===== 2025 Q1  (2025-04-30 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning all and thank you for joining us for the First Quarter 2025 PPG Earnings Conference Call. My name is Carly and I'll be coordinating the call today. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn over to our host Alex Lopez. The floor is yours.
Alex Lopez: Thank you, Carly, and good morning, everyone. This is Alex Lopez. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG and welcome you to our first quarter 2025 earnings conference call. Joining me today from PPG are Tim Knavish, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Vince Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our comments relate to the financial information released after U.S. equity markets closed on Tuesday, April 29, 2025. We have posted detailed commentary and the accompanying presentation slides, which are being shown on this webcast on the Investor Center of our website, ppg.com. Following management's perspective on the company's results, we will move to Q&A session. Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company's current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. The presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG filings with the SEC. Now, let me introduce PPG chairman and CEO, Tim Knavish.
Tim Knavish: Thank you, Alex, and welcome everyone. I'd like to start by providing a few highlights on our first quarter 2025 financial performance, and then I'll move to our outlook. The PPG team delivered sales of $3.7 billion. This is a decrease of 4% compared with the first quarter of 2024, primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency translation and the impact from business divestitures, including the Silicas business. We are beginning to realize the benefits of our enterprise growth strategy as organic sales grew year-over-year with increases in both sales volumes and selling prices. Regionally, we delivered year-over-year organic sales growth in Asia, driven by strong performance in China, India, and Vietnam. In the U.S., after 6 quarters of declines or flat performance, we achieved 4% organic sales growth, led by share gains in several of our businesses and improvement in industrial production. Organic sales in Latin America were up slightly with growth tempered by the recent geopolitical environment. European organic sales were down 1%, which was significant improvement versus prior quarters as demand for our products were stabilizing in the region. Our top line results reinforce our positive organic growth momentum and contributed to improved manufacturing productivity. As we noted in our earnings materials released last night, our first quarter segment EBITDA margin was 19.4%, and adjusted earnings per diluted share was $1.72. Also, we repurchased approximately $400 million of our stock and ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet. Before we go through the quarterly details, let me first talk about how our results and momentum reflect the consistent, disciplined execution of the enterprise growth strategy that we launched in 2023. We are beginning to benefit from the actions we have taken to optimize and focus our portfolio. The development of PPG's organic growth muscle and strategic investments in innovation are driving positive momentum. The company has aggressively -- managing the bottom line, including decisive self-help, combined with our disciplined capital allocation, and strong balance sheet, critical in today's environment, PPG is in a great and differentiated position to prevail in the current economic conditions. Looking at our segment performance. In the global architectural coating segment, first quarter net sales were significantly impacted by unfavorable foreign currency translation, which decreased sales by 7% as both the Mexican peso and Europe weakened year-over-year compared to the U.S. dollar. In architectural coatings EMEA, organic sales were flat versus prior year with improved selling prices offset by slightly lower sales volumes. Sales increased in Central Europe and in the Nordic region, while they declined in Western Europe. Our volumes in Europe were slightly unfavorable, but stabilizing, and we expect flat to higher volumes year-over-year in the second quarter. We are making rapid progress, reducing structural costs in this region and anticipate strong incremental earnings leverage as demand trends improve. In architectural coatings, Latin America and Asia Pacific, sales volumes declined, reflecting a pause in project-related business and governmental spending in Mexico due to recent geopolitical related uncertainty. However, core retail sales were solid. We anticipate economic activity and project spending in Mexico will resume in the upcoming quarters as more certainty regarding regional trade evolves. With its structural advantages, Mexico will remain a strong growth country for PPG. Segment EBITDA margin decreased 310 basis points versus prior year, driven by lower sales volumes and regional inflation stemming from the weaker peso, partially offset by cost control actions. In the performance coating segment, first quarter organic sales increased 9% with both price and sales volume improvements. Within the segment, aerospace delivered double digit percentage organic sales growth with record first quarter sales and earnings. Customer order backlogs were stable at $300 million even with growth-related investments that improved our output in the quarter. The backlog demonstrates excellent industry dynamics and strong demand for our technology advantaged products. In automotive refinish, global organic sales increased a low single digit percentage versus the prior year. In the U.S., sales volumes improved the mid single digit percentage with benefits from customer order patterns and share gains, offsetting lower in industry collision claims. In the first quarter, the company grew the number of linked subscriptions as well as moonwalk installations, which now total more than 2700 in service, further supporting customer productivity and partnerships. Protective and marine coatings delivered double digit percentage organic sales growth supported by increasing global demand for our technologies and our recent share gains in marine. This was the 8th consecutive quarter with positive year-over-year sales volume growth in this business, and we are increasing our growth related investments to support demand. Traffic solutions delivered above market mid single digit percentage sales growth in the quarter. Demand is expected to remain strong for this business throughout the year, including in the second quarter when demand steps up seasonally. Segment EBITDA was up 8% year-over-year, a new first quarter record, reflecting the organic sales growth as our various growth investments in the segment are yielding benefits. In the industrial coating segment, net sales declined compared to the first quarter of 2024, primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation and the divestiture of the silica products business in 2024. These items combined lowered sales by 6%. Organic sales for the segment were down less than 2%, which is a significant improvement versus the fourth quarter of 2024, which was down 6%. In the first quarter, selling prices declined 1% due to carryover of certain index-based customer contracts. Segment sales volumes also decreased 1% as strength in industrial coatings and packaging coatings was offset by soft automotive industry builds. From a business unit perspective, automotive OEM industry production was lower year-over-year in the U.S. and Europe, and our results followed that lower demand trend. We partially mitigated this volume decline with growth in Asia and Latin America, including our share gains in Brazil. During the first quarter, we narrowed the gap in our volume performance versus auto industry builds. We expect to grow above industry levels starting in the third quarter of this year, driven by already won share gains and our market outperformance in Asia. Industrial coatings, organic sales were flat with lower index based pricing offset by improved sales volume after several quarters of weak industrial production. Demand for PPG's industrial products grew in all regions, but varied across subsegments. Packaging coatings organic sales increased by a low single digit percentage year-over-year, driven by share gains on top of strong growth in the prior year. Segment EBITDA margin declined 90 basis points year-over-year as lower sales volumes and price were partially offset by strong cost control and productivity actions. For the industrial segment, we expect organic results in the second quarter to be generally similar with the first quarter, with share gains aiding organic results in the back half of the year. Now, let me talk about our balance sheet in cash. We issued EUR 900 million of debt during the quarter at 3.25%. We have euro debt maturities of 300 million and 600 million due in the second and fourth quarter respectively. During the quarter, we completed approximately 400 million in share repurchases and paid approximately 160 million in dividends. We have repurchased $1.2 billion in our stock over the last 6 quarters and paid 930 million in dividends over that same time period. Our balance sheet remains strong, which continues to provide us with financial flexibility, and we remain committed to driving shareholder value. Looking ahead, obviously the current macroeconomic environment is highly dynamic. Our business model has historically proven to be well positioned to navigate and perform during periods of uncertainty. As it relates specifically to recent tariffs, let me highlight a few relevant business traits that provide structural resilience for PPG. We have a balanced global business portfolio without reliance on any single country, region, or end market. We primarily buy, make, and sell local for local. We are flexible batch process manufacturers, which results in an asset-like footprint that is easily adaptable to volume shifts. We have a highly variable cost structure that allows us to adjust our conversion costs according to demand. Our input cost model is very dependent on commodity materials, including oil that are reliant on supply and demand. Historically, we have been successful in adjusting our selling prices, including through surcharges to account for any changes in our delivered cost of raw materials. Finally, we have a demonstrated track record of consistent cash generation through all stages of the business cycle to complement our strong balance sheet. While these structural advantageous attributes of PPG provide a buffer for macro impacts, we are not immune to lower economic demand and continue to closely monitor customer order patterns and quickly adjust as necessary. Like all companies, we have potential downsides, if overall demand significantly weakens and we are diligently monitoring these conditions. With regard to our supply chain, we are executing our contingency plans and already working with suppliers on alternative sourcing, and you should expect us to aggressively manage our costs and productivity. Now a few more details of what we're seeing. In the first quarter, we already realized a step down in demand in Mexico as project-related spending was paused, yet the overall PPG enterprise still performed. Beyond Mexico, we did not see any other significant changes to demand, and we did not experience any noteworthy customer pull forward into the first quarter. This pattern has continued for the first 4 weeks of the second quarter as we have not seen evidence of any curtailment of customer orders in our businesses. Some customers, however, have publicly expressed the need to eventually assess their production, depending on the duration and eventual framework of trade outcomes. Additionally, we have not yet experienced any significant change to our raw material pricing as our suppliers continue to favor volume over-pricing. We're monitoring this situation and we will react accordingly with pricing actions and or self-help cost actions to mitigate any impacts. When considering our guidance, we see structural strength in our performance coating segment driven by our technology advantage products in aerospace and protective and marine. We expect European architectural coatings volume trends to improve and also anticipate short-term tepid business conditions in Mexico, given the economic uncertainty. Demand for various general industrial markets improved in the first quarter, and we see increasing momentum in the coming quarters. While auto OEM industry demand forecasts were slightly reduced, our share gains are beginning to yield benefits, and we expect to outperform the market beginning in the third quarter. We sized our annual share gains in the industrial segment at $100 million and we are tracking to that annualized figure. Finally, we expect growing benefits from our self-help programs and other discretionary cost management programs, the pace and scope of which we have stepped up over the past few months. In closing, I am confident in our ability to successfully navigate this uncertainty given our improved business portfolio, the diversity of our regions and businesses, our self-help actions, and our share gain momentum. We are reaffirming a full-year earnings per share guidance range of $7.75 to $8.05. Thank you to our PPG team around the world who make it happen and deliver on our purpose every day. We appreciate your continued confidence in PPG. This concludes our prepared marks. And now, would you please open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you very much. We'd like to open the lines for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David, your line is now open.
David Begleiter: Thank you, good morning. Tim, just on global architectural, I know margins are under pressure here. How do you expect margins to trend in Q2? Any relief from the pressure you saw in Q1?
Tim Knavish: Yeah, I don't think, we'll get some margin benefit from sequential volume improvement, David, but otherwise, we've had positive price in that segment and so really it's a volume story for us, with Europe still being down a bit and then the Mexico, the project side of Mexico slowing down, it was really a volume story, so we fully expect that margin to recover.
Vince Morales: And David, just a reminder, typically in Europe there's a seasonal step up in the business, so we'll get some leverage from that.
David Begleiter: Got it. And Tim, just on Comex, how much was the business down in Q1 and what gives you the confidence that the business will come back over the next few quarters?
Tim Knavish: Yeah, look, the confidence comes from a couple of things, first of all leading up to the tariff of April 2nd, prior to that, there was already a pause in project-related spending for business and government investment projects. This pause, it affected our architectural segment and EBIT in Mexico. It's very important to note that our retail sales, our core retail sales in Mexico remained very solid in Q1. Now, why our confidence, we're very well connected in Mexico with our scale and presence. We're very well connected to the project owners. We're connected to the project managers. We're well connected to key advisors that are close to the government and the economists in the country. And they all believe that things will continue to be a bit soft in Q2, but as we move through the year, the project spending will increase. Many of these projects are already in flight. We have not seen any cancellation of projects. We continue to see new projects coming on in our pipeline. So, certainly if trade discussions and with any reasonable framework for Mexico that would allow all this spending to resume fully. But even without that, we do expect the project spending to increase again and particularly in the second half, and we're still confident that given a multitude of factors, favorable business climate, favorable unemployment, favorable inflation, good workforce, good population demographics, proximity. We still believe Mexico remains a strong growth country for some time for PPG.
Operator: Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Duffy Fisher of Goldman Sachs. Duffy, your line is now open.
Duffy Fisher: Yeah, good morning, guys. Just a question on refinish. If you look at the last 4 years, you were kind of down mid single digits, up mid single digits, down low single digits, up low single digits. So that business seems to have gotten much more volatile than what it had been historically. So just, you know, and you kind of see it in the insurance claims data as well. What's really happening in that industry is there are structural changes going on there and does that in any way impair your ability to get kind of that consistent pricing year-on-year in that business?
Tim Knavish: Hey Duffy, thanks for the question. I'll answer the last part first. Let's call it the lumpiness that we see with our sell out has nothing to do with our ability to get pricing in that business, and we've demonstrated that year over year over year over year despite this lumpiness. And the reason for that is the strength of our total value proposition around customer body shop productivity, where the actual cost of the paint is only a fraction of the cost of the total process, and our productivity solutions help that total process. So one, it does not at all impact our ability to get price. Second to the lumpiness, this business has always had a bit of lumpiness because of the 2-step distribution model. And the distributors are all independent private business people that are managing their own cash flows, trying to time things based on when they think pricing and demand may go in certain directions. So, this business is always a bit lumpy quarter over quarter, and you really have to look at this at a yearly and multi-year basis sometimes. Now to the longer term picture in refinish, and I think you're referring to some of the lower collision claims. Let me comment on that. This is a critical coatings vertical, because of the reasons that I mentioned earlier, where our contributions both inside the chemistry and outside the chemistry with our productivity tools are so important to the body shop owners. You've got labor tightness when it comes to skilled painters. So, we play a critical role to the body shop. And that's why you don't hear it just from us. Every coating company in the world wants to be in refinish and grow in refinish. Collision claims have been trending lower for years, and we've continued to grow and perform during that time period, and that's because of our world class, best in class total productivity value proposition. We have the best chemistry in the can, but you also -- we actually capture more value and additional value with what we do outside the can with, you've heard about some of our digital productivity tools. We do a lot with related projects -- allied products, which are associated with the painting process, but not actually inside the can of paint itself. We've done -- we've grown there organically and inorganically and the kegger over a multi-year period for those allied products has consistently been double digit, despite these year over year decreasing collisions. The reality is the players that deliver the best overall productivity solution will continue to win, will continue to be able to capture price as long as they continue to increase the productivity solution that they deliver. It's probably the weaker players that don't have those solutions that are that are going to lose share and pay the price.
Operator: Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy of VRP. Kevin, your line is now open.
Kevin McCarthy: Yes, thank you and good morning. I was wondering if you could unpack the sales guidance that you've provided on Slide 11 for global architectural coatings in particular. You were down 11% in the first quarter. I appreciate a lot of that was currency, which is swinging, but maybe you could kind of talk through your year-over-year volume expectations in that business, for example, would you expect the negative 3 that you saw in the first quarter to penetrate positive territory and any other color on that outlook would be much appreciated.
Tim Knavish: Yeah, thanks for the question, Kevin. I'm not going to comment on currency. I wish I were that smart, as to predict what that's going to do. But, I will talk about price and volume. We will price as we need to price. We got some positive price in Q1, and we'll continue to monitor all the stuff that's happening outside of our business in the macros. So, you should expect that to be again incrementally positive like it was in Q1. On the volume side, we do think this project pause in Mexico will largely continue into Q2, may get sequentially better, but we're not counting on that in our guide. We do expect, we've seen some momentum in Europe finally, and we do expect that to improve; it's been down for a long, long time, it could be flat, it could be incrementally positive and that's really the change in Q2 versus Q1, much more in Europe focused than anywhere else.
Kevin McCarthy: Great, thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Sison of Wells Fargo. Michael, your line is now open.
Michael Sison: Hey, good morning. Great start to the year. [indiscernible] Browns or Steelers draft, but I just want to dig into performance coatings real quick. Volumes pretty impressive there. What do you think your volume should be for this year in total? And then what do you think market demand is? I know it's a little bit different for little business unit, but I suspect the market share gains are really what's driving that growth.
Tim Knavish: Hey, Mike, thanks for the question. The challenge for our performance coatings business is to deliver higher growth than the number of quarterbacks that Cleveland Browns now have in their quarterback room. That'll be a challenge, but we're confident in it, because you look at the performance in Q1, across the businesses, aerospace, double digit, as much as we can make, we'll ship. PMC double digit, great momentum, great pipeline, traffic will sequentially improve, one because the share we won last year, and two, because of seasonality. So I think we see a good -- a good set there of dynamics and demand with each of the businesses in our performance coating segment.
Vince Morales: Yeah Mike, and this is Vince -- a little tag along comment here. We are delivering consistent growth in these businesses. We are starting to comp against some more difficult comps in the back half of the year. On a 2-year stack basis, most of these businesses are up. Aerospace, protective marine up double digits, refinished and traffic up low to mid single digits and organic sales growth, and we expect those traits to continue.
Operator: Great, thank you very much. Our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi of Baird. Ghansham, your line is now open.
Ghansham Panjabi: Thank you, Alberto. Good morning, everybody. Tim, I just want to go back to your comments on Europe as a region, and just for the color as it relates to what do you think is going on there from a macro perspective? Is it just easier comparisons that are kind of flowing through to you specifically, or do you sense an actual inflection in demand that could be a little bit more sustainable than what we've seen over the last few years?
Vince Morales: This is Vince. Let me start and Tim will add some color here. When we look at Europe, we've seen obviously some easier comps, but across the continent we're seeing stabilization in a couple of areas. Industrial production was stabilized relative to recent past. We also saw in Western Europe, better order pattern, especially exiting the quarter -- Western European countries and architectural. We do know there is some sentiment on increased governmental spending there, and I think there is in the Nordics recovery underway from a couple of tough years.
Tim Knavish: Yeah, I would just add to that that a lot of it is based on the momentum we saw growing as we moved through Q1 Ghansham and even automotive, which has been down for quite some time. You've got the easier comps, you've got some of our key customers launching new models as we move through the second half of the year. So, we are not expecting a hockey stick at all, but we've been saying for years in Europe, all we need is stabilization and a little bit of volume, because we've been doing so much structural cost action that we will get really good earnings leverage when that happens.
Operator: Thank you very much. Our next question comes from John McNulty of BMO. John, your line is now open.
John McNulty: Yeah, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, I guess the first one -- the first quarter came in a good bit better than I think was expected. It seems like you've got now an FX tailwind. It also looks like if anything from a volume perspective year-over-year, you're thinking things are maybe better in 2Q than they were in 1Q, and yet you maintained the guide. So, I guess can you help us to think about what is maybe holding you back on that? It sounds like tariffs don't seem to be making too many waves yet for you, but maybe that's just conservativism, but can you just help us to think about that?
Tim Knavish: Hey John, I'm going to give -- I'll give a little tariff overview for PPG, and then Vince can take your more specific questions around FX and volumes. So, overall for PPG, based on what we know today, look, the team, as you would expect, we've been running many scenarios and gain theories on how this is going to play out. We've got external help on -- we're on top of it on a very granular basis. And I put it into 3 buckets of potential PPG impact. First of all, our products, our finished goods, very minimal impact, because we're almost completely local for local. So, our finished goods don't really cross too many borders. Second bucket, the direct cost impact to PPG. We are heavily localized from a raw material standpoint, more than 95% of what we buy is locally sourced or no tariffs. And just a few factoids. If you look at our U.S. businesses, our top 30 suppliers for our U.S. businesses, 0 of them are Chinese. You look at our top 100 suppliers in the U.S. and add up that aggregate spend, 1% is from China. So, we're largely locally sourced and the mitigation actions in the way we've taken advantage of our global footprint has positioned us well. In some of the larger categories, TiO2, epoxy, they were already tariffs coming into this year and mitigation actions were already put in place. The upstream chemical supply market is very long, so not all the announced tariffs will actually directly pass through to us. And if and when there is a direct impact to us, we work with our customers on pricing, surcharges, reformulations, substitutions, things like that. So, the third bucket of potential impact for us is demand. We have built this into our guide. We built in everything we know, and everything we can estimate is already built into our guide. You'll note that Mexico already impacted in Q1 and the enterprise still performed. The biggest potential impact, you think auto, China, Mexico, we included that on the slides. Each of these impacts, based on everything that's out there today, we expect each of them to be less than 1% of total PPG sales. China, example, everything that we paint in China, only 10% of it gets shipped to the U.S. So, the vast majority of what we do is local to local. And as I mentioned, 1 month into quarter 2, our order patterns are consistent with our expectations. Then you get to mitigations. I mentioned a few of them, but a number of our levers. We're doing volume deals with suppliers. We're working with customers on formulation tweaks and adjustments, maximizing our footprint flexibility, and we always have in our toolbox, pricing surcharges if necessary. And look, there's a key mitigator that I think is differentiated for PPG, and I call it the PPG shock absorber, a little bit of a buffer impact, it's structural. Our diverse portfolio, lack of dependency on any individual country, geography or segment, our highly variable cost structure. We're even more asset-light than we've ever been with the divestitures. We divested 2 of our heaviest asset -- fixed asset businesses when we got rid of 11 factories and 750 brick-and-mortar stores. And we've got a natural hedge where demand drops typically, so does the price of our primary input costs. So, we have a shock absorber that does help us with macro events. And then finally, our guide, based on everything we know, we have -- we have identified a clear path, clear path to meet our full year EPS guide. I mean we've got momentum in share. We've got momentum in self-help. We've got momentum in productivity combined with the structural resilience and mitigation efforts that I just meant, we do have line of sight to our guide. So look, we clearly recognize there's uncertainty and a lot of things are moving fast, and we're not immune to that. We'll flex things as they change and charge forward, but we are laser-focused on controlling what we can control.
Vincent Morales: Yes. Just to try to provide some granular thoughts on what I would call where we were in January versus what we see today on a full year basis. A couple of things that are moving against us. Mexico, we were not aware in January, obviously of the project spending pause. Again, we feel that will eventually come back. The automotive industry has stepped down 1% or 2% versus the guide and the forecast in January. Offsetting that, foreign currencies moved in our direction. We had a pretty stiff headwind of foreign currencies coming into the year. We still have a headwind in Q2, and for some currencies, the balance of the year based on current rates. We've upped our self-help expectations for the year, and we're tracking to those higher expectations. We got share gains that are coming in quicker than we had anticipated. And finally, Tim alluded to this on an earlier question, Europe is stabilizing at a faster clip, albeit modest than we anticipated in our original guide. So, some puts and takes like there are in every quarter, but those are the bigger pieces.
Operator: Thank you very much. Our next question comes from John Roberts of Mizuho. John your line is now open.
John Roberts: Thanks and congrats on a return to growth here. Tim, there were a lot of not yets in your opening comments. Assuming the tariffs stay as is, how long before you see customers repositioning production? And do you think you'll have to idle any of your auto OEM paint lines?
Tim Knavish: Hey John, thanks. Second part first. I don't think we'll have to idle any lines. We may decrease staffing, decrease output as necessary, we'll flex, but we don't have to idle any factories. And I can't really say what, when any customer would decide to significantly change their production plans. We are positioned virtually everywhere in the world. So, wherever they decide to go, we can make coatings for them. So, we feel that we have a lot of flexibility. If there's something dramatic and severe, well we'll talk about that. But we have the ability to follow our customers wherever they go.
Vince Morales: Yes, John, Vince here. Just 2 things I'd reiterate what Tim said. We are a batch process. So, small or large changes in customer order patterns, we're able to easily see and adapt our staffing levels to. Just also what we said in our opening remarks, we have not seen any significant change in our customer order patterns through April. And we have order patterns looking into May depending on our short cycle or long cycle businesses and in our short-cycle businesses, looking at the first couple of weeks in May, again, no discernible change right now.
Tim Knavish: Yes. One last part on the idling of assets that you questioned. We don't need to do that in response to what our customers may do. But I want to remind everyone that we have a significant rightsizing as part of our self-help already underway where we'll be closing a number of facilities over the next 3 years. And so that's separate from what's happening, but that will give us even more leverage going forward than what we have today.
Operator: Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Laurent Favre of BNP Paribas. Laurent, your line is now open.
Laurent Favre: Yes, good morning all. A question on capital allocation, if I may. So, you didn't get the BSS [indiscernible] assets. And with all the uncertainty, I assume that deal activity is going to come to a pause anyway. So, I was wondering if you could talk about the intensity on -- and the intent, I guess, intention and intensity on share buybacks after the 400 million in Q1.
Tim Knavish: Yes. Laurent, let me answer M&A first, and then I'll get to repo. So, we've been very consistent on this since 2023 that we're changing from the tip of the spear for growth, being M&A, and secondary organic, to tip of the spear for us being organic and secondary M&A. So, it's still part of our long-term growth strategy, but it's not what we're leading with. We will look at any asset that comes available or any asset that we think would fit with our enterprise growth strategy. But I continue to say it's got to be the right asset fitting with our enterprise growth strategy. It's got to be the right price. We're not going to overpay. And it's got to be the right time relative to what else we have growing on with focus and balance on organic growth. And you mentioned Brazil. I said many times that, that was a good asset that we would look at and we were interested in, but that didn't fit my right price category. The price wasn't where we would have paid relative to other options for use of that cash, which then brings us to the repo question. I hope -- again, I've been consistent with saying exactly the same thing since I took over. Relative to capital deployment, that the first thing we did, we paid down debt back in 2023. Beyond that, I said it wouldn't let it grow on the balance sheet. And after not buying shares for many quarters, we've now gone 6 straight quarters of buying shares. It's been the best use of our cash to deliver shareholder value. And I would just -- you should expect to see that continued prioritization for me. And the reason I can't and won't commit to a specific number is more than ever right now, it is a highly variable environment. And so we'll make that decision as we move through the months and quarters. But I would just say, you should expect to see the same decision-making process that has been made for the last 7 quarters -- or 6 quarters.
Operator: Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Vincent, your line is now open.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you, good morning. Just a few cleanup questions for me on the guidance. You didn't put out the full year details the way you did last quarter. So just some of it, Vince, you covered already, but do you still expect segment margins to be up 50 basis points for the full year? And then if I could also ask, my recollection is that usually the EPS guidance does not include the benefit from share repurchases. Is there any change in that for this year or for the reiteration of the guide?
Vince Morales: Vincent, you're spot-on, on both. No change to our margin profile and guide, again moving around within the segments, but in totality, we're still holding to that, and we typically do not include cash deployment in our EPS guide.
Operator: Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov of KeyCorp. Aleksey, your line in now open.
Aleksey Yefremov: Thanks, good morning everyone. In Performance Coatings, your price was up 3%, volumes up [6%] [ph]. So, I would have expected margins to be up a bit more than 20 basis points. Could you just describe what's going on with the margin there?
Tim Knavish: Yes. Aleksey, this clearly remains our highest margin and best growth segment, if you look at this quarter or the last several quarters. Given the increase in growth prospects, we've increased our growth-related investments, our growth-related spending in several of these businesses to capitalize on the opportunities, capture more share for the longer term. We've had a backlog in Aerospace. As you know, we've been spending some money there to gain incremental output, which delivers incremental sales not only for current quarter, but for future with debottlenecking. And by the way, we're also looking at longer-term, more significant capital investments to support that growth. We're applying incremental growth spending to Protective and Marine, where we've delivered 8 straight quarters of growth -- volume growth, and we expect that to continue. And so we've had to make some investments there to keep that kind of strong growth rate, strong rate going. And finally, we continue to invest in the next gen of those productivity tools that I mentioned in Refinish. Those allied products, those digital tools have been tremendous drivers of growth for us in Auto Refinish in a flat to down market. So, that's really the reason why you're not seeing, let's say, the typical leverage in this quarter that you would see for Performance Coatings.
Operator: Thank you very much. Our next question is from Patrick Cunningham of Citigroup. Patrick, your line is now open.
Patrick Cunningham: Hi, good morning. Just on the Industrial Coatings subsegment within Industrial, you had positive volumes in the quarter. How meaningful were share gains here? And was there any evidence of some prebuying impact that may mute sales into 2Q? I guess how should we think about volume sensitivity going forward for the remainder of the year?
Tim Knavish: Yes, Pat, thanks for asking that great question, because we're excited about this. We have momentum in Industrial Coatings. You should think about it as positive going forward. And it's 2 things. A lot of it is share gain delivered. As we started to execute on our enterprise growth strategy and build that organic growth muscle throughout 2024 and into early 2025, we've been winning business and we're starting to launch that business. And you do see, of course, the country dependent, you see a little bit of improvement in industrial production in some countries and because of our portfolio, we're well positioned to capture that. We've seen some positives. China, India, both grew for us in the quarter. We've seen it in general finishes. We saw Industrial Coatings United States grow in the quarter. So, the word I would use here, and we use it every day when I spoke with my leader of this business, its momentum. We've got momentum in this business.
Operator: Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch of Fermium Research, LLC. Frank, your line is now open.
Frank Mitsch: Thank you. I want to follow up on the 2025 guide. You answered the questions obviously on the margin expectations and also gave us some puts and takes. I'm just curious on the organic growth expectations. Obviously, Performance Coating is very strong in the first quarter, exceeding the 1Q guide. Your expectation for the full year was up low single digits to up mid-single digits. I suspect we should probably start thinking about Performance Coatings organically up in 2025, moving that up to high single digits, low double digits. So, curious to comment on that. And while I've got you, I might as well ask about the other 2 segments, which in 2025, Global Architectural was expected up low single digits to up mid-single digits. So is that still hold? And the same with Industrial Coatings, where we have momentum, is that still expected to get up low single digits?
Tim Knavish: Yes. Let me -- you gave us a lot of parts to that question. So, it is going to take a team effort to answer that, Frank. But you should expect, as a total company -- as a total company, low single-digit growth for us for the year, okay? And again, that's based on what we know today, but we've built in not only known, but estimated impacts from our team. And it's all about the momentum and share. We said last quarter that we won a bunch of share in Industrial Coatings segment that will launch in the second half of this year. We still see that on time. Some of them actually even pulled forward. And we've continued to win share. There are smaller pieces across the other businesses, just the nature of the customer, but we continue to win share across a number of them. Performance Coatings, you should expect mid-single digits for the year due to that growth momentum in that space. And Vince, you can.
Vince Morales: Yes. Just a reminder, what we said earlier, Frank, on Performance Coating is certainly performing well. Comps get harder as we go through the year. If we look at our Industrial segment, and we talked about this on the January call. Comps. We started to see industrial activity in the back half of 2024, weakened. So comps in that segment get easier. And we talked earlier in the call about what's happening in the architectural business, both in Q1 and on a forward look, especially in Mexico.
Operator: Great, thank you very much. Our next question comes from Chris Parkinson of Wolfe Research. Chris, your line is now open.
Chris Parkinson: Great, thank you so much. Can you talk a little bit more about the aerospace opportunity and just go through aftermarket OE and military. On one hand, you've got there a few airlines pulling guidance. On the other hand, you have a pretty strong backlog. So just how should we be thinking about that? And is there any potential to further debottleneck and add capacity to facilitate the intermediate to long-term growth algo?
Tim Knavish: Hi, Chris. So, military, commercial, general aviation aftermarket, strong, strong, strong, strong. And even with the like noise that you hear today, the backlogs are -- the backlogs are years in these segments, not months, not quarters, years. And part of that is what happened during COVID. Not a lot of planes were produced during COVID. Everybody depleted their inventories. So, we're trying to keep up not only with production, but we're also -- the whole industry is trying to gradually rebuild aftermarket and OE pipelines. So, we see no slowdown here for -- on the horizon. Despite the little -- you'll have news pieces here about what this airline is doing, what this country is doing. But you saw what Boeing said in their comments that they -- no matter what happens with China, that their backlog remains multiple years. So, we're fully confident that this is going to be a strong business for us for the foreseeable future. There is still -- we have many active debottlenecking projects going on right now across a number of our facilities for Aerospace. And I would just say, stay tuned for kind of larger capital investments that are under engineering analysis now that would position this business for even better growth in rewards for our shareholders long term.
Vince Morales: And Chris, this is Vince. Just if you look at our manufacturing, we have the flexibility to move between OEM, aftermarket and military. So, if we do see some pause in any activity, we can work at that backlog, which is primarily aftermarket for us is a net positive. And one thing Tim didn't mention as we look at the business today versus pre-pandemic, military has also picked up, unfortunately. But that's unfortunately for the geopolitical reasons. But that's another leg of growth that we didn't see pre-pandemic.
Chris Parkinson: Very helpful, thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Michael Leithead of Barclays. Michael, your line is now open.
Michael Leithead: Great, thank you, good morning guys. I just had 2 quick follow-ups. First, on the Comex performance. How does the Comex business split between residential and commercial? You mentioned that retail is quite strong, so it seems commercial at a much more meaningful drop-off. And then second, apologies if I missed this in the answer to an earlier question. But what is your updated full year currency EPS headwind you're assuming in your guidance?
Timothy Knavish: Yes. I'll take the first one and let Vince take the currency, Michael. It's mostly -- the core business in PPG Comex is mostly residential. We don't give out the specific percentages, because that does fluctuate depending on project activity, but it's mostly residential. That's the history and legacy of Comex. In recent years, we've been expanding significantly, the outside of store sales, which is the project business.
Vince Morales: So for FX, we have $0.09 impact that I think we laid out in the materials. That will diminish as we go through the year as we started to see the currencies weakened especially in the fourth quarter. So, $0.09 impact in Q1, that will step down in the subsequent quarters.
Operator: Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Laurence, your line in now open.
Laurence Alexander: Good morning. Just wanted to unpack the comments around Industrial. I think in the prepared remarks, you indicated your thought momentum would be accelerating in the -- over the next several quarters. And it sounds as if you were referring to the underlying end markets rather than just share gain. Can you just clarify whether that's sequential or year-over-year, because of the easy comp effect? And in particular, kind of what you're seeing in the wood and heavy-duty market.
Tim Knavish: Sure. It's actually both, Laurence, that's driving the momentum going forward. We do see some slight upticks in industrial production in the segments that we are strongest. And we also have booked a number of share gains around the world that it's a bit -- these things on industrial, you have to work with customer lines, so it's not an immediate benefit. So that will be spread out throughout the year. So, it's really a combination of both of those. We're not a big player in wood. It's not a segment that we track very close. And heavy-duty remains down for us. But other segments, general finishes, coil has continued to do well for us. And I mentioned earlier, broadly across our book of businesses in China, which is China for China and broadly across India as well that we've seen good growth across multiple, multiple segments.
Operator: Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Josh Spector of UBS. Josh, your line is now open.
Josh Spector: Yeah, good morning. This may be a bit redundant, but I'll try this around the EPS guide for the year. So, if I look at what you guys are guiding to roughly for 2Q, maybe $2.20, $2.30 in EPS roughly, normal seasonality in second half kind of plus what you did in first half, probably gets to you around the $7.65 range. If I add back some of the Mexico project coming back, maybe that's $0.05 a quarter or so about $0.10. So you get to kind of the low end of the guide with just those assumptions. So, I guess the easiest way to ask this is second half versus first half, what needs to sequentially improve to get that extra $0.15, $0.20 to your midpoint? Is it markets and we talked about Europe improving? Or is it something else within your control cost savings, new wins? Just wondering if you can bridge that out for us a little bit.
Vince Morales: Yes, Josh, this is Vince. First of all, a good reminder to everybody. We did recast our financials in January for the prior years based on the sale of our U.S. Architectural Canada business and the seasonality of our recast business changed dramatically, because the U.S. Architectural business had peak seasonality in Q2, Q3, and weaker, obviously, bracket quarters. Just a reminder, our EPS last year adjusted on a recast basis we were $1.87 in Q1. We were $2.35 in Q2, $2.03 in Q3 and $1.61 in Q4. So, total, $7.87. We did see in the back half of last year, as we alluded to earlier, weaker industrial activity. So, if industrial activity would remain constant, the seasonality of last year would have been different. As we look at our seasonality this year, again, we're comping against those weaker numbers plus we have share gains in industrial. So, we're not wearing a lot of pieces you asked, Josh, trying to go through blow-by-blow those pieces. But things helping us going into the back half of the year, second quarter, back half of the year, additional self-help, as I said earlier, some improvement in Europe, some share gain and easier comps in industrial. So, those affect the year-over-year seasonality comparisons that you're doing. So, those would be the things I pull forward.
Operator: Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Jeff, your line is now open.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. In your Protective and Marine business, roughly how much is Protective and how much is Marine? And do any of the issues having to do with China shipbuilding affect that business for you? Is it something that accelerates your growth or detracts from your growth? And can you talk about your China exposure in that business?
Tim Knavish: Sure, Jeff. So your first question, a strong majority of that business is Protective, and that's true around the world. China shipbuilding, obviously, we do participate there. That's actually been quite strong for us this year. But in Marine, our biggest strength has actually been aftermarket -- aftermarket dry docks. And so we feel good about a healthy mix from a country standpoint, a healthy mix from a segment standpoint. But to your particular question on China, shipbuilding, China Marine, it's been part of our growth story over the last several quarters.
Vince Morales: Yes. And Jeff, I think you're alluding to the fact that some of the Chinese activity is in question, at least that's what the periodical say. In terms of shipbuilding, we also participate in Korea, which is where you may see if the shipbuilding that moves to different country, we have beachheads and have participated in the Korea market for quite some time. So again, Tim's earlier comments about our business being a shop absorber local for local, we're in different regions. If our customers move production, we're there to handle the production wherever they're moving to.
Operator: Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan. Arun, your line is now open.
Arun Viswanathan: Thanks for taking my question. I just had a quick question on Auto OEM and Auto Refinish. So in Auto OEM, I understand that there's some choppy demand trends right now. But would you say that your customer mix or maybe your mix towards EVs or ICEs would be in any way a mitigating factor? And then similarly, in Refinish, it sounds like you were able to turn the corner on a little bit better quarter there, but despite lower claims activity. So, is that also maybe your customer mix more towards MSOs? Or maybe just comment on customer mix in those 2 auto businesses.
Tim Knavish: Hey, Arun. So, let me take Auto OEM first. Customer mix has been a challenge for us in a couple of regions. I talked about that in previous quarters. And the team is doing a lot of work to rebalance that mix. And we will see a lot of that 100 million in share gain is Auto OEM, both with -- on the body side, but also the parts side. So, we'll see that both the customer mix and the overall performance of that business continue, especially starting in Q3 when we expect to be outperforming the industry. EV wise, the only thing I'd say there is the EV outside of China is not a huge part of our business today. EV inside of China, we are number 1 with the largest player, and that player is doing quite well, and they are obviously not shipping to the U.S. It's largely local for local, and that business is doing well for us. On the Refinish side, it's not so much a customer mix issue. The strength in Q1 was really driven by 2 things. Lot of share wins in the last several quarters in that business. And in the U.S., we did have some favorable customer order patterns.
Operator: Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Mike Harrison of Seaport Research Partners. Mike, your line is now open.
Mike Harrison: Hi, good morning. A couple of questions on the Performance Coatings business. First of all, that pricing number of 3%, was that a pretty similar number across all the subsegments? Or were there pockets where pricing was stronger? And then within -- specifically on Traffic Solutions, I'm just curious, does the strength that you see in Q1 suggest a stronger busy season or high season for that business? What are some of the leading indicators that you have available in that business? And what are those indicators saying right now about traffic demand into the high season?
Vince Morales: Mike, this is Vince. I'll take the pricing question and let Tim answer the traffic question. And if you look at our 4 businesses in there, some are long-cycle businesses, some are project-oriented businesses and some are shorter cycle. Certainly, we're still seeing some benefits in pricing from our long-cycle businesses that typically would take 6 months, 9 months. So, we're seeing some carryover benefits from that. We are also interjecting additional pricing in a couple of these businesses in Q2. So, you should see a solid pricing number moving forward. In our short-cycle businesses, we're reacting to market trends on price.
Tim Knavish: Yes. And on traffic specifically, I'd say there's 3 factors here that are driving the strong performance in Q1 and we expect to see in Q2 as well and going forward. Number one, we've got momentum in the businesses -- that business from share gains that we won in the latter part of 2024. So, number one is share. Number two is, believe it or not, weather. This is the most weather sensitive business that we have. And last year was a very wet year in many parts of the United States, where -- particularly where we have the strongest positions. And so there's a lot of miles of road that need painted that are pent up from last year. And so as the weather improves here as we move through the end of Q1 and into Q2, the stripers are out there trying to catch up on pent-up demand as well as this year's demand. And the third would be just overall infrastructure spending has been a growing tailwind for that business, and some of that is finally starting to come to fruition. So, we're expecting, because of those 3 factors and -- another strong performance in Q2 and beyond.
Operator: Great, thank you very much. We currently have no further questions. So, I'd like to hand back to Alex Lopez for any further remarks.
Alex Lopez: Thank you, Carly. We appreciate your interest and confidence in PPG. This concludes our first quarter earnings call.
Operator: This does conclude today's call. We'd like to thank everyone for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-01-31 02:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is Breca, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fourth Quarter PPG Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] To allow everyone an opportunity to ask a question, the company requests that each analyst ask only one question. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Alex Lopez, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Alex Lopez: Thank you, Breca, and good morning, everyone. This is Alex Lopez, Director, Investor Relations. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG and welcome you to our fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings conference call. Joining me today from PPG are Tim Knavish, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vince Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our comments relate to the financial information released after U.S. equity markets closed on Thursday, January 30, 2025. We have posted detailed commentary and the accompanying presentation slides, which are being shown on this webcast on the Investor Center of our website, ppg.com. Following management’s perspective on the company's results, we will move to a Q&A session. Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements, reflecting the company's current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. The presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC. Now, let me introduce PPG Chairman and CEO, Tim Knavish.
Tim Knavish: Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full-year 2024 earnings call. Before I start, I'd like to offer prayers and condolences to those who lost their lives in yesterday's terrible air collision in Washington, D.C. Our prayers are with their family, friends, loved ones, terrible tragedy, and I hope and pray that none of you had any loved ones affected. Now I'll begin by providing a few highlights of our full-year 2024 and fourth quarter financial performance, and then I'll move to our outlook. And on behalf of PPG, I'd also like to apologize for the volume of changes, recasting of financials, the new segmentation, and the guide structure, but this is a positive and critical inflection point for our company. We wanted to structure the reporting on a go-forward basis to reflect this. As a result of the Architectural Coatings U.S. and Canada divestiture, all financial information provided in the earnings material has been recast to reflect this business as a discontinued operation consistent with U.S. GAAP requirements. In 2024, the team demonstrated resilience in a challenging macro by driving growth in adjusted EPS from continuing operations and aggregate segment EBITDA led by sales of our technology-advantaged products, structural cost actions, and moderated input costs. We delivered record results in several of our businesses, including aerospace coatings, automotive refinish coatings, and architectural coatings Latin America. Despite strong share gains in certain businesses, organic sales declined in low-single-digit percentage year-over-year, driven by overall weak macros. However, we delivered growth in Mexico and China, as well as growth in aerospace, protective and marine, packaging, traffic solutions businesses, offset by industry declines in auto OEM, industrial and our architectural EMEA coatings business. For the full-year, adjusted EPS was $7.87, which grew 6% year-over-year and excludes $0.27 of EPS that has been reclassified to discontinued operations. Reflected results of the divestiture of the U.S. and Canada Architectural business with the exception of certain allocated costs. Strategically, during the fourth quarter, we further optimized our portfolio as we completed the divestitures of our silica products and Architectural Coatings U.S. and Canada businesses. This is a significant step forward for our company as these divestitures improve our financial profile, including higher operating margins, and result in a more focused organization, which positions the company to deliver sustainable organic growth. As we've said, our portfolio moves this past year have strengthened the company's financial profile. When you combine the impact of these transactions with the organic improvement in margins we delivered on our remaining businesses, you will note that we have now achieved top-tier EBITDA margins. This performance reflects the value that our customers assign to our technology-advantaged products and services, our solutions, our well-trusted brands, our strong global positions across the coatings verticals and the cross synergies of our business portfolio. We believe that both this margin profile and our enterprise growth actions are great catalysts for the future value creation of PPG. Given the revised portfolio, we have expanded our segment reporting structure and will now report all of our Architectural Coatings businesses as a separate segment, Global Architectural Coatings. The reporting of the remainder of the businesses within Performance Coatings and the Industrial Coatings segment will remain the same. This expanded segmentation provides investors with enhanced visibility as we drive the company's growth and performance. Our Global Architectural Coatings and Performance Coatings segments both now have full-year EBITDA margins at or above 20%, reflecting the differential technologies and strong brand positions of our various businesses. Our Industrial Coatings segment delivered 16% EBITDA margin, despite operating a weak global industrial macro-environment. Each of our segments has unique characteristics that allow us to deliver exceptional value to our customers. By leveraging the distinct strengths of our businesses, we are positioned to drive innovation, increase demand for our technology-advantaged products, and deliver sustainable and profitable growth, while increasing returns to our shareholders. In our Global Architectural Coatings segment, we have excellent and well-recognized brands with world-class distribution and a strong number one or number two position in more than 15 countries. Our Performance Coatings segment is focused on various aftermarkets that traditionally are more stable and have a more fragmented customer base. Within this segment, we offer differentiated and highly specified product and digital solutions that enable our customers' productivity. Our Industrial Coatings segment delivers highly technical products and services for our global B2B customers. We operate field service teams in our customers' facilities, which allows us to develop strong relationships and deep understanding of their productivity needs. Also, we typically grow with our customers as they expand around the world. In the fourth quarter, despite the choppy environment, our adjusted EPS grew by 6% year-over-year, excluding the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation. We delivered strong organic sales growth in aerospace coatings, protective and marine coatings, and traffic solutions. This was our ninth consecutive quarter of aggregate segment margin improvement and we have delivered cumulative margin improvement of approximately 400 basis points since 2022. In the Global Architectural Coatings segment, fourth quarter net sales were significantly impacted by unfavorable foreign currency translation, primarily the Mexican peso. Sales volumes declined due to weak consumer confidence in the European architectural coatings market. However, we benefited from our strong concessionary network in Mexico where demand is robust for our products and services. For the full-year, segment EBITDA margin improved by 70 basis points as lower volumes were offset by our cost control actions and net price impact during the year. In the Performance Coatings segment, fourth quarter organic sales grew 4% with both price and sales volume improvements. Within the segment, Aerospace Coatings demonstrated continued strong performance with record fourth quarter sales and double-digit percentage organic sales growth. Despite improved production capacity and other productivity gains, the order backlog increased to approximately $300 million, demonstrating the strong demand for our technology advantaged products, as well as excellent industry dynamics. In Auto Refinish, sales volumes declined in the U.S. with benefits from share gains more than offset by lower industry collision claims. These share gains are a product of the demand for our technology advantaged products and services. In 2024, the company grew the number of linked services subscriptions and added more than 600 additional Moonwalk installations that now total more than 2,500 around the world, adding to our subscription revenue. Protective and marine coatings demonstrated strong growth in the fourth quarter, supported by increasing global demand of our technologies and our recent share gains. This was the seventh consecutive quarter with positive year-over-year sales volume growth and we expect the positive momentum to continue. Segment EBITDA margin improved in both the fourth quarter and full year due to positive volume and strong net price impact. In the Industrial Coatings segment, demand was constrained by soft global industrial production and weak automotive OEM industry production. As expected and forecasted by industry consultants, auto OEM industry production was lower year-over-year in the U.S. and Europe. Our results followed that lower demand trend and we were able to partially offset the decline in sales volumes with share gains in Latin America and China. Industrial production was also sluggish in Europe and the U.S., which resulted in lower year-over-year sales volume in the industrial coatings business. Sales volume declines in those regions were partially offset by strong growth in Latin America. Prices in the Industrial Coatings segments declined due to lower index-based selling prices as raw material costs declined in the latter part of 2024. This impact is expected to moderate in 2025 as most have reached their anniversaries and will be reset based on recent stability in raw material pricing. Segment EBITDA margin reduced 160 basis points for the quarter and was slightly lower on a full-year basis as the lower volumes were partially offset by strong cost control actions. We ended the fourth quarter with cash of about $1.4 billion. During the quarter, we completed $250 million in share repurchases and paid approximately $160 million in dividends. On a year-to-date basis, we repurchased approximately $750 million of stock, which represented approximately 3% of our outstanding shares. We honored our pledge to return cash to shareholders and combined with our dividend, we returned $1.4 billion to our shareholders in 2024. Our balance sheet remains strong, which continues to provide us with financial flexibility and we remain committed to driving shareholder value creation. Thus, we're deploying about $400 million towards share repurchases during the first quarter 2025. Looking ahead, we anticipate a slow start to 2025 as demand in Europe and in global industrial end-use markets remains challenged. However, we expect stabilization on a full-year basis of some key economic indicators like Light Vehicle Builds and global industrial production, as well as additional aircraft deliveries. In the first quarter of 2025, we'll begin to see the impacts of already enacted tariffs which is expected to result in low-single-digit percentage inflation and raw material costs, while raw material inflation was flat in the fourth quarter of 2024. Despite a challenging macroeconomic landscape and a slow macro start for 2025, I'm genuinely optimistic about this year. We expect to deliver organic sales growth of low-single-digit percentage for the year with the first quarter organic growth flat to slightly down. Stronger results in the second-half of the year supported by the realization of more than $100 million in annual share gains in our Industrial Coatings segment. As we enter the next chapter for PPG with a new sharper portfolio and focus, we're progressing further on the execution of our Enterprise Growth Strategy with several elements that include: building upon our organic growth capabilities on commercial excellence with the right processes, people, tools and incentives; taking decisive self-help actions to further reduce costs, including global structural costs and European manufacturing consolidations. This -- program, excuse me, will deliver approximately $175 million once fully implemented, including savings of $60 million in 2025. Execution of our operational excellence programs will also deliver manufacturing productivity that will more than offset general inflation. We'll deploy cash in a disciplined manner, investing for growth, selective M&A if appropriate, and returning cash to shareholders. As a result of these actions, we expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share for the full-year in 2025 in the range of $7.75 to $8.05, which at midpoint represents an EPS growth of 7%, excluding the impact of foreign currency and higher tax. Consistent with our sales growth, EPS growth will be weighted towards the second-half of 2025 as global industrial demand weakened and the U.S. dollar strengthened in the second-half of 2024. I'm excited about 2025 and beyond. We have a sharper, more focused future-facing portfolio and a higher growth and margin profile company. For our customers, we're both delivering solutions that ensure their success today and innovating tomorrow to improve both their productivity and their success. We remain committed to our heritage of strong cost management and improved productivity that reinforces the ability to maintain our momentum in driving higher margins and earnings growth. The result will be profitable organic growth for PPG and shareholder returns for our owners. The successful divestitures and solid performance in 2024 would not have been possible without the dedication of our employees. We are now a much more focused organization dedicated to driving ongoing growth with strong margins. Thank you to our PPG teams around the world who make it happen and deliver on our purpose every day. Thank you for your continued confidence in PPG. And this concludes our prepared remarks. And would you now please open the line for questions? Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question we have from the phone lines comes from John Roberts with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
John Roberts: Thank you. Could you talk about the $100 million new win for industrial? Is that related to a major competitor pulling back or is something else driving that?
Tim Knavish: Hey, good morning, John. Thanks for the question. That -- certainly the South American exit of one of our competitors is a part of that. I'd say slightly less than half of that. We've got a number of other significant wins in auto OEM, as well as our industrial coatings and our packaging coatings businesses. And as you know, in the Industrial segment, the time lag between win and conversion is longer than our other segments, because these are B2B factories that need change over time, et cetera. But the wins are kind of spread across those three major businesses, but a big piece of it is the exit in South America market.
John Roberts: Thank you.
Operator: We now have Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please go ahead when you're ready.
Ghansham Panjabi: Thank you, operator. Hey, Tim. Just given your comments on the slight increase in raw material prices for 2025, due to tariffs and whatever else, can you just give us more specifics on how are you adjusting pricing across the portfolio to reduce the risk of any sort of price-cost mismatch as 2025 unfolds in context of all this uncertainty on tariffs?
Tim Knavish: Sure, Ghansham. So what's in our guide for raw materials, which is basically up low-single digits inflation throughout the year is almost entirely based on the tariffs that have already been enacted in our basket, which is pretty much TiO2 and epoxies So we've got that, as well as our mitigation efforts of those already baked into our guide. So what you'll see from a pricing standpoint is, I think Q1 will be flattish to slightly positive as some of our businesses are on traditional calendars as to when they raise prices and that's scattered throughout the first few months of the year. In raw material -- I'm sorry, raw material pricing, index pricing on the industrial segment, we'll still have a little bit of carryover for the first quarter. But then for the full-year, we're expecting positive pricing, low-single-digit positive pricing for the company across the board. Now, we'll remain flexible and agile and do what we need to do if there's other tariffs or things we need to do from a competition standpoint to remain competitive in the market, but that's what's baked into our guide.
Vince Morales: And Ghansham, this is Vince. If you pull back to 50,000 feet and look at the supply chain, it's still a loose supply chain, still a buyer's market for coatings commodities beyond the tariffs.
Ghansham Panjabi: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We now have David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
David Huang: Hi, it's David Huang here for Dave. I guess you're expecting full-year segment margins to be up 50 bps and down 150 bps in Q1. How do you expect margins to trend, I guess from Q2 to Q4?
Vince Morales: Yes, Dave. This is Vince, I'll start and I'll let Tim add some color. As we noted on our -- in our materials in Q1 and Tim just now -- also noted we have some raw material inflation around those enacted tariffs in Q1, pricing is coming in throughout the quarter. We also have -- expect a flat to low-single-digit decline in volumes. And as you progress through the year, our volume performance gets better. So that's a differential between Q1 and full-year in terms of the margin progression.
Tim Knavish: Yes, I would just add a little bit of color, particularly on the Industrial Coating segment. That's our most volume-sensitive segment at this point from a margin standpoint, because of the leverage that you get with a little uptick in margins. So as we have a very soft Q1, you'll see that look pretty much like Q4 with the volume kicking in the industrial segment more in the second half of the year.
Operator: Thank you. We have Chris Parkinson with Wolfe Research on the line now.
Chris Parkinson: Great. Thank you so much. Tim, I'm guessing getting on slide five, no one was more excited to get that one out than you because it just represents obviously everything you've been working for? When we take a step back and look at the three new segments. Can you just give kind of the one or two points on, I understand the first-half macro is what it is. Like, can you just talk about how you and your teams are now thinking about the respective growth rates of those end markets in terms of share gain, market outperformance, just anything that would potentially filter into the bias like perceptions of PPGs ability to grow in the new framework would be particularly helpful. Thank you.
Tim Knavish: Yes. Sure Chris. So Global architectural coatings, now that we have our business refined to where we've got positions where we've got a really good strong right to win in those countries. You could use housing, construction, GDP as kind of proxies for the base growth rate of the end markets, but then because of the strength of our position, you can add incremental share gain on top of that. If you look at performance coatings, that's now largely an aftermarket business. And the demand there is a lot more steady on average. And as you know, from things like our refinish business and the new differentiated technology that we've launched for Marine aftermarket, for example, we feel that we've got a pretty strong advantage in the performance coding standpoint to pick up additional share. And with industrial coatings, that's much more tied to industrial production. So automotive, that's the easiest, well, just follow the fields. Beyond that, we'll follow industrial production as the baseline market, and then share gains from our technologies on top of that. So that's how we think about those three different segments.
Vince Morales: Yes, yes, Chris, if I could just add a couple of bits of color here. As Tim mentioned on the industrial side, given the differential or specified technologies, we picked up share in packaging over the past two years. Certainly in certain industrial end markets, we've grown our position globally, including growing our market share in powder, some of that inorganically. And if you look at the performance coating segment, we've talked a lot about some of our tools in the refinish area, especially the digital tools, and on those digital tools, you know, we're recognizing subscription revenue in addition to the customer intimacy that brings. So those are some of the differential items that will give us, I think, an advantage versus the market rates.
Tim Knavish: Yes, if I could just add one more piece of color, Chris, if you refinish in performance coatings, good example, you know, collision claims in the U.S. were down high-single-digits in 2024, and we far outperformed that and won about 2,500 new shops. So that's how we should think about it. Think about the market drivers plus our differentiated advantage in each of those segments.
Chris Parkinson: Thank you so much.
Operator: We now have a question from Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Duffy Fischer: Ys, good morning, guys. I was hoping you could help me. You know, if you look, the published number for last year was 787. The midpoint of your guide for this year is 790, right? So basically on top of each other for the year. But when you look at the shape of how that 787 came about last year. How does that look this year? So can you help us kind of with the shape the year-over-year either EPS or EBIT, whichever way you want to look at it. You know it sounds like you're going to be beating more in the second-half, probably behind in the first-half, but can you just help us with kind of the year-over-year shape of those two numbers?
Tim Knavish: Well Duffy, considering how little time we gave you to digest all these new numbers, you're pretty darn, pretty darn close. We'll be behind last year in the first-half, particularly in the first quarter, and then we'll be nicely above it in the second-half, that's your last comment. If you look at it operationally, it's 7% operational EPS growth. And then there's a couple of big things on top of that, that bring it down about to the same level with the biggest one being about $0.33 of EPS of FX. And then my CFO will give you all the details below it. But high level, weaker in the first-half, especially first quarter, strong second-half, Y-o-Y, net-net, 7% operational EPS gain for the full-year.
Vince Morales: Yes, and, Duffy, we provided, as Tim mentioned, a flurry of information last night. One of the pieces we want to add to that is our quarterly EPS for the last two years on a recast basis. So, Alex, could you give us numbers?
Alex Lopez: Yes, for your reference, Duffy, last year Q1, as you saw in the exhibit, it's $1.87 adjusted EPS; Q2, $2.35; Q3, $2.03; Q4, $1.61 for the full-year of $7.87. In 2023, Q1 adjusted EPS $1.75; Q2 $2.12; Q3 $1.98; Q4 $1.56, with a full-year of $7.42.
Vince Morales: Then if you look at the shape of the year, we talked about this on an earlier question, Duffy. If you look at the shape of the year, again, because of the slightly negative volumes in Q1 and the additional tariffs that were enacted in Q4 that will affect Q1. Q1's light will interject pricing as we go through that first quarter. We'll see the volumes flatten and grow in the back half of the year. We'll also get some more restructuring benefit as we progress through the year. We talked about our self-help actions, and those will drive some cost benefit later in the year.
Duffy Fischer: Great. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Thank you, Duffy. We now have Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Please go ahead.
Tim Knavish: Hey, good morning. Russell or Justin? Will you put your money on Frank and I'll go the opposite.
Tim Knavish: Good call, good call. So the $400 million buyback in in 1Q, I Vince on the last call you have indicated that the sale of North American architectural with all your moves to the cash et cetera would wind up being neutral or creative on the EPS. I’m curious if that's still a case in in terms of the $400 million buyback in 1Q that almost indicates that there's not much you're seeing right now on the M&A side of things, because one would have thought that you might keep your powder dry. Some of the coatings companies have indicated that they are looking at portfolio moves and divestitures and so forth. So any comments in terms of use of cash and when the final -- when all is said and done with respect to the divestiture of North American architectural, you know, a creative neutral dilutive? Thank you.
Vince Morales: Yes, Frank, this is Vince. I'll take the $400 million and the proceeds from the divestiture. We did receive those proceeds late in the fourth quarter in 2024. They're not appearing in our cash flow statement we put out last night, because we didn't put out a discontinued operations cash item, but there will be in the 10-K when we file that. Certainly, we're putting those proceeds to work immediately as we committed to do in Q1, which again reflects that $400 million. And Tim, you want to take the M&A?
Tim Knavish: Sure. So let me just be very clear that, first of all, I think part of your question on the $400 million was it accretive. And the answer is absolutely yes. And -- but on the M&A, let me be very clear, our strategy on M&A has not changed from what I told you all in May of 2023 when I first came into the job that, it's not the tip of the spear for us and we're very focused on building an organic growth machine, but that we would still evaluate any targets because we believe there still is consolidation to happen in this industry. And there are some good assets out there that would add shareholder value. So that has not changed. And if you look, you know, 2023, I told everybody we pay down bad debt. We did that early and then we started buying back shares for the first time in a long time in Q4 of '23. 2024, I said if there was no targeted selective M&A, we buy back shares and we bought back $750 million. As we come into this year, we're starting off Q1 buying shares. We fully expect to have another good cash generation year. So we've got good optionality, especially with where our leverage is right now. There are also a couple of assets coming to market or already on market. One of them, I've already said does not fit our enterprise growth strategy. So not interested. One of them, the Brazilian asset is an attractive asset. It's a good asset, it's a good fit to our strategy of either being a strong number one or strong number two, but we have to decide. We were not the only ones that would draw that conclusion. So we have to decide right price, right time. We want to make sure that whatever we do, if we do anything on acquisitions, that it doesn't distract from building the organic growth machine. But if we do it, if we do want to take a look at that asset or any of the other assets that may come, is it the best use of our shareholders' cash. Because right now, we believe our stock's undervalued then -- and we're generating cash. And so we can deliver returns by buying back shares. So it all come down right asset, right time, so as to not distract the organization. And finally, of course, right price, is it the best use of the cash.
Frank Mitsch: Terrific. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Steven Byrne with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Steven Byrne: Yes, thank you. So, Tim, if your end markets normalized and now you have three segments with more transparency and you've divested the slower growth businesses and you focus on share gains, et cetera. What do you target as a sustainable earnings growth rate down the road here? And what do you think it needs to get to, to move you out of a 15 multiple?
Tim Knavish: Yes. Hey, Steve, I'll be consistent with what I've been saying in my first two-plus years now is that, as we start to deliver on each of our commitments, this is a 8% to 12% EPS growth company. And where it falls in that range is dependent on macros. If you look at 2025, operationally, we're going to be a 7%, which compared to the macros that are in front of everybody right now is a good, I think a pretty robust number. Now going forward, as all the things you said in the beginning of your question are exactly right. More focused portfolio. We don't have the drag on the company from a business that was underperforming. We're not distracted by a high CapEx business that didn't fit our ambitions and we've been investing in the organic growth muscle. And so, we're still confident that this is an 8% to 12% EPS growth company.
Vince Morales: Yes, Steve. I could just add a couple bits of color. This is Vince. Again, if you look by segment, we've got two segments at or above 20% EBITDA margins. So obviously, as they grow, that will enforce our mix benefits. The industrial segment, which has been in a -- we've been in a two-year industrial recession globally. So we think that business and that segment by itself is a -- that is hopefully close to trough or at trough in terms of volumes. And as Tim mentioned earlier, that's our most volume-sensitive segment. So as we see any volume return there, it should come at enhanced incrementals and get back to a different -- differential EBITDA margin on a go-forward basis.
Stephen Byrne: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with VRP.
Kevin McCarthy: Yes, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Tim, I think you mentioned that in the first quarter, you would expect volume to be flat-to-down. My question would be, how do you expect volume to trend through the balance of the year? And how much of the implied improvement in the progression relates to potential macro uplift, you know, getting out of this two-year industrial recession that we've been in, and how much relates to company-specific controllable, such as the $100 million share pickup that John asked about in industrial. Maybe you can kind of parse that out and give us a sense of your level of confidence in restoring volume growth here and what that balance looks like. Thank you.
Tim Knavish: Yes. Hey, Kevin. So, the first quarter will be a challenge as we've said multiple times and you just reinforce. So we're expecting negative volume -- similar trend to what we saw in Q4. You'll then start to see it flattish to positive, low-single-digits and we expect that then for -- certainly for the rest of the year, low-to mid-single digits as we get in the second half. All-in, what we are expecting is positive volume on a full-year basis on a -- at about low-single-digits. Now as far as the breakdown of the components, we are not in none of the segments. Are we excluding a hockey stick kind of recovery? We're expecting stabilization, frankly, stabilization in -- if you look at Europe, for example, stabilization in European architectural demand, stabilization in refinish, but we're not expecting recovery frankly in Europe. Auto builds, IHS has them essentially flat for the year. So we're not -- it's not like we've got this big hope and prayer built into that. It's about stabilization in the end markets, plus the $100 million or so share gains in the industrial segments and then the ongoing share gains that we have in some of our key performance coatings and global architectural coatings. But those are a lot of singles as opposed to triples in home runs that you get on the industrial side. So all in, we're expecting the year to be positive volume in the low-single-digits, negative in Q1, and then ramping up from there.
Vince Morales: Yes. Yes, Kevin, it's Vince. I'll add a couple of points of color about Q1. We did have a strong, very strong Q1 in 2024, especially in China, high-single-digit growth in China. So we're comping against that. We also had double-digit growth in a couple businesses, including packaging. So some of the Q1 year-over-year comp is related to just to hard comparables. And again, as Tim mentioned, the trend line in our industrial business really just continuing the second half of 2024, we saw activity globally decline in the second half. So as we anniversary that in the first-half of 2025, again, we're not expecting significant hockey stick in the back half.
Kevin McCarthy: Thank you, both.
Operator: Thank you. We now have the next question from Michael Sison with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead when you're ready.
Michael Sison: Hey, guys. Thanks. You know, for Performance Coatings and Industrial Coatings, when you look at the business units within that, are the all -- are the businesses in there, the ones that you want to run similar to U.S. architecture, you exited that? Are there businesses you want to exit? Just maybe give us your thoughts on why -- what's last or what's in performance kind of Industrial Coatings can support your goal of growing, I think you said 8% to 12% longer-term for PPG.
Tim Knavish: Yes. Hey, Mike, it's Tim. We don't have any additional divestitures in our recipe right now. Every business has to earn its right to stay in a portfolio on a longer-term basis. But as we sit here today, there's no other divestiture announcements coming out. We like our portfolio. We believe we've got strong position, strong right to win in all of the businesses that we have. Performance Coatings, frankly, it's crushed it. Well, we've got a really strong position in all those businesses, Aerospace, you've heard about refinish, you've heard about PMC, seven straight quarters of growth. We've now got our traffic business pruned to where we got a really strong position in North America and it's performing. So -- and this business or that segment is almost all aftermarket. So we're really happy with that portfolio. If you look at industrial, those businesses are high-technology business -- businesses, which is right in our wheelhouse. And you might look at the margin today and say, oh, well, it's not up to snuff with the other two segments. But as Vince mentioned, we're delivering 16% -plus EBITDA at frankly the trough with a lot of volume leverage to come as things recover and a lot of our self-help is directed at that segment as well. Also, as we start to anniversary that index pricing, that stabilizes and we'll have opportunistic -- opportunities there. All-in, Mike, if you -- I think it's Slide 4, the actions we took moved us up 220 bps top-tier now in EBITDA margin. So we really like the blend of businesses we have with upside given where we are from a macro standpoint.
Michael Sison: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Patrick Cunningham with Citigroup.
Patrick Cunningham: Hi, good morning. So, on the Architectural Coatings EMEA business, your demand seems to be weak on consumer confidence. You experienced demand declines in all regions but said you had some growth in Eastern and Central Europe. Is that mostly a price impact? Are you making some share gains here? And what do you see as some of the catalysts to get consumer confidence off the bottom here? I know you're not calling for a hockey stick recovery, but just wondering what gives you some confidence that we can be stable here.
Tim Knavish: Yes. So performance of our business, you're right, in Q4, most east to west, north to south was a pretty weak quarter. But if you look at the full-year basis, we performed really well in Poland. We performed really well, frankly, in the UK and Ireland. So we had pockets of strength. France was very weak for us and the Nordics were very weak for us. So that's kind of a breakdown of the performance by country by sub-region. We -- from your statement about how is the outperformance being driven share of price, it's both. This team has done an outstanding job for the last decade of pricing appropriately to offset input costs, pricing appropriately on our differentiated products and then pricing at the street fighting level when we need to win shelf space. So the team does a great job of price-volume management. And we have gained some share in those countries where we are performing. As far as Europe more broadly, again, we are not expecting what I would call a recovery, but more of stabilization as inflation stabilizes as whenever central banks are begin the journey in the other direction, some increases in consumer confidence, we are not baking in end of the Ukraine war or anything like that, but that would certainly help. We just believe that there's enough factors out there and we've come down so far over the last five years from COVID and then the war and then high-interest rates and high inflation. We believe that there's enough easing there to stabilize, but not hockey stick.
Vince Morales: Yes. Patrick, Vincent here. Just some confidence from a pace perspective is, if you look at 2023 in this business, Architectural Europe, we were down, let's say, roughly mid-single digits. We were down mid-to-low in the first half of 2024. We were flat in the back half of 2024. So again, that stabilization. And we know the COVID -- we did -- when we had COVID, we had a pull-forward of activity in the -- let's call it, '21 and even early '22. This is on a -- this is a maintenance cycle type business. So we pulled forward some of that maintenance, which was reflected in our '23 and '24 volume numbers. And as that stabilizes and we start to see some of that maintenance come back, we will benefit from that in terms of volume as well as, we'll be able to price accordingly, as Tim said.
Patrick Cunningham: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We now have Mike Harrison with Seaport Research Partners on the line.
Mike Harrison: Hi, good morning. I wanted to go into a little more detail about three different regions or countries that you've mentioned so far. First is Latin America, where it sounds like Architectural and Industrial are pretty solid. Second, you mentioned India, I think in your prepared remarks as a growth opportunity, maybe give us an update on how you've positioned your key businesses there. And then finally, China. I was just hoping you could give us some thoughts on how you're thinking about demand trends going forward, maybe with or without some trade policy shifts.
Tim Knavish: Yes, sure. So LatAm has been and continues to be a rockstar performer for us, some of the stronger GDPs in the world and we're outperforming the GDPs. I just came back from our concessionaire meeting, which the owners of our 5,200 stores across Mexico, and their sell-out is just fantastic. And they're bullish going forward. The nearshoring helps them, but also just the strong consumer confidence and GDP. Our businesses in South America, our automotive business outperformed last year, our industrial business. So not as big as Mexico, of course, but good fundamentals down there. And then we'll pick up some additional share as we mentioned earlier on this call. So Latin America performance will continue as -- particularly as we take to the next chapter of our Comex business where we start to use that network to distribute other business unit products. India. India, we have a very unique situation there where we have a joint venture with the number one Deco player, number one overall paint company in India and that's Asian Paints. Obviously, they run the Deco side, but we've got a joint venture that covers essentially all of the industrial and performance businesses where we bring more to the game, from a technology standpoint, global products, specifications, application expertise, all those things. And so, we leverage the strength of Asian Paints and their footprint and their brand and their kind of reputation in the country and complement that with our technologies and our people, and we've been outgrowing what's been a very nice growth market for us. Then the million or billion or many billion dollar questions is China. And our business in China, unlike many other industrials, we are China for China. We don't make and ship product. We make and paint product locally. So -- and even within that, we're in the right segments. We're in the right segments like auto, aero, PMC and industrial, not anything really associated with real estate or real estate construction. So local for local, we're in the right segments. And throughout '24, despite some of the really challenging macros that you've heard about from us and others, we grew every quarter. It is somewhere between low-single digits and mid-single digits. And so it's not -- it's definitely not the China of a decade ago where you had high-single digits, low-double digits kind of growth. But we're very pleased with the progression of China once we had to reprogram ourselves to think of an elongated recovery as opposed to a hockey stick recovery. But that elongated recovery has another benefit for us in that. It really helps to drive the supply-demand equation on raw materials in our favor because it's elongated, it keeps that supply situation in favorable -- on a favorable side for buyers. So we're not having big celebration parties about a hockey stick recovery in China, but we're pleased with the results of '24 and we're looking forward to a good '25.
Mike Harrison: Very helpful. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov with KeyCorp. Please go ahead.
Ryan Weis: Thanks and good morning, guys. This is Ryan on for Aleksey. Just wanted to pull the curtain back a little bit on China autos. Obviously, you mentioned improvement in 4Q and discussed the increase in exports just overall during '24. So wondering what you're hearing from customers at this stage and kind of what your expectation is here in 2025? Thanks.
Tim Knavish: Yes. Hey, Ryan, thank you for joining us this morning. Here's the most -- one of the more exciting data points for us in our China auto business is the China. First of all, remember, China produces approximately one out of every three cars manufactured in the world. And yes, there's an export portion of that, but most of that is for domestic consumption. Great data point is that China Q4 retail sales were up 19% on autos. So, this is an industry and China certainly has its eco -- economic problems as we all know. But this is an industry that is very critical to the overall China economy and China employment. And so, it's one that gets help from the government and stimulus activity. And I'm confident that going forward, I believe there will be additional help in China from the government as we move forward through '25 and into '26. So on the ground, our teams are telling us the China domestic market is doing well. We are gaining share with the domestic players. So historically, we've had a nice mix of the JVs of Western companies and China domestics. And over this last couple of years, we've really, really had a nice share gain with the Chinese domestics, including the one that everybody talks about. And so, you've got this combined effect of your local consumption being pretty good and share gain of us with the winners on the ground in China auto. Yes. And just one last piece to that, Ryan, is the shine has certainly come off of the EV story globally, but EVs in China are now as at the end of 2024, 37% of every car built in China. And so, yes, we won't see as many EV sales here in the U.S. and Europe and other parts of the world as what everybody thought two years ago. But within China, it's still a big growth market and that's more content for companies like PPG.
Operator: Thank you. We now have John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.
John McNulty: Yes, good morning. Just a quick question on COMEX. Just given how you've broadened it out in terms of the platform, can you help us to think about how much of the product that they're selling is tied to Mexico for Mexico versus export and just to give us a little bit of color on potential tariff risk around that potential platform?
Tim Knavish: Yes, within maybe a couple of decimal points way to the right, it's 100% domestic use from what we distribute through COMEX. I mean, I may be missing some small piece of metal that gets painted and comes across the border, but it is really immaterial. It's -- even the PMC parts of our business that we're now distributing into Mexico are for Mexico construction, for nearshoring, for data centers, automotive plants, industrial plants. Our traffic business that we're now running through those concessionaires is obviously for roads in Mexico. Our refinish that we've started to run through the networks are for collisions in Mexico of Mexican cars. So nothing that I can think of that COMEX concessionaires distribute for us would end up being shipped back to US. But I may be -- again, I may be missing a fraction of a decimal somewhere, but I can't think of it.
Vince Morales: And John, I just want to pick up on those last three things Tim mentioned. We started an active program and the concessionaires are pulling through product in the middle of '24 and it will grow. One of our growth engines in '25 is more through that world-class distribution network. I think we talked about it on the third quarter call and that includes again protective coatings really around the amount of capital infrastructure being built in Mexico due to nearshoring. Our traffic solutions products are world-class and we're now pushing those through the concessionary network. Same with refinish. We have 5,200 distribution points to that refinished product. These are all growth platforms for us in '25 and frankly beyond.
John McNulty: Got it. Appreciate the color.
Operator: Thank you. We have the next question from Steven Haynes with Morgan Stanley.
Steven Haynes: Hey, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just a quick one on the CapEx, the $750 at the midpoint. Yes, a bit higher, I guess, than historically what you would be guiding to and I think there's some catch-up in there. But how would we be thinking about that CapEx number kind of evolving over the next couple of years? Is this kind of the right range or would you expect it to step down or step up to help kind of on growth initiatives from here? Thank you.
Tim Knavish: Thanks, Steven. I'm glad you asked it. It is not our aspiration to be spending CapEx at this level going forward and it won't be. We will get back to our normal kind -- you should think about 3% of sales as a normal run rate CapEx for us, which is what we did for a very long time. And then we stopped spending frankly in some COVID times for obvious reasons. So we do -- some of what you're seeing in there in that elevated CapEx, honestly, both for '24 and '25 is, let's call it, catch-up for the COVID era. But that we do have some kind of transitory incremental spend on a couple of key growth -- organic growth areas, Mexico, building a new resin capacity down there because we need it, because we've grown so much. We've got some incremental CapEx in Aero because we've got more orders than we can fill. And you'll see some CapEx there. Refinish, a growing business for us. We've spent more CapEx -- even in our U.S. refinish factory, we've spent CapEx there. We've been investing in our digital capabilities and we're now over $1.3 billion of digitally enabled sales. So we've had some incremental there. And then last one as far as this wasn't -- didn't impact us in '24, but it will in '25. As part of our self-help program, we're exiting some surplus capacity that we have in some higher-cost regions, particularly Europe. And as you go from, say, three factories down to one in a particular sub-region, we've got to spend some CapEx at the one to get it ready to receive the volume coming from the other two. So thank you for the question because it's not a number, it's a red number for us, but we believe it's good use of shareholder money, one, to catch up for what we didn't spend for a couple of years, and two, to drive organic growth and margin as we move forward.
Steven Haynes: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Laurent Favre with BNP Paribas.
Laurent Favre: And I'm sorry, my questions have been answered. So thanks and have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. We now have Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.
Daniel Rizzo: Hi, this is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. Thanks for fitting me in. If we think about the newly kind of formed architectural segment, how should we think about incremental margins in a recovery and how it compares to industrial and performance?
Tim Knavish: Yes. So as a recovery, we'll get some good leverage and maybe Vince can try to estimate the quantification of it, but we'll get some good leverage, particularly in Europe, right? Because our Mexico -- our business, Global Architectural is almost all Mexico and Europe now, right? We have a small presence in -- very small presence in China, almost negligible, and a decent number two position in Australia, but relative to the other two, it's quite small. So let's talk Europe. We will get fairly significant incremental leverage with in -- not volume uptick, just volume stabilization because of the self-help and pricing that we've done over the last couple of years. Just the stabilization of volume we would view as a win and then, of course, any uptick we would get great leverage on. On the Mexico side, really it would just be the approximation of the gross margin dropping to the bottom line because we're pretty well utilized down there. So there's not a tremendous amount of fixed cost leverage. It's mostly just the variable margin dropping to the bottom line.
Vince Morales: Yes, Dan, this is Vincent. If you put some numbers to it and you look at our portfolio, to Tim's point, the Architectural businesses, they typically have a higher gross margin and they have a higher SG&A to support the feed on the street, the sales teams, et cetera. We are underutilized, certainly in Europe, we don't need to add any SG&A for any of our businesses, any of our countries. So that will come through at close to gross margin, which is depending on the country, mid-40s to mid-50s. In Mexico, as Tim said, we are sold out. So we do have to add some commensurate cost, but most of the cost is borne by the concessionaire on their dime and they get the growth for that. So again, we're talking high incrementals relative to the company average.
Daniel Rizzo: Great. Thank you very much. That was helpful.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Josh Spector with UBS.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning. This is [Lucas Berman] (ph) on for Josh. I just wanted to ask about pricing. So looking at the new segment structure, legacy performance pricing was up about 7% in the last two years. So that was 5% in '23, 2% in '24. Could you give us the splits on the contribution there in '23 and '24 from the new architectural and the new performance segments? So I'd assume performance would be above architectural, but correct me if I'm wrong. And then just kind of what are you assuming there for reach in '25? And lastly, like, I mean, we have the history in industrial, but just what are you assuming in industrial for '25 up, flat or down? Thanks.
Vince Morales: Yes, this is Vince. We're not going to give specifics by business. Just when you look at the segments, as we've said in the past, the industrial segment, we get some -- we'll certainly get some pricing if there's raw-material inflation. That's typically -- it comes on a lag. And then we get pricing above that for differential technology. The performance segment, Tim said this in his opening remarks, it's a business where we heavily impact our customers' productivity. We get paid for that, they get paid for that. We typically see one of our better pricing segments there on a recurring basis. Some of that's perennial pricing. In Global Architectural, it's really market by market and it depends what's happening competitively. We typically have the capability to more real time offset inflation and where we have differential products and where we have differential distribution and service capabilities, we price above that. So if we rack and stack them, performance is typically the best pricing. Architectural is the -- Architectural is steady, but good pricing and industrial depends on the environment.
Operator: Thank you. The final question on the line, unless you would like to ask and that is Star 1, is Arun Viswanathan with RBC.
Arun Viswanathan: Thanks for taking my questions. And I guess I got a couple of questions. So if you go back over the last couple of years, I think we've often thought that maybe low-single digit organic growth was in the cards, but then we have kind of seen a lot of volatility in the form of inflation and interest rates and many of the things you mentioned. So as you look into '25, I know you're guiding to a softer first-half and a lot of that is reflected in your outlook. What would you say are some risks that you do see in front of you? It doesn't look like SG&A would be one of those. It looks like you still have the $100 million or so of share gains across industrial, but -- and then the recovery there as well. But what were somewhat are some of the risks that you guys are keeping an eye on that would kind of prevent you from achieving that growth rate of organic low-single digits? And as a follow-up, if you look into '26, do you see any impediments to achieving that 8% to 12% EPS growth? Thanks.
Tim Knavish: So let me start, Arun. Yes, we -- you mentioned history and we didn't hit low single-digit organic growth this year, I think we hit that. We hit 3%, if I remember correctly, in 2023 and this year organic is about minus 1% minus 2% if all-in, but all includes FX and things like that. So the organic side of that was minus 1%. This year, as we project to low-single digits organic growth, that $100 million that we've talked about earlier, those -- that's not a hope and a prayer. Those are deals that we've won. Now there could be some variability in timing of execution of our customers' launches and things like that, but we feel confident about that. We have done a tremendous amount of work over the last two years of building our organic growth muscle across all of the businesses and that is starting to deliver results. So I feel good about the full-year guide for everything that's within our control. I just can't tell you what -- this is a strange geopolitical environment with post-elections in many countries, we have really good plans and contingency plans for what we can do in the event of various scenarios. But at the end of the day, those would be the risks to achieving both '25 and '26, what's going to happen with all of the potential stressors between the United States and other countries, other countries in Europe. But with everything we know today, we are committed to our full-year guide and we feel good about what we have in our commercial and launch pipeline.
Arun Viswanathan: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude the question-and-answer session. And I will now turn it back over to Alex Lopez.
Alex Lopez: Thank you, Breca, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. We appreciate your interest and confidence in PPG. This concludes our fourth quarter earnings call.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-17 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is Elliot. I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter PPG Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Alex Lopez, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Alejandro Lopez: Thank you, Elliot, and good morning, everyone. This is Alex Lopez, Director, Investor Relations. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG and welcome you to our third quarter 2024 financial results conference call. Joining me on the call from PPG are Tim Knavish, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vince Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our comments relate to the financial information released after US equity markets closed on Wednesday, October 16, 2024. We have posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on the Investor Center of our website, ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide additional support to the opening comments Tim will make shortly. Following management's perspective on the company's results for the quarter, we will move to a Q&A session. Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company's current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. The presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC. Now let me introduce you PPG Chairman and CEO, Tim Knavish.
Timothy Knavish: Thank you, Alex, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2024 earnings call. I'd like to start by providing a few highlights on our third quarter 2024 financial performance, make a few comments on our press release this morning, and then I'll move to our outlook. The PPG team delivered sales of $4.6 billion and our eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year segment margin improvement. This culminated in record third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.13, which represents 3% year-over-year growth despite an unfavorable impact from a higher year-over-year tax rate, which reduced the EPS comparison by $0.08 or 4%. Our segment margin improvement was driven by favorable business mix due to our sales of our advantaged products and a continued focus to deliver productivity and lower costs. Our growth broadened as 7 out of 10 businesses delivered organic growth in the quarter, and another business, specifically our Architectural Coatings business in Europe was flat. We delivered year-over-year sales volume growth of plus 2% in the Performance Coatings segment driven by above-market volume performance in Automotive Refinish, including high single-digit percentage increases in US collision-related products despite lower overall industry collision claims. Additionally, our Aerospace Coatings business delivered record quarterly sales, stemming from double-digit percentage organic sales growth and despite improving our production capacity this year through debottlenecking and other productivity gains, we still ended the quarter with an order backlog of approximately $290 million. This backlog demonstrates the strong demand for our technology-advantaged products and excellent industry dynamics. We had sustained growth in Architectural Coatings Americas and Asia Pacific driven by the professional contractor channel in the US and Canada. Also, our concessionaire network in Mexico continues to perform well. Additionally, our Protective and Marine business benefited from strong global demand and our recent share gains. Year-over-year, organic sales for Architectural Coatings in Europe were flat. And while, of course, we aspire for growth in this business, the flat results are positive trend after several quarters of sales declines. This result was supported by growth in Central and Eastern Europe, offset by lower sales volumes across Western Europe. Solid growth in our Performance Coatings segment in a difficult environment reflects the strength of our key technologies, brands and services. However, this growth was offset by increasingly challenged global auto OEM and industrial production, which constrained demand in the Industrial Coatings segment. As has been well publicized, the automotive OEM industry, particularly in the US and Europe, has taken unscheduled prolonged downtime that was not considered in our July financial guidance. This rapid decline in industry production negatively impacted our top line. And while we reacted quickly with cost mitigation efforts, we were not able to fully offset the earnings impact late in the quarter. We were able to partially offset the decline with PPG share gains that resulted in double-digit percentage volume growth in Latin America and single-digit percentage volume growth in China. Similar to prior quarters, general industrial activity in the US and Europe was lackluster and mixed by end use and our volume performance mirrored that backdrop. Despite delivering solid volume growth in China and India, our aggregate Industrial Coatings business organic sales declined by a mid-single-digit percentage. We delivered strong top line performance in the Packaging Coatings business, achieving our third consecutive quarter of volume growth driven by incremental share gains. During the third quarter, raw material costs were flat year-over-year and we expect this will continue in the fourth quarter. We are just now starting preliminary discussions with our suppliers for 2025 and there is ample capacity in our supply chain. We ended the third quarter with cash of about $1.3 billion. During the quarter, we completed $200 million in share repurchases and paid $160 million in dividends. On a year-to-date basis, we have returned approximately $1 billion of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This is supported by our consistent cash flow generation. Our strong balance sheet provides us with financial flexibility to create shareholder value going forward. I wanted to take this opportunity to provide you with an update from our previously announced strategic reviews of the Global Silicas products business and the Architectural Coatings US and Canada business. As previously announced, we reached a definitive agreement to sell our silicas products business for approximately $310 million in pretax proceeds. We expect to close this transaction in the fourth quarter. Regarding the Architectural Coatings US and Canada strategic review, per this morning's announcement, I am pleased to share that we have reached a definitive agreement to sell 100% of this business for a transaction value of $550 million. We are very pleased to be working with a quality buyer like American Industrial Partners, a growth-focused company with a strong track record. These two divestitures further optimize our portfolio by improving our organic growth and financial return profiles and will result in increased capability to channel our growth resources to areas where we have the strongest growth and strongest margin profiles and a demonstrated right to win. As we stated when we announced this review, on a three-year pro forma basis, PPG's overall company sales volume results would have improved cumulatively by over 200 basis points, excluding the Architectural Coatings US and Canada business. Also, the company's Performance Coatings segment operating EBIT, excluding the US and Canada Architectural Coatings, would have resulted in an approximately 300 basis point improvement in segment margins in 2023. These actions clearly demonstrate the active management of our portfolio focused on value creating shareholder value by management and by our Board. We expect to close on the silicas transaction in Q4 in the Architectural Coatings US and Canada transaction late in Q4 or early 2025. Let me reiterate that our other Architectural Coatings businesses in Latin America, Europe and Asia Pacific remain important and core businesses for PPG. On top of these portfolio actions, we have announced a comprehensive restructuring program to eliminate associated stranded costs from these transactions and separately to enable footprint rationalization specifically in Europe and a few other Global Coatings businesses. This program will deliver approximately $175 million once fully implemented, including savings of $60 million in 2025. These self-help actions reflect our ongoing commitment to aggressively manage our controllables. As we execute and deliver in Q4, we start to execute on our self-help initiatives, I'm excited about entering 2025. We'll have a sharper, more focused future-facing portfolio and are building a higher growth and higher-margin profile company. For our customers, we are both delivering solutions today that ensure their success and innovating for tomorrow to improve both their productivity and sustainability. The result will be profitable organic growth for PPG and shareholder value for our owners. Finally, we remain committed to our heritage of strong cost management and improved productivity that reinforces the ability to maintain our momentum in driving higher margins and earnings growth. The strong performance would not be possible without the dedication of our employees to deliver growth for PPG. Thank you to our PPG team around the world who make it happen and deliver on our purpose every day. Thank you for your continued confidence in PPG. This concludes our prepared remarks. And Elliot would you please open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Roberts with Mizuho. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
John Roberts: Thank you. Tim, could you give us the valuation multiple on the architectural deal? And is the exit completely clean or is there anything left behind at PPG to deal with besides the stranded cost at corporate?
Timothy Knavish: Yes. Hey, thanks, John. So the sales of that business are approximately $2 billion. The EBITDA margin is low-single-digits, and when you do the math, the multiple comes out to a 14 multiple. And as far as, it's a clean cut, a clean break. Well, of course, will be some transitionary service agreements, but it does include ongoing exclusive supply agreements with AAP for them to distribute our protective and light industrial coatings. Thanks, John.
Vincent Morales: This is Vince, John. Just a reminder, the manufacturing and the distribution facilities associated with this business were primarily standalone. So there's no issues in terms of separation there as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Sison with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Michael Sison: Hey, guys. Congrats on getting the deal done. Can you maybe talk about the growth algorithm for 2025 post the sale of architectural silicas? How do you sort of see the volume growth potential for PPG going forward? And I know it's a little bit early to give an EPS walk, but just any framework on how EPS start to grow next year and hopefully, we're in a recovering economy?
Timothy Knavish: Yes. Thanks, Mike. You're right. It's a little early to give any numbers. But the way we're thinking about it is we have momentum in a number of areas. We're very pleased with the trend in Performance Coatings. If you look at auto, despite what's happened here in Q3, IHS is projecting marginally positive builds next year and marginally positive would be a lot better than this year. Europe, while it's taken a while to get here is finally flattened which is a positive story for us as we head into '25. We're gaining traction on a number of the growth initiatives that we've been talking about all year. And then I'd say the self-help that we announced today will start to kick in. So that will help us in '25 as well. So overall, we'll continue to -- we're assuming we'll continue to have some challenging macros. But when you combine with the portfolio move that we just announced this morning, we're optimistic and excited that a sharper more focused PPG, PPG with higher growth and a higher margin profile will be the result in 2025.
Vincent Morales: Hey, Mike, Vince, one thing I'll add there, and we put this certainly in our press release. But again we expect to -- we have a strong balance sheet today. We expect to end the year with a strong balance sheet. So that gives us that flexibility to use that balance sheet in the subsequent quarters and years to our shareholders' benefit.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Leithead with Barclays. Your line is open.
Michael Leithead: Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Tim, can you just speak a little bit more about the outlook and trajectory for industrial margins? And when you think about this quarter, was the weakness driven more as a function of the price declines or volume came in below forecast, and we got caught offside a little bit at the end of the quarter?
Timothy Knavish: Yes. Hey, Mike. So I'd say it was largely driven by the volume, particularly as we progressed through the quarter, predominantly in auto OEM, but also in general Industrial Coatings. There was some, as you saw in the documents, there was some price impact as well, but we expected that. That was all index pricing. The real issue was volume. So the outlook, any volume will bring that leverage right back, but also part of the reason why we're taking these self-help actions.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Your line is open.
Ghansham Panjabi: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everybody. Tim, as it relates to the $550 million in gross proceeds, is that number within the range of outcomes that you anticipated as you contemplated the sale of the assets initially? And then also related to that, how should we think about proceeds allocations and also any dissynergies from global procurement that we should keep in mind?
Timothy Knavish: Yes. Hey, Ghansham. The $550 million and certainly the 14 multiple is consistent with what we were expecting to get. Goldman did a tremendous amount of work with us during this process. We literally had over 100 interested parties to begin with, got 30 initial bids. And so we had a very broad group of interest that gave us a lot of optionality and gave us a lot of insight into what the true value of the assets were. And we're pleased with the 14 multiple. Proceeds, I would just point to our track record over the last four quarters. We've said multiple times we're not going to let cash just grow on the balance sheet. So if there's nothing out there that delivers better shareholder value. We've been buying back shares in the last four quarters. And we stick by our deployment plans there. And as far as the third part of your question, I think, was on any potential dissynergies of raw material. We don't really see any there because if you think about, as you know, raw materials are generally procured on a regional basis. And within North America, particularly with the growth of PPG Comex over the years, even without this business, we are a large producer of coatings raw materials.
Operator: Your next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Duffy Fischer: Yes. Good morning. Question just around the cost program or a couple. So of the 250 in the charge, how is the cash from that going to flow out? How do we model that? Then on the 60 million that you get next year, will that be netted against any kind of stranded cost from the sale of the two businesses, where the net of that ends up being smaller and then to get to the rest of the 175, how does that flow in, in the subsequent years?
Timothy Knavish: So Duffy, I'll ask Vince, the 250, how does it look from a cash outflow standpoint and then your additional questions. Vince?
Vincent Morales: Yes, Duffy, so again, programming us today, it's 250 charge, immediately. That cash will be spread over a three-year period. I'd say front-loaded in the first 15 months-or-so, 15, 18 months. The savings, as we said, are 60 million next year and then pro rata over the following two years. We are making some structural changes to our footprint, so that takes some time as we look at facilities and have to move production around. We do have some short-term quick hitting items as well. But 60 million for next year, we'll certainly give the subsequent years, and we give our guidance in January. And I think you had another question on, again, the total charge is 250, 175 of savings total 60 million next year. Oh, I'm sorry, one other comment. We do have another 70 million of costs that we are required to book as incurred as opposed to upfront. So over the next three years, again, I would assume right now, those are pro rata over the next three years as we move equipment, et cetera, those costs have to be booked as incurred.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citigroup. Your line is open.
Patrick Cunningham: Yeah. Hi, good morning. Just a follow-up on some of the cash outlay here. I'm just wondering how the M&A pipeline looks as it stands today? Are there any specific regions or technologies you want to target? And then just given the sales of Architectural business here and with some restructuring in Europe, would it be safe to assume Architectural Coatings M&A is off the table? Or are there anything that you would look at in perhaps Latin America or something?
Timothy Knavish: Yes. Hey, Patrick. The M&A pipeline over the last year and a half or so has been, I'd say, thinner than normal. That's changed a little bit with some of our peers making a couple of announcements as well as the, obviously, the two things that we did here, but you should not think that we would exclude Architectural Coatings anywhere. It's wherever we have the strongest right to win. I'm not going to take a lot of interest in and then buying a number three anywhere or number four. But we'll look at -- we have a fiduciary responsibility to look at anything that comes across our desk. And so we'll look at any opportunity. But as I've talked since I took over last year, we're going to be very focused. We're building an organic growth machine. And we will supplement that with inorganic growth to the extent that it adds shareholder value, but we will be very targeted in how we do that and where we do it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you. Good morning and congratulations on getting the deals done. A question on the store sale would be, I'm assuming that all those stores had operating leases. And I'm just wondering how you consider the transfer of those lease liabilities? Were those considered debt under I think a recent accounting provision? And does it have any change to your amortization or depreciation or anything like that?
Vincent Morales: Yes, Vincent, there's been a call out in our 10-Q, 10-K on the quantity of those. Those leases, along with any almost all other obligations are transfer with the business. So there'll be no change to our debt profile as a result of that. And certainly that footnote that details our lease commitments will be updated accordingly.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Your line is open.
Josh Spector: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Tim, I was wondering if you could talk about the confidence overall in the growth framework that you laid out a little bit more than a year ago. I think we understand this year, the macro hasn't been cooperative, but you're coming in probably below the low end of that 8% to 12% EPS growth framework. And this is a year where you've had a good amount of help from lower raw materials. So I guess, if I look at everything together, I mean, our assumption is the divestments are modestly dilutive maybe to EPS. You talked about a challenging macro. You have cost savings. So as we think about that 8% to 12% EPS growth framework, is that too high of a bar for next year as we sit today? And if not, what do you take to bridge that gap?
Vincent Morales: Josh, just real quick. We're not going to give our '25 guidance. Tim will talk about macro moves, but we're not going to give '25 financial guidance. One other thing, if we just put the net proceeds into a share repurchase, which we haven't made a decision on that yet, but if we just did that, this would not be dilutive. The transaction would not be dilutive to PPG, it would be slightly accretive.
Timothy Knavish: Yes, Josh, I mean, I am confident in those goals that we set out last year over the course of the cycle and there will be some puts and takes depending on the macros outside of our control. But I'm still confident those are the appropriate metrics for us going forward. And as I mentioned earlier, we feel good about the momentum that we have going into next year in a number of areas. I know we focused on volume a lot here over this past year-or-so, but every single quarter, I think it's seven or eight quarters in a row now, we have gotten better on year-over-year volume comps. And a couple of our businesses, most notably aerospace and refinish, have been doing a great job. And that, of course, helps from a mix standpoint. So I'm feeling good about the momentum that we have on the initiatives that we laid out last year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning. Tim and Vince, on raws, given the excess amount of supply in the marketplace from your producers and today's lower oil price, should we be thinking about another low-single-digit decline in raw material costs in '25 for you guys?
Timothy Knavish: Hey, David, we're -- we've said for Q4 that we should expect flat again, which would be consistent with Q3. And again, that's because we're lapping declines of prior years. As we look to '25, frankly, it's too early for us to give you a guide there, but we're just starting negotiations for 2025 contracts with our suppliers. But I guess, if there -- if you think about things like China being maybe a little slower than it people would like. Those negative things from a demand standpoint and negative things from a macro standpoint actually helped the story from supply-demand on our raws. So we go into the year or year-end here with ample supply upstream of us. So that's the position we're entering our 2025 negotiations with.
Vincent Morales: David, this is Vince. As we've talked many times with you in the past, we probably have six months visibility here at raws. So what we say today, positive or negative could change in six months based on external dynamics. I do want to stress what Tim said is we've negotiated, began negotiation with our suppliers. Almost every one of them have excess supply and are willing to work with us in a joint manner for the betterment of both parties.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. What are the cash proceeds from the sale of the Architectural business? In the quarter, if you excluded the Architectural business, what would have been the volume growth in your Performance Coatings business? And when do prices stop going down in auto OEM?
Timothy Knavish: Yes. Let's -- we'll tag team this one and ping pong it a little bit, Jeff. The first one I'll take. We expect the proceeds from the Architectural [indiscernible] transaction to be about -- the cash proceeds to be about $450 million. The price -- I'll go to the third one and let Vince fill in the sandwich in the middle there. But on the price side, again, the vast majority of the negative price you see is index contracts. And those are on time lags of anywhere from 6 to 12 months. So if you go back and look at our -- when the prices like in auto, for example, started to turn negative, knowing that that's all index pricing, it's -- we have some that will stop and flatten out after six months and some that will flatten out after 12 months.
Vincent Morales: Yes, Jeff, on your question about what's the organic growth and performance or volume growth and performance? If you take the sales out and you take the delta year-over-year out on price and volume for the Architectural US Canada business, you end up almost at the exact same numbers for this particular quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrne with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Stephen Byrne: Yes, thank you. So your volumes were flat and your raws were flat, your COGS were down 3.5% or 3%, a little over 3%. What's driving the lower COGS? And you got more tailwind on that coming. And then just to follow on to that, to the index pricing, what is it indexed to? Six, 12 months ago, energy was not that much dissimilar. So what's driving that? How can we -- how do we anticipate that to change?
Timothy Knavish: Yes. Hey, Steve, the COGS, we have started to gain on our manufacturing productivity that we've been talking about for the last year and a half. So that's helping us in addition to the items that you mentioned. Our index contracts are typically not based on energy other than our silicas business, which we're selling. Our coatings index contracts are based on a basket of raw materials that closely represents the formulation cost for any particular goods. So they're not directly linked to either oil or energy.
Vincent Morales: Yes. If you remember, Stephen, at the beginning of an inflation cycle, we typically lag on price on the way up. And so again, as we get to the end of the cycle, we're lagging on price on the way down. So there's probably a three or six month pause on both sides of that, that are dislocated from when the raws moved.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with VRP. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Kevin McCarthy: Yes. Thank you and good morning. I appreciate you don't want to give 2025 guidance holistically. But perhaps you could comment narrowly with regard to the deal. If we take into account the various tax angles and stranded costs, do you think that this US and Canada divestiture is likely to be slightly dilutive or slightly accretive or immaterial to your 2025 earnings trajectory? And then secondly, as a practical matter, will you move it to discontinued operations in the fourth quarter or just keep it in as normal course?
Vincent Morales: Yes, Kevin, this is Vince. Good series of questions there. Again, if you just assume a share buyback at yesterday's share price for the net proceeds that Tim just alluded to, we would be slightly net positive from an accretion perspective next year. We do have about 15 million of stranded costs. You saw the restructuring announcement this morning, that's the start to tackle those stranded costs that we'll certainly activate on fairly quickly. With respect to the accounting, our intention is to move this to discontinued operations. It's over 10% of the company. We'll go through that those mechanics here over the next several weeks. And at that, upon closure here, we'll -- hopefully, we close as we said in the fourth quarter, but we will move this to discontinued operations accordingly.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes. Hi. This is Davonte Adams sitting in for Frank. Congrats on the transaction. To that point, Vince, about taking costs out, you guided '24 to $300 million in corporate costs. Just curious as to where you think you're going to drive that corporate cost down to? And then secondly, really good progress on Refinish. You added 100 more MoonWalk units. Just curious why the guidance for 4Q is flat on Refinish? And what should we think about the growth in 2025 for Refinish? Thank you.
Timothy Knavish: Well, Davonte, I think you may be should be practicing for a likely loss against the Steelers this weekend. But I'll take your second question and let Vince take your first. Refinish, we've said multiple times, and I think you know, Frank, understand that business with the two-step distribution, there's always a lot of noise in the chain, stocking, destocking, all the distributors manage their cash differently. And so we really try to look at that on a multi-quarter basis. So if you take Refinish total year-to-date, sales are flat, but insurance claims are significantly down. So we're picking up about 500 net shop wins per quarter and that's a pretty consistent run rate. So we really watch the net wins in the multiple quarter sales. Now one other thing about Q4 of last year, we did have a fairly significant pull forward relative to timing of price increases. We're not anticipating that our distributors will do that as much this year. So all those things together give that lead to the table that shows a difference in organic sales growth between Q3 and Q4.
Vincent Morales: Yes, Frank, on your question on corporate costs, we haven't finalized our 2025 profit plan yet. A lot of moving pieces in there, including things like pension, medical cost, et cetera, that we need to get finalized. I'd say from a structural basis, so the structural cost in corporate, we would expect with this cost program, those structural costs to be lower, but we'll have to see how some of these other items come out and we'll certainly give that update in January with our 2025 guidance.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO. Your line is open.
John McNulty: Yeah, good morning. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations, again, on the asset sale. So maybe we can speak to the auto's outlook. So clearly things came in a bit worse than expected. I guess at least what the consultants are looking at is this kind of drags on for another quarter-or-so and then we start to get to positive growth in the first quarter of next year. Is that what you're kind of expecting hearing from your customers as well or is there any reason to think this could either end earlier, end later than that in terms of some of the pressures? I guess how are you thinking about that business? And then also just on the cost-cutting program, how much of it's going to be tied into the auto and industrial segment, first, as part of your European outlook versus just kind of more broad cuts across Europe?
Timothy Knavish: Hey, John, well, first, the way you described, you answered the question exactly how I would answer it. That is what we're hearing from our auto customers that this downturn in builds and increase in production downtime, et cetera, is going to continue into Q4. And honestly, it's something that we're watching very closely because there's one particular customer in the US where there's some strike talk. And so and that's any strike there is not built into our guide. So we're watching auto very closely as we move into Q4. But as you said, we are expecting, based on what we're hearing and including based on what we see from IHS, we are expecting an uptick in 2025. The cost maybe Vince can give you the exact numbers, but there is a portion of that self-help that is dedicated to the automotive business, in particular, the automotive footprint in Europe and elsewhere. But we've got some work to do with works councils and things like that before we get final decisions made in Europe, but certainly auto will be a part of the self-help.
Vincent Morales: John, I'll just add a couple of comments on the industry. What we do see and what we've seen in Q3 here are the industry healthily reacting to inventory levels. So inventory levels are not out of control at this point. So we think the discipline there instilling is positive. Secondarily, what some of the carmakers are doing is taking early downtime to do changeovers earlier. We think coming out of those to the new models, we think we'll have a little bit of a benefit based on some of the particular plans we have, et cetera. So with good healthy inventory or managing that inventory properly and the changeovers, we think, will give us some incremental benefit next year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Favre with BNP Paribas. Your line is open.
Laurent Favre: Yes, good morning, guys. The first question is on the Aerospace business. I think you're getting to some slowdown. I was wondering how you factored in, I guess, all the ongoing headlines at the main OEMs in terms of your volumes outlook, also if possible into 2025?
Timothy Knavish: [Technical Difficulty] Backlogs are so big in OE and aftermarket that all that [Technical Difficulty] slowdown. In fact, we continue to see strong demand across the board for our technology. We're projecting for fourth quarter high single-digit growth and there could be upside for that. And going into 2025, I expect another outstanding year for our Aerospace business.
Vincent Morales: Yes. And I think what we're running into here, Laurent, is we've had a couple of years of exceptionally strong growth. We're just running into compounding law of large numbers. The industry is very, very robust. So it's just the mathematics of large numbers, but we're not seeing any slowdown.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Research Partners. Your line is open.
Mike Harrison: Hi. Good morning. I had another follow-up question kind of on the Aerospace business. It sounds like you've been capacity constrained there in the backlog or demand is still growing maybe faster than you can debottleneck or add capacity. So what are your longer term plans for bringing on some additional capacity in that Aerospace business? And is that kind of the top priority in terms of where you'd like to focus your organic growth initiatives now that you are getting through this portfolio optimization effort with the US Canada Architectural business? Thank you.
Timothy Knavish: Again, perfect question because it's exactly spot on. We love our team and products and customers in the Architectural US Canada business, but this gives us the opportunity to really focus our resources, not only our capital and capacity investment resources, but our human and management bandwidth resources on businesses like Aerospace. And, yes, we are looking at long-term capacity additions in that business in parallel with continued bottlenecking and productivity at our existing facilities. So we have -- we're very bullish, not only on Q4 and 2025, but multiyear kind of momentum for Aerospace and we'll invest accordingly.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with KeyCorp. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Aleksey Yefremov: Good morning, everyone. In Refinish, your sales were up mid-single digits in 3Q, flat expectation in the fourth quarter. Could you just talk about these dynamics here? Is this comps or is this business just slowing down?
Timothy Knavish: Yes. I answered a little bit of this on an earlier question, Aleksey, but it's not slowdown in body shop activity, it's not slowdown in sellout, if you will. It's really more a phenomenon of inventory management by the channel, particularly here in the United States combined with a comp issue related to prebuying last year that we likely will not have this year. But now we're again, this is -- we look at this business, even though we reported quarterly on this chart, sometimes that gets a little frustrating because it's really a multi-quarter and sometimes even annual look that you have to take at our sell into the channel.
Vincent Morales: And, just again, Aleksey, on that prebuy that Tim mentioned, that was ahead of a January 1 price increase, January 1, '24 price increase that there was a prebuy ahead of. So again the comp reflected that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC. Your line is open.
Arun Viswanathan: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So first off, on the Architectural sale, I think I guess I was under the impression that EBITDA margins are more in the 4% range instead of 2%. So I just wanted to clarify that. It looks like the implied kind of $40 million of EBITDA. And then secondly, when you think about volume growth, I guess, going forward, it sounds like for maybe '25-'26, we're going to be mostly impacted by industrial and automotive. Obviously, aero can sometimes be at the upper end of industrial growth rates and maybe some of your other verticals like Protective and Marine or maybe even Packaging maybe at the lower end just on a structural basis. But in general, it looks like you'd be very levered to industrial production and automotive production. Are those the kind of the main two factors that would kind of drive your volumes going forward or how should we think about how your top line evolves from here?
Vincent Morales: Yes, Arun, this is Vince. I'll take the question on the Architectural business. And it's more of the latter, what you said. So if you do the math and we gave all the numbers to do the math, you get certainly that we're selling is that 2% business, 2% EBITDA business. And again, that includes all the assets, all the liabilities, basically a clean sale of the business. And as Tim alluded to before, we do have exclusive supply agreements on a multiyear basis on a go-forward basis, that will be in our organic numbers.
Timothy Knavish: Yes. And relative to kind of the volume and growth, certainly, auto OEM and general industrial have been the detractors in Q3, and that will likely carry into Q4. But if we look at the broader enterprise we're up to -- we've been progressing every quarter with a number of businesses that have positive growth. And we're up to seven positive, one flat and two down. So, yes, those two are down and any uptick there gives us some nice leverage. But we do expect the positive momentum in all those other businesses to continue. So I think that's more, it's really a combined story rather than just auto and industrial. Now those two specifically, as I mentioned, IHS and what we're hearing is that auto will have a modest uptick of builds next year. And from being down, what, mid to high-single digits this year, that's a pretty big pivot. And in general Industrial, we are expecting it to be better in 2025, albeit not as strong as those other businesses that already have the positive momentum.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Wolf Research. Your line is open.
Christopher Parkinson: Great. Thank you so much. Tim, I don't think I have to tell you that you've had a pretty busy year. But when you take a step back and you look at kind of the results of PC ex North American Architectural, how should investors be generally thinking about the growth rate over the last couple of years when volumes have been such a focus? And then probably more importantly, when we get into '25 and '26, how comfortable are you that you can actually outgrow your respective end markets based on whether it's content and aerospace, new products, obviously, across Refinish and MoonWalk and even down to Marine, how should we be conceptualizing that now that ultimately that's pretty cleaned up? Thank you.
Vincent Morales: Hey, Chris, this is Vince. Let me start real quick. I just got a quick comment here. But if you look at the Architectural US business, it has grown nicely this year on the top line. As we alluded to since we talked in February on our call and certainly as we talk to investors throughout the year, we've made commensurate investments to get that growth on the top line. So the bottom line hasn't grown nearly as much as the top line in this particular year because we've been investing in the business. So that helps you, I think, as you go through your algorithm on the PC.
Timothy Knavish: Yes. And on that, to that point, that's one, one of the reasons why we were able to successfully sell it to a good buyer is because of that momentum that we're gaining from the investments on the top line. Then also it just validates a bit the rationale for selling it in the first place in that we're investing in those growth initiatives in that business as opposed to shifting some of those resources elsewhere. So now but longer term, I'm absolutely convinced that the momentum that we're gaining and you mentioned '25, '26 combined with the portfolio actions that we're taking, we will have a higher growth company and a higher-margin company. And that's why I stand behind those growth, top line and bottom line growth numbers that I talked about last year for kind of a much sharper and more focused PPG going forward. So the macros this year were the macros and they were big negatives in some places or some businesses for growth for us, but we're controlling what we can controllable, which is how we invest our growth capital, how we invest our management capital and complementing it with self-help to drive EPS.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Daniel Rizzo: Good morning. This is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just want to follow up on a comment you made about insurance claims being down in the year, but you're taking share. But I was wondering if insurance claims are down because of maybe collision avoidance technology is growing and that's kind of a secular change or is it something just with timing or just peculiar for this year?
Timothy Knavish: Yes. I think there's a number of reasons. I don't think it's heavily influenced by the anti-collision technologies. While those are great technologies, frankly, they're offset by distracted driving, unfortunately, particularly cellphone driven. The drop in insurance claims is more driven by, one, totals are higher. And so there's less repair claims and more replace claims. It's also driven by the type of miles driven that we're getting compared to maybe historical. Also, just given the broader economy, and this is a transitory item, I believe, the broader economy, some folks are not turning in their insurance claims because of affordability of insurance rates going up and others are not turning in insurance claims just because they're pocketing the cash instead of getting it repaired. I believe those two are transitory. As I think as interest rates come down, the inflation gets under control, I think those two with consumer confidence coming back, those last two will improve.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Aron Ceccarelli with Berenberg. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Aron Ceccarelli: Hello. Good morning and congratulations on the sale. Maybe can you talk a little bit about the outlook for Protective and Marine? The comparable basis for Q4 is not very different from Q3. You're talking a little bit about a slowdown. I would like to understand what's changing there? And also if you can update on the change in strategy in Marine would be great and how you see that?
Timothy Knavish: Sure. We're glad to get a question about this business because it's been doing great for us. I think I'm accurate that it's our sixth straight quarter of volume growth and organic growth in Protective and Marine, doing well. But when you go backwards on six, we're starting to comp the beginning of some really strong upticks, particularly late last year and beginning of this year. So we feel good about it. There's a lot of infrastructure spending, a lot of marine aftermarket spending, shipbuildings returning, you've got a lot of LNG spending, you've got near-shoring spending. So we feel good about this business. And Marine specifically, to your question, we've been doing really well on marine aftermarket. We still participate in Marine newbuild. We like that place, but we love marine aftermarket because we've got some really differentiated technologies, SIGMAGLIDE in particular, which is, frankly, taking off because it's such a fuel savings for our customers and such a sustainability improvement for our customers. So bullish on the business, feel good, don't over-interpret the flat in Q4. That's more of a comp issue.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jaideep Pandya with On Field Investment Research. Your line is open.
Jaideep Pandya: Thanks a lot. First question I have is just on your Deco strategy now that you're exiting North America. What about Europe? I know you have highlighted that Europe is a very profitable business and you obviously acquired Tikkurila. But given now there is one of your close competitors also doing a strategic review of their Deco business, do you intend to potentially add to your Deco business or are there any further steps towards maybe reducing the Deco exposure in this regard? And then the second question, sorry to zoom in on Packaging, but I think there has been some share shifts around Packaging in the last one year. If the share goes back to one of your other US competitors from the ones that you've gained, should we still expect growth because you've gained share? Because some of your other competitors are a little bit more skeptical or negative about packaging than you guys. So I just wanted to double check on that. And once again, well done on selling North America.
Timothy Knavish: Thank you, Jaideep. I'll take the first one. Vince, you want to take this, the Packaging one just to divide and conquer here. So very clear, our Deco strategy in the rest of the world, now that this transaction, well, we haven't closed yet, obviously, but once it's completely behind us, our Deco strategy is to focus on those countries where we're number one or a strong number two, that is where we have a proven track record of delivering good earnings, good cash and good growth. And so Europe, specifically, we're number one, I believe, in 10 countries, and some of that coming from Tikkurila, some coming from other deals, and we're strong number two in other countries. Some of the self-help that I mentioned earlier will apply to those businesses in Europe that will improve the profitability even further. So we'll adjust. We will stay in those businesses as long as we keep putting up good numbers like we have been and retain that strong number one and strong number two position. Mexico, for example, lights out. We have a strong number one position, and we're shooting lights out every quarter. In other places, Asia Pacific, Australia, we've got a strong number two position. So as I said in my opening remarks, those businesses are important to our portfolio, core to our portfolio, and we'll keep investing. Now that said, you asked about M&A potential in Deco. One, it would only, we'd only be interested if it fit those criteria that I just described probably not in Europe because we've already got a very well-established position in Europe. But we will -- we have the responsibility to our shareholders to look at things that come on the market and we'll assess them. It's a little early yet for the ones that were just recently announced by our competitors. Packaging, Vince?
Vincent Morales: Yes, on Packaging, I think you hit the nail in the head in terms of history. There was some share shift exiting, like I'd say, '22 to '23, et cetera. That's all lapped. We did pick up share for the full year of '24. We still are fairly confident we're going to pick up more share heading into '25. So you'll see positive top line comps in '25 as well based on what we're talking to with respect to our Packaging customers. So again, our technologies and the services we provide are the reasons why we're maintaining on a net basis picking up share.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the call back over to Alex Lopez.
Alejandro Lopez: Thank you, Elliot. We appreciate your interest and confidence in PPG. This concludes our third quarter earnings call.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-07-19 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is Elliot, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter PPG Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Alex Lopez, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Alex Lopez: Thank you, Elliot, and good morning, everyone. This is Alex Lopez, Director, Investor Relations. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG and welcome you to our second quarter 2024 financial results conference call. Joining me on the call from PPG are Tim Knavish, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vince Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our comments relate to the financial information released after U.S. equity markets closed on Thursday, July 18, 2024. We have posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on the Investor Center of our website, ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide additional support to the opening comments Tim will make shortly. Following management's perspective on the company's results for the quarter, we will move to Q&A session. Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company's current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. The presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC. Now let me introduce PPG Chairman and CEO, Tim Knavish.
Timothy Knavish: Thank you, Alex, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2024 earnings call. I'd like to start by providing a few highlights on our second quarter 2024 financial performance, and then I'll move to our outlook. The PPG team delivered sales of $4.8 billion and our seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year segment margin improvement. This culminated in second quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.50, which is an all-time record for the company and represents 11% year-over-year growth. Despite increasingly challenging macroeconomic conditions, we are building top-line momentum as our underlying year-over-year volume progression improved for the sixth consecutive quarter. In the second quarter, six of our 10 business units delivered positive volume growth versus prior year, aided by our enterprise growth strategy initiatives. These initiatives included delivering new products and technologies to our customers, such as our innovative packaging interior can and exterior end coatings technologies as well as our new SIGMAGLIDE technology in our Marine business. Each of these technologies has allowed us to gain share in their respective businesses. Our actions also include upgrading and modernizing our manufacturing capabilities to drive increased output such as in aerospace where demand has outpaced industry supply. One additional example of our enterprise growth strategy is where we're driving changes to the ecosystem of the business models. This includes an architectural coatings, U.S. and Canada with our Home Depot initiative in our refinish business with our digital tools such as MoonWalk and LINQ and in our Traffic Solutions business as we further optimize our service and supply capabilities, which are critical value drivers in this business. Additionally, our volume performance in the quarter benefited from our well-established business portfolio in Mexico, China and India. Overall, however, our aggregate volumes in the quarter were flat year-over-year, falling shy of our initial expectations as overall demand in Europe and global auto OEM production were below what we assumed in our second quarter guidance. It is important to note that our European volumes, while still negative, improved sequentially year-over-year versus the first quarter. Also, global industrial activity remained subdued in the quarter. Consistent with our financial guidance in April, our second quarter automotive refinish sales were down year-over-year, reflecting a strong prior year comparison and lower insurance claims. However, we remain confident that this business will have a strong second half of 2024. In the quarter, we drove further margin enhancement, and we marked our seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year segment margin improvement. Our aggregate gross margin was 43% for the quarter, a 180 basis point improvement year-over-year. Our Performance Coatings segment achieved all-time record segment margin of 18.7%. In our Industrial Coatings segment also improved its margin profile by 120 basis points versus the prior year. During the second quarter, we benefited from stable upstream and downstream supply chains and the vast majority of our suppliers have sufficient or excess capacity which is noteworthy as this occurred during the peak season for raw material consumption. Consistent with our guidance, we experienced mid-single-digit percentage raw material deflation that we expect will normalize into flat to low single-digit deflation for the third quarter as we anniversary prior year impacts. This benefit was partially offset in our results by general inflation, including higher year-over-year wages and employee benefits. We are proud to have published our 2023 ESG report in the quarter, which highlighted progress against our 2030 targets including increasing sales from sustainably advantaged products and reducing greenhouse gas emissions throughout our own operations and our value chain. I want to take this opportunity to provide you with an update on our previously announced strategic reviews of the architectural coatings U.S. and Canada business and the global silicas product business. We made good progress with these processes and are pleased to have a number of engaged and interested parties. We're working through the traditional bidding management presentation and data provision stages and remain on our original schedule to determine a path forward for each of these assessments. We have also made further progress in driving improvement in working capital, including lowering our year-over-year inventories during the quarter. As a result, our operating working capital was down 90 basis points year-over-year. We have more work to do over the balance of the year as we move towards seasonally slower sales quarters, but we have already returned to near pre-pandemic inventory levels. We ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet and remain committed to deploy excess cash for shareholder value creation. During the quarter, we repurchased $150 million of PPG shares, bringing our year-to-date total to about $300 million. This is on top of our fourth quarter 2023 repurchases. Also yesterday, consistent with our long heritage, our board authorized a $0.03 dividend increase from $0.65 to $0.68 per share. Now, looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect overall organic sales of flat to low-single-digit percentage growth. In Mexico, we expect to again deliver excellent financial results. We also believe that demand in China will deliver organic growth, as a result of our technology-advantaged products, but albeit at a lower growth rate than achieved in the first half of the year. In Europe, demand remains uneven by country and end use, but we expect modest sequential year-over-year improvement. In addition to those businesses that grew in the second quarter, we expect organic growth in automotive refinish coatings and protective and marine coatings, and also, while slightly unfavorable year-over-year, we are expecting product projecting, modest sequential quarterly improvement in general industrial demand. We expect to deliver adjusted third quarter EPS between $2.10, and $2.20 per share, aided by solid operating performance. Our guidance midpoint is 4% higher than our record third quarter 2023. However, the midpoint of our guidance is 10% higher than the third quarter of 2023, excluding the impact of a higher year-over-year tax rate, as the prior year included several non-recurring favorable discrete tax items. The difference in the tax rate is reducing our year-over-year EPS comparison by approximately $0.12 at the midpoint. We anticipate overall company selling prices to be flat in the third quarter, as the impact of certain index-based customer contracts in our Industrial Coatings segment will be offset by selling price increases in our Performance Coating segment, including some additional incremental pricing that will be realized in the third quarter. With regard to commodity raw materials, supply remains ample and we continue to realize benefits from moderating input costs. In the third quarter, we expect flat to low-single-digit percentage raw material deflation lower than the second quarter as we anniversary some decreased realized in 2023. As we have consistently demonstrated, we will drive further improvement of our operating margins, aided by sales volume growth leverage as a result of the execution of our enterprise growth strategy and self-help in manufacturing productivity and cost control initiatives, which includes continued execution of our previously approved restructuring actions. Our more than 50,000 employees are committed to delivering best-in-class solutions to our customers that will drive growth for PPG. Our results this quarter were made possible by our highly dedicated team around the world, who make it happen and deliver on our purpose to protect and beautify the world every day. Thank you for your continued confidence in PPG. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now would you please open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
John McNulty: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I guess maybe the first one would just be on the U.S./Canada architectural review. It sounds like you're getting a reasonable amount of interest. Would you say that, that's increasing the likelihood of a sale versus some of the other avenues, JVs, partnerships, I think you kind of said at the beginning of all this any option is open. But it sounded like a sale was the preference. Would you say there's a high likelihood of this ending up being a sale?
Timothy Knavish: Hi, John. Thanks for the question. We're very pleased with the level of interest in the architectural U.S./Canada business. And I will say that level of interest has great diversity across the scenarios that may end up being the final path forward. So it's just too early at this point to say which one of those is kind of leading the pack as we've had really good interest in a number of different scenarios from full sale to JV and other forms of partnerships. So just too early, John, but we are making good progress.
Vincent Morales: Yes. And John, this is Vince. As we said - as Tim said in the opening remarks, we're in the normal process working with these interested parties, working with our bankers, having traditional management meetings, et cetera. So we remain on our original schedule to determine a path forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Duffy Fischer: Yes, good morning, guys. A question on auto OE. So the numbers you put up were worse - like if we're looking at just the global auto builds, S&P or IHS. So is that a customer footprint issue? Is it a destocking by the customer first? And then do we need to anniversary that? Are there two more quarters after this that are going to kind of be down high single-digits to get to a new level of run rate?
Timothy Knavish: Duffy, thanks for the question. Our numbers, our projections may have been a bit different than what you're seeing from some of the kind of global services - service providers a couple of things there. We do have a very strong position in Europe, which was down more than average. And also, our projections, while services maybe are looking more at macros, our projections for Q3, in particular, are based on what we actually see in specific assembly plant schedules at the plants that we serve. And a number of them have increased just very recently increased their summer downtimes. So that may have a disproportionate impact versus what you may be seeing publicly. And then finally, I'd say, as you know, we have a very strong position in China. And we did see a step down in China production plans as soon as the EV tariffs were announced and I think some of our customers are playing it cautious here until they see how that scenario plays out because, as you know, particularly the largest producer there is exporting quite a bit there, so we do think that's a transitory item that will play out.
Vincent Morales: Yes, Duffy, this is Vince, just a point of clarification on our materials, we provide organic sales numbers, which for us includes volume and price, as we've alluded to many times this year in this business and in our industrial segment. We have index-based pricing. So excluding price, we're much closer to the service provider numbers that you alluded to in your question. So you have to bifurcate price first volume.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Ghansham Panjabi: Yes, good morning. Thank you. Tim, could you give us a bit more color on the volume trend line in Europe during the second quarter. You mentioned it was a bit below your forecast. Which specific business businesses perhaps were a little bit below? I think you call that Auto OEM. And then secondly, in terms of the flattish volumes out of consolidated basis year over year for 2Q and the margin improvement, just quite significant, can you just give us some of the high level drivers of that?
Timothy Knavish: Sure, Ghansham. Thank you for the questions. Yes, the volume - the volume trend in Q2 did play out a little worse than we expected, particularly at the end of the quarter. June in particular, was soft, largely driven by what I just said on Duffy's questions as certain assembly plants started to add additional down weeks and that affected U.S. and Europe. So that was one thing that played out. The other one is the Deco business in Europe softer than we expected, again, particularly in the last month of the quarter. A little more color there. We're very strong in France, and that's one of our large countries for sales. And as you know, that had some unique situations going on there. So that did slow down for us in June. But interestingly, a subset of the Europe story is Eastern Europe has been stronger than expected, where we actually also have a very strong position in countries like Europe - I'm sorry Poland and others. So it was really those two businesses in Europe that trended downward as the quarter progressed. Then the overall volume being flat versus what we had previously said was really driven globally by auto and locally in Europe by architectural. Those were the two big ones. But as I said in my opening remarks, we did - we have been improving sequentially over the last six quarters. If you go back to end of '22, we were down negative 5% in volume, and that has steadily improved to where we were printing flat this quarter. And also in my remarks, I said there were six out of 10 businesses that were volume for us. Just to give you some context there, last year that was three out of 10. So we went from three out of 10 to six out of 10 and we're planning on eight out of 10 in Q3 being positive, so a little under where we wanted to be for Q2, largely driven by end of quarter in those two businesses. But we feel good about the momentum, Ghansham.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Christopher Parkinson: Hi, good morning everybody. I don't think any of us are really on a doubt that the macro has been a little bit choppier than most were anticipating into the second quarter. But Tim, you've been really focusing the portfolio and your ability to outgrow certain end markets. I know it's still a bit early and perhaps tough to tell, but what would be at this juncture, the two to three end markets where you are, by far and away, the most comfortable in PPG's ability to consistently outperform market growth rates? Thank you.
Timothy Knavish: Yes. Hi, Chris, thanks for the question. Number one, aerospace. We're really just - as I've said for the last several quarters, everything we can make is sold and shipped. We're adding capacity. We're improving productivity. We've improved output in this past quarter. So we're selling more and we'll continue to outperform. Despite the - I always say that with refinish, you really have to look over a full year basis with this business, because you always have order pattern issues from the distributors around the world. Refinish, we continue to gain share and refinish by execution of our digital systems, which have been widely accepted and embraced and we keep adding to that toolbox of new digital tools, Chris. So feel really good about that. There's packaging outperforming from a volume standpoint, and we still haven't launched everything that we've won in the last few quarters. Traffic, although not our biggest business, that's - I want to point to a business that the first couple of years, I would say, we cleaned up that business. And now we're in a position where it is really starting to perform for us. Other businesses very, very much by specific region, but those will be the four that overall, I would say, we're outperforming. But I do want to point out three other things. Aggregate Mexico, just Mexico across the board, whether it's PPG Comex or our Industrial segment businesses or protective and coatings, protective and marine, we outperformed Mexico. Aggregate China, of course, with excluding deco, where we don't play, aggregate China were outperforming. Aggregate India except for deco, where we don't play, we're outperforming. So that's how I would describe the businesses that I feel most confident about our overperformance going forward, Chris.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning. Tim, as you go through the review of our U.S. paint business, are you seeing any disruptions to the business, in particular, see any market share losses due to challenges or disruptions in the business? Thank you.
Timothy Knavish: Hi, Dave, we had a very good quarter in that business. So of course, that was something that we had some concerns about as we announced it, but internally, the team has done a really good job working with our employees, our customers, our distribution partners in the private dealer space, our big box customers. And we had a good quarter in that business, mid-single-digit growth. So, while we - it's something we're watching and monitoring very closely and trying to stay ahead of it, I'd say, the team did a really good job in Q2 of doing that and we're expecting the same in Q3. There's lots of discussions. Of course, there are some anxieties. But so far, that has not had any kind of sizable impact on the financial results.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Mizuho. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
John Roberts: Thank you, Tim. Are you still on track with the silicas sale as well? And how do you feel about the rest of the specialty materials portfolio?
Timothy Knavish: Yes, John, thanks for the question. Silicas, we're very much on track with that, maybe even a little ahead of where we are in architectural U.S., Canada. We've had good interest there as well. And let's just say, we're on our original schedule. The rest of that specialty business, we really like. And here's why because we have a leadership position in those spaces and they're high-technology spaces, which is right in our wheelhouse from a R&D capability standpoint. So, obviously, not the biggest part of our portfolio, but that business was one of the good growth engines for us in Q2, we expect that to continue going forward. So they're good businesses for us.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Stephen Byrne: Yes. Thank you. And Tim, if you had a clean slate of how to report your financials, you have these 10 businesses. You have some looming divestitures. If you were to report that network of businesses, would you choose two segments, and would you allocate them the way they're currently arranged, or would you consider going down a path of either more segments, or reporting revenue by business, something to drive more transparency?
Timothy Knavish: Hi, Steve, it is something I've been given a lot of thought to, and we'll continue to think about it and see what things look like post architectural U.S./CA, but high level, we have a group of businesses that essentially deliver factory to factory, pure business, B2B type of businesses where they go from our factory to an assembly plant, or our factory directly to a paint shop of some kind, and that's a logical fit because they have a lot of synergies. Synergies in operations, synergies in raw materials, synergies in supply chain and logistics and synergies in science and technology. We have another group of businesses that largely go through distribution and has a lot of value add services, that are a key part of the value proposition like aerospace, like refinish and like protective. So high level, I'm comfortable with it. But it's something we do look at on a regular basis. And we'll take a fresh look once this transaction is done. But I'm pretty comfortable with how we report today.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you and good morning. In our model, if we look out into 2025, we start to see raw materials move up, probably low single digits in the first half of next year. So is that something you'll look to get ahead of from a pricing perspective in the back half of the year? Or would you take more of a wait-and-see approach? And are there any parts of the business where if we forget about Refinish and Arrow where you have well-defined pricing power. Are there any parts of the business maybe auto OEM where you're a little more concerned about being able to pass that through?
Timothy Knavish: Yes. Hi Vincent. So what I would say at a very high level is there's sufficient capacity out there across the supply chain, because if you look at the total industry of coatings we're producing less, leaders than we did pre-COVID. And so there's high level, there's still quite a bit of capacity out there. Of course, we do what we can to get ahead of it. And you pointed to in some places where we can get ahead of it. The other businesses, largely the industrial segment it's typically more real-time. And in some cases, as you know, businesses are able to get pricing faster than others. And as we discussed during the last inflationary cycle, auto OEM is typically the slowest, but we eventually get there, just like we did last cycle. So, I would expect it to play out the same in any cycle that may be on the horizon, whether its next year or the following year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Sison with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Michael Sison: Hi, good morning. Can you maybe talk a little bit about the profitability of U.S. architectural paints? Has there been any improvement over the last year? Maybe what type of growth you think that business will generate in the second half? And then finally, Tim, when you think about the full sale JV or partnership, how are you thinking which one would be the best transaction for shareholders?
Timothy Knavish: Well, we - the best transaction for shareholders will come down to two pieces. One is what's - what are the proceeds, what do we get paid for, what we're selling. And two, what's the long-term strategic value of anything we might be left with. So that's why it's really hard for me or any of us to say, here's the best shareholder value proposal right now, because the combination of those two price proceeds and future value of anything we might be left with, we're just not there yet in the process. But that's how we're thinking about it is a combination of shareholder value today for what we get and shareholder value for future or how it fits with our growth strategy and what we can expect from an earnings and cash flow on the long-term.
Vincent Morales: Yes. And Mike, on current events, look, as Tim just said in an earlier question, business is performing well. Volumes are a key driver to profitability - our volumes were up in Q2, as we said in the prepared remarks. So we're pleased with the progress year-to-date.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Frank Mitsch: Good morning and congrats, Alex, on your new role. Tim, I want to ask about the expectations for the second half to be lower than you previously thought which resulted in the full year EPS guide down. Just curious, roughly what was the - yes, when you think back three months ago or even six months ago when you first put out the full year projection, what sort of level of volume growth were you expecting in the second half of the year? And where are you now in terms of expectations on volume growth for the second half of the year. And I know that part of the reduction is tied to auto OEM and you said that you've been surprised by the extension of the assembly plant downtime. Just curious, looking back in PPG's history, when you've been surprised in the past by the auto OEMs taking extended assembly plant downtime. Does that serve as any sort of foreshadowing of recessionary environments or anything like that? Any color there would be very helpful. Thank you.
Timothy Knavish: Yes, hi, Frank. So first of all, what changed from what we're saying about the full year to what we're saying today, it's largely a couple of big businesses like auto, global and architectural Europe. And of course, the other businesses are puts and takes, some down. So that's really the biggest driver. And to your second question, I'm not using the recession word at all. What I see more is temporary adjustments at assembly plants just given vehicles - some certain vehicles selling less than expected and inventory is going up a little bit. Inventories are still very healthy compared to pre-COVID levels. But if you look at U.S. inventories, they did creep up a little bit. So I think there's just some adjustment, there's caution from our customers on affordability, interest rates, things that really drive some of the vehicle purchase behavior by consumers. You probably have your own prediction on interest rates. I have mine. But at some point, that should be a pressure that comes off of new car purchases and I think our customers are just watching the same things very closely, inventories versus affordability and interest rates. But I do not see this as foreshadowing of a recession of any kind.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citigroup. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Patrick Cunningham: Hi. Good morning. I'm just curious on your optimism for the Refinish outlook for the second half. Which regions do you expect to see the most meaningful growth? And how much of a role of MoonWalk and LINQ play for organic growth? And are you seeing anything in terms of data points or anything order books that gives you confidence in the underlying market growth in the back half?
Timothy Knavish: Yes, Patrick. So I'd say the biggest confidence point for us is really everywhere outside of Europe where we're really still in the very early innings of launching our productivity, digital ecosystem. We started that in Europe, gained tremendous share and customer retention and subscription revenue as we launch that across Europe. And we're still very early days in the U.S., Australia, China, places like that. So good confidence in the share gain as we roll-out those tools around the world. The collision rates or question mark depending on where you are around the world. But we believe our penetration rates of these digital ecosystem is still single-digits of all the body shops out there. So, we've still got a lot of runway. And as I said in my in an earlier answer, we continue to add to that toolbox of digital productivity tools as we go forward. So it is, of course, the chemistry inside the can, which we're best in class at from a color match and speed and all those things. So we feel really good about that. But a lot of our share gain right now is delivered by the productivity tools outside the can.
Vincent Morales: And just to get to your question on the second half of the year, just a little bit of history. Again in 2023, we had a price increase going into effect in early Q3. We had a lot of our partners buy ahead of that price increase. So as we alluded to in the prepared remarks, we had very strong Q2 and we finished last year softer Q3 given the buy ahead and that pattern reverses this year. So that order pattern from our distributors is helpful for us in the back half of the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. A two part question. You've probably bought all your titanium dioxide through the end of the year. So I understand that there's no TiO2 pressure this year for you. But with Chinese - with sanctions on Chinese product in Europe is that a structural issue that is over the next four years, are you going to be facing as a base case, reasonably higher TiO2 prices are much higher TiO2 prices. How do you think about that? And then secondly, in the quarter, your volumes and auto OEM in the U.S. contracted and I think the production grew in the United States in the second quarter, is that a temporary phenomenon for you or are you losing share in the U.S.?
Timothy Knavish: Okay. Hi, Jeff, on the TiO2, you are correct. We foresee no impact in 2024, not so much because of we're sitting on a whole bunch of inventory there, but more because of we’re contractual coverage. As we look to 2025, here's how we are thinking about it. First of all, at a very high level we continue to reduce TiO2 consumption per batch without sacrificing performance. That's about 1% per year. And even though that doesn't sound like a big number, we've been doing it for a decade and we expect that to continue. Second thing specific to the tariffs and the anti-dumping, we have great flexibility around the world given the formulation work that our S&T teams have done such that we've really increased our sourcing flexibility versus where we were, say, five years ago. And then finally at the end of the day, if those two initiatives are not enough to counter whatever net increase in costs there may be to us, we the biggest consumer of TiO2 is the Deco business by far, and we have demonstrated that, as necessary, we'll offset that cost with price.
Vincent Morales: Jeff, let me just add on here to the TiO2 question before Tim goes to the next question. Two things. One, we're not either advantaged or disadvantaged versus others in the region as it relates to this issue, so it's going to be a item for all coding users. Secondarily, not all of our production and not all of our TiO2 consumption is in the EU. We have plants outside of the EU that are not affected by the tariffs, so we still have some capability to produce with unimpacted tariff Chinese TiO2.
Timothy Knavish: And Jeff, to your second question on automotive U.S. specifically. First of all, the final numbers that just came in the last couple days, the production in the U.S. was actually down, down low single-digits in the quarter and our sales were down mid-single-digits. And so some of that would be, Vince talked earlier, the production number that S&P puts out is volume, and our sales number is volume plus price, and we did have some contractual index price in that business. And then the rest of it would be specific assembly plants, specific customer mix that might vary from the kind of the industry average.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with VRP. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Kevin McCarthy: Yes, good morning, everyone. Tim, if I look at your second quarter organic sales results versus your forecast from last quarter, it seems to me that PPG did a very good job of forecasting in maybe eight of the 10 verticals where you compete. The two that I see that came in a little bit lower are Architectural EMEA and Protective of Green coatings. And so I was wondering if you could speak to each of those businesses and maybe educate us a little bit as to why they came in a little bit weaker than you would have thought, and whether that was because of sort of transitory or idiosyncratic reasons, or do you think they're on a different growth glide path, say looking into 2025. Any additional color on geographies or product lines that would be super helpful?
Timothy Knavish: Yes, sure. Hi, Kevin. Let me do Architectural EMEA. Yes, we were - clearly the results were lower than what we expected for the region in aggregate. We had - we believed that we were - you've heard me use the term bouncing off the bottom. We believed at that time we were on the bottom and we would see sequential improvement Q1 to Q2. The macros, frankly, just got worse in Europe, and that drove Deco, that drove Auto OEM as well. But a little more color there, we're number one in 10 or so countries in Europe, and our biggest is France. I did earlier reference, you've seen the election and some of the turmoil in France that added to uncertainty, and we really did see a downturn in our sales during that period in France, our largest country. So I would say that was that one was maybe a transitory that as things stabilize, we'll see some recovery there. We're also number one, in most of the Nordic countries, which was also slower than the rest of the region, so a little bit of country mix there. On the offset we're number one in Poland and a number of the Central European countries that have started to recover. So as we think about that going forward, we do believe, we will see some sequential improvement in architectural Europe in Q3. We do believe it will still be down versus prior, Kevin, but we do think that that will start to sequentially improve. Much better story on, Protective & Marine as you know that business has really been a good performer for us over the last several quarters. We just - this is a project business. We just ran into a handful of project delay type transitory items that hit us in the quarter. You should expect growth back on track in that business starting in Q3. For example, we had slower China infrastructure spending than we expected with the local government issues with the Mexican election. Pemex was delaying some of its projects. As you know, the elections behind us now and we're seeing that pick up. We have been doing really well at gaining share in the dry dock business. We had some dry dock delays associated with going around the Cape. So just a number of things like that that we do believe are transitory, but the underlying trends for that business, for us are, much stronger than what I, what I would have described for the macro conditions for Deco Europe.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Josh Spector: Yes. Hi. Good morning. I have two questions on the cost side. I guess. First, European peer announced some contract renegotiations with its labor force that they talked about as an incremental inflationary. Is that an impact at all for PPG in the second half of 2025? And then on the other end, your corporate costs have come in better than you've got in the last couple of quarters. With the reduction in guidance, are you accruing less for bonuses for this year? And is that - sorry, a tailwind that's baked in this year and a headwind next year? If you could help quantify any of that would be appreciated. Thank you.
Vincent Morales: Yes. Hi Josh, this is Vince. With respect to the EU, that's you know, we're not involved in whatever that peers involved with. We're under our normal process in terms of reviewing our salaries, benefits on an annual basis. We did as we alluded to at the beginning of the year, have a little bit of a higher wage and benefit inflation this year versus historical given the macro, but again, we expect that to trend to normal, based on what we know today and in future years. As it relates to corporate costs, as we said in our press release, we did due to the lower guidance, for the full year we have made adjustments lower for some of our incentive compensation and that will - and these are not big, big numbers. We'll give a full year 25 guide, as we typically would do in January. We got to get through the rest of this year, before we look at the year-over-year impacts, especially line-by-line or category-by-category.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with KeyCorp. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Aleksey Yefremov: Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask about architectural EMEA pricing. Given these weaker volumes, is pricing holding up in this region? Or is competitive environment perhaps, you know, more aggressive than, than for your coatings portfolio overall?
Timothy Knavish: Yes. Hi, Alexia. You know, given the volume, challenges, you know, we have seen, what I would call, you know, kind of around the edges some price downward competitive actions that, you know, that we've had to match in order to keep, keep our business that is an outlier versus most of our coatings portfolio. But I would also tell you that it's not it's not a huge impact because there's still higher, even though, you know, folks are trying to grab volume and, you know, the raw material deflation is, you know, just not what it was earlier in the year. Us and everyone are experiencing higher wage inflation, higher employee benefit inflation than, let's say maybe a normal year. And we're not the only ones having to deal that. So I deal with that. So I think that is having some impact, whether you're talking about architectural EMEA or where maybe it is slowing down any, any you know, otherwise volume grab kind of behavior. But across the portfolio, that's enabling frankly price to hold up. And that's also enabling things like other parts of our portfolio and in performance coatings to get additional price. Because, because us and everyone else are seeing that higher wage inflation.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Leithead with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Michael Leithead: Great. Thanks. Good morning guys. With the strategic reviews on track for this quarter, presumably you'll get some level of cash in the door later this year. So is it fair to for us to assume share repurchases are currently your preferred use of excess cash at the moment, or how does the acquisition pipeline look today?
Timothy Knavish: Hi, Mike, you know, great shareholder value accretive acquisitions would always be our preferred, use of cash, whether it's from proceeds from these potential transactions or just ongoing business. That said, that pipeline is a bit thin, right now. And so, you know, we continue to look at opportunities, but overall, compared to prior years, I would I would assess it as thin and perhaps that'll change going forward. Perhaps that'll change in 2025. You know with interest rates. But right now it's a bit thin. You've seen, three quarters in a row. We've bought shares back. We're demonstrating that we're going to do what we said, which is we're not going to let excess cash, build on the balance sheet. So, you know, when those transactions are potential client transactions close, we will take, you know, look at our pipeline. And if it's still thin, then we'll deploy cash as we have in the last three quarters.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Research Partners. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Mike Harrison: Hi. Good morning. Was wondering, Tim, if you can, give us a little bit more color on what's going on in the aerospace business. You mentioned that you're selling everything you can make, but how much better could volumes have looked in that business if you didn't have the capacity constraints? And I guess, what specific actions or how much additional capacity do you think you can unlock as we get into the second half and into 2025? Thanks.
Timothy Knavish: Hi, Mike. Just to put some scale on it, our backlog. So we produced more, sold more, had record quarter in that business, and yet our backlog still grew. So our backlog is almost $300 million. So whatever you have us down for as margin in that business, if we were completely unconstrained, it would be that $300 million at our aerospace margins. But going forward from that, there is nothing on the horizon that our customers are telling us that's going to slow that in the near future or midterm, at least. In fact, we're getting forecasts from them that are even higher. So what we're doing in the short term is, I would call them incremental capacity additions, things you can do quickly, whether it's through productivity improvement or CapEx investments, both of which we're doing. But beyond that, we're assessing, do we need to do something of a larger scale? And when we're ready to talk about that, we'll let you know. But it's pretty significant backlog driven across commercial, general aviation and military, driven across transparencies, coatings and sealants and driven across OEM and aftermarket. Every one of those is getting pulled from our advanced technologies.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Favre with BNP Paribas. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Laurent Favre: Yes, good morning, all, and team. Apologies, if France made you - events in France made you miss your forecast. But I've got a question on industrial coatings pricing. On the minus 3%, can you at this impact how much of that was indexation versus the rest? And are you seeing pressure away from indexation given weak volumes? And the second part of that question is, should we assume that the indexation part is going to get worse in 2H2, or are we at the trough in terms of the year-on-year impact? Thank you.
Timothy Knavish: Hi, Laurent, I'm expecting lots of paint sales as the Olympics get going here, and then after the Olympics too as well. So I'm sure France recovery is on the horizon. The pricing in the industrial segment, virtually all of it is index pricing. I don't want to say 100%, because there's always things happening around the edges, but virtually all of it is index pricing. And I don't expect that to change significantly as we look through the rest of this year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Estok with Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Dan Rizzo: Hi, this is Dan Rizzo from Jefferies. Thanks for taking my question, thanks for fitting me in. I was just wondering, you mentioned in your prepared remarks about softness in exports from Chinese auto EVs, kind of slowing. I was wondering if there, as of yet, anticipating a change in the environment, if Trump were to take office. Like, what's the lead time between they anticipate higher tariffs and potentially lower sales and that they end and shut down or slow down production.
Timothy Knavish: Yes. So I'll start and all Trump questions I delegate to Vince. So I'm going to let Vince handle that part. But what I want to say about the EVs is, we're a proud supplier to the number one manufacturer over there and of course, they were doing quite a bit of export. And so they're being cautious right now, and we'll see how that plays out as far as their overall production numbers as we move through the year. But I do want to point out, even though - even with all the headlines on EVs happening right now or maybe in a less than positive direction, I think that's only changing the slope of the curve and not the end point destination of the curve. For 2024, even with all the news we've heard, the projection is still that EV production will grow by 14% versus last year and the production is still that 30% of every vehicle produced in China will be an EV. And of course, China produces about a third of all the world's cars. So, I think we all have to take these headlines as moderation, but not drastically story changing headlines for EV.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Arun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I just wanted to ask a couple of more questions on North American architectural and the portfolio as well. So on architectural, I think our understanding is 4% EBITDA margins for the whole group. But maybe the stores business was recently unprofitable. I don't know if that's something you can just shed some light on. And are you seeing any interest in the stores side of that as well, presumably we've heard that there's good interest on the non-stores business, but if there isn't on the stores, would you consider kind of keeping those or shutting those down or how do you proceed there? And then on the portfolio itself, as you look into 2025, presumably you won't have architectural in North America, so you will be a little bit more industrial levered. Is there any way you can kind of give us your thoughts on how we should think about that Industrial Businesses and coatings sometimes have fetched lower valuations. So, I don't know if that enters into your thinking as well. Thanks a lot.
Timothy Knavish: Hi, Arun. Let me answer the North American architectural questions. Again, I think when we announced the strategic review in February, we gave some directional information, and certainly the people who are interested and engaged got the data, books, etc., and we're providing data almost on a daily basis, and we're not going to get into the nuances of the different channels. Again, we're in a process where there's a lot of folks looking at it. They have what they need. And we're not going to certainly get into how this may or may not be split. Again, there's a multitude of different scenarios that we're entertaining and we'll let that process play out over the next 60 or 75 days or whatever. So again, we'll let that process play out. And when we get to a ultimate conclusion, I think we'll be a little more granular to answer some of your questions. And let me take a row, let me take the portfolio question. Mathematically, of course, you're spot on that X this business, we will be a little heavier in industrial coatings and a little lighter in performance coatings. But you've seen the numbers and the guidance we've given on the profitability and margin of the architectural U.S. business. And X that business mathematically and going forward, despite that shift from - that you described from less performance and more industrial, in aggregate, we will be a higher margin and higher growth company. And we wouldn't be doing this otherwise. And just to be clear, that there's also the benefit of us as a management team, as a PPG team, being able to focus all resources, whether it's human resources, R&D resources, capital resources, bandwidth resources on businesses that have higher growth and higher margin profiles. So we are fully confident that this is the right thing to do for not only customers, employees, but absolutely for shareholders going forward, fully confident.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jaideep Pandya with On Field Investment Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Jaideep Pandya: Thank you. First question is on packaging. Could you just tell us how confident are you to keep the share that you have gained because one of your competitors had a fire because we are hearing sort of opposite messages and they seem to be confident they'll get the share back. So just wondering how will packaging look in 2025? My second question is, sorry to come back to architectural North America, but looking back 10 years ago when you bought the actual business, it doesn't feel like a lot has changed in terms of either the store footprint or the plant footprint, or even for that matter the profitability. And you alluded to one point, which was a need for investment. So just curious, when you look at JV models, where do you need to invest? And how do you sort of unpack and improve profitability here because you yourself done it with Axel in the last 10 years, and sorry to say this, but it sort of hasn't worked. So what would you and a JV partner do here? Just curious. And sorry to squeeze in one more. Tim, volume growth has been an issue for PPG for the last 11 quarters. How do you incentivize your sales force to go for volume if you at all want to do that? Thanks a lot.
Timothy Knavish: Okay, Jaideep. Thanks for the questions there. On packaging, high degree of confidence that we will keep our share gains and continue to grow the share. You did mention an incident one of our competitors unfortunately had, and of course there was some things that the industry did to get through that, but we've won a lot of shares that had nothing to do with that incident. And so we are confident going forward that our technologies inside the can, outside the can, on the easy open end, our food lines, we're gaining share across a number of different spaces that had nothing to do with that isolated, isolated incidence. So, you know good news ahead for that business. JV scenario for architectural, U.S., Canada, at the end of the day there are - I've said from the beginning that we believe this business could be more successful with a partner and that partner could either buy the whole thing or do a JV. What that partner might be able to run more velocity through the high fixed cost that company owned stores brand. They might be able to bring more velocity through, whether it's other paint products or other building products in general. So that is the big issue where a JV may be able to help us from that velocity through your high fixed cost stores. In volume growth, I mentioned as we move through 2023, in the first half of 2024, that we were modifying incentive comp to drive more organic growth. We've done some of that, some of that's already in place and some of its still being implemented as we speak. And that is one element of a multifaceted recipe that we're changing to drive a higher organic profile company.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Aron Ceccarelli with Berenberg. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Aron Ceccarelli: Hello. Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I have a very quick one on, industrial coating, would be interested in understanding if you can provide some color around the monthly run rate of volumes. And I would be particularly interested in the exit rate in June, if there's any area of the business that actually accelerated or decelerated at the end of the quarter. Thank you.
Timothy Knavish: Yes. Aron, thanks for the question. So at the end of the quarter, I would say industrial segment automotive was decelerating. As I previously mentioned, we got some, uh, further shutdown news as we move through the month of June. I would say industrial starting to see, you know, pretty flat. But we are starting to see some sequential improvement that we projected into Q3. And I think packaging you know, basis the last question is accelerating from a volume standpoint. So that's how I'd quantify the exit rates for industrial segment.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the call back over to, Alex Lopez.
Alex Lopez: Thank you. Elliot. We appreciate your continued interest and confidence in PPG. This concludes our second quarter earnings call.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-04-19 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is Angela, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter PPG Earnings Conference Call. All line have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jonathan Edwards, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Jonathan Edwards: Thank you, Angela, and good morning, everyone. This is Jonathan Edwards. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG and welcome you to our first quarter 2024 financial results conference call. Joining me on the call from PPG are Tim Knavish, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Vince Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC. And now, let me introduce PPG Chairman and CEO, Tim Knavish.
Timothy Knavish: Thank you, Jonathan, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2024 earnings call. I'd like to start by providing a few highlights on our first quarter 2024 financial performance, and then I'll move to our outlook. The PPG team delivered sales of $4.3 billion, a solid sales performance despite a very challenging macroenvironment, and we delivered our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year segment margin increases. This culminated in first quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.86, which is $0.02 above the midpoint of the range that we provided in January. This is also our second best Q1 adjusted EPS in the company's history, falling just $0.02 short of the record achieved during the early COVID surge in house paint sales. Our first quarter adjusted EPS was once again up year-over-year, with moderating input costs and improving manufacturing performance, mitigated by lower sales volumes and higher wage and benefit costs. As we indicated in January, we had a large customer win last year at Walmart and a significant portion of lower volumes year-over-year was driven by this prior year $40 million load in. We're also impacted by lower demand in Europe, including the effect of fewer selling days in March stemming from an early Easter holiday this year. We also experienced ongoing tepid global industrial production. Adjusting for these year-over-year comparison items, volumes were nearly flat, continuing the underlying positive volume trajectory over the last five quarters. As I'll discuss in our outlook, I fully expect positive sales volumes in Q2. A benefit for us during the quarter was China, where despite a challenging general economy, our portfolio delivered double-digit organic sales growth, reflecting our strong mix of well established businesses in the country. For PPG, India also grew by double digits in the quarter. In addition, our commercial teams executed well and drove solid global organic sales growth in our aerospace, specialty coatings and materials, and protective and marine coatings businesses. Our selling prices were flat with positive pricing in the Performance segment offsetting lower pricing in the Industrial segment. First quarter pricing comparisons include a transitory unfavorable impact from European energy related pricing indices that were put in place during a period of extremely high energy prices in that region in the first quarter of 2023. We experienced lower energy input costs in the quarter to offset this lower index-based pricing. We expect total company selling prices to be slightly positive overall in 2024 as targeted structural selling price increases have been implemented in several of our Performance segment businesses, offsetting some index based pricing contracts in the Industrial segment. Our operations have benefited from further improvement as we experienced stable upstream and downstream supply chains and customer order patterns. From a supply perspective, the vast majority of our suppliers have sufficient or excess capacity as we continue to experience moderating input costs. This is noteworthy as we are just entering the peak buying period due to the overall seasonality of the paint industry. We also increased our growth-related investments, supporting initiatives that will deliver volume gains later this year and going forward. Building off of the full year 310 basis point improvement in total segment margins in 2023, further margin improvement remains a priority in 2024. This will be driven by stronger sales volumes as the year progresses, improved manufacturing productivity, and moderating input costs from historical highs. Specifically on manufacturing productivity, our improved operating cadence will be more financially impactful during our peak seasonal quarters as we deliver additional volume growth. In the first quarter, we delivered on our margin improvement commitment with the Industrial segment margins improving by 100 basis points versus prior year and the Performance Coatings businesses margins were also up by about 40 basis points as favorable pricing and moderating input costs were mitigated by lower volumes and higher wage inflation. From a cash perspective, we expect another year of excellent cash flow and our balance sheet remains strong, including lower inventories year over year. We'll continue to follow our legacy of utilizing our strong cash flow and balance sheet to create shareholder value. In the first quarter, we repurchased approximately $150 million of PPG stock, reflecting our commitment to use excess cash to create shareholder value. Additionally, yesterday, our Board of Directors increased our share buyback authorization by an additional $2.5 billion, bringing our total share repurchase authorization to approximately $3.4 billion. I'm pleased with the progress we've made on our enterprise growth initiatives. We executed strong growth from selling our innovative products into the mobility space and continued to further utilize our world-class distribution of 5,200 concessionaire locations in Mexico to drive additional non-architectural coatings products into one of the world's fastest-growing economies. In automotive refinish, customer adoption of our industry-leading digital tools increased, yielding nearly 400 additional net body shop wins. These digital tools include our LINQ services and MoonWalk mixing machines, both of which are best-in-class and are focused on improving body shop productivity. To date, we've sold over 2,000 MoonWalk mixing machines and approximately 2,700 LINQ subscriptions. We announced strategic reviews of the architectural U.S. and Canada business and the global silicas product business in the first quarter. Strategically, we are driving this portfolio optimization with a goal of transforming to a higher-growth, higher-margin company. As an example, excluding the architectural coatings business in the U.S. and Canada, Performance Coating segment margins would be an average of 200 basis points to 300 basis points higher than the last several years. We'll communicate a determination of a path forward on these strategic assessments when appropriate, with our target of no later than the third quarter. Now, I'll comment on our second quarter outlook. We expect to deliver adjusted Q2 EPS between $2.42 and $2.52 per share, which at the midpoint would be 10% higher than our previous record quarterly EPS. While we anticipate global industrial production to remain at low absolute levels and demand to be uneven by geography, we expect our overall second quarter sales volumes to be positive by a low single-digit percentage, aided by organic growth in aerospace, protective and marine, and our share gains in packaging coatings. We project continuing solid growth from our businesses in China, our third largest country for sales, led by our automotive OEM business where our strong positioning with electric vehicle OEM producers will drive further sales. Additionally, we expect to deliver further sales growth in Mexico, our second largest country for sales, leveraging our strong position across many businesses as well as our world-class distribution network. We are confident that PPG's unique geographic profile with strong and growing positions in China, Mexico, and India, along with stabilization and eventually modest growth in Europe, and the continued improvements in the U.S., will support PPG's consistent sales volume growth as we move forward. We anticipate overall company selling prices to be flat to slightly positive in the second quarter as the impact of index-based contracts in our Industrial segment will be offset by selling price increases in our Performance Coating segment. There's still some unfavorable pricing impact and offsetting energy input cost benefits from prior year European energy surcharges, but it's less than the first quarter. With regard to commodity raw materials, supply remains ample, and we will continue to realize benefits from moderating input costs. We expect mid-single-digit percentage raw material deflation in the second quarter following the realization of high-single-digit percentage decreases in Q1. We're watching oil price and feedstock volatility, and we will manage any impact accordingly, although we expect that recent oil price increases will be absorbed upstream. Looking at the remainder of 2024, we remain confident that we will deliver positive sales volumes in each remaining quarter in 2024, including our growth in China and India. We'll also execute on our more than $270 million and growing order backlog in aerospace, driving further growth in our well-positioned businesses in Mexico and driving expanded benefits of our key growth initiatives across electric vehicle, auto parts, powder coatings, and various digital solutions. PPG remains focused on our enterprise growth initiatives to drive higher sales volumes and fully capitalize on our technical and service capabilities. We'll drive further improvement of our operating margins aided by sales volume growth leverage and our initiatives to drive manufacturing productivity following several years of supply chain and other disruptions, and we will diligently manage our costs and continue to execute against previously approved restructuring actions. Lastly, we entered the second quarter of 2024 with a strong balance sheet, which provides us with flexibility for further shareholder value creation. Thank you to our more than 50,000 employees around the world who partner with our customers every day to drive mutual success by providing best-in-class paints, coatings, specialty materials, including productivity enhancing and sustainable solutions. Thank you for your continued confidence in PPG. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now would you please open the lines for questions?
Operator: Thank you, team. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi from Baird. Your line is open.
Ghansham Panjabi: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everybody. Tim, I know you have a lot going on across the portfolio by business and also by geography, but your guidance embeds quite a bit of an earnings improvement during the back half of the year on a year-over-year basis. So I guess just on that, can you just lay out the specifics that underlay your confidence for that dynamic to play out, especially with some of the upstream input costs, such as energy trending higher? Thank you.
Timothy Knavish: Yes, sure Ghansham. Thanks for the question. I'll tell you how I'm feeling about the full year guide here. We have a bold 10% EPS growth target off of a strong record year last year and on a very challenging plan. But we've got strong reasons to believe and we're confident in that. First of all, we've proven over the last several quarters what we can do on margins and cash. That gives us optionality. We believe that our strong volume momentum will continue. We went from minus 3%, minus 2%, minus 1%, now essentially flat, without the one-timers, we're expecting positive volume the rest of the year. I'm satisfied with where pricing is. We continue to get price and performance. We've got some indexing offsets in industrial, but I'm confident in that. We've got manufacturing momentum. We're starting to deliver on the productivity initiatives as well as some incremental volume leverage. Portfolio, we're starting from a position of strength in a number of our countries and businesses, aerospace, Mexico, China, India, PMC, automotive. We've got some share gains in the process of being launched across packaging, refinish, industrial coatings. We've got our enterprise growth strategy initiatives. And we do have some optionality, again, with capital deployment. So we feel good about the ramp between Q1 to Q2 and the second half of the year, Ghansham.
Vincent Morales: Hey, Ghansham, this is Vince. Just as we talked, strong balance sheet in our full year guide. We don't have any further cash deployment baked in at this point, as we alluded to in our press release, we did purchase about $150 million of shares in the first quarter. But our full year guide does not assume additional cash deployment at this point. In the remainder of the year we'll make those decisions on a real-time basis.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO. Your line is open.
John McNulty: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So maybe on the price versus raws dynamic. I guess can you speak to whether you expect to see your raw material basket down from 1Q to 2Q? And then on the pricing side, if we take out the indexing, which really should be kind of a net neutral, what portion of your business do you expect to see real pricing as we're pushing forward? Because it does sound like you've got a number of initiatives to push further price. So can you help us to think about those things?
Vincent Morales: Yes. Let me just do the math. This is Vince, John. Let me do the math on the pricing. Again, we had in Q1 on a year-over-year basis, European energy surcharge is really reflecting the high cost of natural gas in Europe last year. That was about $15 million on a year-over-year basis. As you alluded to, John, that was completely offset an exact pass-through in our cost of goods sold. But if you're looking myopically at the price line, that's about $15 million and we have about half of that carryover in Q2. So $6 million, $7 million in Q2. We still have an energy surcharge impact. Excluding that, I would exclude that as what would be our structural pricing. And Tim is going to answer the raw's question.
Timothy Knavish: Yes. John, thanks for the question. As far as progression from Q1 to Q2, Q1, we did say they were down high single digits, which was better than our forecast of mid-single digits. Q2, we believe, down the mid-single digits. And we're confident enough now to issue full year guide on raws being down in that low single digits to mid-single digits for full year 2024. So we've got better visibility now into what we believe that price of raws will look like for the rest of the year.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Michael Sison with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Michael Sison: Hi, guys. Nice start to the year. You talked about being confident in turning the quarter in volume growth in Q2. Maybe give us a little bit of color on how much market growth you need or macro help? And how much really just comes from your execution and maybe just some areas of growth that you're seeing in your end markets?
Timothy Knavish: Yes, Mike, first of all, it's based on a number of factors. One is the overall trend of the company particularly when you adjust for -- you got to take the Walmart load-in out. And when you adjust for that, we've been ramping. So that's one part of it. Second is we are -- we are seeing a number of the share gain wins across some of our businesses from last year, starting to launch in Q2 in industrial, in Refinish and in packaging primarily. And we've also -- we're only 16 or whatever days into the month here. And while that's just one-sixth of the quarter, we're comfortable with what we're seeing on orders and shipments thus far in the quarter. So, we're comfortable in saying that we'll be positive volume for Q2.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Diffy Fischer: Yes. Good morning. Two questions off the buyback. One I just want to clarify. So Vince, in the annual guide you're saying that there's no more buybacks that you're not even rolling through the 150 per quarter into that annual guidance number. And then maybe for Tim. If you look at the $150 million run rate, then take you over five years to eat through the program that you've now got available, how should we think about that buyback ramping going forward? What level should we put into our models?
Vincent Morales: Duffy, this is Vince. You stated it properly. We obviously purchased $150 million in the first quarter. That will obviously be impactful to the financials. We have nothing further assumed in our full year guide for the balance of the year.
Timothy Knavish: The way that I'm thinking about the additional authorization that we got from our Board yesterday is really consistent with what we've done and said over the last number of years and quarters. We said that, obviously, we're going to pay our dividend. Obviously, we're going to do what we need to do with the CapEx to grow our businesses organically. We paid down all of our high-cost debt last year. And we've consistently said that in the absence of shareholder value-creating acquisitions, we're not going to let the cash sit on our balance sheet. And we did that in Q4. We did it in Q1. So we're really sticking with that mantra. The way to think about magnitude going forward will depend on all of those factors, what's our actual leverage sitting at versus what we see in our acquisition pipeline after we've done those kind of organic things of dividend and CapEx.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
David Begleiter: Hi, good morning. Tim and Vince, in U.S. architectural, have you seen any disruption since your announcement in late February? What's the level of interest in these assets? And what's I think the most likely outcome of this review and process. Thank you.
Timothy Knavish: Good morning, David, it's Tim. We had a very, very detailed and thoughtful communications plan ahead of making the announcement on February 26 that we executed very shortly after that press release went out and have continued to execute. And we've seen very minimal, if any, disruption. There's chatter, but we've got really good talk plans out there. We're engaging our key customers, we're engaging our key -- obviously, our employees, we're engaging our owners, as you know. So a very minimal disruption to the business. The second question, we expected strong interest because of the strength of the brands and the strength of the assets in our architectural U.S. Canada business, I'm pleased to say the interest is even higher than what we expected. So that's -- we feel good right now about where we are. As far as the -- which likely outcome, David, until numbers start coming across the desk and we can start looking at what's best for long-term shareholder value creation, it's a bit early. But we want to be definitive on our path forward in Q3. So we'll have a much better view of what this structure might look like in another quarter or so, David.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Christopher Parkinson: Great. Thank you so much. Tim, you've obviously been at the company a long time, and you're making some pretty dramatic moves in the first six quarters. When you take a step back away from the North American architecture and the specialty reviews and you look at your remaining businesses across performance and Industrial. Just how confident are you versus even. Let's say, a couple of quarters ago, last year, however you want to characterize it, how confident are you that those remaining businesses are the best-in-class R&D innovators and will ultimately render above-market growth in the respective end markets over the next year or two? I mean -- or perhaps even a little longer, just has your confidence changed in the portfolio positively or negatively?
Timothy Knavish: Hi, Chris. Thanks for your very polite way of saying that I'm old at the beginning there. I feel more comfortable now than ever, that we are building a portfolio here at PPG that will have a higher growth profile and a higher margin profile. As you alluded to, we did what I would call just pruning last year of some smaller parts of our portfolio that we really did not see being consistent with our enterprise growth strategy and our performance targets. We did that last year. Obviously, Q1 this year, I announced two pretty sizable ones. Going forward, at least today, you shouldn't count on us coming out tomorrow or any time soon with another very sizable divestiture. So I'm comfortable with what's in the portfolio in -- at a high level. We will continue, however, to prove -- I'm sorry, to prune on a smaller scale and one of our mantras going forward is that every business has to earn the right to stay in the portfolio. That means, one, from a performance outlook standpoint, but two, consistent with our very focused enterprise growth strategy. I also want to add that when we talk about portfolio, Chris, it's not just about the pruning and divestitures. But we are also intending to be continued acquirers going forward just on a very focused basis for those things that meet both our performance outlook and our enterprise growth strategy.
Vincent Morales: Yes. Chris, this is Vince. If you think about the remaining portfolio, the businesses, we have the right to win in the businesses, whether it be on a regional basis or on a global basis. As you alluded to in your question, most of these businesses have strong technology associated with them. We've talked earlier in our comments about the margin profile, if absent these businesses that we're doing a strategic review on, which again would be higher on a pro forma basis. So again, the right to win, good margins, good customer pull, those are the things that we're focused on with respect to the portfolio.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Mizuho. Your line is open.
John Roberts: Thank you. Another coatings firm has suggested that you might separate North American architectural into Pro versus DIY and deal with them separately. Could you comment on that?
Timothy Knavish: John, there's a lot of theories out there from a lot of different parties. As I mentioned, the interest level that we've seen coming in is very high, higher than we expected. And not all of those parties have the same view of what we should do and what this might look like at the end. So my only comment would be, everyone should be confident that we said we were casting a wide net intentionally. Everybody should be confident that we will look at every option that comes in and weigh them and do what's best for shareholder value period. It's a little early to go beyond that, again because nothing -- no numbers have hit our desk yet.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citigroup. Your line is open.
Patrick Cunningham: Hi, Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. On the higher CapEx range for the year, what are the areas you're contemplating additional growth investment? And should we expect this to be a reasonable CapEx base for the next few years?
Vincent Morales: Yes, Patrick, this is Vince. A couple of things. One, we did have some capital spending spillover from last year into this year, just things we didn't get to at the tail end of last year. So our Q1 capital a little higher. We're also looking at additional growth-related capital spending in Mexico and also in India. But if you look, and we said this on our Q1 call or our year-end call as well, we're going to be somewhere in that 2.5% to 3%. And -- over the midterm. We still have some additional capital last year, this year, and we're catching up from COVID. So again, we're a little bit higher. We recognize that in our January call. But again, over the midterm, you should expect us to return to our normal range.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research LLC. Your line is open.
Frank Mitsch: The LLC portion is very important. So I appreciate that. Listen, I know that some of the growth you're expecting in the next three quarters for 2024 are tied to higher operating rates, volume improvement, productivity gains. But as you also indicated, you're also spending more money on growth initiatives and so forth. How do we think about the interplay between those two in terms of millions of dollars or EPS, et cetera? Any way that you can kind of frame the interplay between those two?
Timothy Knavish: Yes. Well, Mr. Mitsch, this is Tim. The net-net of the growth that we're expecting versus the investments in growth that we're making, net-net, we're expecting that to deliver the at midpoint, 10% EPS growth for the year. Those investments that we didn't just start making those in Q1, we started making those last year and a number of those will start to actually hit the P&L now coming here in Q2, Q3 and Q4. Beyond that, Vince, I don't know if you want to add any details?
Vincent Morales: No. These are -- these investments are things such as digital, as Tim alluded to, with respect to our consumer-facing businesses. Also with respect to Refinish, we're building out digital tools that increase our customer liaisons. We have other investments in COMEX where we're delivering -- we've had multiple quarters of record earnings. Our Protective business, we're adding some capacity, strong protective business. We still have some infrastructure spending that has not yet hit the books, but we're building in anticipation of that. And even in Aerospace, where we have a backlog that we -- that continues to grow, we're adding some capacity there to try to work at that backlog and get to it in a much more expedient manner. So those are examples. If you look at our overheads up, that's something where some of the growth spending is a result of that -- overhead a result of that growth spending.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Vincent Andrews: Thanks and good morning, everyone. Can we talk a bit about Refinish? And it would be helpful if you just could level set us in terms of where volumes are now versus pre-COVID levels. And I'm just -- what I'm trying to understand on a go-forward basis you're talking about volume declines for 1Q and 2Q against very difficult comps in the year ago period. So is the assessment that we've normalized volumetrically post COVID? And if that's the case, what should the algorithm for Refinish be in terms of volume and price on a go-forward basis from here?
Timothy Knavish: Yes. Vincent, Tim here. Thanks for the question. Let me kill the second part of, first, the easy part. Price, you should expect us to continue to execute on price the way we always have in Refinish, because the value proposition of the pain inside the can plus all the tools and service outside the can continues to improve. And it's such an important part of the repair, but a fairly low-cost part of the repair. So we'll continue to execute on price. In volume, Q1 was lower than we expected and if you saw the claims data for March that just came out for the U.S., in particular, were quite a bit lower than really the industry expected. The whole refinish industry loves an ice storm down in the Southeast U.S. or Southwest U.S., where they're not quite ready to handle with an ice storm, and it was a pretty mild winter, particularly down south. And so the claims in March were down significantly. That affected Q1. And frankly, we'll also carry in effect Q2 which is why we're partly why we're saying mid -- mid-single digits on sales for Q2. The other factor in Q2 is we did have a very strong Q2 last year. That said, I've spoken and Jancy who runs that business for us, has spoken to our key end users here in the last weeks and they're all saying the same thing about Q1, but we are all expecting, I would say, a return to more normal growth in the second half of 2024. So we just got to get through Q2. To your question on industry versus 2019, set March aside from a claims standpoint because it's a bit unique. Other than March, we're down low single digits, mid-single digits versus pre-COVID as an industry, but we are seeing things like mouse-driven ticking up, we are seeing more and more return to downtown areas, if you want to call it that. So long and short of it, down a bit in Q1, down a bit in Q2 because of onetimers here from a weather standpoint and a claims standpoint, confident in the second half of the year and confident for the long-term health of this business. And that's if we don't gain share, but we are continuing to gain share through our digital tools, as I mentioned in my opening remarks.
Vincent Morales: Yes. And Vincent, this is Vince. Just a point of clarification. The claim data, Tim referred to, these are industry claims, which are down again low double digits. The current reading was down low double digits for the month of March. So these are industry collision claims that set the entire industry.
Timothy Knavish: Yes. Prior to March, they were down low single digits.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Stephen Byrne: Thank you. Yes. Tim, I'm trying to get my head around why the U.S. architectural business has been just barely profitable on average for five years. Has that trend been improving? -- is there -- has there been any benefit from the Home Depot partnership? I asked because I had 1 of your store managers tell me you have to match the pricing in Home Depot, which clearly would not be good for his margins. But underlying all that, is it the number of stores? Or is it is that do you need to move to more of a concessionaire model in this business like COMEX and like [Benmore] (ph).
Timothy Knavish: Thanks, Steve. So as far as what it's done over the last couple of years, it's been a little ups and downs, but it has been below company average, and we have been investing, particularly in the Home Depot model. But why has it been at the low level of profitability over the last several years? A number of things, the macros aren't great. You've got this post-COVID hangover across the whole industry. As I mentioned, we have been investing -- and through -- you mentioned our own stores, through our own stores, that's a high fixed cost model, and you need velocity through those stores and with all the factors in the macro and in the post-COVID that velocity has decreased. Now the Home Depot Pro initiative is certainly working and gaining momentum and is positively contributing. But at this point, it's not far enough in that ramp-up curve to offset those macros, particularly what's happening on the DIY side. So the reason we're doing this now is we do have momentum in this kind of omnichannel model with the combination of the Home Depot, our stores and our independent dealers. And -- but we need a partner to make that go faster to get this to company average profitability. And so that's why we're open to a number of different scenarios for this business.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. I think in your Performance division, in the first quarter of the six categories that you look at Aerospace, Refinish, Architectural, all of them came in lower than you expected on a sales basis. And my impression is that things weakened in March globally. So if we forget the second half for a moment, is your expectation now that the second quarter is a little bit weaker than you thought it would be before as you began the years? And then secondly, as far as the share repurchase goes, I think over the past five years, your average purchase price is about $130 million. And so how do you evaluate the success? Or what are you trying to achieve in taking $3.4 billion and repurchasing your shares? How will you gauge the success of that allocation of capital?
Timothy Knavish: Okay. Jeff, thanks for the question. I'll take the kind of momentum question that you asked, and Vince can take the repo one. But -- so I mean full transparency, there were a couple of things that were weaker in Q1 than what we expected. We expected the Walmart -- lack of a Walmart load in, right? So that's the straight math. We expected some negative Easter timing impact. I would say that was higher than what we expected. And we are actually, again, it's only halfway through the first month, but we're seeing a bit of post-Easter snap back, okay? So that was worse in the first quarter, but that will be just shifting to the second quarter. Two other things. Europe was softer than we expected. And industrial production, combined with the launching of some of our share wins was weaker than we expected. So if you think about all of those and roll forward to Q2; obviously, the Walmart load-in comp isn't there. I mentioned we're getting Easter snapback on Europe, early days, but we're comfortable with what we're seeing in April. So I'm not saying it's going to have a snap back, but it's -- we don't see it getting worse. And on the industrial side, we are seeing -- we are launching a number of those share gains that we executed throughout the second half of last year, in Q2. And then finally, the Refinish factor that I just mentioned. Refinish, particularly in March, was a bit slower than we expected, but we're expecting a strong second half for Refinish.
Vincent Morales: Jeff, this is Vince. In terms of share repo, obviously, your numbers are accurate, in terms of the last several years. Again, we've gone -- if you look over a longer time horizon, there's been times where we've done minimal share repurchases for consecutive number of years. Typically, when we're more active in M&A, there's been times where we've done a large portion of share repurchases over a couple of series of years when the M&A market is not as robust, and we have excess cash or excess balance sheet capacity. When you look -- we do calculate what we think is our intrinsic value of our stock price. We do feel that with the 10% growth rate we have going forward in our estimates, there are times where it's an imperative for us to look at share repo as an option. As Tim said, we have a prioritized list of cash deployment. And again, dividend, keeping the businesses healthy with CapEx. We look at M&A and then we look at the intrinsic value of the stock based on our assessment and that's how we effectuate the cash deployment.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with VRP. Your line is open.
Kevin McCarthy: Thank you and good morning. Tim, a few questions for you on the subject of Europe. I think EMEA was 31% of your mix last year if you do wind up divesting some or all of U.S. and Canada architectural, maybe that number will rise a little bit, moving forward. And it sounds like in contrast to China and India, which came in very strong, Europe did come in weaker than you expected. So a few questions would be, A, what is driving the variance versus your prior expectation in Europe exactly? B, maybe you can provide some color on the consumer-facing businesses that you have there versus industrial. And I'm curious to understand whether rationalization of your customers' capacity is playing a role at all. We were hearing more and more about that from various chemical companies anyway. So just a little bit more color on the region there and kind of what glide path of volume you need macro-wise to achieve that positive volume growth overall for the company that you alluded to?
Timothy Knavish: Yes. Thanks, Kevin. I'll take the last one first just to kick it off here. We have not seen any significant -- I can't, frankly, think of any of our customers that have rationalized their capacity to the point that it's affecting our numbers in Europe. In Europe, I'd say the two businesses that that probably affected us the most in Q1, one was consumer facing, and that was Deco. That was slower than we expected, mostly in France and in the Nordics. We did see green shoots in the East, where we're also quite strong, so that's given us a little optimism looking forward. The second business on the Industrial segment, Automotive. Automotive was weaker than we expected for the quarter. So that gives some insights there. But as we look forward, we do -- again, early days in April, we're seeing a better order book and better shipments, we do see -- we do believe that as we talk to our customers, that the Deco business is in those hard-hit countries is bouncing off the bottom. They're not expecting it to get worse. And we do see recoveries beginning to happen in the East. And again, each individually, maybe not the largest Deco markets, but when you add them together, they're important part of our portfolio. Places like Poland, places like Romania, where we have strong number 1 positions in growing, places like Hungary and Czech. So we do see some green shoots there. So we are not expecting Deco to get worse, but we're also not naive enough to say there's going to be a huge V-shape, but we are expecting incremental improvements. And if you think about all the cost actions that we've taken on that continent, a little bit of incremental volume delivers really good leverage. Automotive. We're taking a bit of a wait and see. Also, we're not expecting it to get worse. But marginally, it's a similar story, although a very different end customer base. We are expecting modest recovery, but we're watching it closely. And at the end of the day, with Europe, this has been a benign macro environment for a decade, maybe more. But -- and our teams have shown the ability to do what they need to do from a positive mix, a positive price and importantly, a structural cost standpoint to deliver earnings and cash even in that very benign environment. So, sum it all up, Q1 was worse than we expected in those couple of businesses. We are expecting sequentially incremental improvements, which will give us good leverage and -- but we are watching it closely, and if we don't see what we need to see, we will take further structural cost actions.
Vincent Morales: Yes. And Kevin, this is Vince. I'll just add a point on architectural. As Tim mentioned, lower than our expectations in Q1, largely attributed to March. If you look at our performance through the first two months of the year, so Jan, Feb, that business was on our targets. We do feel there was a bigger Easter impact that we're seeing, again, a snapback at least early in April in that business.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov from KeyCorp. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you and good morning. This is [Ryan] (ph). I'm on for Aleksey. Just wanted to talk a little bit more about the targeted pricing you're doing in Performance Coatings. Wondering if you can discuss some of the areas other than Refinish. And then just wondering if you guys are like having some more success in recent weeks following this uptick in oil. Thanks.
Timothy Knavish: Yes. So Ryan, the question on pricing, again, we'll continue to execute as we always have in Refinish as I described. But all across performance, we deliver a value proposition that's far beyond the tin of paint. And that's what enables us to continue to offset things like wage inflation, which are higher than we expected. Things that -- offset things like logistics expenses, which are higher than we expected. And that's because we typically supply very advanced technologies in our own products, but then additional services and tools to help the customer beyond what's inside the can of paint. So we expect to get price in Refinish, you'll see incremental price in Aerospace. We expect it in parts of PMC, where we have some really good sustainable solutions for our customers that they're very interested in. And so, we really expected to see almost across the whole portfolio of Performance Coatings.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Michael Leithead with Barclays. Your line is open.
Michael Leithead : Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Question for Vince on raws and inventory. Can you just talk about where you guys are relative to more normalized raw material buying patterns? It looks like you maybe still have a few extra days of inventory. And then I appreciate you don't give free cash flow guidance. But just given your full year assumptions of raws down low to mid-singles, volume up for the full year. I guess broadly, should we still expect working capital to be a source of cash this year? Thanks.
Vincent Morales: Yes. I'll take the end of that, Michael, because our assumption is we're going to continue to work down. We have excess inventory relative to our history. We're going to continue to work that down, especially as we're in this peak production season that Tim alluded to earlier. We're probably carrying four to five days of excess inventory versus history. All of that's in raw materials. . And we've made progress. We were at 10 days at 1 point last year. So we're about halfway through our journey. We hope to take another bite out of that in Q2, a sizable bite in Q2. And then for the balance of the year, continue to be prudent in our purchases and that should generate a positive working capital on a year-over-year basis -- working capital impact on a year-over-year basis on free cash flow. In terms of our purchases, as I said, the opening -- or as Tim said in the opening remarks, most of our suppliers have excess supply, this is a market that is advantage for us, and we'll continue to push that. But again, our intention is to work down raw materials in concert with the peak season.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Laurent Favre from BNP Paribas. Your line is open.
Laurent Favre: Yes. Good morning. I had a question on China. I think you talked about growth in Q1. But presumably, this was still a quarter impacted by COVID. So I was wondering, when you look into Q2, what kind of momentum are you seeing there on the ground? Thank you.
Timothy Knavish: Hi, Laurent. Thanks. Sure, there was an impact -- some impact on COVID. But Automotive was a big driver. We expect that to continue. We're expecting double digit, high single-digit kind of growth again in Q2 from automotive. Industrial Coatings grew in China for us and we expect that to continue. Refinish, grew in China and we expect that to continue. So it's really -- we've been maybe more confident than others on China for the last several quarters and that is actually playing out as we expected. So I don't think you're going to see overnight going back to the growth rates of five to 10 years ago, but we remain confident in continuous growth in China.
Vincent Morales: Yes. And just a couple of other data points. Our Aerospace business is doing well there. The Chinese New Year brought about record travel in the country. And again, industrial activity there for our set of products and our set of businesses, we expect to remain strong.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC. Your line is open.
Arun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to go back to the volume outlook. So it looks like you're guiding organic sales to be up low single digits in the second quarter and for the full year as well. So if you look at that second quarter number, it looks like low single digits, you can have some targeted price initiatives. So should we assume kind of flat volumes for Q2? And then similarly for the full year, how are you thinking about kind of consolidated volume growth? I know you've given out some guidance by segment as well on the slides. But it would look like that you need a kind of ramp to about the low to mid-single digits on volumes in the back half. Am I reading that correctly? Or yes, maybe you can just clarify how you're thinking about volumes, how they should evolve through the year.
Timothy Knavish: Yes. Thanks, Arun. It's Tim. You're reading the second half, I think, correctly. But Q2, one adjustment, you said price up, volume flat. We're actually expecting more price flat volume up. Some of that because of what Vince talked about earlier, we still have a little bit of carryover of price negativity from that European energy cost pricing from last year. So Q2 price flat volume up and the rest of the year, I think you described it well is that we'll see volume growth momentum moving through Q3 and Q4.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Your line is open.
Joshua Spector: Yes. Hi, good morning. I wonder if you could just talk about Americas Architectural a little bit more. So excluding the loaded impact, it seems like your volumes are up slightly curious just how much of that is COMEX continuing to grow versus what you're seeing in the U.S.? And if you could help us kind of delineate in the U.S., what's going on with Pro and DIY from a volume perspective in the first half?
Timothy Knavish: Yes, Josh, actually, it's a little bit flip flop because Mexico, while it had another great quarter from a kind of sales and earnings standpoint as well as cash, the Easter impact in Mexico was more of an impact than it was up here. It's a really important holiday for our friends in Mexico. And we actually had decent performance in our architectural U.S. business versus last year and versus the kind of market. We're confident that we gained share in 2023 and we saw that momentum continuing into Q1. And all on the pro side, though, Josh, DIY remains soft, but we did see a good performance. The way we look at our Pro business now with what we're doing between our own network, our partner, Home Depot and our many good partners across the private dealer channel, we look at it in totality. And despite all the negative macros, all the negative news as recently as this week on housing, we were up low single digits for the architectural U.S. business. On the Pro -- I'm sorry, that's on the Pro side.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Research Partners. Your line is open.
Michael Harrison: Hi, good morning. I was wondering if you could give a little more color on what you're seeing in India. Obviously, you gave us some comments on what you're seeing in China. But what are some of the key markets that you're serving in India? What's your current position? And I guess maybe what stage or inning are we in, in terms of the growth potential that you see in India?
Timothy Knavish: Yes, Mike, I was just there. I just got back a couple of weeks ago and it was fascinating. I've been going to India for 25 years and there was always a lot of talk of improvements in infrastructure and public investment and growth. It's happening now. It is actually happening. It's very noticeable. If you go regularly, you will see a big difference there. A lot more cranes, a lot more highways being constructed, trains, airports. We've got a very good position there, mostly on Automotive, Industrial and Refinish and all of those businesses are growing. And we feel really good about the growth trajectory going forward. Now it is not in our top five countries today. But the reason that we've started to highlight it is, one, we do have a very good position there. And for the first time in a long time, we see real tangible industrial production and infrastructure growth on the ground.
Vincent Morales: And Mike, what's fostering that is we are seeing a significant amount of reshoring in Asia to India. The economy there is growing as robustly as Mexico. And again, that's driving that industrial activity.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Laurence Alexander: Good morning. Just one quick one. On the proposed, possible exit of the silicas North and the restructuring of the North America Coatings. How much would that have changed your volatility across your business? And I guess just going forward, I mean, you talked about M&A sort of leading to mostly focusing on higher growth, higher margin. To what degree does the volatility of the businesses you're acquiring factor in? Or just how are you thinking about that managing that going forward?
Timothy Knavish: Sure. Thanks, Laurence. The volatility, the cyclicality, the seasonality are factors, of course. But I would say the number 1 and number 2 factors are, does it improve our overall organic growth profile on a on a long-term basis for the company? And does it improve our overall margin profile? So those are our first two factors. And then if we can do it without adding cyclicality and seasonality even better. To the first part of your question, clearly, architectural U.S. Canada is one of our more highly seasonal businesses. So if we do separate entirely from that business, you can visualize the outcome there. And I would say the silicas business does have some cyclicality to it, because part of that business is tied to auto OEM production in tires, but only a portion of that business, other parts of it are tied to automotive aftermarket and tires. Other parts are tied to battery separators, consumer electronics. So I would say it will have some impact, but not enough that it's going to, I think, affect your modeling of how you might model the company in its entirety from a cyclicality standpoint.
Vincent Morales: Yes, Laurence, Vince, just a reminder, as we said in February, this has a multiple hundred basis point impact on sales volume improvement. If you do a pro forma basis. But again, looking at that for a period of time, it's not significant in terms of cyclicality.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Jonathan Edwards.
Jonathan Edwards: Okay. Thank you for your continued confidence in PPG. We want to thank you as well for good operating, so much appreciated. This concludes our prepared remarks and now -- or sorry, we appreciate your interest and confidence in PPG. This concludes our first quarter earnings call.
Operator: Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-01-19 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is Elliott, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fourth Quarter PPG Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Now I'd like to turn the conference over to Jonathan Edwards, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Jonathan Edwards: Thank you, Elliot, and good morning, everyone. This is Jonathan Edwards. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG and welcome you to our fourth quarter 2023 financial results conference call. Joining me on the call from PPG are Tim Knavish, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Vince Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and John Bruno, Vice President of Finance. Our comments relate to the financial information released after U.S. equity markets closed on Thursday, January 18, 2024. We have posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on the Investor Center of our website, ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide additional support to the opening comments Tim will make shortly. Following management's perspective of the company's results, we will move to a Q&A session. Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements, reflecting the company's current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. The presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC. And now let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Tim Knavish.
Tim Knavish: Thank you, Jonathan, and congratulations on your new role, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings call. I'd like to start by providing a few highlights on our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial performance, and then I will move to our outlook. In the fourth quarter, the PPG team delivered strong financial results, including record fourth quarter sales of $4.4 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.53. This is our fourth consecutive quarter of delivering record sales as we continue to benefit from organic sales growth. Our fourth quarter adjusted EPS was 25% higher year-over-year driven by aggregated segment margin improvement of 260 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 as we continue to be laser-focused on driving margin improvement. Our results reflect our continuing growth trends and strong execution in several of our leading and technology advantage businesses, which culminated in record fourth quarter sales in the aerospace, automotive OEM and automotive refinish businesses with strong performance in the Protective & Marine and PPG Mexico Architectural Coatings businesses. Our year-over-year sales volume trend improved compared to recent quarters, decreasing less than 1% year-over-year. We continue to experience lower global industrial production along with soft U.S. and European architectural demand, especially for DIY-related products. Notable for us during the quarter was China, where despite a lethargic general economy we achieved high single-digit percentage volume growth, reflecting our strong mix of businesses in the country. In addition, we delivered flat year-over-year volumes in Europe as we see economic stabilization in the region, albeit at lower absolute demand levels. Our selling prices were about 2% higher with both segments delivering positive price led by the Performance Coatings segment. We expect total company selling prices to remain modestly positive in the first quarter of 2024 as new selling price increases have been implemented in several of our businesses. We also benefited from further normalization of our operations as we experienced stabilization of both upstream and downstream supply chains and order patterns. From a supply perspective, the vast majority of our suppliers have more than sufficient capacity heading into 2024. We started the year laser-focused on margin recovery and the fourth quarter marked our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating segment margin improvement. And as I mentioned, fourth quarter aggregate segment operating margins increased 260 basis points year-over-year and full year increased 310 basis points. We also achieved our second key priority for the year by delivering excellent cash generation of nearly $900 million during the fourth quarter, which was up over $300 million on a year-over-year basis, leading to record full year cash generation of over $2.4 billion. We significantly reduced working capital by a total of about $600 million on a sequential quarterly basis and this includes the benefit from a partial reduction of our inventory levels. However, we still ended the year with higher inventory levels from a historical perspective, primarily in raw materials and will continue to reduce inventory in the first half of 2024. The strong cash generated drove a reduction in net interest expense by about $20 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 as we repaid some high variable cost debt during the quarter. Additionally, we repurchased $100 million of stock in the fourth quarter, which essentially offset dilution. Now a few comments on the full year 2023. As we communicated at the beginning of 2023, my priorities included margin recovery, strong cash generation and further strengthening of our capabilities to support our customers' productivity and sustainability needs, which will result in higher PPG organic growth. Coming into 2023, we had a high degree of conviction that our global business portfolio would prove resilient while anticipating a challenging economic environment, and these clearly played out during the year. For the full year, I'm proud of our team's execution against our strategic objectives as it resulted in delivery of record sales, record adjusted EPS and record operating cash flow. Our sales performance was led by continued selling price execution to offset significant multi-year cost inflation. Our year-over-year earnings growth was driven by these improved selling prices coupled with moderating input costs and cost structure reductions stemming from our cost management and restructuring initiatives. This resulted in improved margins in both segments. Our businesses delivered innovative and value-added products and solutions to our customers, and this enabled several of our businesses to set all-time annual sales records, including our aerospace, auto OEM, automotive refinish, architectural Mexico and the Protective & Marine coatings businesses. Our enterprise growth initiatives delivered about $150 million of incremental sales in the first year, including strong growth from selling our innovative products for electric vehicles, as well as our share gains in powder coatings. In automotive refinish, customer adoption of our industry-leading digital tools accelerated yielding nearly 2,000 net body shop wins. These digital tools include our Link Services and moonwalk mixing machines, both of which are best-in-class and are focused on improving bodyshop productivity. In Mexico, we further advanced cross-selling of our valued products, including protective coatings and certain light industrial coatings through the best-in-class distribution network of nearly 5,200 concessionaire locations. Finally, our strong focus on the customer drove share gains across several businesses including expansion of our architectural coatings products at Walmart. Strategically, we conducted an ongoing review of both our product and business portfolios leading to the divestiture of several non-core assets including our European and Australian Traffic Solutions businesses, along with the recently announced strategic alternatives review of the silicas product business. In a variety of cases, we also simplified and improved our product offering, allowing us to reduce complexity and drive down working capital. Finally, these actions plus strong balance sheet management resulted in record full year 2023 cash generation of $2.4 billion. So overall, we achieved excellent financial results in 2023 and are anticipating improving from this higher base in 2024. We remain confident that we will deliver positive sales volume in 2024, including benefits from China, India and Mexico. We've delivered share gains in several businesses, including auto refinish, packaging and the protective and marine coatings businesses. We will also execute on our more than $250 million order backlog in Aerospace drive further growth in our well-positioned businesses in Mexico and further expand the benefits of our key growth initiatives, including powder coatings, electric vehicle products and digital solutions. We will drive further improvement of our operating margins aided by the sales volume growth leverage and our initiatives that drive manufacturing productivity following several years of supply chain and other disruptions. Lastly, we entered 2024 with a strong balance sheet, which provides us with the flexibility for further shareholder value creation going forward, including funding organic growth initiatives, appropriate acquisitions, debt repayment and share repurchases. Now, I'll comment on our first quarter outlook. We expect to deliver sequential adjusted EPS growth from $1.53 per share in Q4 2023 to a range of $1.80 to $1.87 per share in Q1 of 2024, an increase of 20% at the midpoint of the range. We anticipate global industrial production to remain soft, and our year-over-year sales volume performance will be unfavorably impacted by the approximate $40 million non-recurring Walmart customer load-in that occurred in the first quarter of 2023. Also, the timing of the Easter holiday will shift some sales into the second quarter. Despite these difficult year-over-year comparison items, we expect our first quarter sales volume will be flat overall, aided by positive sales volume growth in our aerospace, Protective & Marine and packaging, coatings businesses. We project solid growth in our Auto OEM business in Asia Pacific, where we expect to drive solid volume growth in China, led by our strong positioning with the electric vehicle OEM producers. Additionally, we expect to deliver organic sales growth through our best-in-class Mexico distribution platform. We anticipate overall company selling prices to remain positive, as some modest declines in our industrial reporting segment related to a small portion of customer-based index contracts will be more than offset by targeted selling price increases in our Performance Coatings segment. First quarter comparisons also include declines in certain transitory European and energy-related pricing indices, that were put in place during the period of extremely high energy prices in the region. These particular price declines are offset by lower purchased energy costs for our facility. The net selling price increases, along with various productivity initiatives will serve to offset somewhat higher expected wage inflation in 2024, especially in emerging regions. With regard to commodity raw materials, supply remains ample, and we will continue to realize benefits from moderating input costs including further recognition of savings stemming from working down, our higher inventories as we progress through 2024. We will diligently manage our costs and expect to deliver manufacturing and productivity gains supported by a more stable supply chain and customer order patterns. We anticipate more moderate year-over-year earnings growth in the first quarter associated with some of the transitory items, I mentioned earlier. However, we are confident that we will deliver our commitment for full year earnings growth of around 10% at our forecast guidance midpoint. Finally, I want to thank our more than 50,000 employees for making it happen by delivering excellent 2023 financial results and positioning the company for growth and value creation in 2024 and beyond for the benefit of all stakeholders. Thank you for your continued confidence in PPG. And this concludes our prepared remarks. And now would you please open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning. Tim and Vince, do you expect total company pricing to be up in 2024? And I presume that if it is, it's a positive performance than Industrial. Within performance, are you seeing pressure from big box retailers to lower your paint prices?
TimKnavish: Hi. Good morning Dave. Thanks for the question. We will have positive company price for full year 2024. Again, to your point, largely from Performance Coatings and more targeted beyond that. As far as big box pricing, most of the big box pricing is contractual and so I wouldn't say that you'll see a significant movement in that pricing throughout the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from John McNulty with BMO. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
John McNulty: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. So, maybe a little bit more color on the raw material front. Can you speak to relative to what you reported in the fourth quarter, how much lower our raw materials that you're buying right now? Because it does look like things are held up a little bit because of FIFO and also some of your destocking. Is it just the mid-single-digit dip that you guided to for 1Q? Or is there more to it than that? And how should we be thinking about that?
Vince Morales: Yes, John, this is Vince. If you look throughout all of last year, we continued to accrue larger benefits from the moderation of raw materials. We will remind everybody raw material costs are still higher on a multiyear basis by a significant amount. As Tim mentioned, most of our suppliers have more than ample capacity, and it's certainly a focus for them to pick up more volume. We expect some incrementally better invoice benefits from raw materials, and then that will eventually flow through our P&L as we go through the year. But year-over-year, we expect some incrementally beneficial invoice pricing.
TimKnavish: Yes. And I would just add -- this is Tim, John. Thanks for the question. I would just add that fundamentally, upstream of us, it's still a pretty long environment. No issues on our end from availability and I think that's a good indicator for us as we move through the year as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Ghansham Panjabi: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everybody. Tim, I want to go back to the question that was asked earlier about pricing. As you kind of zoom out a bit, price for PPG as a whole has been up over 20% since 2021, and a lot of that is just enormity of the raw material cycle and so on and so forth, which seems to have changed significantly. Your confidence on pricing holding or being up in 2024 and maybe even beyond that. Is that based partly on the mix change in the portfolio with aerospace and so on and so forth? Or is there something unique about the industry structure now that's going to allow you to hold on to the enormity of these price increases, but raw materials doing what they're doing?
TimKnavish: Yes. Hi, good morning Ghansham. It's not a mix issue for us, Ghansham. It's more – first of all, I'm very pleased with how we've continued to hold price, even just closing out fourth quarter with another 2% increment. Again, we'll be positive in Q1, the confidence level is more because of a couple of things. One, to Vince's point earlier, raws are still quite elevated. We're talking about coming off of extremely high peaks. And so -- but they're still quite elevated from, say, 2019. So we don't see what I would characterize as massive deflation by any means. And the confidence level as we move through the year, I'll talk Performance Coatings. We -- as you know well, we get price almost irrespective there of the raw material environment, because of the unique value proposition that we deliver in performance where we're such a small part of the cost structure of our customers from a pure paint standpoint, but the value add outside of the can that we deliver is such a big significant impact on their cost structure. So that's a very different model there. And on industrial side, where maybe it is more proportionate to raw material increases or decreases, we just don't see the long supply dynamic upstream of us changing dramatically as we move through the year. When you think about, for example, China, just not having a V-shaped rebound in China is a big consumer of raws. So we expect a more moderate environment as we move through 2024.
Operator: Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Duffy Fischer: Good morning, guys. Two questions. First is cash flow as a percent of EBITDA. If you hit the midpoint of your guide this year, EBITDA should be up about $250 million. Should we expect a commensurate move in cash flow would be one, and then two, in the auto OE business, you guided to down low single-digits coming into Q4. You did mid-single digits up, again, guiding down in Q1, is that just conservatism? Because when you look at the auto numbers, it seems like auto OE should be better than that unless there's some pricing in there. So can you just talk about what you're seeing in auto OE for Q1 price versus volume?
TimKnavish: Yes. Duffy, this is Tim. I'll do the auto one. I'll let Vince do the cash versus EBITDA one. Auto had a really good year for us last year, and we are well positioned for what we view as a multiyear recovery. So I personally continue to be bullish on auto as we look into the full year 2024, when you look at our Q1, and we went from up mid-single digits in Q4, and we're projecting low single-digits down in Q1, a lot of that, if you go back to last year, we were a strong double-digit up in Q1 of 2023. And also, yes, there is some, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we do have some of our index pricing rolling back and that has some impact. But I would not -- personally, I'm not overconcerned about auto volumes as we move through the year. I think total builds were 89-point-something last year. I believe there is some incremental upside to that as we move through 2024. Our share position is good. Our China auto position is really good. And as you know, out of the 90 million new builds, about 30 million will come out of China. So overall, feeling good about auto. There's a little bit of a year-over-year comp soft point and a little bit of index pricing rolling off in Q1.
Vince Morales: Just to add, as we talked several times, Duffy, on auto, acceleration in China helps us from an EV perspective as well. So we have more content on any traditional EV than we do otherwise. So that's proper for us in PPG in particular. To your cash flow question yes, I think the short answer is typically EBITDA would certainly serve as a proxy for cash flow, plus or minus. We have the last couple of years, expanded answer is we have the last couple of years had working capital movement that has either helped or hurt the cash flow on a transitory basis. We do have, as Tim alluded to in his opening comments, probably a couple of hundred million dollars of excess raw materials in inventory. We're going to work that down in 2024. So that will have a cash flow implication for us in a positive manner. But I think generally, what you're saying in EBITDA and cash flow should be the movement should be consistent.
TimKnavish: Yes. And Duffy, this is Tim. I'm going to come back with one additional -- Vince mentioned the EV situation. And we all see the headlines on EVs, but that's largely U.S. and Europe right now. And as you know, two-thirds of the world's EVs are made in China, and that content number, if you look at the average PPG content across the EV space for 2023, was up by 20%. So our content per EV built was up by 20% in 2023. So that bodes well for us as well. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Byrne with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Stephen Byrne: Yes. Thank you. You've been involved in this partnership with Home Depot for a long time. I'm curious to hear your view whether it's going better or worse than what you had expected? And any potential for inflection in that in that relationship in 2024. And if you don't mind, can you just comment on SG&A for 2024? It seemed to really jump in the fourth quarter, were there some unusuals in there like with your strategic actions? Any comments on that, how should we forecast that going forward? 
TimKnavish: Yes. Hi, Good morning, Steve. There was -- the quick answer on your second question is there were some unusuals and Vince will take that. But your first one, the Home Depot relationship and progress on the Pro program is going as expected. Quite frankly, the challenge that we have is that as it's growing off relatively small denominator, as you know, it's still being offset by the challenges on the DIY side. DIY is still the Home Depot and the Glyndon brand and Olympic brands are still a critical part of our DIY omnichannel strategy going forward. And unfortunately, the negatives there from a volume standpoint are offsetting the good progress that we have on our Pro omnichannel between the Home Depot and our own network. If I look at -- just to give some perspective, so Q4, despite the challenges out there, we were up low single digits on our Pro omnichannel. And our sell out with the Home Depot was one of our better quarters yet. So we're making progress there. But our DIY omnichannel, which includes not only what we do with the Home Depot, but also our big partner in the Midwest, our DIY remain down. So that's the issue there, but the momentum continues to grow. It's -- as I've said many times, we are building a business model for the future. That's brick-and-mortar light and it's a marathon, not a sprint, and we continue to tick off miles on the marathon. So good progress. 
Vince Morales: Yes, Steve, on the overhead, I'm going to just look at the whole year, there's always movement between quarters within a year. But on a full year basis, our overhead was up about $380 million. About a third of that is directly correlated to the increase in sales, whether it be volume, price, or FX. So, on a percentage basis, if you just do the percent's comparison, you get about a third of that directly related to our sales movement. Another third of that on a year-over-year basis, and then Tim alluded to this in his opening remarks, we did have a higher shareholder based and performance-based compensation and the reminder that in the prior year, we had much lower compensation. So, kind of a doubling effect on a year-over-year basis. And the final third roughly $100 million or so of inflation and the remainder of that would be growth initiatives for some of the key programs we won throughout the year and including our Comex growth, et cetera.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Roberts with Mizuho. Your line is open, please go ahead.
John Roberts: Morning. Is your China strength primarily China for China? Or is it the strong exports of cars that we're seeing out of China?
TimKnavish: Yes, hi John, it's both. But I mean the vast majority of the vehicles that we paint in China stay in China. The exciting part on the export side is the largest producer EVs now in the world, a Chinese producer is beginning to export. So, that will just be incremental upside but the vast majority of the cars that we paint in China stay in China.
Vince Morales: Yes. And John, I think for our book of business, again, 2023, especially at the beginning part of 2023, it was a tougher year. We're starting to see industrial and some of our other businesses kind of turned the corner in the fourth quarter and now heading into 2024.
John Bruno: One more John from John Bruno, outside of auto OEM, a very high percentage of the coatings we sell in China or for products that stay in China. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Josh Spector with UBS. Your line is open, please go ahead.
Josh Spector: Yes, hi. Thanks. So, I wanted to follow-up on industrial pricing. So, when you're talking about down modestly for the first quarter year-on-year, maybe it's 50, 100 basis points, I guess, in the frame of that, does that is it stabilized at that level through the year? Or do you expect it to decline? So, kind of, separating the energy give back from maybe some of the index pricing. And I guess when you look at this longer term then, what does this mean for margin potential for the Industrial segment? Are we looking at more normal incrementals from here to price raw still play into that? Or what are the factors that maybe move the margins up from the current level beyond this year? Thanks.
Vince Morales: Yes, Josh, let me start, and I'll let Tim add some color here. But we did -- I just want to remind people -- and again, we talked about this in opening comments in our prepared remarks we released last evening. Just a reminder, Q1 last year in Europe, there was exceedingly high. Energy costs, natural gas costs were $30 to $40 per MMBtu depending on the day. Most companies, PPG included invoked surcharges to pass those through that. We're lapping that in Q1 of this year. That is a third to half of our price decline in the first quarter in the Industrial Coatings segment. And the remainder is organic based on the indices that Tim was talking about. Tim you have some color here?
TimKnavish: Yes, I think the question about margin expansion beyond what Vince described in pricing is the volume leverage will be significant on the industrial segment because that's the segment that really got hit the hardest during COVID and COVID recovery and so we've still got significant margin upside driven by volume leverage. The other side, if you go back to our CEO Day in May in New York, we pointed to about $150 million to $200 million of manufacturing productivity gains that we had line of sight to in the coming years, really, not just to get back to where we were pre-COVID, but also as we modernize, automate, digitize our operations. So those will really be the two levers that get us to the next horizon on margin largely across the industrial segment, but somewhat also in the Performance Coatings side.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with VRP. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Kevin McCarthy: Thanks and good morning, everyone. Tim, would you elaborate on your volume outlook that's embedded in your 2024 guide? Would you expect volumes to be flat or up a little bit? Part of the reason I ask is we've seen many chemical companies suffer from volumes that are trending well-below real GDP. And so as you look across your portfolio and survey and forecast, do you think we'll see convergence in 2024? Or are there pockets of residual destocking or other headwinds that might make that more ambitious?
TimKnavish: Yes. Hi, Kevin. So first of all, we're going to have positive volume in 2024 for the year. I would – our sales, we said, are going to be up low single digits, we might have to start putting a fourth letter there because I think the – I'm sorry, the volume will be a little higher on the low single-digit side and the price will be a little lower on the low single-digit side. But we have volume momentum for really five quarters now, minus three, minus two, a little lighter, minus two, our fourth quarter. We rounded it up to minus one. It was actually less than minus one. We're looking at a zero for Q1. And that includes the impact of the Walmart load in. It includes the shift from of Easter from one quarter to the next. So we have momentum on volume, some of it just because of the diversity of our portfolio and where we participate, but some of it because of the growth initiatives that we've worked on throughout 2023, where we've picked up share that will start to kick in this year. I think about our packaging coatings business, our Industrial Coatings business, our refinish coatings business. So it's really the positivity on volume is one even though they've had negative numbers in front of them for much of 2023, we do have volume momentum. We see it flipping in early 2024. And it's a combination of strength of our portfolio positioning and execution on our growth initiatives.
Vince Morales: And just a couple of other items of note, Kevin, we expect Europe to stabilize, which really reflects a lack of a destock. We experienced a destocking, especially in the first half of 2023, and that's -- we feel that's won its course. So stabilization in Europe, which has been a negative for us. And again, China on the 2023, first half basis was light. So again, as that normalizes the pandemic effect of that hopefully is behind us. And as that normalizes, provides us with some uplift. And we are -- we do have this backlog that Tim alluded to in the opening remarks in aerospace. So we continue to produce more products at our manufacturing sites and that we expect that to continue to grow throughout the year to work down that backlog, which is more than a half a year backlog for us.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Leithead with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead. 
Michael Leithead: Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask around cash deployment. Your net leverage ended the year towards the lower end of where it's historically been. I guess, three very brief questions. One, can you just remind us roughly what target leverage you intend to maintain? Two, how does the M&A market look today, say, relative to returning more cash to shareholders this year? And then third, I think you're guiding to $15 million of interest in 1Q, but about $95 million for the year. So why does that step up so much? I'm assuming that takes into consideration of more cash deployment. Could you just help clarify that? Thank you.
TimKnavish: Yes. Hi. Mike, it's Tim. I'll start. Target, we don't write a target in pen because it changes with time, depending on where we are in the execution of our strategy. We're doing some portfolio things. You've seen some announcements in that regard. And where we are on our strength of our balance sheet, very strong right now, but it would be different as the environment changes. M&A, it has -- it was a little quiet there for some time. We're seeing some things come across our desk now. Nothing huge in the pipeline, but we're seeing some assets come across, and we're evaluating those. Overall, on the strength of the balance sheet and deployment, consistent with what I said throughout last year, number one, we're going to focus on continuing to generate strong cash. That gives us a great deal of flexibility. I'm very proud of what the team did in 2023. Just to be very clear, we will not let cash sit on the balance sheet. We'll do what we need to do from dividends. We've got some good organic growth investments that we'll invest in. Love to do some shareholder value accretion -- accretive acquisitions. And if that doesn't come along, then we'll return cash by buying shares. We did some in Q4 for the first time in a long time. And if we've got excess cash sitting on the balance sheet, you can be assured that that's what we'll do. Now Q1, we're sitting with a lot of cash right now, but we typically consume significant cash in Q1. And so we'll be a little cautious here in Q1 so that we don't get back into paying high interest cost debt, which we just got out of. But beyond that, you should expect us to not let the cash sit there.
Vince Morales: Yes. Let me just add. This is Vince. I just want to reemphasize the key comment Tim said, we prefer a strong balance sheet. Due to the optionality, it gives us on many fronts. We feel where we are today. We don't need to let cash grow. We will consume cash through April. That's our traditional seasonality of our businesses. So the $1.5 billion that sits on the balance sheet, we will consume them through April. That allows us to not enter the debt markets as significantly as we normally would for commercial paper. At this time of the year, we're typically adding commercial paper throughout -- from now through the end of April. So that's why our interest cost in Q1 will be lower, because we're going to use the cash on hand to fund that seasonal inventory build. That cash will then what we typically generate strong cash in the back half of the year, which is we'll deplete our interest income. And then, as we generate that strong cash in the back half of the year, we'll look at other uses.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. I was wondering whether you could comment on the direction of titanium dioxide prices. Secondly, you make a fuss over the difference between or you make a plus over your LIFO inventories. So if you would value things on LIFO instead of FIFO? What might the difference have been at the end of the year? And then finally, in your accounts payable and accrued liabilities line, your year-over-year increase that is a benefit was about $380 million. And sequentially, maybe it was $250 million. Now you guys don't disaggregate accounts payable from accrued liabilities. Can you explain what's going on there and that many, many companies had much lower accounts payable this year, and it seems to have really worked in the other direction for you?
TimKnavish: Hi Jeff, it's Tim. I'll take titanium dioxide question. And Vince, you can take the more finance-related questions there. TiO2, we see very good availability. We see a long supply chain upstream of us, it's still quite long. And so we're seeing some modestly lower pricing on TiO2 than what we would have seen last year. It's not down as much as some other parts of our basket, but it's definitely down from where we were last year, Jeff. And on TiO2, in addition to pricing, I do have to mention that a key part of our strategy is to continue the research work that we do to reduce our titanium dioxide content in our formulas every year without sacrificing any performance. And our team has done a great job there. We're down about 1% per formula over the last several years, and we achieved that again in 2023.
Vince Morales: Yes, Jeff, on the balance sheet questions, I'm not going to be able to calculate the FIFO, LIFO impact on the fly here. We can just a reminder everybody, we're at 75% or so FIFO, the difference between, again, the invoice cost and what we're realizing on the income statement for raw material moderation that is tens of millions of dollars, if we move that to a FIFO. I can't calculate it precisely. As it relates to payables, for us, we had a couple of items in the fourth quarter. Our tax provisioning is about $100 million higher. We ended the year on a weekend, two-day weekend. So our accounts payable is higher because of that. There's natural FX in that number on a year-over-year basis. And we had, as you saw, an environmental special for about $30 million where we accrued $30 million for future environmental spending. And we talked about the compensation increase in the fourth quarter. So, those are the big elements in our payables on a year-over-year basis.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you. A few quick ones from me. In the first quarter, I get the timing shift of Easter, but February also had an extra day this year. So does that not offset the Easter impact and then also on TiO2, how much Chinese TiO2 are you guys buying these days? And how much of it is in Europe? And have you changed any purchasing patterns as a function of the EU's investigation to Chinese imports? And then lastly, the Pro architectural business has been holding up an awful lot better than the DIY, just in a similar fortunately, far enough away from COVID now that I think we should be able to have a conversation about what's driving the DIY weakness other than just a pull forward of volumes. And what's keeping the Pro business so high or so strong because it just seems like there's a disconnect between sort of pro demand being there, but DIY being so weak. So if you could help with those three things, I'd appreciate it.
TimKnavish: Okay, Vincent, this is Tim. On the Q1, yes, I'd say correct. There is an extra day in February. I think the negativity of Easter impacts that more significantly in 1 day because particularly some parts of the world, Europe, vacations before, some vacations after other parts of the world. We do have Easter time is typically a good month for us in Mexico. And so it's more significant than the one day. But you are correct. Also on Q1 though, we have in addition to the Easter impact, you do have that customer load-in that we mentioned and the energy pricing issue that Vince mentioned earlier. On the pro DIY, first of all, DIY remains down? And yes, some of it, I don't know if we could put a time stamp exactly on it, but some of it, you could call it COVID -- post-COVID hangover, as people did a lot of pull forward, I think now it's more general inflation, and general consumer spending and confidence on remodeling at home. And some of it is existing home resale too. Where sellers -- DIY sellers will paint their house, DIY buyers will paint their house. So I do think some of it is related to what's happening with existing home sales as well. But I do think it's some combination of that and just overall inflation and how it's hitting the average consumer's pocket book and the decisions that they're having to, make. On the Pro side, does remain strong. We do see some areas of weakness, again, in things like existing home resale, some of that's done by Pros as well. But we see strength in commercial strength and maintenance. And I think that's why it's holding up well. And that's not only a U.S. phenomenon, that's a phenomena that we see in Europe as well.
Vincent Andrews: TiO2?
TimKnavish: TiO2 Europe, I'm sorry, I missed that element. Yes, the TiO2 Europe, we're watching this process very closely. A couple of things, we have not dramatically shifted. We do buy a good bit from the Chinese TiO2 suppliers. They're an important part of our supply portfolio. And we're watching this process in Europe. We think, number one it will be a very lengthy process. Number two, we have -- we're constantly working on the diversity of our supply base in TiO2 and the flexibility of that supply base. And we've made significant improvements there and where else we can use the various TiO2 from different parts of the world, including China. And again, we continue our longer-term initiative of reducing our dependence solely on TiO2 by removing it from our formulations without sacrificing performance. So those three things I would point to. Again, we're watching it very closely. And we'll adapt. And I'm confident that the between the upstream supply being in a long situation. And the diversification work that we've done, we'll do what we need to run our business.
Vince Morales: Yes. And just to expand on that diversification capability, we continue to add slurry capabilities around the world, which allows us to mix different TiO2 suppliers products and efficiency, we're at a multiyear, 6%, 7% of efficiency in TiO2 in the last four or five years. And we have very active projects continuing to become more efficient. Some of those could be recognizable in terms of our -- the breadth of our buy.
Operator: Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Frank Mitsch: Good morning and congrats on the new role, Jonathan. I wanted to come back to the volume questions. Tim, it sounded from your answer that flattish in Q1, basically, but you would expect as we progress through the year Q2, we'd probably see positive volumes. It sounded like that. I was wondering if you could clarify that. And Vince, when you mentioned Europe stabilizing, which is obviously a positive sign. But if I think about math of Europe deteriorating in the earlier parts of 2023, if it's stabilizing at these low levels, it might suggest that 2024, the net would be negative in terms of volume. So I was wondering if you could speak to that. And also any sort of comments you have with respect to -- I know you indicated that China, you anticipate positive volumes there, particularly with the weak comps. But what you're expecting in the Americas as well would be fantastic.
TimKnavish: Okay. Hi Frank, I'll start. It's Tim. I think your interpretation of my volume comments are spot on. Positive -- positive volume for the year, flattish in Q1, and then you should see an up-tick soon thereafter. So I do think that's spot on. I know you asked Vince to your question. I'm going to give a quick lead in on Europe, despite the very benign 2023 volume environment in Europe, we had a record year of earnings in 2023 in Europe. So yes, it does impact the top line, but our team has really executed well and we had all-time record earnings and also, it's not all of our businesses in Europe. We have -- Arrow is very strong in Europe. Auto had a better-than-expected year in Europe. And frankly, we do expect that to continue. It's really mostly around the deco the Deco market, particularly the retail deco market in Europe that saw negative volume. And PMC, PMC had a great European year with -- particularly driven by both protective and marine aftermarket. So I'd give that lead into Europe and hand it over to Vince.
Vince Morales: Yes. When we say Europe stabilizing in Europe, Europe stabilizing in volumes for 2024, we're looking at it quarter-over-quarter, Frank, and I know as you know, we're a very seasonal business there in our Deco our architectural coatings business. So each quarter, we expect that stabilization respective to the last prior year quarter. So again, on a full year basis, we expect that to be flat, reflecting that year-over-year comp quarter-by-quarter. Again, our view of China is a bit different, I think, than what most markets are seeing. We always have to remind folks, we do not have a large architectural presence in China. One of the heaviest unfavorable items in China is the construction and housing market, very little exposure for us. Again, we're turning the corner on industrial. Auto is growing. Our refinish business is returning in China, because of higher miles driven and aerospace is starting to come back. So our mix of businesses in China helps us. And again, the fact that we don't have that architectural content. The architectural industry draws a lot of raw materials as well. So the fact that, that's down is supportive of our earnings in China.
TimKnavish: And the last part of your question, what are we seeing in the U.S. relative to volume? We've got the PMC business, mostly on the P side, the protective side, doing well in the U.S., driven a lot by energy spending and infrastructure traffic with infrastructure spending will be stronger this year. Refinish doing very well. And auto, the U.S. SAAR is holding up very well. I know inventories have ticked up a bit, but they're still only at about 40 days. So those would be on the – and of course, Aero, we're selling everything we can make. So those would be on the positive side of the U.S. ledger. The negative side, again, we've said DIY multiple times, we do expect at least the first half of this year, to be soft there. The only upside there might be that we do believe destocking in that space is behind us. And then finally, I would say general industrial coatings driven by just industrial activity, and this could be all kinds of widgets that get painted. That's still a bit soft in the U.S. So that's a bit of a positive and negative ledger here at home, Frank.
Operator: Our next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov with KeyCorp. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Aleksey Yefremov: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Can you just provide an update on your strategic efforts to broaden the product lines with Comex, where are you versus your goals? How -- what are your plans for 2024? And maybe broader any update on other strategic organic growth initiatives that you talked about last year?
TimKnavish: Yes, sure, Lexi. So in PPG Comex in Mexico, we said in May, 1 of our key initiatives was to continue our robust performance and growth in the Deco space, and the team did that another record year, double-digit sales up on the year, but also to introduce other parts of our portfolio to that strong concessionaire network. And we've done that. Protective Coatings were up, let's call it, very high single-digits. Adding again adding that fourth letter, but traffic sales were up double-digit. And I just returned, we just had all of our concessionaires together this past weekend and I was down there meeting with them, and they're very bullish on their ability to sell not only Deco, but these protective traffic, powder, light industrial coatings. So we're off and running. We just literally on -- I believe it was Monday of this week, introduced powder brands and refinish brands that are specific and dedicated and exclusive to the concessionaire network and that got a very good reception. Your other question on the initiatives that we kicked off last year as part of our enterprise growth strategy, I'd say, I am very pleased with the first year of execution of that enterprise growth strategy. As we said in the opening remarks, those initiatives, just in the first year, generated about $150 million of incremental sales. And some of those initiatives are longer-term initiatives than others and still in development. So between powder films, the Mexico opportunity that we just talked about, EVs up 20% content per vehicle. They're all up and running and I'm very pleased with the progress that we have seen so far.
Vince Morales: And if I could just add a little broader commentary, we talked in May about being bullish on the Mexico economy. I think that has come through in space for us in the region. We continue to see reshoring of industrial activity into Mexico. We'll support that with our industrial companies. We'll support that certainly with our Comex brand. In addition, one of the things we haven't Tim alluded to it on the opening comments, but we haven't talked about in the Q&A, a second economy for us that's well outpacing most other regional economies is India. And we've got a good position in India as well, and that's supported by I'll call it reshoring into India or shoring in India that is just starting.
Operator: Our next question comes from Laurent Favre with BNP Paribas. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Laurent Favre: Yes, good morning. In the presentation, in the list of watch out, you've mentioned the Red Sea situation. And Tim, I was wondering if you could talk about, I guess, how you're looking at the risks there in terms of ability to source impacts on costs. Have you seen anything on that side yet? And on the flip side, on the positive or potential positive, there's such a thing? Could it be a reason for a bit of a restocking along the chain in your customers? Or is it just not big enough of the deal right now? Thank you.
TimKnavish: Yes. Laurent, it's really not been anything near material to us to this point. First of all, from our direct products, paint and coatings don't do very well shipping around the world. We're mostly local for local. So minimal impact on our direct products. Our suppliers, we have -- our suppliers have plenty of capacity. There's plenty of inventory upstream of us. And our suppliers are seeing some delays but they're accounting for that in their production planning and in their logistics planning. So we're not expecting any impact to us there to the financial impact. We've seen a few minor small surcharges being implemented, but frankly, to this point, pretty insignificant. So the piece that we're watching and the reason we listed it on that part of our slide, was we're not certain of the impact on customers particularly if you think about European auto OEMs where they've got sourcing from around the world. And if they're missing any critical parts, it may impact production scheduling, we have seen none of that so far. That's really the piece we're watching more of a customer impact than on any internal impact. To your restocking, maybe I doubt that we'll see any significant inventory build of paints and coatings as a result of this. I think it will be more a movement of inventories upstream of us and how our suppliers deal with deal with their own logistics planning. But again, the fact that they're pretty long right now, we're not expecting any issues. 
Vince Morales: And Laurent, just to put numbers to it. Typically, the average delay to do to not going through the Red Sea about 10 to 12 days. So certainly, plan -- we can plan for that on our raw material purchases.
TimKnavish: And Laurent, one more for me. We have nothing in the guide for the first quarter for this area
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick Cunningham with Citigroup. Your line is open Please go ahead.
Patrick Cunningham: Hi. Good morning. Just on auto refinish. It seems like there's maybe some normalization there. So I guess my first question is what's causing lower collision claims in the U.S. Is there anything structural you can point to like balance of total vehicles trending upwards? And how should we think about the outlook for Refinish for the full year by region? 
TimKnavish: Yes, I'll take this one. Refinish had a good year, a record quarter, and that was off of tough comps. Yes, claims still down in the U.S., still down versus 2019. But we're able to achieve our results even at that level. And what I'll tell you is body shop activity is up and strong. And the only thing -- most of our body shop customers have backlogs, driven mostly by labor availability. So even though claims are down and we watch that closely, we're still performing. I would also add, largely because of our digital tools, we had a really good share gain year and even the revenue that we get from those digital tools was up more than 100% year-over-year. So, we feel good about that moving into this year. We've got a good order book as we sit here today. So, yes, we are watching claims and mouse driven. The only thing I can hypothesize is that the type of driving is maybe a bit different. Most downtowns and cities are still not as crowded as they used to be. We see more claims coming from suburbia than we used to. But overall, we feel positive about this business moving into the year. I'm confident in our best-in-class productivity, value proposition, we're winning shops. So, I would say we expect to have another really strong year out of our Refinish business.
Vince Morales: Yes. And then regionally, we expect the U.S. and Europe to hang around 0 plus or minus for the year. As we said earlier, we expect China to grow as we see kind of a reopening on a full year basis there. So, that's the regional aspects. And just again, to hit on Tim's comment about our digital tools, these are tools we think are best-in-class. We have body shop productivity focus on those tools. And those are a subscription model for us that didn't exist three or four years ago.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Sison with Wells Fargo. Your line is open, please go ahead.
Michael Sison: Hi guys. Good morning. I guess just one question, Tim, when you think about the -- achieving the 10% EPS growth at the midpoint, can you sort of break down sort of the key drivers? I know you talked about volume growth quite a bit. Is that low single digits, kind of half, a little bit more? Maybe how much is deflation and anything else that sort of gets you to that 10%? Thank you.
TimKnavish: Yes, Mike, I guess we'll both have a little bit of extra time this weekend. So, we won't be glued to the TV screen based on last week's results. So, wish you the best for that. We'll have some -- it's a number of things. We'll certainly have positive price, as I mentioned earlier. We will have higher low single-digits on volume, which will bring not only the benefit of margin dropping, but we will get better leverage out of our manufacturing assets by finally starting to get positive volume. We'll have a manufacturing productivity that will be a piece of that. We do expect -- even though it's a bit early to say what will happen on raws in the second half of the year, we do expect price net inflation to continue to be a good guy for us. And beyond that, I just answered some of the enterprise growth initiatives that we talked about. Those things will start to -- some of the have already started kicking in with that $150 million that I mentioned, but we'll see continued momentum on those enterprise growth initiatives. Additionally, we got cash deployment. We haven't talked about that -- we certainly didn't talk about it as we were rebuilding last year and paying down debt, but that will be another piece of the equation that wasn't there last year.
Vince Morales: Yes. And Mike, just I think it's important, a midpoint of 10%. Our operating results are going to be better than that. We do have some tax headwinds like most companies will have as some of the tax rates around the world move up. So, we guided to a higher year-over-year tax rate. So, operating results above 10%, offset modestly offset by this tax – a higher tax rate.
Operator: Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Dan Rizzo: Good morning. This is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. Thank you for squeezing me in. Obviously, the focus is on China for a good reason, but I was just wondering what India in terms of sales versus China? And if there's any time in the coming years where India will be competing in terms of importance versus China?
John Bruno: Hi, Dan, this is John Bruno. I can take this. Most people know India has been one of the best economies in the world in 2023. We have a really good position there. We have a JV with Asia Paints. Our sales growth was circa 10% in 2023, and we expect continued good growth in 2024.
TimKnavish: Yes. Our partnership with Asian Paints in India is fantastic and continues to perform very well. And across the same segments that were really strong in the rest of the world, which are doing well over there, automotive OEM, automotive refinish, industrial coatings, protective coatings. So that partnership is really world-class and helps us take our global technology advantage solutions to someone and partner with someone that's best-in-class within India. And so it's a really good story for us, not only in 2023, but going forward.
Vince Morales: And again, going forward, as I alluded to earlier, again, there's a multitude of industries that are establishing or expanding their footprint in India, electronics, automotive, some aerospace. So again, a multitude of global industries that are expanding their footprint.
Operator: Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Arun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the strong results in 2023. So just a question on the guidance. So if I look at the sales guidance, it looks like you are hoping to get to low single-digit organic growth in 2024. Just wanted to confirm that, that would be also including low single-digit volumes, and if so, how do you see that kind of playing out cadence-wise through the quarters, if you're guiding to flat volumes you get to maybe 2% to 3% in Q2 and then mid-single digits in the back half. And similarly, on the earnings growth bridge, your guidance kind of implies 1% growth EPS in Q1. So that would require low double digits in Q2 through Q4, maybe something in the order of 13%, is that the right way to think about it that really some of these onetime items in Q1 holds back your growth and you get more into the low single digits to mid-single digits on sales to Q2 to Q3, Q4 and maybe low double digits to mid-teens Q2 through Q4 EPS growth? Thanks.
Vince Morales: I think the math you have, Arun, is definitely accurate. We talked a lot on the call already about factors that affect Q1, some comparable factors last year, et cetera. Again, we're a seasonal business for us, Q2 and Q3 are very large quarters for our Deco architectural businesses. They're very large, even larger for our traffic businesses. So again, we'll see a pickup in those businesses seasonally, but we're also expecting some different volume tenor than we had last year in those businesses. Tim went through, I think, a laundry list of items earlier that included the leverage on those higher volumes. We also would expect improved manufacturing that we've been working on, and we alluded to in our May CEO update that manufacturing should grow throughout the year. So again, I definitely agree that Q1 on a year-over-year basis, up modestly, but the back half of the year, we expect to grow in terms of a size.
Operator: Our next question comes from Aron Ceccarelli with Berenberg. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Aron Ceccarelli: Thanks and good morning. I would like to go back to the topic of raw materials cost for a second. Your guidance has been improving throughout 2023. You were guiding down high single-digit in Q3 to Q4. When I look at Q1 2023, your raw materials costs were still slightly inflationary. So why are you guiding just for mid-single-digit decline now? What has changed, if anything? Because when I look at gross margin, it expanded 450 basis points year-over-year in Q4. It looks to me this is accelerating. So what is driving this mid-single-digit guidance for Q1, please? Thank you. 
Vince Morales: I think as we alluded to earlier, we do expect sequential improvement in the moderation of raw materials Q4 to Q1. And the mix of business for us as we build inventories. And we deplete inventories in Q4. We're building inventories in Q1. So that has a factor. But again, for the full year, we still expect moderation further moderation of raw materials for the full year 2024 versus 2023.
Operator: Our final question today comes from Jaideep Pandya with On Field Investment Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead. 
Jaideep Pandya: Thanks. Maybe it's not relevant, but given how low volumes are across the value chain, could you tell us like what is the spare capacity you have? I'm basically asking this question because a lot of investors are wondering if the margin growth left in the coating sector beyond 2024 and given that it looks like in 2025, 2026, growth will come from volume. Just wondering what is the spare capacity you have in the system these days? That's my first question. The second question is really around raw materials. Do you expect to buy in sync with your volume growth this year? Or would you still destock? And therefore, if your volume growth is, let's say, up 2%, we shouldn't really expect raw material purchasing to be upto should be maybe zero. And the last question really is on Marine protective. You alluded to firefighting protective – one of your competitors is very strong in that area. So have to launched new products and therefore gaining share from that competitor or is that a market is just doing very well? Thanks a lot.
Tim Knavish: Okay. Let me take those on, Jaideep. Its Tim. First of all, capacity. We got plenty of capacity. We have capacity. You know volumes are still down significantly versus 2019. And yes, we haven't taken capacity out since 2019. And frankly I would say our industry peers and certainly our suppliers. There's capacity. So yes, you're exactly right. You should expect that as volume comes up, certainly, we will get leverage from that volume, which will drop as margin improvement. Second question, raw materials and inventories. We do still have probably a few days higher DOI that we would like to have, $100 million, $150 million more raw material inventory than we would like to have. So yes, we will be buying raw materials in Q1 as we get ready for the peak paint season and some of them are more seasonal businesses, but maybe a little bit less than what links directly to demand because of that excess that we're sitting on today. And finally, on marine and protective, the quick answer is yes. We have launched some new products, new technologies recently in the fire protection area. That are quite strong and being well received by the market. For hydrocarbon fire protection is a product called PITT-CHAR NX, which has been very well received and on the cellulosic fire protection side, a product called STEELGUARD 651, which is also being very well received. So those new technologies are delivering share gain for us. But separate from fire protection, we've got really a fantastic product on the marine dry dock side that's very sustainable, very fuel efficient and drives -- it's really getting really good market receptivity and we've got a lot of share gains that will be -- we'll reap the benefits of those share gains in 2024 and beyond, and that's a product called SIGMAGLIDE. So, it is technology-driven in those spaces.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the call back over to Jonathan Edwards.
Jonathan Edwards: Thank you, Elliot. Well done today. We appreciate your interest and confidence in PPG and this concludes our fourth quarter earnings call. Have a good day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-10-19 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is Emily, and I will be your conference operator for today. At this time, I’d like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter PPG Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Bruno, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
John Bruno: Thank you, Emily, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG and welcome you for our third quarter 2023 financial results conference call. Joining me on the call from PPG are Tim Knavish, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Vince Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our comments relate to the financial information released after U.S. equity markets closed on Wednesday, October 18, 2023. We have posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on the Investor Center of our website, ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide additional support to the opening comments Tim will make shortly. Following management's perspective on the company's results for the quarter, we will move to a Q&A session. Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements, reflecting the company's current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. The presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC. Now, let me introduce PPG Chairman and CEO, Tim Knavish.
Tim Knavish: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2023 earnings call. I'd like to start by providing a few highlights on our third quarter record financial performance, and then I'll move to our outlook. In the third quarter, the PPG team continued to deliver strong financial results, including sales of $4.6 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.07, both records for our third quarter. Our year-to-date cash generation is over $1.5 billion, which is also a record on a year-to-date basis. Our adjusted EPS of $2.07 was 25% higher year-over-year. We benefited from several non-recurring favorable discrete income tax items, which added $0.10 versus our beginning of quarter guidance. Excluding this favorable tax benefit this year, our EPS was still about 20% higher than the third quarter of 2022. We're on pace to finish 2023 with all-time record adjusted earnings per share. As we communicated at the beginning of the year, we had a high degree of conviction that our global business portfolio mix would prove resilient this year and as we had anticipated a challenging economic environment. That has clearly played out through the first nine months of the year. Our results were supported by good growth trends and strong execution in several of our leading and technology advantaged businesses, which resulted in record third quarter sales in the aerospace, automotive OEM, automotive refinish and PPG Comex Coatings businesses. Our third quarter sales volumes were impacted by soft global industrial production, which worsened in many countries during the quarter and also by cautious consumer buying patterns in Europe, China and other parts of the world. The selling price increases we implemented earlier this year, primarily in the Performance Coatings segment drove a solid 3% increase for the quarter. We expect selling prices to remain positive in the fourth quarter of 2023, albeit a little lower sequentially as we continue to see prior price increases reach their anniversaries. Throughout 2023, a key priority for our team has been restoring our margin profile. The third quarter marked the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating segment margin improvement with aggregate segment margins up 260 basis points. This led to both of our operating segments delivering at least 25% earnings growth in the third quarter with the Industrial Coatings segment also delivering higher sequential margins. Another key focus remains strong cash generation. Throughout the first three quarters of the year, the $1.5 billion operating cash generation that we delivered is up more than $1.1 billion over a year -- on a year-over-year basis. In addition to our strong earnings performance, we significantly reduced working capital in total by about $300 million, mainly driven by lower inventories, contributing to the robust operating cash flow generation. We use part of this cash to reduce our higher variable cost debt during the quarter and despite significant increases in market interest rates, our net interest expense declined year-over-year. As we look to continue our momentum into the fourth quarter, we are laser-focused on achieving top line sales and earnings growth in 2024 and beyond. I'd like to highlight a few items that we expect will support growth in 2024. First, as I communicated at our CEO investor briefing in May, we are working on a number of commercial growth opportunities and several of these initiatives have been launched and are now gaining momentum. For example, we are pleased with the progress being made supporting our customers' rapid growth of electric vehicles in China with PPG technology advantage products and services. We are well positioned with the leading electric vehicle producers and continue to gain share as the production rate increases each quarter, including strong EV export activity out of China. In the past few years, we've invested to enhance our manufacturing and technology capabilities around powder coatings products with prudent capacity additions. This year, we're realizing the benefit of these investments as our powder coating related sales have increased about 15% compared to last year. We're winning new business every quarter and supporting our customers' sustainability and productivity objectives, and we expect powder to outgrow the market for a number of years to come. Another commercial growth initiatives supporting our growth in 2024 and beyond involves expanding the breadth of products being sold through the PPG Comex distribution network. Our world-class network of over 5,100 concessionaire locations in Mexico has consistently outgrown the regional architectural market and provides customers with their preferred paint brand and products in Mexico. We are very excited about the opportunity to now leverage this distribution network to support customer needs for protective, refinish, traffic and light industrial products. So these focus areas are part of a larger basket of commercial initiatives that will support our previously communicated organic sales growth targets. I will provide periodic updates on these initiatives in subsequent quarters. On legacy of PPG and another catalyst for earnings growth going forward is strong cash generation and value-creating capital deployment. I plan to continue to abide by our hallmark of prudent balance sheet management and financial flexibility, supported by strong free cash flow of our business portfolio. Year-to-date, we have delivered record cash flow from operations and we have utilized this to deliver on our prior commitment to repay some variable rate debt, driving down our interest expense. In the fourth quarter, we will likely incorporate some additional debt repayment, but will also likely complete some share repurchases, reflecting our strong cash position and seasonality of our cash flows. In addition to the sales and earnings growth initiatives, one other strategic initiative that we've been actioning relates to some selective pruning of our business portfolio. As a reminder, we've recently divested a number of smaller assets, including most of our coatings businesses in Africa, a non-core business that we acquired with the Ennis-Flint acquisition and have exited certain product categories in some businesses. In addition, this week, we announced the divestiture of certain international operations in our Traffic Solutions business. These actions allow us to channel our growth bandwidth in areas that are meaningful and where we have winning advantages, including technology, brands and customer relationships. We will continue to actively assess each of our businesses and product lines to ensure they're consistent with our growth objectives and that they meet our financial objectives, and they earn the right to remain in the portfolio. Now I'll comment on our fourth quarter outlook. We expect several of the businesses in our Performance Coatings segment to deliver organic growth, including continued solid growth in our PPG Comex and aerospace businesses. We do expect slowing in U.S. architectural coatings demand stemming from multi-decade highs in interest rates and lowering housing turnover. While we expect our automotive OEM business to grow in the fourth quarter in most regions, other portions of our Industrial Coatings segment will be challenged due to sluggish overall global industrial production. While there are many variables in uncertain timing, we have prudently included an estimated financial impact of the UAW strikes of a few cents of EPS in our fourth quarter financial guidance. As we have communicated in the past, our regional sales to the OEMs impacted by the strike are low-single digit percentage of our total company sales. Also, we sell to other OEM customers in the region not impacted by the strikes and given the historically low dealer inventory levels, we expect any lost volume will be made up in subsequent quarters. Certain other sales volume headwinds are beginning to abate, as we expect China is at or approaching trough levels. Also, we do not expect destocking to be a significant issue in our packaging coating end-use market in 2024. With regard to commodity raw materials, supply has normalized to pre-pandemic levels and we expect to continue to realize benefits from moderating input costs. We will maintain emphasis on diligently managing our costs and expect to make more progress on our previously announced restructuring initiatives. In addition, we are beginning to deliver manufacturing productivity gains, which are supported by a more stable supply chain and customer order pattern. Despite the challenging environment, we've raised full year earnings guidance and expect fourth quarter aggregate segment margins will be higher on a year-over-year basis for the fifth consecutive quarter. Lastly, I'd like to thank our team members around the world who live our purpose every day to protect and beautify the world. Thanks to their hard work and dedication, we're able to support our customers and help them solve their biggest challenges. I remain confident in our team's ability to make it happen. Thank you for your continued confidence in PPG. This concludes our prepared remarks and now would you please open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO. John, please go ahead. Your line is now open.
John McNulty: Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking my call and congrats on a solid set of results. Wanted to ask on the raw material environment, we've seen a decent jump up in oil recently. I guess, can you speak to how we should be thinking about raws moving from 3Q to 4Q and if you expect those to be down and how much on a sequential basis, do you expect them to be down? And then, I guess, how should we be thinking about that as it rolls through into 2024?
Tim Knavish: Hey, John. Thanks for the question. So let me talk about oil first. Obviously, oil is going to produce some impact on solvents for us. But really, our raw material basket is much more dependent upon supply demand, where several steps removed from oil with the exception of solvents, so that's a much bigger impact for us. And then, the total impact for Q4, we saw high-single digit deflation in Q3. We expect high-single digits in Q4, and we expect further deflation as we move into 2024 on a broader basis.
Vince Morales: Hey, John. This is Vince. Let me just add a little bit to what Tim was saying. So the supply demand environment, as we pointed out, I think, in our prepared remarks and the press release, we have seen sufficient -- more than sufficient supply, that's typically a bigger driver of our input costs than just the feedstocks. And right now and heading into a seasonally lower fourth quarter, we expect that to continue. So I would expect the increase in rise in oil to have no impact other than solvents on our fourth quarter and as we head into next year, we will start negotiating with our suppliers in Q4 -- late Q4, and the tone from our suppliers has been more volume driven as opposed to price driven.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs. Duffy, please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Duffy Fischer: Yeah. Good morning, guys. Just a question around the delta between Industrial and Performance. So Industrial margins were up 300 bps year-over-year and Performance was up a little under 2.5%. But Industrial trailed on volumes by 4% and trailed on dollar pricing by 3%. So it doesn't look like there were any leverage from price and volume on the margin spread, so what's underlying that gap and why was Industrial able to do better than Performance even though it didn't on price or volume?
Vince Morales: Yeah, Duffy. This is Vince. Let me just start, I’ll let Tim add some color, obviously. But if you look at Q3 alone, the improvement year-over-year in Industrial is larger but the Performance segment improved quicker. So we got pricing, we typically have pricing and performance quicker. So we had price injected into our businesses quicker in Performance. We lagged that with Industrial, and we were still getting price in Industrial and certainly in 2022 in the back half. So on a year-over-year delta, you're correct, the Industrial segment looks better, but Performance just recovered earlier. Tim, do you want to add?
Tim Knavish: Yeah. I think it's spot on, and I think both segments will see continued year-over-year margin improvement, depending upon with the addition of manufacturing productivity improvements that I mentioned in my opening comments. And of course, as we get into seasonality, more volume will help that step change in margins as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Ghansham, please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Ghansham Panjabi: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everybody. As we kind of think about 2023, two of your higher margin verticals, including aerospace and Comex had delivered on outsized growth and obviously, margin conversion as well. How should we think about the sustainability of these growth verticals into 2024 and just more broadly, what is your base case for volumes for each of the two operating segments next year?
Tim Knavish: Yeah, Ghansham. Thanks for the question. Aerospace, you should expect that to continue not only for '24, but multiple years going forward. We have just such a unique technology advantaged position in that industry across commercial new build, commercial aftermarket, general aviation, military and all of those are strong and projected to be strong for the foreseeable future. We've got a tremendous backlog. Everything we make, we can sell. So that you should feel very good about we do for coming quarters and years. Likewise, with PPG Comex, I think this was the 13th quarter in a row of record performance. There's nothing to say, we won't have 14th, 15th and beyond. In my opening comments, I mentioned and back in May at the CEO briefing, I mentioned that while we will continue to gain share in the conventional architectural business. We're now focused on kind of our next chapter of accelerated growth in PPG Comex and that's using our world-class distribution network to sell refinish coatings, traffic, industrial protective and those are all up and running. So you should feel really good about those two businesses continuing record-breaking performance, and we certainly do. On an overall volume basis, I'm confident that we're going to swing to overall positive volume in 2024 based on a number of green shoots that we're seeing throughout our portfolio.
Vince Morales: Yeah. And Ghansham, if I could add just to those green shoots. We are seeing Europe, in our opinion is troughing especially for our business mix. We were essentially flat in Q3 in European volume across our portfolio. We do expect growth to resume in China, albeit at a lower level. Those are two pieces of our -- two big pieces of our portfolio geographically. And as Tim mentioned, Mexico, we expect to have outsized growth relative to other regions. And then the other business, as Tim mentioned, I would agree with, but I would also add that we do -- we are picking up share in our refinish business based on some of the technologies that we talked about in May.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho. Christopher, please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Christopher Parkinson: Thank you so much. Good morning. Tim, you've spoken a lot about kind of refocusing on R&D and just further positioning PPG to outgrow some of its respect to end markets, new products, new technologies has been literally just mentioned one. Once we're through this macro mayhem or however, you want to characterize it, what's your level and degree of confidence that you will, in fact, be able to outgrow certain end markets and where are you ultimately the most enthusiastic? Thank you.
Tim Knavish: Yeah. Hey, Chris. Thanks for the question. I like how you described the macro. The way I'm thinking about the broader kind of sequential what you should expect to see from us, most of '23, you heard me say many times, laser focused on margin recovery. We've made progress there. I think the next phase, I would call mostly focused on recovery growth in some of our stronger portfolio segments. But while all of that is happening, we have been shifting those focus in investment areas that you alluded to in, I would say innovation areas, not just classic R&D because some of that innovation is inside the can and some of that innovation is outside the can. And we're starting to see progress in a number of those areas, which is some of the green shoots and confidence that I have on go forward. From a sustainability standpoint, I look at our marine M&R business. We're up 20% this year. And a lot of that is driven by sustainable products for reducing friction on the hall of ships, and we're getting tremendous pull and we expect that to grow significantly in '24 and beyond. I'm sorry, Vince mentioned in Chancey Hagerty’s business, some of the digital innovations that we've invested in and continue to invest in are really starting to gain not only momentum with our existing customers, but share winning momentum. By the end of this year, we'll have 2,000 moonwalks in place, about a third of those are share gain. You'll recall back in May, Chancey and his team demonstrated the broader PPG link digital ecosystem to help body shops be more productive. Even though we're only nine months in, we've got 7,000 shops lined up for PPG Link paying their subscriptions and starting to improve their own shops and we're still very early days. And share gain momentum on PPG Link is starting to pick up. EVs 25% every car produced in China now is EV. We are winning share with the EV producers and we are growing content per vehicle on EVs. So a lot of the things we talked about are starting -- they're moving from incubation phase to implementation and execution phase. So I'm highly confident, Chris, that the things that we've picked as needle-moving investments for our future are going to do just that and move the needle in a positive direction.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Leithead of Barclays. Michael, please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Michael Leithead: Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Questions for Vince on the cash flow. It's been quite strong this year. Tim talked a bit about 4Q deployment opportunities. But just what's the early read for the best opportunities to deploy cash in '24 and just how should we think about a pick back up potentially in buyback sort of factoring into the EPS growth algorithm next year? Thanks.
Vince Morales: Yeah. Thanks, Mike. Good morning. Yeah, again, just to reiterate, again, record Q3 year-to-date cash flow about $1.5 billion. If you look at our net debt, we're down $700 million, $800 million year-over-year or versus the end of the year. Tim mentioned that we have some more debt coming due in 2024. We're going to pay some of that early to get the interest rate carry into our EPS. But we have $600 million of debt coming due over the next 12 years -- 12 months, excuse me. And again, some of that's -- we have -- we can prepay early, which we'll take advantage of. And we are going to do some level of share repo in Q4. And we're not going to itemize that in terms of size, but we'll look at our cash position and we'll look at the cash flow and typically our strongest quarter of the year. We'll give more guidance on 2024 in January. Again, we do have expect -- again continue strong cash flow in 2024, our earnings growth, supporting that as well as we're still carrying several hundred million dollars of excess inventory as we continue to make good progress in working that down in Q2 and Q3, but we still have a couple hundred million dollars we want to work down over the next six months or so. So that'll help our cash flow next year, but we'll get more cash and financial guidance in January.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I believe there were some comments in the prepared remarks in U.S. refinish about some negative volume. It's a function of some customer issues. Could you just give a little more detail on those and whether they're going to persist into the fourth quarter or it was just unique to the third quarter?
Tim Knavish: Yeah. Hey, Vincent. It's Tim. Thanks for the question. So to the earlier point, we are winning share in U.S. refinish. We are winning share largely driven by our digital ecosystem technology. So -- and we're laser-focused on the body shop level because that's ultimately the end customer, that's where our products get consumed. Because of the two-step distribution in this business, the actual sales we book or to the distributors. And they -- especially in a high interest rate environment, they fluctuate their inventories up and down. So we look at it over a multi-quarter basis. But we're confident, based on our net body shop wins that the volume and growth in this business will be a good story for us.
Vince Morales: Yeah. And Vincent, just -- at the market level, the body shops are still very active. They still have a backlog. They're working through that backlog. So sell-in certainly matters for us, but the ultimate judge of how the business and how the market is performing or the body shop metrics and the body shop business remains very solid as we sit here today, and we don’t see that changing in the near term.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen V. Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Stephen, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Stephen V. Byrne: Thanks, Tim. I'd like to ask you about your view on, among all of your growth potential, where would you rank cross-selling, you highlighted growth opportunities in businesses, but -- and you highlighted Comex as an opportunity to drive a few other businesses. But do you see potential to do that in other regions and which of your businesses do you think you have the most potential to drive geographic share gain?
Tim Knavish: Yeah. Hey, Steve. Thanks for the question. Comex is one example. Two areas that top of mind, we talk about often as far as cross-selling, if you look at protective coatings, we are as part of our PMC business, we sell protective coatings today across the distribution networks that are kind of owned and operated by our architectural business. We look at from a customer standpoint, the near-shoring, the construction of battery plants, for example, or the near shoring of factories into Mexico or Vietnam and other places, those are cross-business selling opportunities, where we would be selling protective coatings, architectural coatings and light industrial coatings. So we have those cross-selling opportunities around the world, and we leverage those and see good opportunities for further growth going forward. PPG Mexico, I point out because I would argue it’s the strongest distribution network in the coating space globally, but we have similar opportunities to different scales around the world.
A – Vince Morales: Yeah. And Steve, I just want to expand on the battery factory comment, Tim made. So if you look at the battery factory construction, we typically have multiple angles to prosecute that. We may go in first with protective coatings as they’re building the infrastructure for the factory. We certainly could do architectural coatings. We then have an I into the actual products being made in those factories, both on a light industrial or heavy industrial coatings as well as an OEM basis. So that I think battery factors are prime examples of where we are able to cross pollinate with the customers.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Jeff, please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Jeffrey Zekauskas: Hi. Thanks very much. You said that you're on FIFO and that your raw materials on that basis were down at a high-single digit rate. If you were on LIFO, how much would they be done? I know that they would be down more, but my question is by what percentage? And secondly, it seems that your volumes in your domestic architectural paint stores business increased in the third quarter, is that true and do you think they're capable of increasing in the fourth quarter?
Vince Morales: Jeff, this is Vince. Great to hear from you. Let me take the first question on inventory and Tim will take the architectural question. I think the best way we could describe that, it's a complicated question, as you pointed out, but a great question. I think the best way we've been describing that is, if you look on a realized basis, we're realizing mid to high-single digit deflation in our financial -- in our P&L in Q2, Q3. We think that would be high-single digit or even low-double digit depending on the commodity. If we were able to move to a LIFO for the 80% of our business that's on FIFO. So that gap is probably 200 basis points to 300 basis points of deflation capture. So hope that's understood. Tim?
Tim Knavish: Hey, Jeff. On your architectural U.S. question, the way we look at it with our new business model is our stores are part of our professional omni-channel, which is company-owned stores plus the Pro at Home Depot plus our independent dealers. That business, despite all the challenges macro-wise that omni-channel delivered low-single digit growth in Q3. And we would expect that or better as we move forward. So yeah, I think the omni-channel is delivering what we've expected some help from macros would make that even better.
John Bruno: And Jeff, this is John. Just one other point to Tim's feedback that growth was driven more by volume than price in the third quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Josh, please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Josh Spector: Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to ask on margins, and I'll ask it on Industrial, but I think the same market should apply on performance to remove some of the seasonality. So if we look at where margins are now in Industrial, you're in the high 13% range. You were there in the first quarter of this year, when you weren't getting benefits on raw materials, you're there now where you are getting benefit, sales are roughly similar. So I guess, first, is why aren't we seeing the flow through on margin? Is there something on cost or any price hitting back impacting that? And then second, when we look at next year, if volumes are, say, flattish or maybe slightly up is there anything in your control to get margins up higher than where they are today, be it cost or otherwise or is this the level we kind of normalize that and it's more volume growth? Thanks.
Tim Knavish: Hey, Josh. So Industrial segment, 39 as you said, that is 300 basis points up from last year in Q3. And the real driver -- it's not price, we have not seen any significant, if any, price give back to your question on the impact there in Industrial. The big impact is volume that -- as volume recovers moving forward, you'll see margin in Industrial Coatings improve. So within our control, the operational improvements that we've talked about and we said in our prepared remarks that we're starting to see those impacts come through on a productivity basis. That's another big driver to Industrial segment margin continued improvement.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David, please go ahead. Your line is now open.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning. Tim and Vince, just on the Q4 guidance, can you give a little more color on your assumptions for the auto strike, how long it continues and does it expand? And also, what are you seeing in terms of professional contracted backlogs heading into Q4 here? Thank you.
Tim Knavish: Yeah. Hey, David. On UAW, I said in my prepared remarks a few cents, I'll be a little more specific. We've assumed $0.03 for Q4. It was much less than that in Q3, almost negligible because just the mix of where the strikes hit from UAW, but we have made some assumptions that this will go on and will likely spread to a couple of plants. But as you know, David, we're trying to guess as much as anybody to what tactics are going to be deployed. But we've got about $0.03 built into our Q4 guide. And the second question again was...
John Bruno: The backlogs in the U.S. architectural side.
Tim Knavish: Yeah. Thanks. Sorry, I forgot the second question. Backlogs in architectural from a DIY standpoint, of course, no backlogs down low (ph) from an overall sales and volume standpoint, but the Pro backlogs are actually holding up pretty well despite everything that's happening out there on housing. You'll recall that a lot of our Pro business is commercial and maintenance and that's holding up well despite the macros. And some of it is based on a backlog of jobs still coming out of prior quarters and prior years. And some of that backlog is holding up because of skilled labor availability that our customers are seeing. So backlogs remain strong. I think the average backlog for us and our customers only dropped by about a week from average of 14 weeks to 13 weeks, so still pretty solid there.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with VRP. Kevin, please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Kevin McCarthy: Yes. Good morning. Portfolio question for you, Tim. You've done a fair amount of pruning, including most recently, the Australia, New Zealand portion of Traffic Solutions. Can you just put that into context, where are you in that process? How much more might there be to go? And then on the flip side of the coin, I'd appreciate any updated thoughts on potential for an increase in bolt-on acquisitions, with interest rates having increased, are you starting to see asking prices come down in the private market and how would you characterize that versus say, repurchases or just ongoing deleveraging for next year?
Tim Knavish: Yeah. Hey, Kevin. Good morning. To your pruning question, I would say, we're in early innings, frankly. What we've done so far is, I'd say some of the more obvious ones around the edge is, but businesses are on notice. My team knows that every business has to earn their right to stay in the portfolio and that's small or medium or large even. But we did the obvious ones first, and we're working through a number of other things. It's a bit early to give any specifics, but early days there.
Vince Morales: And Kevin, let me just add there. I think this goes back to the May, CEO briefing, the focus for us is to make sure that we're spending our energies, our bandwidth on organic growth. And if a business is not performing or too small to contribute meaningfully, then we're going to shift that bandwidth to organic growth initiatives. So that's, again, one of the critical focus is here as well as the financial returns, obviously.
Tim Knavish: Yeah. And the word is focus. I said that many times back in May, and I'd say, it's daily within the company. We're going to focus on the areas that we have the best right to win for the future and that are going to drive the best financial and growth performance for the future. To your second question, we are still – still a core part of our strategy is value creation, shareholder value accretive acquisitions because we still see many opportunities out there in the coatings space. But it's been a little slower than historical just given the financing costs and also performance of some companies during these macro challenged environment, sellers, of course, sellers want to sell it to peak EBITDA. So I think there's a little bit of a pause in closing deals, but we have a number in our pipeline. We’re talking to potential sellers daily, weekly, monthly. So it’s still a core part of our strategy. And frankly, because these acquisitions add long-term earnings and long-term cash generation, it’s still our preferred – one of our preferred deployment opportunities. But as you heard us in our opening remarks, if those don’t happen, we will put that surplus cash to work in other ways, including repo.
Operator: Your next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc (ph). Aleksey, please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Aleksey Yefremov: Thanks and good morning, everyone. Did you outperform in the Pro paint market in the U.S. this year and if so, by what magnitude and how do you think you could do relative to the market in the segment next year?
Tim Knavish: Well, we're in -- again, in architectural, we really run three very different architectural businesses depending on where you are in the world, right? So we talk a lot about our strength in Mexico. In Europe, we're number one in 10 countries with a very strong position with the existing business model. And that business, we're actually starting to see flat volumes despite everything that's happening in Europe. So we see that the flat volumes, we see as a positive, given what's happened over the last couple of years, with the potential that Europe has stabilized. In the U.S. specifically, it's a very different business model where we are actually in the mode of building a business model for the future. And so, it's early days in that journey where we're building a model that's brick-and-mortar like omni-channel model across our three channels, and we're converting paint customers one by one by one. You heard me say in the past that -- for that model to prove success, it needs to grow high-single digits, low-double digits every quarter, and it will take many quarters to get significant scale there. Q3, you heard the earlier question, we did grow both volume and sales by low-single digits, a little lower than where I'd like. But given the macros in housing, I’d say that was to expect it. How we’re doing versus the market and peers? We’ll see as other people release their results. But our architectural U.S. business, we are building a business model for the future. And it’s a marathon, not a sprint. So we’re looking at it on a long-term business model foundation.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Sison with Wells Fargo. Michael, please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Michael Sison: Hey, guys. Nice quarter. In terms of the fourth quarter, your outlook is for plus low-single digit sales growth to minus. I guess that implies some pricing, right? So the outlook for volume would be kind of like flattish to down mid-single digits. So can you maybe talk about what drives sort of the flattish or drive sort of the down? And then given where the interest rate environment is, do you think U.S. architectural demand next year could be up, down, flat? Thank you.
John Bruno: Yeah. Mike, this is John. Let me start, and I'll have Tim and Vince add on here. So in terms of fourth quarter outlook and volume, the Performance segment, we expect volume to be positive. We're still going to see good growth in aerospace and Comex as two key drivers there. The Industrial segment, we are expecting volumes to be lower, and that includes the assumption that Tim made earlier about the UAW impact. So if you -- if we didn't have a UAW impact, we must be much closer to being flat in volume in the Industrial Coatings segment.
Tim Knavish: Yeah. For Architectural Coatings U.S. next year, I feel good about the Pro based on two things, Mike. The continued growth an acceleration of the omni-channel that we're building plus the backlogs that our customers continue to experience. DIY, it's a big part of the business and if it stays at the current low level, that would actually be a positive for us as opposed to declining further. If there is just a little uptick in consumer spending and consumer remodeling, and I will remind everybody that a paint remodeling is the lowest cost home remodeling project you can do. So it will be the first one to start to recover. A little bit of volume recovery there would really help the total business in aggregate. So net-net, I'm positive on the Pro. I'm still questioning what's going to happen on DIY for next year.
Vince Morales: And Mike, just one more thing on the DIY is, we do know many of the large DIY retailers have destocked in 2023. So we certainly haven't had detailed conversations about their plans for 2024, but there was a pretty aggressive destock in 2023. So the sellout was much greater than the sell-in in 2023. And if that just normalizes on a year-over-year basis that will assist the pain producers.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Frank, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Frank Mitsch: Thank you and congrats, John on the promotion of VP, Finance reading a lot about wage inflation and higher accruals at PPG. So I assume it's because you've been doing double duty for the last 2.5 months, so congrats on that. You commented that volumes in the fourth quarter, it seemed like we might finally get that to be positive if it wasn't for the UAW strike. I'm curious as to given the nine quarters in a row of negative volumes, Tim, what your expectations are as you have an early read into 2024 in terms of volume growth at PPG?
Tim Knavish: Yes. Hey, Frank. I do appreciate you congratulating John on his promotion. Very easy decision for us, well deserved, but it didn't affect our wage inflation because John loves his job so much, he does it for free. But going into next year, I'm confident based on what we know today, based on what we see today, that we will swing to positive volume as a total enterprise in 2024. Q4 will be close, but again, UAW is a big unknown, what it will on how that goes and which plants and which ones we supply, customer mix wise, it's still a bit of an unknown. But I do feel positive that we will swing to positive volume in 2024. We've got Europe and China, two of our biggest regions that sequentially – sequentially, we believe China is going to recover to a slower speed than historical, to a slower speed than what we thought a couple of quarters ago, but sequentially, we will see improvement in China. Europe, as I said earlier, we're actually pleased to see flat volume across some of our larger businesses like deco in Europe because we really believe it is bouncing off the bottom. So we've got demand stability and any incremental increases in Europe will drive really good leverage for us. I mentioned the aerospace backlog, the more we make, the more we sell and that will go on for many quarters. And we're focused very heavily on productivity and getting more out the door, which will drive growth for us. Automotive, I believe, will have sequential improvement, sequential build increases moving into 2024, so when exactly, which month? We will have some macro dependency. But overall, I'm confident in the swing to positive volume in 2024.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Laurence Alexander: Good morning. Congrats on strong quarters. I just want to pin down one point. With respect to the incremental price actions and productivity, do you think you'll be able to keep that ahead of wage inflation in Q4 in next year or how should we think about the bridge there?
Tim Knavish: Yes. Hey, Laurence. Thanks for the question. The short answer is, yes. We'll stay ahead of wage inflation with a combination of price and productivity. We do expect, if you look at, let's call it, salary inflation in the established markets a little higher than normal, call it, 3%, frontline workers is very country specific. So it will be higher than that in some countries. But we're also confident, given our pricing track record that through a combination of price and productivity, we'll be able to offset the wage inflation that we'll see. And I'll also point out, remember that with our mix of businesses, with the exception of company-owned stores, we have a very low people intensity structure because most of our businesses are direct or direct to somebody else's distribution channel. So with the exception of company-owned stores, we have a pretty low human capital intensity frontline business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Aron Ceccarelli with Berenberg. Please go ahead. Aron, your line is now open.
Aron Ceccarelli: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I have one on pricing. With the heavy lift on pricing initiatives now behind us and the supply of raw materials back to normal condition, how should we be thinking about pricing across the two segments for 2024? And how do you feel about the potential scenario where pricing could turn negative next year? Thank you.
Tim Knavish: Yeah. Hey, Aron. Thank you for the question. Pricing, we will -- in the Performance segment, we will get incremental targeted pricing as we move into 2024 because of the structure and the value add that we deliver relative to the total cost of production that our customers have. So in other words, the small amount of paint consumption, a small amount of price is more than offset by the total production cost that we impact and the value that we add to our customers from a productivity standpoint. So we will get more targeted price in performance next year. In Industrial segment, we have not seen price give back to this point. We do have some structural contracts about 30% of our Industrial segment that is tied to some form of an index contract. So depending on what happens to that total basket of raws, there is a time lag built into where there would be some structural price changes. But again, that's less than half of our business. Beyond that, let's -- to the prior question, let's recall that there's a lot of other inflation out there. So the discussions we'll have with our customers and continue to have with our customers is that, that other inflation we also need to talk about when it comes to the price of our products and services.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Research Partners. Mike, please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Michael Harrison: Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask a question about the growth that you're seeing in powder coatings. Is this mostly share gain where you're seeing the growth or is there a lot of conversion happening with existing customers such that we should view it more as cannibalization. And I guess what does the margin profile look like for powder coatings compared to liquid for a similar application. Thank you.
Tim Knavish: Yeah, Mike. Great question. Thank you. What you see in powder growth for PPG is share gain, okay? Very little, if any, conversion of existing PPG customers from liquid to powder because there's two factors there. One, frankly, we're starting at a fairly low market position in powder. So we're specifically targeting share gain and conversion of an existing customer from liquid to powder takes a capital investment by that customer in their paint job. So it's not an overnight flip. So what you're seeing is share gain. Now from a margin standpoint, if you look at our U.S. powder business, for example, on a net margin standpoint, it's one of our more profitable segments across general industrial. And the reason is we target specifically the higher end of the powder portfolio, there's liquid-like appearance, there's metallic powders, those types of things that command a higher margin because they're more technology advanced from a formulation standpoint. So we're specifically targeting the higher end of the segment. Longer term, one of the reasons we are investing in powder for the future is, it is more sustainable solution for our customers. So you've got the short-term focus that where we're driving share gain by targeting the higher end segments of margin for powder. Longer term, you will see more and more customers converting from liquid to powder because of the sustainable solution that it provides.
Operator: Our final question today comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC. Arun, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Arun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. So I just wanted to understand, it sounds like you may be looking at consolidated positive volume growth for '24? Given that scenario and the operating leverage and the incremental margins that you kind of envisioned, do you expect to get to that $9 EPS level or what's the path to getting back to that level that you put out a couple of years ago? Thanks.
Tim Knavish: Yes. Thanks, Arun for the question. I've said many times, and I'll continue to say it that $9 for PPG is a question of when not if, okay? We will get there. I just fully confident in our new enterprise growth strategy and leveraging the portfolio that we've got as well as some selected pruning and some selected, targeting certain geographies and segments and being a lot more focused. So $9 is a when not if. What I'm confident in 2024 is that we will hit the 8% to 12% EPS growth that we stated in -- when we were together in May. And frankly, that 10% average EPS growth has been a target for our company for many years. And so I'm confident that as we move through 2024, a combination of the swing to positive volume plus the capital deployment that we've talked about a few times here this morning, plus some of the key innovation initiatives that we're launching now and will gain momentum in 2024. I'm confident that, that combination will get us to what we've committed to.
Operator: Those are all the questions we have. So I’ll turn the call back over to Mr. John Bruno.
John Bruno: Thank you, Emily. Great job. Appreciate that. We appreciate all your interest and confidence in PPG, and this concludes our third quarter earnings call.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-07-21 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is Carla, and I will be your conference operator for today. Welcome to the Second Quarter PPG Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to John Bruno, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
John Bruno: Thank you, Carla, and good morning, everyone. Once again, this is John Bruno, and we appreciate your continued interest in PPG and welcome you for our second quarter 2023 financial results conference call. Joining me on the call from PPG are Tim Knavish, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Vince Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our comments relate to the financial information released after US equity markets closed on Thursday, July 20, 2023. We have posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on the Investor Center of our website, ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide additional support to the opening comments Tim will make shortly. Following management's perspective on the company's results for the quarter, we will move to a Q&A session. Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements, reflecting the company's current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. The presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC. Now, let me introduce PPG President and CEO, Tim Knavish.
Tim Knavish: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. And welcome to our second quarter 2023 earnings call. I would like to start by providing a few highlights on our second quarter record financial performance and then I'll move to our outlook. The PPG team delivered all-time record financial results in the second quarter, including sales of $4.9 billion, adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $2.25 and year-to-date cash generation of about $620 million. Our adjusted EPS is about 24% higher than the second quarter of 2022 and cash generation of $750 million higher year-over-year. These strong financial results were achieved despite operating in an environment of variable global economic demand. Industrial production was muted, reflecting cautious consumer buying behavior in Europe and slower-than-expected recovery in China and softening demand in certain end use markets in the US. Overall, our results were supported by good growth trends in several of our technology, advantaged businesses and leading brands. PPG's strong positioning in these end use markets led to record second quarter sales in five of our nine businesses. Aerospace, automotive, automotive refinish, PPG Comex and our protective and marine coatings business. We implemented incremental price increases in the first half of the year, primarily in the Performance Coatings segment and our aggregate two-year stack pricing for the company is now about 20%, which is offsetting historically high cost inflation. We expect selling prices to remain positive in the second half 2023, recognizing prior year price increases will reach anniversaries as the year progresses. As I said at my CEO investor briefing in May, margin recovery is the top near-term priority. And we have made great progress this year in improving our segment margins toward our historical profile. Our aggregate segment margins in Q2 were about 16%, which is 330 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2022. This included the Performance Coatings segment delivering margins of near 18%, the highest since 2016. Another key priority for our team has been to return to our legacy of strong cash generation. And through the first half of the year, we delivered record operating cash generation of about $620 million. This was supported by our record net earnings, but we also lowered our inventory levels by about $100 million on a sequential quarterly basis. Despite this reduction, our raw material inventories remain elevated and we are executing various actions, plans to further reduce these inventory levels over the next several quarters as commodity supply availability has improved significantly this year. Now I'd like to spend a few minutes on three key drivers that are contributing to our excellent financial results in 2023. First, while overall global industrial production is challenging, including in a number of industrial end use markets that are already in recessionary type demand conditions, our portfolio of business mix is providing great resilience. Two of the best performing global industries in the second quarter were aerospace and auto OEM. We have established leading global positions in each of these end markets by facilitating our customer success through innovative and sustainably advantaged products and much relied upon services. We expect demand for our aerospace and auto OEM coatings products to remain robust as they are both still below 2019 demand levels. Two data points are, international flights remain 10% below 2019 pre-pandemic levels and over the past several years, lower automotive OEM global builds have resulted in an estimated supply deficit of about 40 million cars versus historical build rates. The second key driver is that we continue to deliver strong earnings performance in Europe as we achieved consecutive quarterly earnings records despite lackluster regional industrial production activity and weak aggregate -- architectural demand. This has been accomplished by our team's strong execution of cost and margin management. When this region begins to recover to any degree, PPG will be well positioned for solid topline and additional bottom line growth. The third key drivers are strong positioning in Mexico where current economic conditions remain robust including expansive nearshoring related growth, solid consumer wealth growth and an appreciating local currency. We expect the nearshoring benefits to continue for a number of years, first with capital investment and then through increased regional employment. PPG remains the clear leader in Mexico for architectural and automotive OEM and we have actions underway to capture further growth in our other businesses where we will leverage our core strengths, including the best-in-class PPG Comex concessionaire distribution network. I'd also like to comment on our enterprise growth strategy. A key pillar of this strategy is to partner with our customers to deliver superior service and products with a focus on enhancing their productivity and sustainability. In the second quarter, we continued to make advancements and earned several new customer wins. I'm excited about the opportunities we have ahead of us to win more customer value driven business and grow our organic sales. Now some quick updates about our important ESG initiatives. As we communicated in our 2022 ESG report, we've introduced 2030 greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets that have now been validated according to climate science through the science-based targets initiative. We plan to reduce our scope 1 and scope 2 absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030 and our scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 30% within the same timeframe. Moving to our outlook. We expect global industrial production to remain at lower levels in the third quarter, including similar demand activity in Europe, some further slowing in the US and modest sequential improvement in China. We do expect certain pockets of industry activity to remain more resilient, including aerospace and automotive industries, where we are well positioned on a global basis. In addition, we expect economic activity in Mexico to remain solid. In our architectural businesses, we expect demand conditions to be mixed by geography. In Europe, we anticipate demand will stabilize at current levels, resulting in year-over-year sales volume being much closer to the prior year. In the US, we anticipate DIY demand to remain at lower levels and pro-contractor residential repaint activity to begin to modestly decline sequentially with the backdrop of lower existing home sales. Finally, in Mexico, we expect our PPG Comex business to continue to post solid organic growth. In the third quarter, we expect to realize additional benefits from moderating cost inputs. At the peak of our supply disruptions, we had more than 160 force majeures in our global supply chain. That is now about 10, which is in line with our historical norms. To date, we have not yet recognized the full financial benefit of our commodity supply chain normalizing. From a financial realization perspective, through the end of June, our input costs were still 20% higher than the pre-pandemic levels. As we further reduce our inventories, we will realize additional earnings benefit. We continue to work on our previously announced restructuring initiatives and expect an incremental $15 million year-over-year earnings benefit in the third quarter. Additionally, we will benefit from the recent paint film acquisition that we made in the second quarter. This business is uniquely positioned in the premium end of this new emerging market and has good customer pull and future growth prospects. Annual sales of this business are about $100 million. Despite the challenging environment, we have raised our full year earnings guidance and expect third quarter aggregated segment margins will be higher on a year-over-year basis for the fourth consecutive quarter. Finally, I want to thank our team members around the world who support our customers, serve our communities and continually look for ways to do better today than yesterday every day. It is their dedication and commitment to helping make our customers successful that gives me continued confidence in our future. As we mark PPG's 140th anniversary in August, I firmly believe that our best days still remain ahead of us. Thank you for your continued confidence in PPG. This concludes our prepared remarks and now would you please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson. Your line is now open.
Christopher Parkinson: Great. Thank you so much. Tim, can we perhaps just dissect the outlook for Industrial Coatings segment margins a little bit. Just based on what you're seeing for price cost for the second half of the year and market mix, given the dichotomy of certain things moving various directions per your 3Q outlook in your slide deck, comp accruals, just anything else you think is worthwhile discussing as you progress back towards prior peak? Thank you so much.
Tim Knavish: Hey, Chris. Thanks. I'll let Vince answer the comp accruals, but I'll take segment margins and outlook for some of the businesses. Segment margins in Industrial are still on the recovery journey. So we have continued…
Operator: [Operator Instructions]
Tim Knavish: Carla, are we there? Hello?
John Bruno: Carla, can you please open up the secondary line?
Christopher Parkinson: Hey guys, we can still hear you for what it's worth.
Tim Knavish: Okay.
John Bruno: Thank you.
Tim Knavish: Thanks, Chris. So as I started to say, segment margins -- okay, good -- segment margins in industrial certainly have more room to grow and we expect that to continue, both from the price cost standpoint. But the other piece of recovery that is really not happened yet that will continue to improve the segment margins on Industrial are volume. Of course, right now auto OEM is strong, but still below 2019. And then we've got some pockets of weakness in industrial and certainly pockets of weakness in packaging. So we will get segment margins as those volumes stabilize. The other thing is the operational challenge that we mentioned at our May event have largely been in the industrial segment. So as we make progress on those initiatives, those two pieces will add to the improvements that will be realized from the continuing price versus cost recovery. And then end markets, to your question for the Industrial segment, automotive has been very resilient, some time surprisingly so despite everything that's happening in the world with interest rates and inflation and affordability. All of our major regions for automotive were up double digits for Q2. And we expect continued strong recovery as we move forward here. We'll be lapping a stronger Q3 for auto based on China which had a strong Q3 last year. But overall, we'll continue to see good volume recovery in auto.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]
Christopher Parkinson: We expect that recovery to continue for years to come. Powder is a mix -- I'm sorry.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Hi, everyone. Apologies. We have some issues with the phone lines. Bear with us a second whilst we gain reconnection with the speaker lines. [Technical Difficulty] Hi, all. We now have connection with our speaker line. Please continue.
John Bruno: Apologies, everybody. We're trying to sort through these issues. We'll continue the call right now.
Tim Knavish: Okay, Chris. I'm back. The positive of technical difficulties, we've had a long time to think about your question. Already answered the segment margin piece. And then from a segment volume and sales and outlook standpoint, auto, we expect to continue to be strong, Q3 comp issue with China, but that will be -- the whole auto build recovery will continue for beyond ‘23 and into ‘24. Industrial is very mixed. Certain segments are doing well. I'll point to powder for example where we were up solid double digits, which as you know from our May event is very important to our growth strategy. But sub-segments that are closer to the consumer, electronic materials, appliance and even COEX for instruction are soft, but we do expect that to continue to be a mixed bag. Packaging, packaging has been weak with both destocking but also end customer demand given what's happened from an inflation standpoint. So very much a mixed bag. But overall, the summary would be we are expecting industrial segment margins to continue to improve.
John Bruno: We'll move to the next question, Carla.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi. Your line is now open.
Ghansham Panjabi: Okay. Hey, guys. Good morning. Can you hear me?
Tim Knavish: Yes, Ghansham.
Ghansham Panjabi: Okay. Terrific. I guess just given all the moving parts on a macro basis and just kind of building on your last few comments, Tim, can you just give us a sense as to how your volume outlook for 2023 has changed since the last time you reported and which of the businesses are seeing the greatest variability relative to your previous view? And then separately, apart from packaging, are there still any businesses being impacted by inventory destocking in any material way?
Tim Knavish: I'll answer your last question first, and not really, Ghansham. Destocking is pretty much behind us. And even on the industrial side, they don't carry a lot of inventory anyways. It's pretty much a just in time. And then on our performance side, most -- any destocking that's occurred is largely behind us. So what we see outlook wise across the company, so the things that have changed a bit is the recovery in China slower than what we had anticipated and we're expecting continued improvement in China industrial activity, albeit at a more measured pace going forward. So sequentially improving but not as -- not as much of a V shaped as what we had previously projected. Architectural Europe, I'd say the other one that was lower volume than what we expected in Q2. But a lot of that was driven by kind of one-off social and political events in France, which is one of our largest markets in Europe. So we do believe architectural Europe, I would call it bouncing up the bottom and we'll start lapping weak comps from last year. And then in the US, architecture -- the DIY, not just US, around the world, continues to be soft. But overall, we still got more than half our portfolio that's very resilient and I would say has positive outlooks. Auto was stronger than we anticipated, refinish was stronger than we anticipated, aero was stronger than we anticipated, PMC was stronger than we anticipated and Mexico continues to just shoot lights out. So a lot of positives there, but those are the ones that were a little different than what we had previously thought in our guide.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Spector. Please go ahead.
Josh Spector: Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a solid second quarter here. I just wanted to ask some questions on your 3Q assumptions. So specifically, SG&A as a percent of sales and gross margin, I guess my math indicates that midpoint of your guide, gross margins are maybe 40% or lower. You just printed about 41% in the second quarter and similarly in the first quarter. So what would drive gross margins to go down, especially when you're expecting some raw material benefit? Can you just walk through some of the moving pieces in your assumptions there? Thanks.
Vince Morales: Yeah, Josh, this is Vince. On SG&A, let me take that one first. We did have a little bit of higher SG&A in Q2 than the prior year. Really a couple of elements to that. We talked about higher performance-based incentive comp including total shareholder return compensation. We did have as we communicated in Q1, higher non-cash pension expense for the balance -- for all of 2023. That falls in the SG&A bucket on a year-over-year basis. You could see that. And just a reminder, a lot of our China business was shut down in Q2 of 2022 and some of the increased sales creates increased SG&A. So those three elements pushed our SG&A cost up year-over-year. And the incentive comp item was a catch up for both Q1 and Q2. So again, that's SG&A component. On the gross profit percent, we did as you pointed out, we're averaging about 41% year-to-date. Q3 typically is a lower volume quarter for us. We don't have as much operational pull-through as we would on a higher volume quarter, specifically in Europe. So it's really the only delta I would point to. We do expect as we said in our prepared remarks, a higher or improved deflation capture. But again, the lower volumes are going to affect our manufacturing efficiency.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter. Your line is now open.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning. Tim and Vince, you mentioned the weakness -- potential weakness in Pro. Where are the backlogs today and are you actually seeing that weakness yet come to fruition?
Tim Knavish: Hey, David, thanks for the question. I would describe the weakness in Pro to be sequentially down a bit, but not a tremendous amount. A lot of that Pro work is commercial and maintenance, that still remains pretty resilient. But we have seen some reduction in backlog. But honestly, the painters are still in some cases having difficulty getting labor. So there are cases where they're passing on jobs because of that. So while we've seen DIY down fairly significantly, I would just say we're seeing just a bit of softness in the PRO backlogs.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Zekauskas. Your line is now open.
Jeffrey Zekauskas: Thanks very much. Two-part question. Can you talk about the state of Chinese TiO2 industry and that there's enormous [Technical Difficulty]. Can you use that product in China and in other regions or China chloride-based material. And is it the case that tariffs are just too high to use it in the United States? And secondly, in your script, you say that 80% of your inventories are on FIFO. I thought most of your inventories in the United States were on LIFO. So does that mean that the inventory adjustments that you really need to make are in the offshore markets and your inventory control is pretty good in the US and it's tougher abroad?
Vince Morales: Yeah, Jeff, this is Vince. We had a little break-up on your question, but I think you asked about TiO2 oversupply in China. And we do -- we are able to take Chinese TiO2 and are -- and have been for quite some time, utilizing that certainly in Europe, certainly in Latin America, South America, obviously in Asia. And there are tariffs that make it less cost effective today to do so in the US. But we are fully utilizing our capabilities to move that TiO2 to other markets or other regions of the world outside of Asia and capitalizing on those lower prices.
John Bruno: Jeff, this is John. I'll take the FIFO question. So, first start with the sales we have, our profile in the US. We're now about 35% sales in the US. And in the past five, six years as we've made acquisitions in the US, the companies we've acquired have been on FIFO. So we have not moved them to the LIFO accounting. So over time, the percentage of inventory that we have on the FIFO method has just incrementally increased due to those factors.
Vince Morales: To just add on there…
Operator: Sorry.
Vince Morales: Sorry, Carla. Just -- I apologize. Just to add on, my apologies. Just to add on, as John mentioned, we do excess inventory, specifically in raw materials. If you look at our inventory historically, we've trimmed about 50% of the excess raw material inventory that we came into the year with in the first six months So we'll be working the balance of the year to trim the other portion to get back to our historical level.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen V. Byrne. Your line is now open.
Stephen V. Byrne: Yeah, thank you. If I understood you correctly, Tim, you talked about raws, and I believe it was in COGS, still being 20% above pre-pandemic. And, Vince, you just highlighted, you're still sitting on excess inventory of raws. My question would be, for raws purchased today, what would be the cost relative to pre-pandemic? And how long do you think that it will take for that to flow through COGS?
Vince Morales: Yeah, Steve. I'll take the first stab at that and Tim will add some color here. So what we're seeing today on invoice cost, as we said last quarter, invoice to invoice year-over-year, mid to high single-digit and maybe in some cases low double-digit deflation on certain raw materials. I would remind everybody as raw materials went up 20%, 30%, 40%. So when you do it on a multi-year stack, we're still much higher. But we're seeing on a year-over-year basis on invoices mid to high to low -- mid to high single to low double-digit declines that typically would flow through in 30 to 60 days or even 90 days depending on the raw material. And again, that's extended right now.
Tim Knavish: Yeah. And bottom line, Steve, when you combine that with the additional $100 million or so of inventory that we've got to work through that we're sitting on now, you've got sequentially more raw material deflation combined with that additional inventory flowthrough. That's why I'm so confident that our margin recovery journey will continue.
Operator: Your next question comes from John McNulty. Your line is now open.
John McNulty: Yeah, thanks for taking my question. So, Tim, in your prepared remarks, you spoke to pricing continuing through the second half of the year. I guess just because the comps are kind of pretty dramatic year-over-year, I guess can you help us to think about whether you're going to see pricing sequentially from 2Q to 3Q and how we should be thinking about that?
Tim Knavish: Yeah, most of what -- most of what we're going to see, John, is a carryover impact. There'll be some targeted pricing that we do in Performance Coatings. But a lot of what you'll see going forward here for the remainder of 2023 will be carryover. And to your point, we are lapping some strong price quarters from last year. So if you look at -- we printed 8% for Q1, 6% for Q2. So you'll probably see low single digit pricing printed in Q3, still a little early to tell in Q4, we're confident it will be positive, but we'll see what happens and what other actions we might need to take.
Vince Morales: And just to tag along here, we still expect that the price -- the raw material delta to expand as we talked about the prior question, which is we expect more -- to realize more deflation as we pull down our inventories.
Tim Knavish: The other thing, I mean, the pricing has been holding up very nicely, proud of how our teams are executing to that regard. And so our price story, someone earlier asked about what's different in our guide versus earlier. Our price story is stronger than what our prior guides were.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews. Your line is now open.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you and good morning, everyone. Just a question on the wage inflation and you said it will remain elevated the next few quarters. Is that just because your -- you have to lap the flowthrough of some wage increases from prior quarters or is there more going in? And if you can size it a little bit, just to help us understand how much of a headwind that is versus the raw materials benefits that you're getting.
Tim Knavish: Yeah, Vincent, we do have -- no surprise, higher than normal wage inflation. I'd say in a mature markets average, you could call that about 3% but higher than that on frontline workers like store workers, but 3% would be a good average. Emerging markets, higher than that. And then from a raw material inflation standpoint, we're still at that 20%-ish number versus pre-pandemic. And we're expecting Q3 to see mid to high single-digits down. So we expect the combination of those two to still keep us at elevated cost versus pre-pandemic, but improving sequentially as we move through the rest of the year.
Vince Morales: And as we look at the trend lines, we're not seeing out of the trends, a change in terms of increase or decrease of wages. We provided our merit process or our wage increase process earlier in the year and we typically would do that once a year for most of our employees. So that trend should hold for the balance of the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer. Your line is now open.
Duffy Fischer: Yeah. Good morning, guys. Just a question around the EPS and the guide for Q3 and the implied for Q4. So In Q1 and Q2, your year-over-year number was up $0.45 and $0.44. The guide midpoint for Q3 and then the implied for Q4 is up $0.24 and $0.19 year-on-year. With raw material deflation accelerating for you guys and price still up in the back half as you were commenting, why would the year-over-year EPS improvement decline in the back half versus the first half?
Tim Knavish: Hey, Duffy. The biggest driver to that would just be the quarter-over-quarter price actions. Most of the larger price increases for us started kick in like Q3 of last year. So as we lap those and less new pricing if you will adding to the top, that's really the biggest difference.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham. Your line is now open.
Patrick Cunningham: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So increasing interest rates and -- are clearly showing up in existing home sales and you cited softness and resi repaint. And I want to talk a little bit about non-resi. While it appears to be strong or maybe hanging in there, how should we think about the risk to commercial volumes in the back half and in 2024 given a higher interest rate environment and, starting to see some deceleration in commercial construction and remodeling indices?
Tim Knavish: Well, I'd say in the short term, that's not -- frankly for the rest of ‘23, not something we're particularly concerned about because there was such a backlog in those areas. If you think about the -- really bifurcation of painting activity that happened during COVID, you had a tremendous amount of resi painting happening, but you had virtually no commercial and maintenance painting happening. So there's still a tremendous amount of pent-up demand in that -- in that space. Now eventually, we'll see what happens with interest rates and macros in the longer term. But that's -- we're just not seeing that right now being a major concern for us.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Leithead. Your line is now open.
Michael Leithead: Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just one question from me on traffic solution. I think you expected sales to be up high single digits in 2Q, and they were down low single digits. So just can you talk through what drove the delta versus what you thought in April?
Tim Knavish: Yeah. So part of it was -- part of it was comp related. We had a really strong Q2, Q3 last year in that business. And secondly, it's still a new business for us and we're still learning the market a bit. And this is an area where we did see some -- I'd say temporary shift in paint volumes as activities picked up. And so we expect that -- we expect to get that back as we move forward through the rest of the year and certainly into next year. We have been focused very heavily on margin over volume in that business and the team has done a great job there. And the last thing I'll say to that is while the volumes did come in a bit lower than we expected for the quarter, this business is generating good cash for us, really good cash and a good contributor to the enterprise from that standpoint.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch. Your line is now open.
Frank Mitsch: Good morning and nice results. Obviously you guys generated some strong cash flow in the first half of the year, begs the question on the use cash. Debt paydown is part of it. But how do you think about buybacks versus M&A? I know, Tim, you've talked about right property, right price, right time? Is this the right time? Are you seeing the right price? Any thoughts there would be greatly appreciated.
Tim Knavish: Yeah. Thanks, Frank. You're proud of the team, great [narration] (ph). And as you noted, our number one priority to pay down some debt. We said earlier this year, we would pay somewhere between $500 million and $600 million down We paid about $200 million of that down so far this year. So we've got a bit more of that to do. But I'll tell you, we're going to have a really good cash year. We're going to have really good cash year, which gives us a lot of optionality. Probably not time to talk about specific actions on the M&A side, but that clearly remains a priority for us. And we are seeing properties come across our desks there. But bottom line, we're going to have a really good cash generation year. We're going to pay down some more debt. And then we're going to make decisions on how best to use that cash to deliver shareholder value based on what we see at the time.
Vince Morales: And just to reiterate what we said in May in New York, we're not going -- after we pay down this debt, we're not going to let cash grow on the balance sheet.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov. Your line is now open.
Aleksey Yefremov: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. We've recently seen somewhat better deed on new residential construction in the US What do you see in your business in this market? Have your expectations here improved at all in the last three months? And then separately, are you seeing any meaningful pickup in the US infrastructure spending?
Tim Knavish: So on the newbuilds, we are starting to see a little bit better activity there on new home construction. We've said in prior calls, it's a fairly small part of our overall business, but it's not zero. And we've had a couple of nice wins recently with some new home builders. So bottom line, any walls -- any additional walls that get painted in the US, Mexico, Europe, Australia is good for us. That's upside to us. So that would be the first one. Second part of your question?
Aleksey Yefremov: Infrastructure.
Tim Knavish: Infrastructure.
Aleksey Yefremov: What you think about US infrastructure.
Tim Knavish: Infrastructure. All right. Thank you. Thank you. US infrastructure, we are starting to see, I would call it, upstream project activity and we're very active in the specification side of ensuring that our products are well specified, whether it's traffic or protective coatings or architectural coatings or industrial coatings. Typically, paint and coatings are late stage in those projects, sometimes last stage in those projects. So this is more of a ‘24 and beyond growth opportunity for us, but we're certainly seeing that upstream activity happening now. We're excited about it and we're very active with it.
Vince Morales: And if I could add, it's not US comment, but it's a Mexico comment. We are seeing a significant amount of near-shoring occur in Mexico, several hundreds of building permits for manufacturing facilities have been requested. Those will yield benefits for us certainly in ‘24 and ‘25 as that manufacturing is put in place. And then as Tim mentioned earlier, we have a full-fledged array of PPG businesses in Mexico to facilitate further painting once that industrial activity picks up as well as our strong Comex brand.
Tim Knavish: Yeah, just to put some metrics around that Mexico nearshoring. In Q1 of this year, there's about $48 billion of nearshoring investments in Mexico. That's 3x, three times Q1 of 2022. So we are really seeing that pickup and were involved in the specification side of that business as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison. Your line is now open.
Mike Harrison: Hi. Good morning. Wanted to ask about auto OEM and the price realization that you're seeing there. Is there more still to come on pricing in auto OEM? And are there any instances where you're starting to see some customer pushback related to raw material declines either in auto OEM or any other subsegments?
Vince Morales: Yeah, Mike. This is Vince. Let me start and I'm sure Tim will have some color here. But it's taken us a while as it typically does, at doing an inflation cycle to negotiate with our customers, get paid for the value we provide. So we had a lag on the way up in terms of the inflation versus price to our OEM customers. We're in a steady state environment now. We're not seeing any pushback We're still trying to capture -- as the volume grows, we're still trying to capture our margins back in that business, but we're not seeing any pushback at this point from the customers. Again, that's a traditional lag effect that we would see in any inflation cycle.
Tim Knavish: And to your broader question about other segment, I would say normal market dynamics, nothing significant, nothing material. There's been some intense competitive pressure just around the edges. But at the core, we haven't really seen anything that was unexpected or out of the normal.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Roberts. Your line is open.
John Roberts: Thank you. Refinish organic sales were up mid single digit. I don't know what pricing was up, but the Performance segment was up 6%. Refinish volumes globally flat and when you talk about it being better than expected, was price better than expected or was volume better than expected?
Tim Knavish: Yeah. Hey, John. Volume was positive here in the US, which of course is our most -- largest and most critical market. And that was better than we expected. Volume in Europe, I would say, was worse than we expected. Volume down there a bit more than we thought. And then volume in China, a little bit muted because of the slower recovery, but we see that is sequentially improving as time goes on. But overall, great quarter for that business, really bullish on particularly the US side and we're watching closely what happens on the Europe side.
Vince Morales: And Europe side, we talked about a destock earlier in the call here. And we think in Q2, there was some destocking with certain refinish customers. We think that's concluded by the end of Q2. So again, as we get to the back half of the year, we would expect the demand and the volumes to be more in sync.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Sison. Your line is now open.
Michael Sison: Hey, guys. Nice quarter. In terms of the half of your portfolio that's in decline or weak, do you think those markets are bottoming or potentially bottom here in the third quarter? And then, when I take a look at your volume outlook, third quarter seems to be down year-over-year again. And, I just wanted to get your thoughts on the fourth and how you see that sort of unfolding.
Tim Knavish: Yeah. So I'll take a few of the markets that were lower volume than what we expected for Q2 and how we're thinking about them going forward. First one, architectural Europe, was -- that was clearly down more than we expected, but some of that isolated to France as I mentioned earlier. I do expect that to start comping pretty close, maybe even a little upside from where we were at Q3 of last year. So I've used the term bouncing off the bottom. I do believe that Europe architectural is bouncing off the bottom and maybe a little bit of upside there. The China recovery, slower than we expected in Q2, no doubt, but the way we're thinking about that is, that just stretches out the recovery positive -- any stimulus that the government does in the industrial space will be a real positive for PPG and we do expect China to sequentially improve. So those would be the two main ones I would point out as far as what we saw in Q2 and potentially improving in Q3 and beyond.
Vince Morales: Yeah, Mike. And I think there is a comparable -- year-over-year comparable issue as you look at volume. So we do have improving volumes as Tim mentioned in China sequentially in Q3. But that was compared to a recovery from COVID shutdown last year Q3. So again, when you look at -- you mentioned year-over-year volume challenges. That's -- again, China is improving as we look Q2 to Q3, but it's against a tough comp.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy. Your line is now open.
Kevin McCarthy: Yes. Good. Thank you. Good morning. Tim, a two-part question for you on auto OEM volumes. First, could you speak to the outlook for the back half of the year of some of the consultants are to be believed. It looks like there's quite divergent trends in Asia versus Europe for example. So curious to understand what you're baking in there. And then longer term, you referenced the supply deficit of 40 million units. Is the implication that that is the amount that needs to be recovered over some period of time? How do you view the medium to longer term outlook for global production?
Vince Morales: Hey, Kevin, this is Vince. I'll start and I'll let Tim add here. But just a reminder, again, just the same question we had -- the last question. China had a recovery in Q3 last year in auto production. So again, the numbers when you look on a year-over-year basis are a bit skewed.
Tim Knavish: Yeah. So, Kevin, we're bullish on auto despite some of the kind of affordability and interest rate questions. And here's why. We continue to be positively surprised by performance in Europe for example, where macros are worse than anywhere and yet the builds and sales remain resilient. The USR, when everybody was predicting that would drop was -- came in at a nice number of [15.8] (ph), which was a positive surprise, but still well below historical levels. We're starting to see -- we're seeing really good numbers out of China. Double digit builds in China, growth Q2. As Vince mentioned, we have a little weird comp situation here in Q3, but we do expect that to recover. So we're bullish on auto. We are bullish on auto for both the short term and medium term. Now, the $40 million is just straight math. You take the six-year average before COVID of annual builds, and you take what happened during COVID and you come up with that $40 million deficit. I have no idea how long it's going to take to make up that deficit and how spread out that will be. But it's not going to be zero. That deficit will need to be made up because in many countries you still have population growth, in many countries you still have cars per capita or cars per household being much lower than the developed world. And you've still got aging fleets. Mature parts of the world, US, Europe, average car in a road is like 11 or 12 years old. So the fundamentals say at some point, some significant part of that $40 million deficit needs to be made up. It's a question of how stretched out that will be.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of [indiscernible]. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I have one on segment margin. So your sector margins expanded 300 basis -- 330 basis points in Q2 and they were expanded 370 basis points in Q1. I understand we are past the peak in terms pricing initiatives, but we start to see really the widening gap of raw materials going down. And some of the volumes we are talking in the weak markets are bottoming. So what could prevent margins in Q2 and Q3 to expand -- to accelerate in terms of expansion again?
Vince Morales: Yeah, I think we talked about this a little earlier in the call. We do expect, again, incremental deflation to flow through to our P&L. We're starting to lap some pricing. We do, especially in the industrial businesses, we do see volume as the biggest catalyst in the back half of the year or in 2024 to help improve the margins as well as, Tim mentioned earlier, manufacturing -- PPG manufacturing as a key element and we laid that out in our May New York meeting. So those would be the four key elements that I would point to that would impact our margins in the back half of the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander. Your line is now open.
Laurence Alexander: Good morning. Just a quick one. What's the net drag for earnings and margins from the destocking you're doing this year? Just trying to think about kind of how that translates into the bridge for next year?
Vince Morales: Interesting question, Laurence. I'm doing the math in my head as we speak. But again, what we're seeing is, it's called mid to high single digit deflation on our invoices. We're realizing mid single digit inflation through our P&L. So I'm going to guess that that's $0.05 to $0.10 a quarter. Looking at John here to make sure my math is proper. But that would be the delay. That's not coming through on a real time basis into our P&L.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan. Your line is now open.
Arun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to understand kind of the volume outlook overall. It sounds like obviously aerospace and automotive OEM volumes have been trending positively and you expect that to continue. Now you're calling out some weakness in packaging and some of the other markets. So is there a path to maybe overall positive volume by the first half of next year given some easier comps in some of these industrial businesses and maybe a persistence of volume growth in auto and aerospace. So I'm probably thinking about how kind of volume growth overall trends for the next couple periods. Thanks.
Tim Knavish: Yeah, Arun. Great question, and one we talk about a lot. And I'll first qualify it by saying it's still pretty early given all the macro stuff that's happening around the world to really nail in our 2024 volume assumptions. But I will tell you that I'm optimistic based on a few things. We've talked a lot about auto and aerospace and Mexico and refinish and we fully expect those businesses to continue to perform. In addition to that, I've talked about a few businesses that we think are bouncing off the bottom and they're not small businesses for us. So eventually, bouncing off the bottom will turn to positive. China, we have a really strong presence in China. China ramp up in recovery been slower than expected. But if you think about that for 2024, that's a positive, particularly with any government stimulus. And the last one I would point out is Europe. And while Europe volume has been very muted, for the first half of the year, we still printed all-time record earnings in Q1, all-time record earnings in Q2. So the team has done a great job of positioning from both a margin and cost base standpoint. So any incremental uptick in volume across any of those businesses in Europe will be a real positive for us. So, still a little early. We'll talk more about that in the next earnings call, but there are a lot of indicators that could point to positive volume for us for 2024.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to John Bruno.
John Bruno: Thank you, Carla. This ends our second quarter earnings call. We appreciate everybody's interest and confidence in PPG. Have a good day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-04-21 13:35:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is Elliot, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter PPG Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Bruno, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
John Bruno: Thank you, Elliot, and good morning, everyone. Once again, this is John Bruno. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG and welcome you to our first quarter 2023 financial results conference call. Joining me on the call from PPG are Tim Knavish, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Vince Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our comments relate to the financial information released after U.S. equity markets closed on Thursday, April 20, 2023. We have posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on the Investor Center of our website, ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call, provide additional support for brief opening comments Tim will make shortly. Following management's perspective on the company's results for the quarter, we will move to a Q&A session. Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements, reflecting the company's current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC. Now let me introduce PPG President and CEO, Tim Knavish.
Timothy Knavish: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our first quarter 2023 earnings call. I will keep my comments brief, providing a few highlights on our first quarter financial performance and on our outlook. Our first quarter sales were a record $4.4 billion and were achieved despite the backdrop of macro challenges, including soft global industrial activity, elevated cost inflation, continued geopolitical issues and weakening demand in U.S. construction-related end use markets. We delivered adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $1.82, which is 33% higher than the first quarter of 2022. Our operating segment margin recovery accelerated, improving 380 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2022 as we work back toward our historical profile. The first quarter was aided by incremental 2023 selling price increases in the Performance Coatings reporting segment and in total company-wide. We have now fully offset all cumulative cost inflation incurred since early 2021. As I highlight some of the key drivers that drove the strong first quarter performance, an overriding theme is around the benefits we are deriving from our diverse portfolio. For example, PPG has the largest and most diversified aerospace business in the coatings industry. We are well positioned to serve our customers in the aerospace aftermarket and our backlogs expanded once again this quarter, following the reopening in China as customers need to replenish their stock with PPG's technologically advantaged products, including sealants and transparencies. We expect this business to continue to grow for the remainder of 2023 and beyond. Also, PPG has the largest architectural coatings business in Mexico, where current economic conditions remain robust and among the best in the world. The PPG Comex business continued their strong execution and delivered an 11th consecutive quarter of record sales. We are laser focused on driving organic growth. During the quarter, we benefited from several customer wins that included becoming the primary paint supplier at Walmart's 3,800 location that carry paint products. The expansion of our well-recognized Glidden DIY brand at Walmart and in our independent dealer channel will support further growth opportunities. The automotive refinish business has now installed 1,400 global MoonWalk machines, recently gaining traction in the U.S. with additional rollouts planned globally. About a third of these installations are new body shop wins. While overall demand conditions in Europe remain difficult, our leading position in automotive OEM in the region allowed us to support our customers during a sharp rise in automotive builds in the region, albeit off a historically low base. Our OEM sales volumes in the region were up mid-teen percentage for the quarter and we expect additional growth throughout 2023. The first quarter is typically a negative cash generation quarter due to our business seasonality. However, our strong earnings contributed to us generating positive operating cash flow in the first quarter for the first-time in seven years, as our operating cash generated was about $400 million higher than the first quarter of 2022. Our financial results were better than our preliminary first quarter update on April 3. This was mostly attributable to, stronger sales at the end of the month, a richer sales mix and lower costs than we predicted. A quick update to our very important ESG initiatives. We are prioritizing and delivering sustainably advantaged products and services to our customers and view this as a key lever for organic growth. Last year, we increased our sales from sustainably advantaged products to 39% of our total sales and continue to better define our product sustainability priorities to enable the sustainability ambitions of our customers. We look forward to sharing our new 2030 targets once our emissions reduction goals are validated by the science-based targets initiative. We will also be launching our 2022 ESG report in late May, which will include our progress against current environmental goals as well as our previously communicated diversity, equity and inclusion targets. Moving to our outlook. It is evident that challenges remain to the demand environment and in some cases, such as U.S. housing and construction, they're weakening. Despite these anticipated headwinds, we remain confident that our margin recovery momentum will continue. We're executing against the shopping list of opportunities, which we expect to contribute to strong year-over-year earnings growth in the second quarter and for the rest of 2023. This includes supporting our aerospace customers as they fulfill their strong order books, and we expect a second straight quarter of more than 10% sales volume growth year-over-year in this business. Also, as availability of raw materials returns to pre-pandemic levels, we expect our earnings to start benefiting from moderate deflation from recent historic inflation highs. As a reminder, aggregate raw material inflation since early 2021 remains at historically high levels. Additionally, our manufacturing is beginning to improve for multiyear production disruptions. And we expect this will generate efficiencies that will provide another earnings growth lever in the coming quarters. With respect to Europe, we are seeing coatings demand stabilize, albeit at lower levels which will enable further year-over-year earnings growth, aided by the actioning against our restructuring program. PPG has leading architectural coatings positions in several countries in Europe. Once the economy begins to improve, this will provide an additional earnings growth lever. I'm also pleased with the growth prospects for our auto refinish, protective coatings and Traffic Solutions businesses. These end-use markets have proven to be more demand resilient than in prior economic downturns and a couple of these are positioned for further growth to support infrastructure investment in the United States. In China, we expect moderate and continuous sequential quarterly improvement in domestic demand as the year progresses. This will be more evident on a year-over-year basis given the pandemic-related restrictions in China last year during the second and fourth quarters. In summary, for the past few quarters, we have been conveying our strong conviction that various earnings growth catalysts would be activated. I am pleased that we have reached this inflection point and continue to have strong conviction as reflected in our full year earnings guidance that year-over-year earnings growth will continue 2023. In addition, in this challenging macroeconomic period, you can also count on PPG's legacy of being highly focused on controlling the controllables, including managing our entire cost structure and optimizing our working capital. As I've begun my new role as CEO, I've challenged our team to focus on our advantages, prioritizing investments that will differentiate us and move the needle for our customers and our business. This includes advancing our digital capabilities throughout our businesses to improve our customers' productivity and further enhance our internal efficiencies. Our team is committed to accelerating earnings growth while preserving the strength of PPG's legacy. Thank you for your continued confidence in PPG. This concludes our prepared remarks. And Elliott, would you please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Duffy Fischer from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Duffy Fischer: Yeah. Good morning, guys and congrats on a nice quarter. My question is mostly around the sequential EPS and how that relates to history. So if you stripped out 2020 and 2021 and looked at the six years before that and last year, Q1 to Q2 has averaged up about $0.48 with all of those years being above $0.40. And at the midpoint of your guide, you're only up $0.28 this year. So how do you match those two? And then a similar question for first half versus second half, if you just use the midpoint to your guide, your second half is down $0.80 versus the first half. But in those same seven years, if you look historically, it's averaged down about $0.30. So could be conservatism, could be something different in the seasonality, maybe something around the loading of Walmart. But can you just kind of walk through why we should expect a lower -- or why we shouldn't expect kind of a higher number of history that to prevail?
Timothy Knavish: Hey. Sure, Duffy. Good to hear from you. First of all, let me give you a few high-level comments, and I'll let Vince fill in the gaps. On the Q1 to Q2 step up, we definitely had some one-timers in Q1. Notably, the Walmart load in, we had some insurance settlements related to past storms. We have a promotion for Comex Easter sales every year. More of those sales were pulled into Q1 than normal. And that's a big piece of the Q1 to Q2, and I'm sure Vince can give you more details. As for the rest of the year, we are cautious on volume for a number of reasons. Slower China opening of manufacturing. We're cautious on U.S. housing for the second half of the year. We're cautious on global industrial. So those are some of the few high levels. And Vince, you want to add a few details?
Vincent Morales: No. I think we quantified the Walmart business. The load-in for us in Q1 was about $40 million. Again, just a little more color. The Comex business has a very large Easter campaign. The Easter campaign was split last year between Q1 and Q2. This year, most of the load started in Q1. So we're not going to have that traditional step up. And we did see really good activity in Europe auto. And again, our prediction is, well, that's still going to be a very strong business. Q1 was a very strong European auto.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi from Baird. Your line is open.
Ghansham Panjabi: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys and congrats on all the progress to start the year. I guess, first off, on auto refinish and your outlook for directional improvement in 2Q. Is that just a function of comparability from the year-ago period and the China reopening? And also going back to some of the volume weakness in Europe and North America for auto refinish in the first quarter. Can you just give us some more color on the customer order pattern timing that you called out? Thanks.
Timothy Knavish: Yeah. Sure. Thanks for the question, Ghansham. Let me start off by saying, I have full confidence, high confidence in our auto refinish business globally going forward as well as over the last several quarters because our key to key value proposition is best-in-class. What you see in refinish, if you look at Q4 then to Q1, then what we're saying for Q2, this business, because of the two-step distribution, you really need to look at it over a multi-quarter basis just because it's hard sometimes to project the order pattern of our independent distribution. So I would look at Q1 in that lights and rather look at instead of an individual quarter, look at it over multiple quarters. But we have strong backlogs across the body shops, and it’s really driven by two things other than paint. It’s driven by parts shortages, and it’s driven by labor shortages. So those backlogs remain. And so, this actual sellout to the collision industry remains strong. There’s just some fluctuation in independent distribution ordering patterns.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Byrne from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Stephen Byrne: Yes. Thank you. I'd like to drill in a little bit on your commercial strategy in U.S. architectural. It seems like you have a similar offering now at the independent hardware stores and Walmart with this Glidden platform. And between those in The Home Depot arrangement in your own stores, it seems like it could be nearly 10,000 locations. My question for you is, how would you split your sales in architectural paint in the U.S. between those various buckets? And where do you think that could go in the next few years and could this cannibalize sales in your own stores?
Timothy Knavish: Thanks, Steve. Great question. So we don't expect cannibalization. Let me explain a little bit about what we're doing. Glidden is by far, our strongest and best known DIY brand in the U.S. And historically, despite that strong brand strength, we lacked distribution. So obviously, we partner with The Home Depot with Glidden. We're now partnering with Walmart with Glidden. And we've always partnered with our independent dealers with Glidden. One of your points, typically, we don't carry Glidden at our own company stores. So think about it as big box home improvement plus Walmart plus private dealers. The type of customer that buys paint at Walmart Is very different than the type of customer that buys paint at The Home Depot. And so what we’re really doing with these recent moves is expanding distribution and providing access to a strong DIY brand across multiple different types of consumers, multiple different price points of consumers and expanded geography. So that’s really what we’re doing here. And there’s very little conflict between those three pieces and certainly very little cannibalism.
Operator: Our next question comes from John McNulty from BMO. Your line is open.
John McNulty: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Tim, your first quarter margins, I don't think we've seen them this high other than maybe twice in the last 15 years, and that's even with adding Traffic Solutions, which I think should be dragging it down in 1Q. So I guess, one, where can we see margins go this year for PPG? And then what are some of the big factors? Is it all price versus raws? How should we think about mix, some of the efficiency measures you were speaking to? I guess can you help us to frame that a bit?
Timothy Knavish: Well, we're on a -- as you've heard me say, John, we are on a margin recovery journey. And as happy as we are with the 380 basis point improvement, we're pleased with that progress, but we are not satisfied with where we are. We are not back to historical levels. We've still got more work to do and we're confident that we will continue to see improvement. This frankly, is our second straight quarter of year-over-year margin improvement. We expect Q2 to be the third straight quarter of year-over-year margin improvement. But we've got more work more work to do here. And it's both on the value capture side and getting paid for the products and services that we deliver. It's mix driven. And certainly, we've begun to see some moderation on the cost side.
Vincent Morales: Yeah, John. This is Vince. Just to give some more numeric guidance here. We're down still 150 basis points, 200 basis points versus our prior high watermarks, which we hit several times and several times in the past 10 years in the first quarter. So we have other levers. Tim mentioned one in the opening comments. We're still not back to where we want to be on manufacturing. Our volumes on a multiyear basis are still down. And again, cost control, which is a legacy here, we feel we could do better. So we still have multiple levers to get back to prior high watermarks and then eventually hoping to exceed those.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christopher Parkinson from Mizuho. Your line is open.
Christopher Parkinson: Great. Thank you so much. Can you just offer a little bit more color about what's embedded in both your aerospace and refinish guidance levels? Just how you're thinking about for the year? Does aerospace include Boeing's further build rates, 737 MAX in China, wide-body, some color on that. And then on the refinish side, just any color about how you think the body shop world, specifically in the U.S. is still dealing with labor constraints and so on and so forth. You have seen pretty optimistic or actually, bullish comments for the second quarter. It'd just be great to know what's underscoring that in particular versus '19 levels? Thank you so much.
Timothy Knavish: Sure. Thanks, Chris. So on the aero side, you mentioned a number of things there and the answer would be yes to all of them. We have a number of positive catalysts there. The China reopening, even though China -- international China widebody is still well below 2019 levels. Domestic travel alone drives a lot of MRO activity for us. So that we expect to continue to grow. You mentioned one of our big OEM customers. You've seen their 2023 output so far is much better. So that certainly helps. We've got -- the backlog continues to grow on both OEM and aftermarket, particularly on the MRO side, so -- I'm sorry, on the transparency side. So we've got some catch-up of that backlog built into our planning. And the military segment remains very strong. So a lot of what we've got built in is the underlying demand strength but also our ability to continue to increase our output because right now, in many parts of our business in aerospace, we can sell whatever we can produce. On the refinish side, again, you have to take out these quarter-to-quarter fluctuations. Fundamentally, the collision business is still very strong. And so if the body shops are able to get more cars through because they're able to improve supply on parts, improve labor, we're in a much better supply situation because most of our supply dynamics are behind us. So we're really poised to capture whatever throughput output -- I'm sorry, throughput increase, they're able to achieve, which they're highly motivated to do because their backlogs are so strong.
Vincent Morales: Just to put some numbers to the [indiscernible]. Just to put some numbers to the China aerospace opportunity, international flights to and from China are down about 70% versus pre-pandemic still. Domestic travel in China is down about 20% versus pre-pandemic. Big – obviously big market for all the aerospace players. And again, for us, that’s all opportunity in both OEM and our aftermarket business.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning. Hi, Tim. Just on raw materials. What's embedded in your second half guidance in terms of declines year-over-year? And just on pricing, where are you still implementing price increases?
Timothy Knavish: Sure. Thanks, David. On raw materials, well, let's start with -- the high-level statement is, we expect to continue to see moderation as we move through the year. And what we actually realized in Q1 was essentially flat on a year-over-year basis. We expect Q2 to be about low-single digits down on a year-over-year basis. And beyond that, we expect continued further moderation, but hard to quantify the scale of that at this point because there's still so many moving parts. But that's what I would say on the raw material side. On the pricing side, we did achieve more pricing in Q1. We were up 8% in total. Above 70% of that is carryover. We were able to achieve some additional pricing in the quarter on an incremental basis. The vast majority of that being in the Performance Coatings segment. So I think as we move forward on price, we'll comp -- we'll start to comp higher increases as we move through the year from last year. So the increments will be smaller but we are highly confident that for Q2, Q3, Q4, we will print positive price numbers.
Vincent Morales: And just a reminder, we're still at a 40 year high inflation rates in our sector, even with this moderation.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. Two-part question. So first, when you look at your auto OEM prices in the quarter, were they comparable to the industrial segment in general that is industrial was up, I don't know, maybe 8%? Is that what auto OEM prices did or were they higher or were they lower? Can you calibrate that? And second...
Vincent Morales : Jeff, they were certainly in line. Sorry, go ahead.
Jeff Zekauskas: Yeah. I'm puzzled that your raw materials were flat year-over-year in that oil was $100 a barrel in the first quarter of '22, and propylene was $0.60 a pound. And I believe that maybe your raw materials probably peaked in the second quarter of 2022 and then came down. So like where is the inflation coming from or there must be something -- it seems to be unusual about your raw material basket and that it should be lower than where it was in the first quarter of last year, at least from an outside perspective.
Timothy Knavish: Hey, Jeff. I'm going to take the auto question. So yes, auto OEM was consistent with segment pricing, which was about that 8%. And again, I want to remind you, the vast majority of that is carryover, especially in that business. And the new pricing there, much of that was actually negotiated last year. And part of the process in negotiations with auto OEMs is magnitude and timing of implementation. So that's the answers to your first question. Vince, do you want to take raws?
Vincent Morales: Yeah, Jeff. I think when you look at our raw materials, one of the things we've talked about the last several quarters was pulling that through our inventory. And if you look, we ended the year -- we talked about this in the back half of last year, we ended Q3 and Q4 with abnormally high inventory balances. We were buying raw materials when we can get them. So we have to work that inventory down. If you look at our inventory balance actually in Q1, it's still elevated relative to what our expectations are. So it's really a matter of how we're pulling those prior purchases through our inventory and into our cost of sales. We still have some, again, inventory to work down as we get into the peak season here in Q2. And we'll see some more realized benefit once we are able to work through that inventory.
Timothy Knavish: Yeah, Jeff. To your basket question, our raw material basket is largely what it’s always been. But there are parts of that raw material basket that we’re still seeing year-over-year inflation in. Pigments, additives, extenders, inorganics, a number of items where we’re still seeing year-over-year increase.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you. Thank you very much. I'm wondering if you could just help us better understand how March went. It sounds like, obviously, it was stronger than you expected particularly in the back half of the quarter, in which particular areas of your business that strength came in? And if there was any particular driving force for it and whether it's continued into April so far to the extent you have data you can?
Timothy Knavish: Sure. Sure, Vincent. The parts of our business that were very strong as we move through March, I would say, our aerospace business, our auto business, particularly Europe auto. And as Vince alluded to earlier, our Comex business was stronger than we had expected as we saw more pull forward of the Easter campaign.
Vincent Morales: And just a reminder, when we said this in January, March is typically 40%, 50% of the quarter in terms of the size of the quarter, financially. So again, when we have a strong March, it’s very helpful.
Operator: Our next question comes from Josh Spector from UBS. Your line is open.
Josh Spector: Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So I just want to poke on the guidance again for the year. So if I think about some of the one-timers in 1Q, if I say, they're maybe $0.20 in EPS seasonally adjust first half implies the year's kind of at the midpoint of your guidance for the year about 710. No incremental benefit from raw materials. And where the areas where you talk about volume weakness, China housing industrial, maybe we're talking about 20%, 25% of your sales, but you're optimistic on auto OEM, refinish, aero, which more than offsets that. So I mean, is it a fair take to look at this and say, there's really minimal benefit of raw materials in the second half, similar benefit of pricing and you're just like pushing on where volumes are today or is that an entirely wrong way to look at it?
Timothy Knavish: Well, on our second half guide, first thing I'll say is, it's still 10% EPS growth Y-o-Y in an extremely challenging environment. And so I just want to lead with that. And most of the concern for second half is more volume focused. We're -- continued slowdown, U.S. housing. We've got uncertainty on the general industrial side. And really, uncertainty on the pace of recovery of industrial/manufacturing in China. So those are really the key drivers to the second half.
Vincent Morales: Yeah. This is Vince. I'll just add. Again, it's still cloudy when we look at the economy. We do know that those countries are raising interest rates. There's typically a delay between interest rate increases and consumer effect. We're seeing that in different parts of our portfolio around the world. So we just remain somewhat cautious on the delayed effect on that interest rate increase environment. As Tim mentioned, I’ll echo, we’re not sure about the pace of recovery in China. We do feel it’s going to be – our guide includes a moderate recovery continuing, elongated recovery. That’s beneficial from our perspective because we don’t see that creating more commodity inflation, but that – the pace of that recovery is still uncertain at this time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov from KeyCorp (ph). Your line is open.
Aleksey Yefremov: Thanks and good morning, everyone. In architectural in the U.S., can you share any data or sentiment from Pro paint contractors? How is the backlog changing here?
Timothy Knavish: Yeah. Backlogs have remained surprisingly robust despite everything you see in the news and despite what's happening in construction, driven by labor shortages primarily. So the backlogs remain strong. And for our Pro business, the omnichannel of our Pro business was up almost 10% for the quarter. So we are seeing continued good activity in the Pro space in architectural in United States.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Sison from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Michael Sison: Hey, guys. Nice start to the year. Tim, just curious, in terms of the second half with the 10% EPS growth, I apologize I miss this, but what do you expect for volumes? What's sort of the range of outcomes for the company? Is it down, flat, maybe even up on easy comps? Just curious. Thank you.
John Bruno: Hey, Mike. This is John. I’ll take that one. So as Tim pointed, there’s a few factors that we’re considering in the volumes forecast that’s in the guide. I would say that it’s down slightly in our second half guidance, Mike, overall, based on all the feedback that Tim provided.
Operator: Our next question comes from Peter Clark from Societe Generale. Your line is open.
Peter Clark: Yes. Good morning, everyone. Just looking at your number one priority of getting your margin back and particularly on the Industrial Coatings because obviously, you were picking at over 18%. I know there's been mix changes. You bought in lower margin acquisitions that you're working on. But if I play with your full year guidance, you're sort of inferring this margin recovering to about 14% ex-amortization. So you're still 400 basis points of drift. I understand it's challenging. Volumes are still not great. But is there anything structurally that stops you getting back to that sort of level in the next few years that you were achieving back in '16 and '17 level? Thank you.
Timothy Knavish: Yeah. Thanks for the question. There's nothing structurally preventing us from getting back to those levels. The big driver for us, I would say two things. Number one, volume. Volume is still down significantly from the time periods that you referenced. And so just the leverage from that. And then the other one is, operating efficiencies. All of the supply chain disruptions that we've had over the last couple of years, our manufacturing costs have not been at benchmark. And you heard that we did see some improvement in that in Q1 and we're expecting further improvement as we move forward. So there's nothing structurally preventing us from getting back to peak margins in that segment.
Operator: Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC. Your line is open.
Arun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple of questions around margins. It looks like your margins were up at around 13% level for EBIT in the first quarter. Do you see continued growth there and what kind of volume growth would you expect to get that back into the mid-teens to high-teens level? Thanks.
Timothy Knavish: Well, we absolutely expect to see continued margin growth everyone, (ph) as I mentioned earlier, we're confident that the next couple of quarters will show continued year-over-year margin improvement. The volume question, as John mentioned, we're going to have volume challenges likely potentials for upside, but our base case is that it will be a tougher volume second half.
Vincent Morales: Yeah, Arun. This is Vince. If you look at some of the nearer term levers we have, the rich mix we benefited from in Q1, we expect to continue against some of our key technology businesses, aerospace, automotive. Tim mentioned about the strength of the Mexican economy. We have leading positions in Mexico and several of our businesses, including Comex. And as Tim mentioned, we’re starting to see early signs of manufacturing optimization. Still a long – we still have a long way to go there, but that’s something internally we’re managing. And as I mentioned earlier, we have laser focus on our costs, especially with the volume outlook and the concern around consumer spending that I talked about earlier.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from VRP. Your line is open.
Kevin McCarthy: Thanks. Good morning. A few questions on your auto OEM coatings business. What are you baking in for global builds in terms of your annual EPS guide? And would you also comment on any meaningful share shifts by region and how the EV penetration is playing out for PPG?
Timothy Knavish: Sure. Thanks, Kevin. Our base case on auto OEM for the year on builds is low-single digits with potential for upside depending what happens with a whole number of things around affordability in China. But our base case is low-single digits. We have not seen a huge amount of share shift. We did see some in China as we were executing our margin recovery strategy. We did lose some of the lower margin business, but what's historically happened there, Kevin, is they ultimately come back for a number of reasons. And third part of your question was around EVs. What I could say on EVs is, we're extremely pleased with our progress there. We're winning on EVs where EVs are winning, which is China. So we're doing well with the number one China EV player, and they're doing well. If you look at builds now of EVs, they were up over 10% of global builds now are EVs. And in China, which is where we're having most of our success, over 20% now of all vehicles sold in China are EVs. So we like what we're seeing from a penetration standpoint and we're pleased with our progress, but still a lot more to do there.
Vincent Morales: Just to add, again, we came into the year with a low to mid-single digit projection on global builds for the year. Q1 was – for the industry was 5%. So Q1 outperformed the initial projections for the industry.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Leithead with Barclays. Your line is open.
Michael Leithead: Perfect. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Real briefly, just on North American architectural, there's obviously a few moving pieces with all the wins you flagged. So I guess, high level, what do you assume or you think the industry is growing at this year versus what do you think PPG is going to be able to grow at?
Timothy Knavish: I think it's -- the reality is the industry in totality is going to be soft, driven by what's happened on two fronts. Number one, housing. And number two, you still have some post-COVID hangover from the DIY side due to what everybody did, painting their houses during that period. So industry-wide, that's what we're seeing. For PPG, we've got a number of programs, as you say, with obviously our Walmart win, the launch of The Home Depot Pro program. Our mix were not as big on new build as we are on construction and maintenance. So we're thinking about it a little bit better than the rest of the industry. But driven by housing and driven by DIY, we expect this overall to be a challenging year in architectural U.S.
Vincent Morales: Yeah. And Mike, just another reminder here. We're -- paint is typically the last part of the cycle. So as housing starts have come down the past several quarters, we're still working off those backlogs from a paint perspective. If you look at the mixture of housing starts, roughly 60% are single-family. Those have come down already. I’m not sure if they bought them yet or not. There’s some positive signs that they at least flattened. If you look at multifamily, multifamily is a still a very high record. And those will be delivered late this year or maybe early next year. And we do think there’s an air pocket after that to the credit liquidity, et cetera. Again, 60% single-family, 40% multifamily. So we haven’t seen the negative effects at multifamily.
Operator: Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Laurence Alexander: Good morning. Could you just briefly flesh out how your outlook for U.S. infrastructure and particularly current view, kind of sort of your assumptions for the back half of the year and the landscape for -- or the pipeline for potential bolt-on M&A and particularly like how you're thinking about opportunities in the emerging markets?
Timothy Knavish: Yeah. Sure, Laurence. On the -- the outlook for infrastructure, we're quite positive on that as the infrastructure spending is starting and there's a lot more projects in the queue. And we have a number of portfolio positions that should help us there. Our Protective Coatings business, some of our industrial coatings business and certainly, our Traffic Solutions business. So we're positive on that ramping up as we move through not only this year but into the future.
Vincent Morales: Yeah, Laurence. On the M&A environment, yeah, I'd still say it's somewhat active, not consistent. Historically, it's been more active. There's certainly some deals or some files that are percolating of the small kind of vintage. So there's still an issue if you're a buyer or a seller, coming up with a price based on the past 12-month financials. Again, we said many times, we would expect a few deals to get done in our space each year and that's our same expectation this year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Laurent Favre from Exane BNP Paribas. Your line is open.
Laurent Favre: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Two very quick questions, please. The first one is, on manufacturing. Can you size that opportunity for us? And is it just about China where you see that COVID issues in the early part of Q1 or do you also see an opportunity in Europe and U.S.? And the second question was just on marine and protective. It sounds like that was a bit surprise for you in Q1. You thought it would be down, was up. I'm just wondering, if you can share your thoughts there. Thank you.
John Bruno: Hi, Laurent. This is John. I'll start with the manufacturing one, and Tim will take the second part. So if you go back to January of '22, we talked about significant manufacturing challenges we had due to supply disruptions in the fourth quarter of '21. And we quoted about a $0.20 EPS impact. That was the height of the impacts. And every quarter since, we've had some type of negativity. Now this quarter, the first quarter of 2023, we were close to being breakeven on a year-over-year basis, and we expect that to get better as we go forward. So the objective is for us to claw back all of the inefficiencies that we've had in the last five quarters.
Timothy Knavish: Yeah, I'll take the protective and marine side. The way I think about this business right now is, it's well positioned for infrastructure, near-shoring, energy, a lot of the investments that are happening around those areas. And also, in marine, where we have really pivoted our focus to marine aftermarket, which is doing well. So when you add those all together, we were up high-single digits in Q1 and we expect to be up mid-single digits again in Q2. So that’s one of the businesses that we’re pretty bullish on.
Operator: Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Your line is open.
Frank Mitsch: Good morning, gentlemen. Congrats on the start to the year. Vince, you took a $144 million charge due to the pension benefit obligation. I'm curious as to what sort of future cost benefit might we expect from that action? And Tim, obviously, very impressive progress on price and your expectation is that you're going to have positive price for the balance of the year. But as we see deflation from record raws, any concerns on potential price givebacks in any of your businesses? Thank you.
Vincent Morales: Thanks, Frank. This is Vince. Yeah. Just a reminder, we do have a step up in 2023, a non-cash step-up as it relates to pension expense. Fairly significant, $10 million to $15 million a quarter. We did annuitized a portion of our pension plan. The benefit from that from an expense perspective is fairly minimal. It's about $1 million or $2 million a quarter. So nothing sizable relative to step-up we've had coming into the year.
Timothy Knavish: Yeah. And Frank, on price, so on protective, we expect very little, if any, any price give back as we -- I'm sorry, I said protective, I meant performance. On performance, in total, we expect very little give back as we move through the year. On industrial, I'll remind, about 30% of our industrial segment business, the pricing is based on index arrangements. So if there is raw material deflation, those indexes will kick in, but there's a delay of multiple quarters depending on the contract. So that's more of a '24 issue for us. And beyond that, more generally, I'd say, we -- obviously, we watch this very closely every day and churn would be our primary indicator if there's something we need to act upon. Our competitors are facing the same basic cost structure and cost inputs that we are and we watch our churn. And to-date, we've seen very little churn, as I mentioned earlier, other than a little bit in Asia.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Roberts from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
John Roberts: Thank you. Where within the Performance segment were you able to get additional price or was that mix with the aerospace business just improving in the mix?
Timothy Knavish: Well, there were both factors. The mix element, part of it was our aerospace business, no doubt. As the first part on where we're able to get price, we got incremental price in almost all parts of our performance segment. So architectural, refinish. And I'd just remind that while we are seeing moderation and some raw material inflation, we're still seeing inflation in wages and indirects and some raw material categories. So I'd say that incremental price was largely in response to incremental inflation.
Vincent Morales: Yeah, John. This is Vince. Just for clarity, we -- as we break out these numbers for you guys externally, we have price separate. We put in business mix, regional mix, product mix. We combine that with volume. And if you look at both our original guide and our updated guide or updated final numbers, we benefited from incremental pricing, stand-alone pricing, so invoice pricing. Secondarily and separately, we benefited from regional mix. Tim mentioned some of our business, including Latin America were higher than our expectations. We benefited from business mix. Some of our higher technology businesses were higher than our expectation as we called out in both of our releases. And we benefited within business from product mix. So we hit, I think, three big categories for us.
Operator: Our final question today comes from Jaideep Pandya from On Field Research. Your line is open.
Jaideep Pandya: Thanks. First, I want to go back to the EV point. Could you just give us some color on what is the content per vehicle for ICE versus EV? And in your top EV customers, are they all sort of the top Chinese companies? That's my first question. And then second question is on the Industrial Coatings, where you alluded to weakness in the U.S. Have you seen sort of the destocking coming to an end in Q1 or are you expecting further destocking of weaker volumes from the coil exclusion categories in the U.S., especially in Q2 and Q3? Thank you.
Timothy Knavish - CEO: Thanks, Jaideep. I'm going to be backwards with how you asked them. Just destocking, the -- our Industrial segment businesses, there's not a tremendous amount of inventory held at our customers. And so any significant destocking, whether it's -- frankly, whether it's industrial or performance is largely behind us. But the softening that we mentioned in general industrial and in particular here in the U.S. is across a couple of key segments. One of them you already mentioned, and that's coil because that's largely tied to construction. But we've also seen softness in some consumer-facing areas, electronic materials, kitchen and bakeware appliance. Unfortunately, there's some positives offsetting some of that as well on HD -- heavy-duty equipment, transportation, powder. But in general, those were the segments that were a bit soft. On your EV question, so the content per vehicle, unfortunately, there's not a simple one number answer to do that because it depends upon the different technologies that are adopted by each of the OEMs. But what I will tell you is that the potential content per vehicle for functional and specialty protective coatings is significant and in the same scale as the content per vehicle of conventional layering systems, which can -- that can range between $90 to $125 a vehicle. You had a question embedded in there about who are we working with. Who are we successful with in China. Generally speaking, we're working with all of the OEMs, whether it's Chinese or non-Chinese, but we have had most of our commercial success thus far with the number one player in EVs in China.
Vincent Morales: Jaideep, this is Vince. I want to go back to your industrial question and maybe broaden it a little bit. If you think about PPG, 2022 was a difficult year. We had significant exposure in Europe, where we saw the geopolitical items really affect our volumes. As everybody is fully aware, China had multiple months of shutdowns in 2022. And the U.S. was one of our most stable businesses. And Mexico and Latin America continued to grow. If you fast forward into 2023, we feel Europe stabilized, and we're able to then put our cost stewardship on that. We feel China and Asia is going to grow. So two big pieces of our portfolio pointing in the right direction as it compared to last year. And we still feel very strong about Latin America and grow, and we're seeing some softness in the U.S. in industrial, certainly in the construction markets, but we're offsetting the majority of that with aerospace and automotive, protective, as Tim mentioned. So again, I think for us, we had a difficult 2022, and we’re lapping some of that in 2023. The only thing we see softening is really those pockets in the U.S.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the call back over to John Bruno.
John Bruno: Thank you, Elliott. We appreciate everyone's continued interest and confidence in PPG. This concludes our first quarter earnings call.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-01-20 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is Emily, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fourth Quarter PPG Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Bruno, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
John Bruno: Thank you, Emily, and good morning, everyone. Once again, this is John Bruno. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG and welcome you to our fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results conference call. Joining me on the call from PPG are Tim Knavish, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Vince Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our comments relate to the financial information released after U.S. equity markets closed on Thursday, January 19, 2023. We have posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on the Investor Center of our website at ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call provide additional support to the brief opening comments Tim will make shortly. Following management's perspective on the Company's results for the quarter, we will move to a Q&A session. Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements, reflecting the Company's current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG’s operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The Company's is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The Company has provided, in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC. Now, let me introduce PPG's President and CEO, Tim Knavish.
Tim Knavish: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call and my first earnings call as CEO. I'll keep my comments brief to provide a few highlights on the recent quarter, the year 2022 and our outlook. Let me start with the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter sales of $4.2 billion were near the record levels achieved in 2021 despite significant unfavorable foreign currency translation. Sales were aided by our strong U.S. automotive refinish volume growth as supply chain disruptions started to moderate, and our order books remain robust. In 2022, our automotive refinish coatings business delivered over 2,000 net new body shop wins as customers continue to value the product technology and industry-leading services and capabilities that this business delivers every day, including what we believe is the best-in-class body shop full repair product [Indiscernible]. Also aiding our sales were record results in our PPG Comex business in Mexico as our team continued their strong execution and delivered another record quarter of sales and earnings. PPG Comex sales are now more than $1 billion on annual sales basis, another record year for this business. Our aerospace business continued to recover, delivering organic sales growth of more than 20% on a year-over-year basis, even with continued supply chain challenges. With an initial reopening in China, strong global order book, increased military related growth and PPG's advantaged technology products we expect this business to continue to grow in 2023 and beyond. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.22, above the midpoint of $1.13 from the guidance we provided in October. This included more than 20% year-over-year segment earnings improvement driven by selling price realization and strong cost management. On a two-year stack, selling prices were up about 19%. We achieved this segment earnings improvement despite the significant and unpredictable shutdowns in China from COVID-19 that were worse than what we had anticipated going into the quarter and these have continued into the first quarter. In Europe, despite demand remaining soft, earnings were similar to prior year due to strong selling price realization and cost management. We also continue to execute our previously announced restructuring programs and realization of acquisition synergies and delivered about $20 million of savings in the quarter. Now a few comments on the full year 2022. The challenges were many, including unprecedented cost inflation, unexpected geopolitical issues in Europe, disruptive and unpredictable shutdowns in China, strong appreciation of the U.S. dollar and rapid escalation in interest rates in the United States. Though all of these factors impacted our sales and margin performance, the PPG team responded to these challenges, including rapidly implementing real-time selling price increases that, by early 2023, will offset all cumulative cost inflation incurred since early 2021. Given the more difficult macro backdrop, we also announced, and are quickly executing new cost savings initiatives with particular focus on Europe. In 2022, we also made good progress on key strategic initiatives, including strengthening our relationship with the Home Depot, as evidenced by the launch of our new U.S. architectural Pro program, and winning more shelf space with our Glidden Max-Flex spray paint. In addition, we were honored to be awarded Home Depot's 2022 Overall Innovation Award, which was the first time that a paint supplier has achieved this distinction. Our partnership with the Home Depot continues to be a great opportunity for significant growth in the coming years. The PPG team continued the integration of our recent acquisitions, including timely execution of acquisition-related synergies. These businesses are all executing well and will provide the Company with increased organic growth prospects in the next few years. We made some smaller, but strategically important powder coating acquisitions, which adds needed manufacturing capacity and greatly aids our technological capabilities in this fast-growing product category. In 2022, we once again lowered our SG&A as a percent of sales, decreasing by about 100 basis points, including the delivery of about $65 million in restructuring savings in the year. While working capital remains higher than we would like, we made solid progress in the second half 2022 to lower our inventories on a sequential basis. We expect cash conversion to return to our historical levels in 2023 and have exited 2022 with a strong and flexible balance sheet. Throughout 2022, we took actions to bolster our ESG program, including announcing our commitment to the science-based targets initiative, issuing our first-ever diversity report, and finally obtaining shareholder approval to declassify our Board and remove supermajority voting requirements. In 2023, I expect our team to continue their strong progress by introducing additional sustainable products for our customers and unveiling our new 2030 sustainability goals. In summary, for 2022, we did not meet our own earnings expectations. But through the resiliency of the global PPG team, we did deliver record sales of $17.7 billion and set the foundation for many accretive growth initiatives. Now moving to our outlook. As we outlined in our press release, we expect the Q1 demand environment to remain similar to the fourth quarter. However, as the year progresses, we are more confident that we have several catalysts that will enable PPG to drive earnings growth, including improvements in the supply chain, which will further moderate raw material costs, and we expect to see this flow through our P&L more prominently starting in the second quarter. Also, our strong position in China that will benefit us as the COVID reopening progresses. With respect to Europe, we expect coatings demand stabilization beginning in the second quarter, resulting in higher year-over-year earnings. In the U.S., we will benefit from the continued recovery of the aerospace and automotive refinish businesses and the current strength of our order books in both of those businesses. Also in the U.S., our recent share gains in the architectural business will help buffer lower demand from a softer U.S. housing market. As a reminder, our overall exposure to the U.S. new home construction market is relatively small, only about 1% of our global revenues. As we said last quarter, we believe our global portfolio mix will prove more resilient in the coming quarters if we experience a broader global economic decline. As normal course of business, we will be highly focused on controlling the controllables, including managing our costs and optimizing working capital. In summary, while economic conditions are challenging in the near term, I expect segment margin recovery to continue in the first quarter and remain confident about the future earnings capabilities of PPG, and we certainly see a path to return to prior peak operating margins with opportunities to exceed it. As I begin my tenure as CEO, the PPG team is laser focused on delivering improved financial results, including recovering our historical margin profile, and executing on all levers to return our portfolio to mid- to high-teen percentage segment margins. At a high level, you can expect me and the PPG team to elevate our collaboration with our customers, bringing them innovative, sustainable and differentiated products and solutions, which will enable our customers to improve their productivity and growth and allow us to improve our own organic growth performance. We'll simplify and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain efficiencies to reduce complexity and deliver productivity for both PPG and our customers. And we will preserve our legacy of prudent management of our balance sheet, continuing to prioritize cash deployment for shareholder value creation. I plan to share more details on our key initiatives as the year progresses. In closing, I am looking forward to leading this great team, 50,000 employees around the world, as we continue to partner with our customers to create mutual value. This year marks PPG's 140th year anniversary, and I strongly believe that our best days are ahead thanks to our people, industry-leading products, innovative technologies and great customers. Thank you for your continued confidence in PPG. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, Emily, would you please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, David.
David Begleiter: Tim, for the full year, consensus was around $7 per share, which will imply a pretty big ramp up from the Q1 levels. Is that a number that you think you can -- that can be achieved or get close to as year progresses?
Tim Knavish: Yes. Right now, David, just because of all the uncertainty in many different avenues of our business, we're focused on Q1. And clearly, Q1 has some hangover elements from Q4, particularly around China. We do believe, as I said in my comments, that there are the shopping list of multiple potential earnings growth catalyst for 2023, including China, including aero, including refinish, including Comex, EVs, THD, literally a shopping list of potential earnings catalyst, but we'll get through this hangover of Q1 and then reassess and communicate more as we move forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Sison with Wells Fargo. Michael, please go ahead.
Michael Sison: Tim, I think your outlook for the first quarter is down mid-single digits for volumes. Can you walk us through what the volume outlook is from your less cyclical markets and your more cyclical markets to give us a gauge of kind of where those are at for the first quarter?
Tim Knavish: Sure, Mike. I mean the biggest impact is again China. Typically, in China, March is a very big month for us, okay. And our assumption for China in Q1 is that they'll see a second wave to some degree after Chinese New Year. And so our base case is that we won't really see significant China recovery until starting in Q2. Additionally, on the architectural side, particularly in Europe, we would normally, in Q1, see a fairly robust stock up ahead of paint season. And because of everything that's happening in Europe that we see some buildup, but not nearly what we would see in a normal year. And then finally, one of our top-performing businesses, PPG Comex, typically has a very strong Q4, and it had an even stronger-than-expected Q4 in 2022. So there's a little bit of just timing there, even though we expect another great year from that business, there is timing issue in Q1. So those are the three main factors, I would say.
Vince Morales: Mike, this is Vince. Just [Indiscernible] the other businesses. We're not seeing any tone change in the businesses sequentially again, good strong pace of recovery in aerospace, a solid, consistent growth in refinish, auto OEM, consistent -- generally consistent quarter-over-quarter, starting to recover in Europe. So again, we're not seeing any significant changes in some of the other key businesses either.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho. Christopher, please go ahead.
Christopher Parkinson: Just a real quick question on pricing. Can you just comment on the current pricing environment just given the macro movement in, let's say, raw materials and then also several management changes across the sector. Are you still seeing the ability to sustain price throughout the year? Just any commentary would be incredibly helpful.
Tim Knavish: Yes. Sure. Thanks for the question, Chris. You saw on the print that we put up 11% for Q4, 19% on a two-year stack, sequentially it was 18% on a two-year stack in Q3. So we still have pricing momentum. We will have additional price in Q1 targeted by business. We've got some carryover impact in Q1 as well. As for what's happening out there in the world besides PPG, all the coatings companies are facing the same inflation inputs that we are, be it raw materials, which we focus a lot on but there's also significant inflation outside of raw materials that we are all experiencing. So, we see a continuation of positive pricing as we enter the year. And beyond that, a lot of it depends what happens on the inflationary environment, but that's our view at this point in the year, Chris.
Operator: The next question today comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please go ahead.
Ghansham Panjabi: Hi, guys, good morning. As it relates to the U.S. architectural, I mean, obviously, there's bifurcation so far between yourself and some of the professional markets. How do you sort of see that evolving over time as the year unfolds? And then for European architectural, just given the extent of the volume weakness in the markets, can you just give us a sense as to how competitive the pricing backdrop is in the industry, just given the volume weakness?
Tim Knavish: Sure. Thanks, Ghansham. So let me start with the U.S. environment. I'll start at a high level from a macro standpoint. Clearly, DIY is down partly because of what's happening with consumer confidence, but also a bit a holdover from the COVID piece of DIY. And clearly, new housing construction going down, again, only 1% of our sales, but those two segments are down. Fortunately, for us, we're much stronger in commercial and maintenance. And there, we still see backlogs with our customers. I think you know we do a survey every quarter with our professional customers here in the United States. And their backlogs are still floating in that 12- to 13-week range. So we still see some good demand there. And then as we move forward, we expect to continue to see growth from our Home Depot Pro program moving forward. Now going over to Europe, the volume started to really deteriorate after the invasion last Q1, and was down double digits throughout all of 2022. The professional painter business down not nearly as much more in the single digits, but as we enter 2022, we'll see particularly for Q1 -- I'm sorry, 2023, for Q1, we've got a little bit of a comp issue where we're still comping part of the quarter to the pre-war era. But then once we get to Q2, we start to have, frankly, some positive comps because our total business in Q2 in Europe was down about 10% double digits, low double digits. So we do see it more or less kind of bouncing off the bottom, if you will, as we end Q1 and then comping better as we get into Q2.
Operator: Our next question comes from John McNulty with BMO. John, please go ahead.
John McNulty: Tim, you spoke in your prepared remarks about the target of mid- to high-teens margins for PPG going forward. Is it a function of just raw materials getting back to normal and kind of having that catch-up kind of finally been made? Or do you see a lot of manufacturing efficiency improvements that may have uncovered themselves through some of the supply chain problems, what have you? And if so, if it's the latter, can you help us to understand what some of those levers might be?
Vince Morales: John, this is Vince. I'm going to start, and I'll let Tim add some color here, but really three levers. One, we've been chasing, which is the raw material price, or total inflation price gap, which, again, we think will be kind of on that in early 2023. We call it weeks not uneven months. But the second, which I think is important is and you hit on it, John, we haven't had a strong manufacturing couple of years here due to disruptions, due to supply disruptions, due to customer disruptions, COVID disruptions, due to churn in the workforce that many companies are seeing. So we do -- that is not a significant number for us from a manufacturing perspective. But the third, which is very important, though, is we're still down about 10% versus pre-COVID levels in terms of volumes spread throughout our portfolio. So, those are the three big levers and Tim can add color here.
Tim Knavish: Yes, you really hit the Phase 3, but particularly to the volume, we've got aero still down significantly. We've got auto, auto has been at recession levels for three years now. There's pent-up demand across the planet for cars. Refinish is still down 10%-ish from 2019. In addition to what Vince mentioned, we have done a good bit of cost out during this period as well and restructuring. So we'll get levered from that. We're not completely finished with our acquisition synergy realization. So, as I said, I used the term shopping list. We've got a shopping list of items that are contributed to our margin in public.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, Stephen.
Stephen Byrne: Yes. Thank you. Tim, you made a comment a few minutes ago about inflation outside of raws. And I just wanted to drill into this near-term outlook of yours of low-single-digit inflation in the first quarter. Is that a comment on broadly cost of goods? Or is it just raws? And are you also seeing it in labor and freight and so forth? And maybe just on the raw side of that, for first quarter, when would you say that flowing through cost of goods is based on? What month would be the midpoint of your purchases that would flow through cost of goods in the first quarter versus your purchases of those raws today, what would you say that would reflect in terms of maybe second quarter raw material costs?
Vince Morales: Sure, Steve. I think the numbers you were quoting at the beginning of your question were raw material, okay? So Q4, we were up mid-single digits year-over-year, down low single digits sequentially. In Q1, we expect to see modest down year-over-year and another sequential step down. The reality of flow-through is, we're really flowing through inventory that we have on hand now pretty much and that will flow through throughout Q1. So, we're expecting the positive benefits of that on the P&L to really not show itself significantly until Q2. Okay. And then on the other inflation, that's going to be, at least for now, that's going to be pretty constant as we move from Q1 into Q2 around labor inflation and some of the other installations.
Vince Morales: Yes. And, Steve, just going back to what Tim said earlier in the call. That's why we're doing targeted pricing in -- across our portfolio to compensate for this other inflation that's going to be higher year-over-year, primarily labor. I'm not seeing as much freight as you pointed out. It's not been an inflationary factor the last couple of quarters.
Operator: Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, Duffy.
Duffy Fischer: Question just around price. So, as you ended last year, if you just anniversary the price that you had at that point, how much would that move up price this year just from an accounting standpoint as we roll through? And two, I'd imagine you've gone out with a lot of your price increases already. So if you average that across the Company kind of what's the ask on price that you've sent out to customers so far this year?
Vince Morales: Yes. Duffy, I'll handle the first part of the question. The carryover pricing -- we do have every quarter, our price off of our sales base so that you can do the math. You come up with several hundreds of millions of dollars of price carryover in 2023 and from our 2022 pricing initiatives. Again, if you just do the math, you can easily come up with that. It's certainly north of $300 million and will be carried over.
Vincent Andrews: Yes. And Duffy thanks for the question. It's Tim here. On the new pricing, if you will, it will be more targeted just based on where each of the segments are on their catch-up and on offsetting total inflation and new inflation. We've already gone out for additional price in a couple of businesses. We're having discussions with customers in a few other businesses, and we'll prefer to have those discussions with the customers first and -- but we'll have more visibility on that as we move forward. But we will have positive price when you net all of that here as we move through '23.
Operator: Our next question comes from Laurent Favre with Exane BNP Pariba. Please go ahead.
Laurent Favre: Tim, in your focus areas, you mentioned simplification and optimization of supply chain and manufacturing. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about this and maybe size the opportunity on costs and working capital, and other areas where you think you need to rationalize the footprint based on a structurally lower demand environment for instance in Europe?
Tim Knavish: Yes. Thanks, Laurent. If you look at our journey over the last decade and we've got a lot of acquisitions, we've acquired a lot of manufacturing [indiscernible]. We've also acquired a lot of product portfolios, and we've captured a lot of synergies along the way. As we look at where we are today and some of the things we've learned through some of the supply shortages, et cetera, of the crisis, we believe there's fairly significant opportunities for us to really simplify, not only our footprint, but our processes, simplify and standardize some of what we've acquired, simplify some of the portfolios that we've required are. So, we do believe that there's some significant upside for us there as we move forward. And as you can imagine, that's not as quick a realization as, say, procurement synergies when you first close the deal, but we feel pretty confident that in the medium and long term that we can deliver value there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Kevin McCarthy: Tim, a question on your U.S. architectural business, if we look at most of the macro indicators for housing and construction, they're slowing markedly in recent months. On the other hand, you have some company-specific tailwinds in the form of a ramp of your Pro paint program at Home Depot. I think you also referenced increased shelf space at Glidden. So can you frame that out in terms of what you're anticipating maybe volumetrically as 2023 progresses in that vertical?
Vince Morales: Yes, Kevin, this is Vince. Let me just start on the macro. Again, what we're seeing, which I think has been pretty chronicled is new housing starts and leading indicators, certainly pointing down. We really have to bifurcate that. Single-family housing starts are significant, significantly down. Multifamily, we expect to turn down, and they're starting to turn out, but there's still going to be growth. Multifamily completions, again, paints at the end of the cycle here, there's still completions that will carry us well into the year. Tim mentioned earlier on the commercial side, commercial new build, again, for the -- sorry, for the first half of the year should be some constant, if not longer. And then commercial repaint is solid right now. And there's a backlog on that. So, those are the macro signs and we do have some PPG-specific items that Tim's can talk about.
Tim Knavish: Yes. Yes, the PPG specifics, you know well about the THD Home Depot Pro program, and we expect double digits from that program again this year after strong double digits last year. The other one, we've got a nice additional retail win. Our customer is going to announce it first, but you should hear in weeks, possibly months here of what that is, that will help offset some of the other things that Vince mentioned. And then the spray paint win for us with that innovation award at the Home Depot is -- we're excited about opportunity to not only leverage that specific product, but expand that offering either further. But when you put it all together, Kevin, we are expecting net-net for volumes in that space to be down, but of course sales to be up with the price offsetting the difference.
Operator: Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Please go ahead, Frank.
Frank Mitsch: First, I want to extend my sympathies to the PPG's family on the passing of Bill Hernandez. He really was a great, great guy. Tim, I appreciate your answer on the full year EPS question, for sure, given all the uncertainties. But you already indicated that you expect European earnings will be up year-over-year in the second quarter. And you also mentioned that your folks on the ground in China are expecting China to really pick up come April. And so I'm wondering, is part of your calculus that we will likely see higher year-over-year EPS in the second quarter?
Vince Morales: Well, again, Frank, first of all, thanks for the call out to Bill Hernando, a loved PPG partnered here for many years. and just a world-class CFO and great human being and been a tragic and sudden loss this past weekend. So thank you for calling that out. Frank, at the end of the day, the uncertainty at this point with what's happening with China and when and what's happening with Europe and to what degree, and what's happening to raw material pricing and the specificity of that raw material pricing, as you know, can change our earnings profile fairly significantly. We're just not in a position right now to put out a statement on Q2 EPS. That said, as I said earlier, I believe we've got a hangover in Q1, but a number of those, let's call them, earnings levers start to come due in Q2.
Vince Morales: Yes, Frank, this is Vince. We do give this up. If you look at our profile of countries, China is one of our largest countries for sure. So there's still uncertainty there as we pointed out, and Tim pointed out in the opening remarks about the timing of the opening. Right now, we certainly hope March aerospace a strong month. Definitely April too hard to predict April, which is Q2 is typically a very good quarter in China. So, we're not in position at this point to provide any real line on that at this point.
Operator: Our next question comes from Josh Spector of UBS. Please go ahead, Josh.
Josh Spector: I just have a couple of follow-ups here. First, do you think you can achieve the low end of your margin targets this year in 2023 on average? And second, if you could comment on your ability to hold prices across the businesses as we move through this year? And any comments there versus why this might be different versus prior cycles?
Vince Morales: Yes. Josh, one lever to help us improve earnings, again, we're not trying to give full year guidance on margins, and that's even harder pass than top line. So, we'll defer that till a little bit later into the year. Your question on pricing, I'm going to let Tim answer it.
Tim Knavish: Yes, Josh, I'm confident in our team's ability to hold price similar to prior cycles. And with this cycle, possibly even more because of other inflation that is more persistent than we've had in other cycles. So that's -- we're confident in that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Vincent.
Vincent Andrews: I think you commented in the prepared remarks that you've got auto builds flat in 1Q, and I think the consultants are still calling for it to be up about 2.25%. So is that just something you're seeing in your own book? Or are you anticipating those consultant numbers to come lower? And just, in addition to that, could you talk about how you anticipate the mix of auto builds this year? Is there going to be any different than last year, and would that be a plus or minus for you?
Tim Knavish: Yes. Thanks, Vincent. Well, first of all, historically, I don't want to brag, but historically, we've actually nailed it pretty well compared to some of the external consultants on the builds because we got so many people in the plants every day. We have visibility to operating schedules, and we talk to those folks. So, the difference for us in Q1 specifically is China. Because our base case is that there will be, to some degree, a second wave after Chinese New Year of infections, and we saw what that did on the first wave to assembly plants and other suppliers. So that's our base case, and that may explain the difference between us and some of the consulting houses out there. But beyond that, we're expecting modest growth for the year, low single digits. And that's an area where there potentially could be upside, but our base case is low single digits. Yes, just to give you some examples specifically of what happened on the ground in China, and why we are a bit cautious on the post-Chinese New Year. When things opened up in mid China -- I'm sorry, mid-December in China, we've got 19 PPG manufacturing sites across the country. And we went from near zero absenteeism very quickly to above 50% absenteeism across that whole network. And that has returned very rapidly to near zero in a period of about 2.5 to 3 weeks. And we saw that same in some of our other suppliers, assembly plants, you name it. So we've lived it, we've seen the data, and we believe that as people travel to the families that more travel than the last three years across China for Chinese New Year, as they travel to some of the more remote villages to visit their families in return, we do believe there will be a short, but acute second wave. And so that's why we're a bit more cautious. And as Vince mentioned, March is a huge month normally for our China business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc. Please go ahead, Aleksey.
Aleksey Yefremov: I just wanted to clarify your raw materials commentary from earlier. It sounds like you are currently destocking sort of earlier raw materials purchases and will begin to purchase more perhaps in the second quarter. So, there could be more of a step down in the cost. Is that the right way to think about it?
Vince Morales: Yes. Aleksey, let me provide some -- maybe some clarity here. So we did see, as Tim mentioned, some modest sequential raw material deflation Q3 to Q4. We expect a -- we expect a further incremental deflation in Q4 to Q1. We were still up Q4 year-over-year. And we have to work that deflation through our inventory, which will take us likely through the first quarter before we see that impact on our P&L. And so that's, I think what we were trying to articulate. We do have -- as Tim mentioned, we do have efforts underway to optimize our working capital, primarily our inventory. We ended July or June with exceedingly high inventory levels. We worked in the second half of the year to work those down, and we're still working those down as we get into the first quarter of 2023. So, they're still above what we want to be our target range. So, we're still going through various destocking depending on the region, depending on the product. So, we will have print raw material purchases in Q1 and likely some crimped on material purchases in Q2 as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Roberts of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, John.
John Roberts: Good morning, Tim, Vince, and John. I just wanted to ask a question about auto refinish. You won 2,000 new body shops in 2022. Was that concentrated anywhere regionally? Or was there something else common to those shops that switched? And when you talk about 15% higher productivity, is that relative to the prior supplier to those shops? Or how are you defining that since you're leading competitors also talking about having productivity higher than the competition?
Tim Knavish: Yes. Thanks, John. To your first question, our net wins on body shops are positive in all the major regions, U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and China. It's just proportion to our business that the vast majority of those are in the U.S. and Europe. Relative to the whole productivity question, the way we look at it is change is only as strong as its weakest link. And so every link on the refinish body shop throughput has to be strong in order to really drive what's most important to the body shop owner, and that's what they call key to key time. From the time you take the vehicle owner's keys until the time you hand those keys back to the vehicle owner. That is the one and only metric that that is present. So if you are incrementally faster in one of those steps, but slower in several others such that your key to key time is 15% lower, than you're simply not as productive in the eyes of that -- in that body shop over. And so we focus on that end-to-end with things like the digitized color match, our linked digital system that really encompasses the whole body shop, the visualizer, optimized mixing to improve speed, eliminate waste. And another thing that's really important to the body shop owners right now that PPG's value proposition delivers and some of our competitors don't, is you're actually simplifying some of those steps with things like moon walk and the visualizer so that the constrained flavor of the professional painter doesn't always have to be the one to do that. You open it up to other labor that can do that and that adds additional productivity of the body shops. So again, the most important thing is that key to key time, and that's where we have the 15% advantage.
Operator: Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup. Please go ahead, P.J.
P.J. Juvekar: Yes, good morning. Tim, clearly, the housing market is slowing down, whether you look at new homes or existing home sales. Have you seen a slowdown in the contractor business? The contractor business was robust. Last couple of summers, they had a huge backlog that they were working from COVID. As that backlog is worked down, do you expect some slowing in the contractor business?
Tim Knavish: Yes, P.J. Yes, we have already seen a slowdown in contractors that are primarily focused on new housing. That's a brutal reality that we all have to face. But again, that's a small portion of our business. Our backlogs for where we're strong, which is commercial and maintenance, literally have moved only incrementally, 13 weeks average backlog in Q3 to 12 weeks average backlog in Q4. So, that's what's been the margin of error of four survey. So that's holding up much better than the new build. I believe part of that, if you think about a lot of commercial work and maintenance work and light industrial work, a lot of that work was near zero during COVID, while the DIY and res repaint was offsetting it. So there's still a lot of pent-up demand there. So I don't -- as I said earlier, the total volume is still going to be incrementally down. So I don't want to oversell that. But that's why some of our Pro business is holding up better.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Leithead of Barclays. Please go ahead, Michael.
Michael Leithead: I just had a bit of a follow-up on the raw material basket. Can you just help us with how you think about that evolving broadly over the course of this year? I guess, with 1Q demand being pretty benign or restock volume was down five-ish-percent or so, why do you think input costs aren't coming down faster? And if China does recover in 2Q and beyond pretty quickly, how do you think about what that does to your raw material cost?
Tim Knavish: So, Mike, I'll start and let Vince fill in some color. I think there were some actual artificial demands in the second half of '22 that has maybe delayed some of the basic supply-demand economics, because you'll recall that for most of '21 and the first half of '22, raw material availability was our number one issue and a lot of our coatings peers' number one issue. So as that availability improves, we all stocked up and got safety stock and, at the same time, demand started to collapse. So if things were kind in -- when I say collapse, I mean, particularly on the DIY and eco side, but big driver to the overall raw material change. So, I think a lot of companies, and you've seen that in what companies have said, ended the year with more inventory than they would like. So, there was a bit of artificial demand that delayed what would be a normal supply demand curve.
Vince Morales: Yes, Mike, let me just add some color here. So as we enter 2023, again, we're destocking. We know from a public commentary, a lot of our peers have excess inventory and are destocking. I do think there is this type of war with the supplier base typically Q1 and Q2 are peak volume orders for coatings raw material purchases. I don't think that's going to materialize in the same manner this year. So, we'll have a lower buy -- PPG will have a lower by in Q1. We have suppliers in virtually every week or every day for the past couple of weeks, indicating to us to have excess supply to give to us. And so, we're going to maximize that to the benefit of our shareholders. And we'll negotiate our Q1 and Q2 pricing accordingly. We do believe, as we said for the last couple of quarters, there's ample supply in our supply base.
Operator: Our next question comes from Silke Kueck with JPMorgan Chase. Please go ahead.
Silke Kueck: This is Silke for Jeff. I was wondering whether you can discuss your volumes and your price and your U.S. architectural stores. And secondly, I was wondering whether you can talk about what's happening in the packaging business?
Tim Knavish: Sure. So, the stores pricing, we've raised price there multiple times, and we held that price throughout the year. And 2023, it will depend on what happens from an inflation standpoint, but that's one of the businesses where we moved fairly quickly to keep up with cost inputs. On packaging, we did have strong margin recovery in that business throughout '22, and we expect that to continue in 2023. We do see some softness there in pockets around the world, driven by -- in China, it's the lockdown. And in Europe, it's just consumer confidence in beverage spending. So, we have seen some softness in volume, but strong margin recovery. And we also continue to convert to our Innovel Pro BPA-free content material, and we've had some nice wins in that beverage space, that will be launched as we move through this year. But overall, at a high level, good margin recovery, some softness in demand around the world.
Operator: Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC. Please go ahead, Arun.
Arun Viswanathan: I guess my question is about some framework you've provided in the past. If we go back maybe a year, 1.5 years ago, you were discussing maybe $9 of earnings for 2023. Do you see that as still maybe a possibility a couple of years out that would imply another $400 million, $500 million of EBIT on top of where you are, so what's the framework to get back there? Is it kind of that high teens EBIT margin and maybe the recovery of the volume? Or would you need more than that to get back? And is that still maybe again available in a couple of years' time?
Tim Knavish: Yes. Arun, I've said before, I believe that the $9 EPS is when, not if, and I stand behind that. And that's because the fundamentals are there. We have portfolio that has earnings power that has yet to be released. And I won't give you my entire 10-point plan that will get us there, but you've still got recovery in some of our better businesses, aerospace, auto, refinish. Let me talk about auto for a second without going too far off topic here. But if you take a six-year run rate of global builds before COVID, compared to the -- I'm sorry, 2021, '22, there's 40 million fewer cars that were built during that three-year period compared to the six year before. So, everybody has their guess as to how much of that 40 million will be made up over time, but it's not zero. And so that business has a lot of volume recovery to go. We've got the price/cost momentum. You've heard about our restructuring, acquisition synergies, some of the technology innovation, productivity, sustainable products that will drive share growth. And then just broader volume recovery, we feel confident that the $9 is a when not yet.
Vince Morales: And just Peru, just a couple of comments it's actually a little more near term. So if you look at 2022, we have to remind -- Tim mentioned this earlier, but it's a good reminder. We really saw Europe fall really the back half of March. So, we're going to come up against some recession type volumes here in a couple of weeks. We remind everybody that, in Q2, China was shut down, industrial-wise, for almost two months. So again, we don't think 2022 was representative in China of a traditional -- even a compressed run rate on GDP growth. So, those two outside of aerospace, outside of refinish, we think have some opportunities to contribute. And again, as Tim mentioned earlier, we expect very good leverage above historical average leverage as volumes return in any business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please go ahead, Laurence.
Dan Razon: It's Dan Razon on for Lawrence. Just in terms of the backlog you mentioned, I think you said commercial backlog was 13 to 14 weeks. And then I think in the comments, you said a $200 million backlog in aerospace. I was just for comparison purposes. How -- what does that mean like versus what, I guess, historically it's been?
Tim Knavish: Yes. Dan, historically, that 12- to 13-week or U.S. PRO paint is actually still high. So that will offset some of the negative volume in some of the other segments. I can tell you that in my short 35.5 years of with PPG, I don't remember the aerospace backlogs ever being this strong. And that will take us -- that's pent-up demand for the foreseeable future. Refinish, our refinish backlogs are still, particularly here in the U.S., probably 5x what they were pre-COVID. And it's not only a matter of us getting product out or getting raw materials in, our refinish customers' backlogs are high. I hope you haven't had any minor fender benders lazy, but if you have and you've taken a car to a body shop, they're likely to tell you it's six to eight weeks before you're going to get that car serviced and taken care of. So the backlogs across all of those spaces are high, and in some cases, historically high.
Vince Morales: Yes. I'll answer the color, Dan, to the aerospace figures here. So we said before, aerospace is circa $1 billion business for us. This $200 million backlog is typically a small fraction of that. So this is almost another two months of activity. If we can get it done this year, we're still facing some supply challenges that are governing what we can do in a particular month or quarter, but it is a significant backlog relative to historic terms.
Tim Knavish: Yes. And I'm going to grab that back one more or one more comment. The demand in aerospace is actually growing as we progress through the months and quarters. So you've got kind of the underlying demand is growing, which means that $200 million backlog is going to be there even longer. And recall that China, international travel only opened on January 8, so that's going to be another stimulus for aerospace demand.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Harrison of Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead, Mike.
Mike Harrison: In the auto OEM business, a question on electric vehicles that hit 10% of global car sales last year, I was hoping that you could give us an update on some of the key products that you're providing for electric vehicles. Any recent wins or other metrics you can share on that portion of the auto OEM business?
Tim Knavish: Yes, Mike, we're really excited about EV because we are winning where the EVs are winning, okay? We're winning where the EVs are gaining the most and that giant. You probably saw the journal article here not that long ago. It's something like 65% or so of the EVs sold last year wherein in China, and that's where we're having the most success. In fact, we're growing significantly with the largest EV producer in China. The way we're approaching is, it's not only about new technologies, it's about picking the winners on the EVs and selling, let's say, more conventional corrosion protection and beautification products to those customers. So it's a combined effort of selling our new and differentiated products like our battery fire protection, and our dielectric coatings products to those customers, but also targeting and winning with the EV winners in the market.
Operator: Our final question today comes from Jaideep Pandya with Enfield Research. Please go ahead.
Jaideep Pandya: [Audio Gap] partly because of the crazy raw material inflation you've seen. Now as raw materials tail off, are you not getting pushed back from your customers when you're trying to do these targeted pricing, especially in a demand environment, which has at least changed and has slowed? That's my first question. And the second question really is on protective. Could you just tell us like what's the backlog in marine and protective these days?
Tim Knavish: Jaideep, I'm sorry, the beginning of your first question kind of -- I apologize, but if maybe you could repeat your first question for us, please.
Jaideep Pandya: Yes, sure. Sure. So my first question is just on the pricing.
Tim Knavish: I get the first question.
Jaideep Pandya: Yes. It's just on.
Tim Knavish: Yes. So, Jaideep, I'll take it and then Vic, you can jump in. On pricing, you got to remember that the pricing that we've achieved over the last couple of years was to offset what's happened in inflation in the last couple of years. And our customers have visibility to what's happened to our net margins. And so, they have optics on where we are on a margin recovery standpoint and they also know when we have these discussions with them that we're not back to peak margins. And so it's not like we're going, in most cases, above and beyond that. So, as we move forward, we'll continue to be competitive, and we'll continue to price to offset non-raw material inflation.
Vince Morales: Before Tim answers the protective question, Jaideep, I think we have discussions with our customers and almost every business. And they want us to be a healthy supplier that continues to innovate and they understand that and again, get paid a fair price for innovative technology that typically helps them. And we're coming into a period of time, given the inflation and base and salary where our customers really value functional attributes of our coatings products. And again, they're pushing us -- not so much on products, they're pushing us to help them with their productivity right now, which is a much bigger cost pull for them, cost opportunity for them than the price on coatings. So again, we're in a lot of discussions with our customers about how to improve their productivity, which again is a key attribute for them.
Tim Knavish: Yes. On your protective question, our protective and marine business actually had a very strong year last year. Even though there was volume degradation in Q4, that volume degradation was China because whether its marine new builds or large petrochemical protective projects, a lot of those are done in China. So, that will -- some of that will follow the China closing and then reopening curve. But beyond that, a couple of things are happening in protective. There is significant investment in LNG, all aspects of LNG, and that's that area uses a lot of our advantaged protective products. There's an infrastructure investment certainly coming in the U.S. and other countries that leads to future growth for the protective business. And then, finally, on a PPG-specific protective opportunity, we had a fantastic distribution network in Mexico, over 5,000 store locations that has historically been very heavily architectural and deco focused. Well, we're now leveraging more and more of that network to grow our protective business, which is how we're successful in that business in other countries, like the U.S. and Canada. So, that's a really great growth opportunity in the protective area that differentiates PPG.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to John Bruno.
John Bruno: Thank you, Emily. We appreciate your interest in PPG. This concludes our fourth quarter earnings call. Have a good day.
Operator: Thank you everyone for joining us today. This concludes our conference call. You may now disconnect.

The Board and I have full confidence that Tim will guide PPG to future growth and additional shareholder value. With Tim's appointment, I will become Executive Chairman on January 1, 2023. Now let me turn to our financial results. Last evening, we reported third quarter 2022 financial results. For the third quarter, we delivered net sales of $4.5 billion, and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.66. To quickly summarize the quarter, our sales performance was a record, driven by continued realization of real-time price increases that fully offset total cost inflation for the second consecutive quarter. On a two-year stack, selling prices are up about 18%. As we communicated earlier this month, these sales and earnings results were lower than our guidance for the quarter as we were impacted by further softening of demand in Europe and less of a sequential economic improvement than expected in China due to the pandemic restrictions in September. In addition, the strengthening of the US dollar lowered sales by about 6%, or $265 million worse than it was originally forecasted. Despite these lower-than-forecasted sales, we did deliver strong performances in several of our businesses, including PPG Comex, which delivered another record quarter. Also, our global automotive refinish Traffic Solutions and US Packaging Coatings businesses each set all-time quarterly sales records in the quarter. Year-to-date, our automotive refinish coatings business has delivered about 1,500 net new body shop wins as customers continued to value the product, technology and industry-leading services and capabilities that this business delivers every day. In addition, our aerospace business delivered strong double-digit percentage sales growth, volume growth aided by recovering airline travel that is now about 85% of pre-pandemic levels. With additional industry recovery, a strong order book and PPG's advantaged technology products, we expect this business to continue to grow into 2023 and beyond. We continue to experience improvement in commodity raw material availability. However, certain short supply raw materials impacted our automotive refinish and aerospace coatings businesses constraining their ability to meet their respective strong order books. Together, these two businesses ended the quarter with a $200 million backlog similar to the end of the second quarter. Importantly, our year-over-year segment operating margin recovery has begun. This reflects the progress we have made in implementing selling price increases. The third quarter marked the 22nd consecutive quarter of higher selling prices. We expect our margin recovery to accelerate into 2023 and anticipate by the first quarter of 2023 we will fully recover all cumulative inflation from 2021 and 2022. We continued to make good progress executing on our acquisition-related synergies and other cost savings initiatives from previously announced restructuring program, which delivered about $25 million of incremental benefit in the third quarter. During the quarter, we continued to progress our launch of the expanded pro painter initiative with The Home Depot. Each week, our team is calling on thousands of prospective new customers and delivering new business wins. In the third quarter, we also started joint work with the HD Supply team to hunt for new paint customers, including in the commercial maintenance area. And while early, this collaboration is yielding results and we expect will be another catalyst for future growth in the US architectural coatings business. Overall, paint contractors are providing us with ongoing positive feedback on the convenience of buying well-recognized PPG pro products at The Home Depot. Collectively, we continue to see opportunities for significant growth in the coming years. While working capital remains higher than we would like, we made solid progress in the third quarter and began to lower our inventories on a sequential basis. We had been carrying higher than historic levels of inventory given supply chain constraints over the past year. But given the broadening elongation of supply globally, we are now able to destock, including reducing or canceling raw material orders and reducing safety stock closer to historic levels. We are prioritizing further inventory reductions in the fourth quarter, which will benefit our cash generation. We made modest repurchases of our stock during the quarter and repaid $100 million of debt. We continued to evaluate potential strategic bolt-on acquisitions. Consistent with our past practices, we will deploy cash in the most accretive manner for our shareholders, including some continued debt reduction. On the ESG front, I want to highlight yet another example of PPG leading the way. The acquisition of Tikkurila has proved to be very valuable on several fronts, including enhancing PPG's ESG program through the addition of advantaged, sustainable solutions that contribute to the circular economy. These include bio-based products and packaging made from 50% to 75% recycled plastic that is also 100% recyclable. Currently, nearly 90% of Tikkurila's products are waterborne and 48% of the portfolio is eco-level. We are leveraging Tikkurila's sustainability approach in our architectural business beginning in Europe. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, normal seasonal demand trends are expected, including lower sequential sales in most of our architectural businesses, and also in our Traffic Solutions business, where sales historically fall about 50% due to the weather considerations. In Europe, we expect economic conditions to remain weak due to the softening consumer confidence and lower industrial activity related to the significantly higher energy costs, and geopolitical issues. In China, we anticipate weaker-than-normal economic activity for the fourth quarter due to continued pandemic-related disruptions and slowing exports to Europe. PPG's largest factory in China was required to close for the first 10 days of October, and further restrictions could curtail production and commercial activity. One offset important to PPG is we expect automotive OEM builds in China to remain solid and consumer spending to improve into 2023. In general, demand in the US in the huge markets remain solid and we expect several of our businesses to continue to deliver positive year-over-year sales volume growth. Demand for architectural DIY and residential new home coatings products in the US is beginning to slow, and industry demand is anticipated to weaken further in the fourth quarter and in the next year's basis leading economic indicators. PPG's exposure to the US new home market is relatively small and a low single-digit percentage of company sales and our overall exposure to the residential housing market is less than 10% of company revenue. We expect some of the industry weakness to be offset by our growth initiatives with The Home Depot, and other customer gains. Raw materials are expected to remain inflationary, with a mid-single digit higher than the prior year, but fall modestly on a sequential quarterly basis. We expect supply chain conditions to continue to broadly improve, including better raw material and transportation availability as our suppliers are nearing their 2019 manufacturing, and supply capability. As a reminder, we've absorbed about $1.9 billion of raw material inflation since beginning of 2021. In the fourth quarter, we expect further increases in energy costs, especially in Europe and to some degree in the US. We will continue to prioritize implementing further real-time targeted selling price increases to mitigate these higher costs. Due to the heightened level of economic uncertainty, we have implemented an additional restructuring program focused on past payback actions targeting $70 million of annualized savings, upon full implementation. The program includes several initiatives in Europe, is mostly concentrated on matching our staffing levels with lower demand. As we enter a period of heightened economic uncertainty, we expect our business portfolio to prove more resilient in the coming quarters, with continued recovery in the automotive OEM and aerospace coatings businesses. Along with demand-stable businesses like automotive refinish and traffic solutions, we believe that more than 50% of PPG's portfolio will remain resilient even if we experience a broader global economic decline. This is noteworthy and positive step-change from the prior recession. Also importantly, we expect that our sequential quarterly momentum on operating margin improvement will continue in the fourth quarter, as we work back towards our historical margin profile. This will be supported by maintaining our selling prices to reflect the value of the products and services we provide. While economic conditions are challenging in the near term, I remain confident about the future earnings capabilities of PPG, as the earnings catalysts that I'd referenced in the past remain fully intact, and we certainly see a path to return to prior peak operating margins, with opportunities to exceed them. In closing, as we look to finish the year managing intensifying challenges, I want to thank our team of 50,000 employees around the world who are making it happen by supporting our customers and the communities where we operate. Their dedication, even during the most challenging times, is inspiring and drives our purpose to protect and beautify the world. Thank you for your continued confidence in PPG. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, Elliott, would you please open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Christopher Parkinson from Mizuho. Your line is open, please go ahead.
Christopher Parkinson: Great. Thank you so much. The macro is changing, not necessarily for the better, but per your comments it doesn't seem like the setup for this recessionary environment aligns with history, which has consequences across fixed asset leverage, end market mix when you're discussing refinish and aero, just the overall margin outlook versus past downturns. Can you just give us sort of overall update of your thoughts here and potentially anything on price cost as well? Thank you.
Michael McGarry: Thanks, Christopher. First of all, I think, the most encouraging thing about what we see is that we see continued price increases coming. So fourth quarter, we're still looking at high single digits, low double-digit price increases. So that's going to be significant. We have seen raw materials, they have loosened up in China. They are starting to loosen up in Europe. We are arbitraging what we see in China into Europe and we expect to arbitrage Europe elsewhere. So these are things that are a little bit different than the last ones. I'll remind everybody, by the end of the year, we'll have about $2 billion of raw material inflation, and we still have other inflation. And for the second quarter and third quarter, we covered all total inflation. That includes MRO, freight logistics, labor, you name it, we covered it, okay? So we feel very confident going into the fourth quarter that we're going to continue to recover that gap. By the end of the year, we will have recovered all raw material inflation. And before the end of the first quarter, we will recover all total inflation. So we're really in good shape from that standpoint. So I'm pleased with what I see and I think this is going to be a little bit different recession than last time, because we have a strong OEM business and a strong refinish business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi from Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Ghansham Panjabi: Yes, thank you and congrats first off, Michael and Tim. Can you just give us a sense, Michael, on how you see architectural volumes evolving in your three major regions of the US, Europe and Mexico as we cycle into 2023? I mean, obviously, DIY has been impacted in the US and Europe. But just given the extent of mortgage rate increases and some of the fundamental shifts in housing as well for markets such as the US, how are you planning for that evolution of volumes there?
Michael McGarry: Ghansham , I'm going to let Tim take this one.
Tim Knavish: Thanks, Ghansham. And first, I want to thank Michael and the PPG Board for their trust and confidence as we continue to drive the company forward. I also want to thank Michael personally for his leadership, his personal mentorship of me, and frankly, for setting up PPG with a global portfolio that is well positioned for future growth and also well positioned and navigate through today's economic challenges. Excited for this opportunity, I really look forward to the future and working -- continuing to work with our 50,000 people around the world. Now specifically to your question, so around the world for architectural, PPG-Comex, our Mexican business continues to shine. First, GDPs are holding up better than most parts of the world in Latin America. And second, just the strength of our position, the strength of our services, the strength of our brand, the strength of our network will continue to put up strong results down there. As you know, Asia Pacific for us is a fairly small business in architectural. And given some of the things happening in China, that's actually a positive at this point. Europe, we continue to see soft -- quite soft DIY, as we said in Q1 and Q2, and we expect it to continue at the depressed levels that it is today. Trade, Trade in Europe is actually a bit stronger. It's down mid-single digits. The PRO backlogs are still there, driven largely by labor shortages more than anything, but we do see that moderating. We do see the trade business moderating as well in Europe, as you would expect. Some variability by country, the closer you get to the war zone, the more depressed it gets. UK, you know what's happening there and then a bit stronger in the south. Holding up better over here in the US, Canada market. We are seeing DIY softness here. Nothing like Europe, more down like low single-digits in DIY, US/Canada. But the PRO business is holding up well. Backlogs remain strong. Backlogs, our quarterly survey paint contractors averaged about 12 weeks of backlog, pretty consistent with the prior quarter. And our omni-channel business for the PRO, we were actually up this quarter. So holding up better here in the US/Canada region.
Operator: Our next question comes from Josh Spector from UBS. Your line is open.
Josh Spector: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just curious if you can comment on the pricing progression in the two segments. I mean, clearly, you have momentum in Performance with that increase on a two-year stack. But Industrial maybe a little bit less obvious, 20%, two-year stack or slightly above that isn't much of an improvement Q-on-Q. So I'm wondering if you can comment on why pricing there would it be moving up higher, especially if you just talking about margins accelerating. And does energy prices, and that being a new inflationary factor, perhaps a higher inflationary factor, impact the ability to get pricing in an either segment? Thanks.
Michael McGarry: Josh, this is Michael. First of all, what I would tell you is that, part of what you're seeing of the slowing of the price increases in the Performance Coatings segment is because of the drop in architectural sales, okay? So you have a little bit of a mix issue going on in there. So, that's one. The other thing you have to remember is we've got pricing much earlier in Performance Coatings segment. And we always lag a little bit in the Industrial side. So the other piece besides mix is timing. So, what you see, which is most important, is that on our Industrial side, it does lag, but now it's catching back up. And the Industrial side was above company average, and we expect that to continue in the fourth quarter as well. And most importantly, in our automotive segment, a number of our customers have provided us retroactive pricing as well. And so that helps that margin as well. So, we're still anticipating some significant price improvement in the fourth quarter. And again, we'll be ready to talk about the first quarter later, but we will have positive -- significant positive price in Q1 as well.
Vince Morales: Josh, this is Vince. I think the key things to remember for us is, the margin recovery, we promised in Industrial is underway. We're seeing -- we expect that margin recovery to continue into Q4 and expand into Q1. Your question on energy in Europe, we did put in select energy surcharges as most companies have done to accommodate that. We're not a big energy consumer in Europe, we're downstream and we're reacting as much as we can to what's being -- what's a tough energy environment in Europe.
Operator: Our next question comes from John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
John McNulty: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations again to Michael and Tim both. So, when we think about the raw material basket, it sounds like a lot of things have improved, but there are still some challenges. I guess can you help us to understand what portion of the raw material basket is still currently challenged? And then, as the supply chains continue to improve, and it looks like they have a lot, I guess, how should we be thinking about, what that might mean for raw material relief as we look to 2023? Thanks.
Vince Morales: Yes, John, this is Vince. Let me start real quickly and then I think Tim is going to chime in here. If you look, again, we have cumulative, about 40% inflation levels. We do see inflation year-over-year in Q4, but it's down sequentially. And that's, I think is the key is we're starting to see the fever break. It's different, as Michael mentioned, by region and we're seeing arbitrage opportunities. And I think Tim has some specifics.
Tim Knavish: Yes. And so from the availability situation, John, it's much better. We're now to isolated examples. You've got the singular example here in the US with a fire at a particular resin supplier that has caused a transient disruption. We put some alternatives in place to deal with that. And if you look at like cut across the aerospace transparencies, you've got some things not related to coatings, but components, machine parts, acrylic parts that go into the manufacture and assembly of a windshield. But now we're down to handfuls of items, some minor additives as opposed to what we had a quarter, or certainly two quarters ago.
Vincent Morales: Yeah. And just one other comment here is if you think about the inflation that we've absorbed in the past almost two years now, a part of it started as a supply chain issue, but we then were saddled with inflation that included COVID absenteeism, freight issues, port issues. A lot of those other issues have fallen by the wayside. So we do feel, given those other issues have been resolved, the supply/demand economics will start to play a bigger factor.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Byrne from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Stephen Byrne: Yeah. So I was curious to hear your view on the ability for you to expand geographically in your various businesses. Which of them do you think you have the most potential to expand? For example, Tikkurila, did that give you a footprint in a region where you think you can meaningfully expand either refinish or traffic markings? What's the outlook for you in that region?
Michael McGarry: Well, Stephen, this is Michael. Let me just give you some examples that all play into the positives of what we do with the acquisition. So if you think about traffic solutions that was primarily a US business. They had a key tiny piece in Mexico where you take our PPG-Comex team, and they're a powerhouse in Mexico. So what do we do? We take those formulations that they have in the US, we transfer them down to Mexico. We localize them for those local markets, and we started to sell them. And our traffic solutions business is growing 20-plus percent every quarter since we've had it and we've had it now five quarters. So it's moving along. Same thing with Tikkurila. So you go to Tikkurila, and they had a strong customer relationship up in Scandinavia. It's not that we weren't selling in Scandinavia, but they had some tremendous relationships. So we're able to take our industrial products and bring them up there. We're able to expand some of our refinish products up there. And I think we highlighted that when we took you to see birch there up in Scandinavia for the Investor Day. And the same thing when you think about China. So when we bought [indiscernible], we took those formulations. We moved them over to China, and we've been able to grow our automotive parts and accessories business in China and that's been a nice win for us. We have a new waterborne technology for automotive parts where we're growing significantly faster than market. So I think we have a number of these examples where we do acquisitions and we move them around the world, and it turns out to be a strong positive for us. So thank you very much for the question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from VRP. Your line is open.
Kevin McCarthy: Yes, good morning. I'd like to ask how much destocking do you anticipate internally and externally. For example, do you expect to run your assets at a rate that's below underlying consumption in the next several quarters perhaps outside of auto OEM and aerospace where those markets have been more dislocated or depressed?
Michael McGarry: Well, we're certainly, Kevin, going to do that for some of our businesses where the raw materials we built up. So that's going to happen. But you did highlight a number that are going to be well north of that. So automotive, refinish, traffic solutions, things like that are all going to be well above company average. But the thing you have to remember is, we're also going to take advantage of the arbitrage in raw materials. So if it makes sense for us, we're moving TiO2 right now from China. We're moving it into Europe. So we're going to take advantage of things like that. And net-net, I would tell you that we're probably going to be pretty close. We took down inventories $100 million in Q3. We're probably going to take down another couple of hundred million dollars in Q4. And I think we're in pretty good shape.
Vince Morales: Yes. Let me just add on to what Michael said here. I think if you think about the coatings industry more broadly, we're a batch process. So we typically can start and stop as we please. We're not a continuous process. Where we are this cycle versus prior cycles is, we don't have a lot of inventory. Our end customers, with a few exceptions, do not have a lot of inventory in the chain. We're seeing that in, for example, automotive refinish, as Michael alluded to. We're certainly seeing that in aerospace. So there's not, Kevin, a big destock coming in many of our industries. Automotive, another one where we're inventory light all the way through the chain. So we're going to run at or slightly below what we see as our end customers' consumption to draw down our inventories. But with a couple of small exceptions, we're including in some of our big box DIY customers, there's not a lot of inventory in channels. But we do have a huge focus on drawing down our raw material inventories in the fourth quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Laurent Favre from Exane BNP Paribas. Your line is open, please go ahead.
Laurent Favre: Yes. Good morning, all. Congrats again to Michael and team. My question is, again, on this inventory point and destocking. On the volume guidance for Q4, I was wondering if you had made a specific assumption on destocking itself on the customer side.
Tim Knavish: Yes, Laurent, thanks for the question. This is Tim. To Vince's point, really, the only segment where we're seeing destocking on the customer side is architectural DIY big box. And we are seeing that in Europe predominantly, but also here in the United States. And so, we do expect that to continue really for the remainder of the year until they reach their targeted levels. But beyond that, many of our customer channels are still fairly light or very light in some cases on inventory. So that's the only destocking we expect to see.
Vince Morales: Yes. And if I can just add, this is Vince again. If you go to Europe, when we're seeing that, we started to see that really in Q2 -- Q1, early Q2 of this year. So we're going to lap -- in a couple of months here, we're going to lap those declines. So we do have a different comparison base in 2023 for Europe.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Sison from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Michael Sison: Hey. Good morning. Congrats to you, Tim, and been great working with you, Michael. I assume you're moving to Cleveland post retirement, but -- I guess, the first question for you, Mike, when you think about your outlook for the fourth quarter, the $1.05 to $1.20, seems sort of low on a quarterly run rate. And just curious what you think needs to happen to see sequential improvement heading into the first half of 2023. And then maybe for Tim, maybe you can comment on what you believe PPG's earnings potential is at some point in time. There was a $9 number out there for a while, and I just didn't know if that was still the one that you think is the right number. Thank you.
Michael McGarry: Okay. Mike, this is Michael. So I will take the first question, and I'll let Tim answer the second question. Look, at the end of the day, when we put together our original, let's call it, our pre-announcement guidance, we -- our Chinese team was very confident that post President Xi's election for his third term that the COVID policies in China would be relaxed and would take a more normalized approach. Clearly, with this speech last week, that is not going to be the case. So we've adjusted based on that. Our Tianjin plant, which is actually our largest coatings plant in the world in China, it was down the last 10 days of September. It was down the first 10 days of October, running at reduced rates. And consumer confidence, obviously, is something we're going to be watching very closely in China. But the good news is when you look at the rest of China, the automotive business had a very strong third quarter. They had a very -- we're projecting a pretty good fourth quarter. That's historically the best quarter for automotive in China. And I'm very encouraged by the fact that the automotive guys in China are exporting their electric vehicles. And as you know, the electric vehicles are good for us. BYD is not only exporting to Europe, but they're also exploring to Southeast Asia. So we feel very confident about that. So I think overall, you may view that guide as a little weak, but there's a lot of things out there that are quite uncertain. We don't know how much destocking DIY guys will do in the fourth quarter. We don't know how much they're going to -- typically they start buying in December to get ready for the new season. We have not put any of that in there. So we're being a bit cautious given what we see. And so I think our guide is reasonable, and we're certainly going to keep you updated through the quarter as we go. So I'll end with that, and I'll let Tim talk about how he sees the $9.
Tim Knavish: Right. The $9, the answer is it's a question of when, not if. The fundamentals for $9 are absolutely there. If you look at the pluses and minuses on the ledger for that, you've got aero recovery, you've got auto recovery, you've got more refinish recovery. That great business is still down 10% versus pre-COVID. We've got the inflection of the price cost curve. You know about our restructuring and footprint work we've done. China's still closed, acquisition, synergies, technology, et cetera, et cetera. So that side of the ledger is a lot stronger than the other. The other side of the ledger is really only about macroeconomic-driven volume. And we only need some of that to come back to get to that $9. So it's absolutely in our future. And thanks for the question.
Operator: We now turn to Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Duffy Fischer: Hey, guys. This is Duffy. Can you hear me okay?
Michael McGarry: Yes, Duffy. Good morning.
Duffy Fischer: Good morning. Sorry, guys. So first, thanks and congrats to Michael and Tim. Second one -- two questions around the price cost. So the first one is to get to your first half goal of offsetting all the raw material inflation we've seen to-date, how much sequential price do you need between Q3 and whether that ends up being Q1 or Q2 next year? And then the second one is the $1.9 billion you referenced, what is it realistically you think we're playing for, let's say, over a three-year period? I mean, obviously, there's some true inflation in there that we probably never get back. You've got stuff like the Alnext plant that, again, theoretically, as soon as that's back up and running, you'll see some relief there. But you can do a lot better job analyzing the supply/demand change for each of the particular, is it half? Is it three-quarters? What is a realistic bogey that we think we can get back on the raw material side over a couple of years?
Vincent Morales: Duffy, this is Vince. I'll take the first part of that question and I'll let Michael take the second part. To fully recover our total inflation, as we said early, late Q4, early Q1, we have very modest targeted pricing actions we're going to take in Q4, and we're going to take some targeted actions in Q1. So again, we're not -- this is not relying on exceptionally exceedingly high pricing going forward.
Michael McGarry: So Duffy, let me just reiterate, look, we're going to have covered all inflation. We covered it all in the second quarter. That's total inflation, not just raws. We've covered it at all in the third quarter. We're going to cover it all in the fourth quarter. So now we're eating into some of that gap that we had built up, and we'll be totally caught up in Q1. And that's what the price increases we know. That's not with anything that may come up in the next 30 to 60 days that we may also talk -- tag on, as Vince says, from a targeted standpoint. So what is it that we're probably not going to see relief on? We're clearly not going to see relief on labor. That's not going to happen. But we are going to see -- we already have started to see relief on transportation. We think warehousing costs are going to moderate a little bit. It's not going to be significant, but that's going to moderate some. And raw materials, we've already seen it in -- starting in TiO2. We've seen it start in epoxy. We're going to continue to see it in some of the basic isocyanates. There's no question in Q1 we're going to get to lower emulsion costs. So we can see these things coming. Now are we going to get all the way back to 2019 levels on some of these? Maybe, maybe not. It's a little bit too early to make that call. But what I am confident enough is that our team has done a really good job of pricing effectively. Our customers are well aware of what's going on in that space. And I think we're going to continue to close this gap and it will be completely closed by the end of Q1. And that's why we're confident that margins will continue to expand in 2023.
Operator: Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Your line is open.
Frank Mitsch: Yes, thank you. And first, we get a changing of the guard in Pittsburgh at the quarterback and now this. Michael, it's been a pleasure working with you. Best wishes for the future, and obviously, congratulations to Tim. I wanted to drill down a bit more into the volume trends. Third quarter volumes were down 3%. I was wondering if you could let us know what that was by month to see if there was some degradation as we exited the quarter. And as I think about the fourth quarter -- as you think about the fourth quarter, you mentioned that you anticipate volumes down mid-single digits. And in the prepared remarks, you said that Asia was expected to be down 10%. I was wondering if you could offer some comments on expectations, Europe, US, Canada and Asia.
Michael McGarry: Frank, this is Michael. Thank you very much for your kind comments. It's been a pleasure working with you and obviously, we'll continue to follow the Jets regardless of where I end up playing golf in the future. So, let's talk a little bit about the third quarter. Look, the thing about the third quarter was, September in China was weaker than we expected, that we certainly did not expect the impact from them asking us to reduce rates 50-plus percent in our Tianjin plant. We certainly saw the decreases coming in the destocking in the architectural channel in Europe. They've been very aggressive with that and they made that even more aggressive in the September time frame. We started to see that in the US as well. Anything that touches a consumer, whether it's the appliance area or think about things that look like a Peloton, that continues to be weaker. So we're tracking that closely. Right now, I would say, for the fourth quarter volumes, we're not projecting any major surprises in that area. I mean, cautiously optimistic that the OEM space in Europe has reached the bottom. I think that's one area that we'll be looking for to see if that levels out where it is now. Certainly, we're worried about and watching the interest rates here in the US and how that's going to impact automotive. But look, this year, we're probably going to finish with automotive builds around 81-plus million cars and we're looking at next year to be about 85 million. So for some of these things that are weakening, we do see some things that are strengthening. And should China ever move away from -- or at least move partially away from their Zero-COVID policy, we know that flights in China will just significantly increase. They've been pent up. They want to move around, but they just haven't been allowed to by the government. So on that standpoint, I feel pretty confident.
Operator: Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Arun Viswanathan: Great, Thanks for taking my question. Apologies for that. And Michael, congratulations on your next endeavors there. Good working with you. I'm just curious on the volume side. So when we think about it, there looks like there's been some real structural damage in Europe. Volumes may not necessarily recover to where they were pre-pandemic levels. I don't know if you'd agree with that, but maybe you can just comment on that. And then secondarily, if we do see some continued weakness in Europe, is there a risk that volumes also could deteriorate in North America? And if that's the case, then are we kind of thinking about Q4 earnings run rate as likely a good starting point for Q1 and most of next year. Thanks.
Tim Knavish: Yes. So, Arun, this is Tim. Thanks for the question. I'll go first and then maybe hand it over to Vince. For Europe, I think the guidance that we put out, we're comfortable with what we projected from an architectural standpoint, industrial, auto. We feel pretty much like we bottomed on the volume standpoint from a European situation. And then, the carryover to the US, we really haven't -- we haven't seen that yet. The US volumes are holding up pretty well for us with the exception of, again, anything consumer-related on the industrial side and architectural DIY. So we haven't really seen the contagion cross the ocean into the United States market yet.
Vince Morales: Yes. Arun, this is Vince. On your question about structural demand, I think it's too early to make that call. I think as we look into 2023, again, we're going to lap some easier comparisons beginning in March. We do feel there is a health -- there's a consumer there that typically has spent money. We were obviously seeing some impact from that due to higher energy prices. The length of that energy price issue will drive some of the answers to your question that we just don't have. And if activity or production shifts to other parts of the world from Europe due to those energy prices, we already have positions. So if it shifts to China or shifts to Mexico, we'll supply the customers there.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Roberts from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
John Roberts: Thanks and best wishes, Michael, and congrats, Tim. The theme in auto OEM is that in Europe and the US, we're already at recession levels so that we don't decline further. Now that Europe is actually probably in a recession, do you still think that European auto OEM is going to be flat to up next year?
Michael McGarry: John, this is Michael. I think that European auto demand is going to remain at the list for the next two to three quarters. I don't see any catalysts for the turnaround. At the end of the day, Europe rarely gets below that 8 million or 9 million cars in Western Europe. That's about where we are now. And overall, we have a lot of cars that are driven by corporate buying and fleet buying and those behaviors have not ever changed because they're ingrained in the habits of the companies that do those things. So we're pretty confident we're at that level. In the US, look, I mean we've been constrained. I mean, right now, there's only 32 days of inventory on the lots. And many of the most popular colors are very hard to find. And so people are still buying. If you think about the truck market, you can't find a truck out there. So that remains a very solid market, and that's always a good indicator because our -- the man and the van kind of stuff, those guys need trucks. And so that's going to continue. We do see some continuum momentum on EVs, but we're really excited about the EV momentum in China. I didn't talk about this earlier, but China had a goal of having 25% of all cars by 2025 EV. Well, actually, last quarter, they hit that target. And the fact that these guys are starting to export EVs is an encouraging factor for us. And the largest maker of EVs in China is BYD and we just happen to be the largest supplier to BYD. So we feel like we're in good shape.
Vince Morales: Yes. I think, John -- this is Vince. I think holistically, when we look at the global auto market next year, our forecast six months ago was we'd be up 5% to 10% year-over-year. Our current forecast is we're going to be up 5% to 8%. So there might be some cropping off at the top of that, but we still feel very good about global auto growth next year.
Operator: We now turn to Mike Harrison from Seaport Research Partners. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Mike Harrison: Hi, good morning. And let me add my congratulations, Michael and Tim. Wanted to ask maybe for a little bit more color on the actions that you guys are taking to reduce cost by another $70 million. You mentioned that a lot of those are going to be taken in Europe. But can you talk about some of the different buckets in terms of whether it's supply chain procurement, manufacturing optimization, head count reduction. Maybe talk about the timing? And also, should we assume that it's split pretty ratably between the two segments? Thank you.
Tim Knavish: Hey, Mike, this is Tim. I'll start with -- and thanks for the question. The vast majority of the new cost-out program are people reductions. We anticipate globally we'll reduce our head count by about 2%, and most of those will be fairly fast moving. Any facility discussions, of course, we would work with the appropriate works councils. But the majority by far of this new program are fairly fast reductions in staffing.
Michael McGarry: And Mike, this is Michael. It is ratably the same between the performance side and the industrial side. And I'll let John talk a little bit about the $70 million.
John Bruno: Yeah, yeah, Mike. So we are targeting $70 million and that will start benefiting the company as early as the fourth quarter, along with other open progress we've had from prior years. At this time, we expect next year the savings will be a total of about $70 million.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Anthony Merandetti: Hi, good morning. This is Anthony Merandetti on for David Begleiter. Can you discuss the benefit in US architectural coatings from The Home Depot relationship? And maybe quantify the additional wins that were mentioned in the prepared commentary?
Tim Knavish: Sure, Anthony. This is Tim. Thanks for the question. The Home Depot Pro program is progressing well. We've got thousands of new customers from the program. And we've actually, as you heard in the prepared comments, we've activated the next phase, which is engaging with HD Supply. And the beauty of HD Supply, they're largely MRO focused, hospitality, healthcare, government, multifamily, maintenance, repair and delivered on site and previously did not do a lot of paint. So this is a lot of upside opportunity for us. And to put some scale on some of the comments earlier, we're focused heavily on lead indicators and we're averaging over 6,000 new customer engagements every week, and that is enabled by the linkage of our CRM systems between The Home Depot and PPG. So these are new customer opportunities for us that are already buying paint from somewhere else and buying other products from The Home Depot. We've got about a 40% win rate. That compares to historical levels of about a 20% win rate. So we're very satisfied with that lead indicator. And then on the HD Supply, we're very early days here, but we've also started to engage in the first month 12,000 new customers just through that next stage of the program. So big picture, this is a $10 billion US addressable market for the pro painter. It's a marathon, not a sprint as you convert each one of these contractors. But we're pleased with the results so far, and we're expecting double-digit growth in this category for us for many quarters to come.
Operator: Our next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov from Key Corp. Your line is open.
Aleksey Yefremov: Thanks and congratulations, Michael and Tim. In the US, Canada DIY market, you mentioned that it's down low single digit. How does this compare to prior downturns? How bad do you think this could get? And also in the short term, if you can comment if this is down low single digit, was getting worse in September, October or was stable?
Michael McGarry: This is Michael, Aleksey. I would tell you, the architectural business in September was a little bit lighter on the destocking in the big boxes. So that is not demand related. They just decided they would move into a little bit lower inventory position. As Tim has said on multiple occasions, our business with The Home Depot continues to grow. We're really pleased with that. We'll have some further announcements about some other wins in the big box segment when it's appropriate to put it out there. But we're going to have a substantial nice little win in the big box segment starting in the first quarter, and so we'll be starting to ship that in Q1. And what I would tell you is that, this is probably the slight downturn is lighter than historical. It's still too early to call, obviously, interest rates. When I think about interest rates of 6% and 7%, it's still low compared to my first house that I got at 11%. So, of course, my kids don't understand that. But I would tell you that, we still have a positive outlook on the housing market. We know that there is a labor shortage and more of this is being driven by the fact that both our pro painters don't have enough labor. There's not enough labor in the new home construction market. So net-net, I would still tell you that we're optimistic.
Tim Knavish: Yes, I'd just like to add one other thing on US housing with all the numbers everybody has seen. And really, we're talking about new housing here. We're going to be honest with ourselves in how we plan for that, based on what's really happening in that space. And the way we're looking at it is, we do see an air pocket in the new housing space for -- or some number of quarters. The positive from PPG standpoint, it only represents about 1% to 2% of our total enterprise sales. And we're also, frankly, significantly stronger in commercial maintenance repair. So we are accounting for what's happening in new housing in our guidance. And the other positive, as Michael alluded to, the housing fundamentals are still strong for the mid to long term. There is a housing shortage in the United States as well as many other countries. So while there is maybe an air pocket in the short term, the fundamentals for the mid and long term remain strong.
Operator: Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citigroup. Your line is open.
Patrick Cunningham: This is Patrick Cunningham on for P.J. How is Tikkurila holding up relative to your expectations, especially given the energy crunch in Europe and the consumer slowdown?
Tim Knavish: Yes, Patrick, Tim again here. We are very pleased with Tikkurila as a result in our first year of ownership. It has given us technology. It's given us ESG. It's given us a great wood care offering that we can spread throughout the rest of PPG, starting with the rest of Europe. It's given us market access, strong number one position in a number of countries. It's -- and a great management team, by the way, which was a very pleasant -- I'm not going to say a surprise, but the strength and depth of the management team was better than we had anticipated. So we are absolutely thrilled with Tikkurila and the path forward. Of course, from a DIY standpoint, they're seeing some of the same issues that I mentioned earlier for kind of the Pan-European situation. But between what we acquired with Tikkurila and what we're able to bring into Tikkurila and their position from other businesses like light industrial, like finish, like protective coatings, we really are just thrilled with how that acquisition is doing.
Michael McGarry: And Patrick, I would add one thing that the skill set that we brought to Tikkurila that they were starting to learn how to do, but we've accelerated is pricing. And this is an area where they have a market-leading position in Finland, a market-leading position in Sweden, a market-leading position in the Baltics. That pricing muscle hadn't been exercised previously, and we're showing them how to exercise it. So it's a win-win from that standpoint.
Vince Morales: And Patrick, this is Vince. I don't want to sway away from your question, but the other acquisition we did was NS Plant [ph], Michael alluded to it earlier. We've had double-digit sales growth in that business. The outlook for that business continues to look promising into 2023, especially with the infrastructure activities in the US, et cetera. So again, very promising situation with NS Plant as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Kevin Estok: Hey, good morning. This is Kevin Estok on for Laurence. Thank you for taking my question. I was just wondering if you could discuss how you guys think about incremental margins between the different regions you operate in, in particular, if there was a difference between EU and US incremental margins, let's say, every additional dollar that spent by customers?
Vince Morales: Yes. Kevin, this is Vince. We're still in that 30% to 40% range for incremental margins, certainly around the fringes as activity in Europe -- win activity in Europe comes back, it will be a little higher just because our utilization rates are a little lower. But I would certainly pencil in 30% to 40% incremental margins. And then we have to -- as we've talked about several times on this call, there'll be some benefit from price raws as that normalizes. So that will be above those incremental margins.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Haynes from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Steven Haynes: Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. As working capital frees up a little bit as inventories come down, can you just provide a bit of an update on your M&A pipeline and how you're thinking about doing deals versus share buyback going forward? Thank you.
Michael McGarry: Steven, this is Michael. Listen, our inventory on the pipeline of deals is still solid, but the most important thing is we're going to remain disciplined on how it affects total shareholder returns. So we're going to decide whether it's better to pay down debt versus do acquisitions versus buying back stock, whatever is the most accretive to our shareholders. So we're actively engaged in this space. There are still a number of deals we had. I always tell people that when earnings are falling, it's always harder to get deals done because people want to be paid on what their old earnings look like and not what the current earnings are looking like. So that always does make it a little bit more of a challenge, talk about normalized earnings versus where they currently are. But we're going to remain disciplined in this area. And I don't think you should expect anything different than what you've seen from PPG in the past.
Operator: Our last question today comes from Adrien Tamagno from Berenberg. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Adrien Tamagno: Hello. Good morning gentlemen. And congratulations to Tim and Michael. A question for Tim, I mean given your extensive experience in all of the areas of PPG, where do you see the greatest potential for self-help and margin recovery in the current environment?
Tim Knavish: Thank you, Adrien, for the question. And let me just first say I am very excited about the opportunity we have at PPG. And I can assure you that we will continue to execute on our margin recovery and we will continue to execute on the optimization of shareholder return, first and foremost. Beyond that, second, as Michael indicated, the change becomes effective on January 1, and at the appropriate time after that, I look forward to engaging all of our key stakeholders, including this group, to communicate further about my priorities, my vision for the next phase of evolution for PPG. So thrilled with the opportunity, encouraged on our path to margin recovery, encouraged on the opportunity to deliver shareholder return and look forward to 2023 for both organic growth and continued opportunities on the inorganic side.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. Mr. John Bruno, I turn the call back over to you.
End of Q&A:
John Bruno: Thank you, Elliot. I want to thank everyone for your interest and your attention today. This concludes our third quarter earnings call. Have a good day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-22 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is Lauren, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter PPG Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Bruno, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
John Bruno: Thank you, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. Once again, this is John Bruno. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG and welcome you to our second quarter 2022 financial results conference call. Joining me on the call from PPG are Michael McGarry, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Tim Knavish, Chief Operating Officer; and Vince Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our comments relate to the financial information released after US equity markets closed on Thursday, July 21st, 2022. We have posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on the Investors site of our website, ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide additional support to the brief opening comments Michael will make shortly. Following management’s perspective on the company’s results for the quarter, we will move to a Q&A session. Both the prepared commentary and discussion during the call may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company’s current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG’s operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For more information, please refer to PPG’s filings with the SEC. Now, let me introduce PPG Chairman and CEO, Michael McGarry.
Michael McGarry: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. I would like to welcome you to our second quarter 2022 earnings call. I hope you and your loved ones are remaining safe and healthy. I will provide some comments to supplement the detailed financial results we released last evening. For the second quarter, we delivered record net sales of $4.7 billion and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.81. To quickly summarize the quarter, our sales performance was an all-time record, driven by continued realization of real-time price increases that are now fully offsetting total cost inflation. Total cost inflation includes generational high commodity cost inflation, energy, logistics, and other employee-related cost inflation. In addition to pricing, our top and bottom lines continue to benefit from recent strategic acquisitions, including our Traffic Solutions business, which delivered a record quarter. We achieved strong sales results despite softening consumer demand in Europe, longer-than-anticipated COVID-related disruptions in China, and unfavorable currency translation. While we included the European demand realities and our financial guidance we issued in April, the impact of the extended China restrictions and the currency translation was negative by about $0.10 per share versus our original guidance. Our sales were aided by above-market volumes in several of our end-use markets, including our PPG-Comex business, which delivered another record quarter as concessionaires continue to add new locations. In addition, our global automotive refinish, traffic solutions and U.S. packaging coatings businesses each set all-time quarterly sales record in the second quarter. This highlights one specific example of PPG technologically advanced products. That is our packaging business, where we have won positions on about 75% of the new metal can packaging lines in North America over the past two years. Also, our aerospace business continues to benefit from year-over-year improvements in domestic travel in various countries resulted in higher aftermarket demand, and we expect further aftermarket and OEM growth as the industry demand remains well-below pre-pandemic levels. Although still challenging commodity supply disruptions continue to ease in the quarter, and we expect further improvements as we progress through the second half of 2022. This includes much better raw material availability as inventories at most of our suppliers have vastly improved. We achieved adjusted earnings that were toward the upper end of our April financial guidance and would have been in line with the second quarter of 2021, if not for the negative impact of foreign currency translation. This reflects the benefit of our strong commercial discipline regarding pricing and continued focus on cost management. Our earnings performance was aided by higher selling prices of about 12% year-over-year, marking the 21st consecutive quarter of higher selling prices. Our selling prices are now up over 15% on a two-year stacked basis, reflecting our continued actions to offset persistent cost inflation. We anticipate by the end of 2022, we will fully offset all cumulative total inflation from 2021 and 2022. More importantly, we are converting higher prices to improve margins. During the quarter, our operating earnings improved each month. This strong progress is being reflected in the positive momentum of our operating margin recovery as we improved sequentially sequential quarterly margins by 200 basis points and anticipate further improvement in the third quarter. Also aiding our second quarter earnings performance was continued realization of acquisition related synergies and cost savings from previously announced programs, which together totaled about $30 million of incremental benefit. During the second quarter, we also implemented cost mitigation initiatives in Europe, reflecting the slower demand in the region and have additional contingency plans ready in the event of a broader economic slowdown. The efforts around cost management resulted in a reduction of our overall -- of our selling and general emission cost by 100 basis points as a percent of sales compared to the prior year second quarter. Our acquisitions are also performing well, including the traffic solutions business, which achieved 15% sales growth in the second quarter. We remain excited about future growth opportunities for this business as in the next few years, we anticipate increased infrastructure spending and expect further U.S. adoption of mandatory expansion of traffic marketing for safety purposes. During the quarter, we continued to progress our launch of the expanded pro painter initiative with The Home Depot. I'll be at later than we wanted in the paint season and despite continuing raw material constraints, we were able to fully load PPG products at all U.S. locations with our full probe product assortment by the end of the quarter. We have already had some meaningful early wins of some large pro-contractors and our near-term target list includes more than 1,000 pro-contractors that have expressed interest in buying our products at the Home Depot. We're excited about teaming up with the Home Depot, and collectively, we see opportunities for significant growth in the coming years. In the second quarter, our net debt was consistent with the first quarter and our working capital was sequentially higher, mainly due to the higher dollar value of inventories, reflecting inflationary effects and higher receivables given our selling price increases. As the supply chain disruptions continue to improve in the coming quarters, we expect our working capital to return to more normal seasonal patterns and cash flow generation improve as we progress through the end of the year. We repurchased $135 million of our stock at attractive prices during the quarter and continue to manage our acquisition pipeline. In addition, we have progressed our key capital expenditures during the second quarter focused on productivity and growth and now expect total spending to be about $450 million for the full year. Consistent with our past practices, we'll deploy cash in the most accretive manner for our shareholders, including some debt reduction. In the second quarter, we further enhanced our company's corporate governance as we receive the necessary shareholder vote threshold for Board declassification and elimination of supermajority voting requirements. We had worked on soliciting our shareholders for years to pass these proxy votes, and we're pleased to see our efforts pay-off to further solidify our corporate governance. In addition, we continue to advance our sustainability strategy and proudly announced PPG's commitment to setting near-term company-wide emission reductions, in line with climate science through the science-based target initiative. We plan to communicate new 2030 goals that will define our decarbonization strategy over the coming months. Looking ahead, in most major regions and end-use markets, underlying demand for PPG products is expected to remain solid. We anticipate strong sequential growth in Asia due to higher industrial production compared to the second quarter that was heavily impacted by COVID restrictions. We're closely monitoring the current COVID situation in China. And at this time, we only expect minimal impact to our sales and operations from any further restrictions. In Europe, we expect economic conditions to remain soft, including normal seasonal demand trends versus the second quarter. Also, positive demand trends are generally expected to continue in North America, aided by stronger sequential automotive OEM production, further aerospace recovery and continuation of recent trends in auto refinish sales as we work to fulfill strong back orders. In the second half, year-over-year comparisons will be aided by the sharp declines we experienced last year during the height of the supply disruption that impacted several industries, particularly in the US. Outside of a few commodities, we expect supply chain conditions to continue to improve, including better raw material and transportation availability as our suppliers' production capabilities are returning to a more normal condition. Also, in the second half and specific to PPG, we expect several businesses, including automotive OEMs and Aerospace to deliver strong growth due to large supply deficits and low inventories in these end-use markets. Other PPG-specific positives for the second half are continuing acquisition synergy realization and additional cost savings from previously announced restructuring actions. In the third quarter, our two-year stacked raw material inflation is expected to be about 40%, up a low single-digit percentage sequentially versus the second quarter. We'll continue to prioritize implementing further real-time selling price increases, and we expect a quicker offset versus historical lags similar to what we delivered in the second quarter. Importantly, we expect that our sequential quarterly momentum on operating margin improvement will continue in the third quarter as we work back towards our historical margins. And also, even with significant unfavorable currency impacts expected to continue resulting in about a $0.10 EPS impact in the third quarter, we are forecasting our adjusted earnings to increase on a year-over-year basis. While near-term challenges exist, I remain confident about the future earnings capabilities of PPG as the earnings catalyst that I referenced in the past remain fully intact, and we certainly see a path to return to prior peak operating margins with opportunities to exceed them. As a reminder, this includes continued recovery in the automotive refinish, OEM and aerospace coatings businesses. Continued sequential momentum of positive price versus cost as commodity raw material costs moderate, in the event of an economic downturn, they should moderate in a more rapid manner. A lower cost structure resulted in strong operating leverage on any sales volume growth, accretive earnings and further growth from our recent acquisitions. In closing, as we look ahead, our team of 50,000 employees remain focused on serving our customers and supporting our stakeholders. Every day, I'm inspired by our teams around the world who are making it happen, are providing products that are helping to protect and beautify the world. Thank you for your continued confidence in PPG. This concludes our prepared remarks. Now Lauren, would you please open the line for questions.
Operator: Of course. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. David, please go ahead.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning. Michael, you discussed a path to $9 of EPS in 2023. Has that now been pushed out given the current economic backdrop and weakening we're seeing in Europe?
Michael McGarry: Well, David, it's certainly going to make it a little bit more challenging. But all the conditions are still there, right? You have refinish that's going to have an improved outlook. Miles driven are closing in on 2019 levels. Automotive OEM is still light. I mean, we got 24.5 million builds in China. We have a supply deficit in the U.S. The fleets haven't been rebuilt, so that's still there. Aerospace is coming back at a very strong level. And I'm sure you saw the Farnborough announcements about the new planes. So you're going to have not only aftermarket doing better, but OEM doing better. You have the synergies we've talked about. We have $30 million in synergies just in the quarter alone, productivity and manufacturing and then price raws, even though we haven't built that in, I'm sure somebody is going to ask later on the call about that. We see certainly raw material pricing getting a little weaker in China. We know it's going to get weaker in Europe, and that's going to free up additional. And then we still have ability to have cash deployment. So I think all options are on the table, and I think we're still pretty confident that the outlook remains good for PPG.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi from Baird. Please go ahead.
Ghansham Panjabi: Yes, good morning. Thank you for the time. On the weakness in Europe that you saw in 2Q and market concerns over a recession in the region, Michael, how do you think this particular business cycle could be different in a continued slowdown scenario given that some of your end markets never fully recovered to begin with? And then related to that, can you also comment on the current raw material supply situation in Europe just given concerns over not just the supply of natural gas, but also issues with logistics and the water levels and so on and so forth in the rivers? Thanks.
Michael McGarry: Sure, Ghansham. Let's start with the fact that what's going to be different this time is, look, in the U.S., we have full employment, and you have people with a lot of money in their pockets. And so even if the Fed over tightens, I'm still looking for people to maybe partially slow down, but it's not going to be anything significant. I would say that right now, there's a strong likelihood that people are going to continue to spend money in the U.S. Certainly, we see a slowdown coming in Europe. I got to be honest, I'm not as worried as other people are about gas rationing in Europe. And the reason for that is when you think about the size of the automotive business, the size of the chemical business, these are hugely important to people in Europe. And if you got into a significant gas rationing over there, you would have an economic event that would not be pleasant. So I'm anticipating the government is going to ask people to turn their thermostats up substantially during the summer. They're going to turn them down in the winter. People are going to start conserving. So I'm not worried about raw material supply from that standpoint. The other thing I would tell you is I'm already starting to see some rotation of raw materials out of China to Europe in anticipation of this. So that's going to provide additional supply, and that additional supply will help ease some of the projected challenges. So I'm, obviously, paying attention, but I'm not nearly as worried as some people are.
Vince Morales: And specific to the European demand contract in the U.S., we are seeing, obviously, slowness. We were down about 10% in Q2. We're projecting to be down in Q3. And we have some markets that are improving on a go-forward basis, as Michael alluded to. Our auto OEM business, we expect to improve certainly over the next, call it, 12 months. We know aerospace is improving in that particular region as well as globally. So we have some offsets to what's already a weak environment. And so again, on a go-forward basis, we expect some puts and takes.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Parkinson from Mizuho Securities. Christopher, please go ahead.
Christopher Parkinson: Great. Thank you. Just back to corollary of Beg’s questions, there have been three variables affecting your margin outlook, including end market mix with Refinish and Aero improving, but still below or maybe just at 2019 levels. Some manufacturing inefficiencies, especially in the second half due to auto OE and then, of course, price cost. When we take a step back and just think about these for this -- not only for the second half, but into 2023, going back to that $9 question, can you just give us the key highlights and how you're thinking about these right here, right now and perhaps just highlight how you're thinking about them a little bit differently versus the past three to six months? Thank you so much.
Michael McGarry: Christopher, I mean, obviously, the mix is improving every single day. So that's a positive for us. As you know, Refinish and Aerospace are very good businesses for us. And you have improved pricing in automotive, which is improving that mix as well. So I think from that standpoint, that's going to be good. The second one, if you think about our manufacturing situation, we've had to adjust manufacturing schedules on very short notice or no notice, in some cases, because of supply disruptions force majeures. And as supply gets better, we're able to plan better, scheduling is better. Obviously, COVID is not a challenge anymore. We don't have as many call-offs. So, from that standpoint, our manufacturing is going to improve. And as you see, our price is dropping to the bottom line. So, margins improved 200 basis points in Q2, you're going to see a significant improvement in Q3. You're going to see an improvement in Q4. So, from that standpoint, that is going to continue to be positive momentum and we're expecting raw materials on a sequential basis only be like up low single digits in the third quarter. So, I think there's a lot of positive momentum here and I'm feeling pretty good about that.
Vince Morales: And Christopher, I just want to -- this is Vince again. I just want to add that we are still down 10% in volume versus 2019. So, again, you said we were close to parity and just huge incremental margins on that volume recovery. Again, auto and aerospace are two of the biggest declines versus 2019 or pre-pandemic.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets. John, please go ahead.
John McNulty: Yes, thanks for taking my question. So, I guess what I'd like to focus on is the price versus raws dynamic. I guess can you help us to understand what portion of the portfolio still has more pricing that it needs to get to catch up. It seems like you did really well in 2Q. I guess I'm curious what else you need to kind of hit on. And then equally important, it looks like you're on track for raws to be up about $2 billion or so over the last couple of years. I guess when we start to see raws coming off, I guess, how much of the pricing associated with that do you think you hold on to versus having to give back? Is there a way to think about that? Because it just seems like it's a really big number.
Vince Morales: Yes, John, this is Vince. I'll start, and then Michael could add some color. We still have targeted pricing that we will inject in Q3. Some businesses, we have perennial pricing that typically occurs toward the end of the season. So, you'll see that both in performance. We still have some catch-up pricing in some of our industrial and auto businesses that will take place in the quarter. And so there will be higher -- we expect higher pricing on a percentage basis and certainly on a two-year stack for Q3. With respect to the inflation, I think your numbers are directionally correct in terms of the inflation we've absorbed over the past, call it, 18 and soon to be 24 months. We anticipate offsetting that fully with price. But not just that, as Michael mentioned in the opening remarks, we're offsetting logistics. We're offsetting employee-related inflation so in packaging inflation. So, again, our pricing will overcome that by the end of the year. And we typically have sticky pricing as we progress through the economic cycle.
Michael McGarry: So, maybe, John, to add a little bit to that. Your premise that you're trying to understand is how much of this $2 billion plus are we going to keep. The thing that we're talking to our customers about is raw material inflation is just one piece of this. And so when you add the things that Vince talked about, logistics, labor, energy, packaging costs, we need to continue to recover that. So, I fully expect, and I will be fully engaged and Tim will be fully engage with the businesses to ensure that we're going to be keeping a large percentage of this in our pocket. And that is a key deliverable for our business unit leaders. Everybody is well aware of it, and it's been signaled well ahead of time. So, this will not be a surprise to our customers. So, I'm feeling pretty good.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Kevin, please go ahead.
Kevin McCarthy: Good morning. In your guidance for the third quarter on Slide 10, you're baking in volume assumptions of flat to down a low single-digit percentage. I was wondering if you could just speak to the buildup to that assumption, maybe in terms of geography, assumptions around China lockdowns, you lack thereof, European macro, but also in terms of your individual businesses and which ones you expect highest or weakest volume growth in the third quarter?
Vince Morales: Hi, Kevin. Good morning. This is Vince again. So, on a year-over-year basis, probably a couple of big movers. Again, we expect Europe to be down double digits, close to double digits versus the prior year. But we do expect, if you recall, we did have the peak of the chip shortage in our automotive OEM business last year, and that's recovering. Not fully recovering, but it's recovering this year. We also have improvement in aerospace, as we've talked about several times already on the call. Those are three of the bigger movers. And then we have a variety of puts and takes by business. On a sequential basis, what's important is we do expect -- for us, China was down for essentially two months in Q2. We do expect China to be fully up and running with just modest, very modest impact from COVID in Q3. So that's the biggest mover sequentially.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Spector from UBS. Josh, please go ahead.
Josh Spector: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering, within Architectural Coatings, could you discuss some of the volume differences in DIY versus trade markets, I guess, specifically looking at North America and Europe. And I guess given some of the commentary about Europe, where you're still seeing declines on technically easier comps from last year, what does that say about your thoughts about DIY and how that holds up in a recession, this cycle potentially? Thanks.
Tim Knavish: I'll take that one, Josh. This is Tim Knavish. Thanks for the question. The biggest driver of the volume issue in DIY is clearly Europe. We've seen a double-digit decline in DIY volumes in Europe. And frankly, we expect that to continue. We called it at the end of the last quarter, that was accurate and we expect that same phenomenon to continue. The trade volumes in Europe are a bit stronger. It depends on some by country. We're seeing some softness in some countries of trade and other countries like France, we continue to do very well on the trade side of the business. So that's more mixed. And when you come over to this side, to the United States, we've also seen DIY, I would call it more normalizing, where Europe was down because of a number of issues, whether it was coming out of COVID or consumer confidence because of the war. Here in the United States, it's more normalizing in a post-COVID environment, whereas in the trade side of the business here in architectural US, we still see very good backlogs. We do a survey of our professional painters every quarter. And about 80% of the professional painters that we surveyed here in the US this quarter have as much or larger backlogs than they did last quarter. So DIY normalizing here, but still good trade backlogs.
Vince Morales: This is Vince. A couple of other color points here. In the US, we were still impacted early in the quarter in our US architectural business by supply challenges. April, May are still in the heart of the paint season. And in Europe, based on what we've seen to date, we're very comfortable with our share position.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Frank, please go ahead.
Frank Mitsch: Thank you and good morning, folks. I appreciate the level of details. Coming to the use of cash, Tikkurila is rolling off as a driver as part of the M&A increase. And I know that M&A is important to PPG. You did mention that you stepped up buybacks in a quarter at attractive prices. But I'm just curious as to what the outlook is on the M&A front that's out there.
Michael McGarry: Frank, this is Michael. The M&A front continues to be what I would call steady. You saw there were some deals done in the past 90 to 120 days. We obviously looked at those and decided that we sort value creating from a PPG shareholder perspective. And we continue to look at our portfolio. You probably noticed that we sold a couple of businesses. You saw we sold Everly [ph] and another small one. And so we're always looking at our portfolio. So -- but we're going to do what's best. So this quarter, paying down debt and buying back a little stock made the most amount of sense. We're going to continue to look at our portfolio and decide what we're going to do. The pipeline remains what I would call steady, and we're continuing to talk to the Board about the options that are out there.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Laurent Favre from BNP Paribas. Laurent, please go ahead.
Laurent Favre: Good morning, all. I had a question regarding this contingency plan on the European side. I mean, I hope you're right on, I guess, the lack of big curtailments of chemical production and all the mess that would be related to that. But I was wondering if you could talk about two things. One is are you thinking about raw materials inventories and stocking up perhaps into a more turbulent time. But also in terms of areas where you may have single sourcing, I know that there was a big surprise last year in the US, I'm wondering if you plan from the US side and that now all of your European operations can run on dual sourcing, for instance, so that you can indeed import those raw materials from elsewhere? Thank you.
Michael McGarry: So Laurent, this is Michael. First of all, it's virtually impossible to be dual source on everything because we make some unique chemistries. On those that we are single source, we have a contractual relationship with our suppliers to provide that protection that we need. But we have been in a mode of being conservative on inventories right now. In Europe, though, we are going to be moving toward a mode of destocking over the next few months. We've already started to see availability raw materials get better. We anticipate that prices, we've seen some prices already soften in China. We anticipate some softening coming up in Europe. And so the plants have already put in place contingency plans. They've enacted some to lower costs. And so from that standpoint, I think we feel very comfortable. We have some additional plans in place as well.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Arun, please go ahead.
Arun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, I just wanted to go back to the bridge potentially to maybe $9 or something close to that in 2023 or 2024. If you think about that that seems to be likely that it would have to be composed of something around $250 for Q2, Q3 and $2 for Q1, Q4, I guess, is that correct? I mean, that would imply like a 20% improvement on a quarterly run rate basis. And if you think about that 20%, is that maybe one-third volume improvement and two-thirds kind of margin recovery from price cost? Or how should we think about that path to getting back to that kind of earnings power?
Vince Morales: We'll try to take another stab at this, Arun. This is Vince. So look, we're down 10% in volume versus 2019. We expect the vast majority of that to return. Again, because of some of these decremental items are in very large businesses for us and businesses that are showing today, and we expect on a go-forward basis, good recovery momentum, again, we talked about auto. We talked about aerospace. There are a couple more that are smaller. We do expect positive business mix as part of that equation as well. To your point on price, raws recovery, we've talked about a couple of times. We're still down in Q3 on a cumulative basis. We expect to be at least at parity by the end of the year on price raws, so that will pick up several points. And then I don't want to underemphasize what Michael talked about with respect to manufacturing. We typically have productivity improvements year-over-year from our manufacturing operations. If you look at the past 12 months, we've had decrements in manufacturing. So we expect to fully recover those decrements and move back to our legacy of producing productivity. So those three things, coupled with synergy capture and coupled with some cash deployment, gets us to the $9 plus of earnings power we've talked about.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Prashant Juvekar from Citi. Prashant, please go ahead.
Prashant Juvekar: Yes. Hi, good morning. You talked about European DIY being slow. You've talked about that for a while. How did European industrial business do throughout the quarter? Did it slow down as the quarter progressed? And then a related question to that is, are you seeing a rebound in industrial activity in China? And do you think that China activity or industrial activity can grow if US and Europe are slowing down? Thank you.
Vince Morales: Yes, P.J., we saw declines in architectural in Europe, obviously, as Tim talked about, automotive on a year-over-year basis and our industrial business on a year-over-year basis were also down, let's call it, mid-single-digits due to some of the same issues that caused call it economic slowing in the region. On a go-forward basis, auto, we expect to recover at some point. It's still going to be choppy in the back half of the year in Europe. It's going to certainly recover in the US and in China. Industrial activity, we expect at least at parity. We are seeing a very rapid recovery in China from the COVID shutdowns and expect growth on a year-over-year basis in Q3. With respect with Europe slowing, would China grow? Again, we think China is becoming more of an internally consumption market, and we still feel good about the US economy. So, there are some offsets to a European slowing that would allow China to produce good industrial activity results.
Michael McGarry: P.J., this is Michael. I think if you think about this from a China macro standpoint, China government is under significant pressure right now because of some of these COVID lockdowns. And they're injecting money, reducing the amount of bank restrictions and they're putting pressure on the building industry as well. So, they are showing every sign to make sure that the local economies in China continue to recover. So, I'm -- I feel pretty good about the fact that China is committed to having a better second half of the year than they had the first half of the year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Sison from Wells Fargo. Michael, please go ahead.
Michael Sison: Hey guys, nice quarter. It does feel like a recession is the consensus view pending these days and your portfolio has changed. So, just curious, overall, how do you think the current portfolio would, in terms of volumes, would hold up in a recession? And given you've got $2 billion worth of inflation, is it possible that you could potentially offset that entire volume decline because you get a lot of this inflation back and maybe PPG's earnings look a little bit more resilient than maybe in the past?
Michael McGarry: Well, Mike, I think we certainly have built a more resilient company to start with that as a basic premise. Second, I do think that we're going to keep a lot more raw materials in our pocket. So, if you do see a raw material decline, I think that's going to flow through the P&L a lot quicker than you think. And I think that's a little bit of what people are missing in this analysis. And quite honestly, this recession, if there is one, which I still don't think there's going to be a significant one If there is one, we have a different portfolio right now. So, think about traffic solutions. I mean that business runs no matter what happens. And they are behind on that, plus you have demographics where they're going to have thicker lines more -- the lines are going to be longer. So, those things are going to be positive. You also have the fact that we have a supply significant deficit here in the US of cars. That's going to be different. And we have a significant deficit of planes, and that's going to be different. And the new planes that are coming out are much more fuel-efficient than the old plane. So, it's not a matter of whether they're going to keep the old planes in the air, they're not going to do that. They're going to replace these because of the fuel efficiency. And so if you believe that $100 oil is here for long moderate period of time, the plane guys, those are economics they cannot afford to miss. So that's why they're going to be replacing these planes. So, I think that's all good. And so, what's interesting about this work from home stuff is that the, the dynamics are people are driving in the suburbs more and less on the highway, which leads to more lower speed collisions. So, totals are actually down right now. So, totals were down 2% and I anticipate totals continuing to decline, and that's good for our refinish business. And oh, by the way, if you're getting an accident right now, you better be prepared to wait because there's about a six-week the average backlog to get a car repaired is about six weeks right now. That's assuming they get the parts. So, I'm feeling pretty good about that.
Vince Morales: And Mike, this is Vince again. I just -- your comparison, and we'll just compare to the last recession. Obviously, there was a housing overhang globally in the last recession. There was an auto overhang in the last recession. We're not seeing those. Michael talked about aerospace. We expect that to be in a recovery mode, auto in a recovery mode as it relates to PPG's portfolio and a different -- in an addition to traffic solutions versus the last recession, we have PPG-Comex, which is a very steady business for us. We also have some other businesses in other parts of the world that are more steady. So again, I think Michael's comments at the outset that we've built a better portfolio, more resilient portfolio takes into account some of those things.
Tim Knavish: Yes. And Mike, it's Tim. Just to pile on here, even one more business from a recession or a potential recession resiliency standpoint, the military part of our aerospace business, given what's happening in geopolitically, tremendous backlog there, too.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Jeff, please go ahead.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. Your volume expectation in Performance Coatings for the third quarter is flat to down a low single-digit percentage. Isn't that too low? And that I understand that European Deco is weak, but is an aerospace better and auto refinish. And last year, they were very -- there are shortages in raw materials in the North American architectural market. Shouldn't volumes be up in the third quarter? And then for Vince, inventories and receivables are going up at maybe about a 10% rate and payables are maybe going up at half that. Is that a trend that's going to continue? And why the difference?
Vince Morales: Yes, Jeff, I'll take the second question first. Again, on inventory, we came into the quarter -- we came into the year with a focus on having excess inventory where possible in order to have supply to our customers. So, we're certainly looking at that as we go to the back half of the year. We'll ratably work that down as supply conditions have improved and continue to improve. Receivables are up simply because our pricing is up, and we have a bigger book of business. I think receivables are up $600 million or $700 million on a year-over-year basis. We'll collect those, and we're not seeing any significant deterioration on collections. So, the high receivable balance, Jeff, will turn to cash in the third and fourth quarter. Payables, again, we're timely with our suppliers, so, nothing to speak of there. As it relates to the Performance Coatings volumes, there's a variety of different moving pieces. Aerospace up, as you mentioned. We do see DIY, down both in Europe, US, also in other mature regions like Australia. We do have a slowing -- we do have some challenges in our protective business when you go into Q3, really residual hangover from Q2 in China. So with the reporting segment, you always have puts and takes. It's our best guess at this time. Hopefully, we're being conservative. But that's our best guess at this time.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer from Goldman Sachs. Duffy, please go ahead.
Duffy Fischer: Yes, good morning. Question just around raw materials. If you could talk about the different buckets, solvents, resins, pigments and maybe packaging. What's your view what's happening with price and availability going into the back half of the year? And then maybe kind of what do you think the two-year outlook is for some of these raw materials that have been quite tight?
Michael McGarry: Well, let's start with the negative first, is that emulsions continue to be a bit of a challenge for us. And there have been a few force majeures. You probably saw the one in next recently. So it's not -- we're not out of the woods on that yet. But we've seen TiO2 and China get weaker. We're seeing TiO2 from China being shipped into Europe. I certainly see epoxies in Asia getting weaker as well. I think that there's a number of our solvents that are now flattening out. Availability is much improved, but the pricing is flattening out. And I think the same thing with packaging. Packaging is flattening out. And so I think when I look at our overall, we bucket our raw materials into about 12 different buckets. Last quarter, I had 11 out of 12 were red. Coming into this quarter, we have four or five of them that are yellow. That means the prices have moderated, and we actually have one green on the chart. So -- and when we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we see improvement in a number of those as well. So I think we're coming to the end of the raw material inflation, and that's good for us sequentially. We see low single-digits in the third quarter, and I think you should expect sequential improvement in the fourth quarter.
Tim Knavish: Hey, Duffy, it's Tim. Just to add to what Michael said. While supply is significantly better than it was at the beginning of Q2 and certainly better than last year, we still have spot supply issues, I would call it, in refinish, in auto, in architectural. So we're not quite back to what you would call completely normal supply, pre-COVID kind of supply situations, although sequentially much better, and we expect that to sequentially continue to improve.
Vince Morales: And Duffy you asked about -- this is Vince. Just about two years. That's beyond our forecasting horizon. We're typically three to six month windows, the best forecasting visibility we have, and we certainly can't go out two years. If there is structural commodity supply being built in China, which we expect to fully exploit. But that's the best we could give on a two-year lot.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Vincent, please go ahead.
Vincent Andrews: Yes. Thank you. Just wondering if you can talk a little bit about the cost work you're doing in Europe and whether that's sort of structural or just sort of temporal. And along those same lines, given sort of the normalization in DIY, has there been an opportunity to reduce maybe promotional spending? I mean, maybe that was already being reduced during the hot demand period, or ad spending. Or is anything changing on how you're allocating investment spending into that business?
Michael McGarry: Well, certainly, on the ad spending, as you see the decline, you're also getting near the end of the paint season by the time the quarter is going to be over. So that is on a decline. That's typical, though. So that's not really that much of a difference. We do bucket our cost reductions in Europe into two things. One is structural and one is short term. The structural ones, you see that flowing through. We have plants that we have targeted to be closed. We have headcount that we're taking out. We have productivity initiatives through dispense cells and other high-volume packaging equipment that is driving productivity in the plant. All those things are underway. And then, of course, we are on a temporary basis. You are reducing headcount as you're seeing that lower demand in the Architectural segment. So I'm feeling comfortable that we're going to continue to grow margins. If you look at our history in Europe, we have consistently grown our earnings in Europe year-over-year regularly. So I don't think this should be any different this year.
Tim Knavish: Hi, Vince, Tim here, Tim Knavish. We also have continuation of the Tikkurila synergies, which, of course, are structural. We've captured a lot of those. But footprint-wise and back-office wise, we continue to make progress there. And just to put some perspective, margin improvement progression has continued in our AC Europe business, despite the volume challenges, and we expect that to continue as well.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Leithead from Barclays. Mike, please go ahead.
Mike Leithead: Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just on auto OE. I was hoping you could give some context about your volume levels today versus maybe, say, pre-pandemic. I'm just trying to figure out, if we get back to, say, a 2019 type build rate, what sort of upside does that offer? And maybe just remind us what type of incremental margin levels we should think about broadly for your Industrial Coatings business today after all the restructuring and whatnot.
Vincent Andrews: Well, Mike, if I remember right, last year, there was about 78 million cars built. We're on a path to have a little bit over 80 million cars built. At the peak, it was 95 million cars, and there is a substantial backlog of vehicles that need to be built. And plus, I think what you're going to be seeing you're already starting to see some of these electric vehicles being made in China that are being exported to Europe. So you're going to start to see a better mix in our automotive business because of mobility. And right now, our margins in automotive are improving on a sequential basis. So what I would do is I'd look back at the historical margins in our industrial segment. And you know automotive is the biggest business in that. So they're going to be somewhat close to that margin, and that's the way I would do the math.
Vince Morales: Yes. And Mike, if I could just elaborate a little bit on what we call the latent demand in auto here. We talked about this last quarter, but US dealer inventory somewhere below -- just below 30 days. Typically, that's 60 plus, 70 plus. So the inventories need rebuilt. There's a big fleet rebuild process that has taken place in the US that includes just company-owned cars as well as other fleet vehicles. That's a significant impact. There is a European fleet that also, at some point, will be rebuilt. There's a significant amount of employees that have company cars in Europe. So that's another adder. And that -- those latent things, in addition to the demand where most cars are on back order. So again, we have comfort the next 12-plus, 15-plus months for a solid recovery back toward that, call it, high 80s, low 90s level. So we're still down about almost 20% in the industry versus pre-pandemic.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Harrison from Seaport Research Partners. Mike, please go ahead.
Mike Harrison: Hi, good morning. I was wondering if we could go back to some of the raw material availability issues and specifically dig in on what's going on in the Refinish business. It’s sounds like some of the raw material and logistics bottlenecks that you've been seeing are going to continue into Q3. So maybe just a little more detail on what you're seeing there? What needs to happen to get some resolution to those supply issues? And I guess, is your expectation that, that improvement is going to happen some time this year? Or is that an early 2023 thing? What's the timing looking like? Thank you.
Tim Knavish: Hey Mike, its Tim. We -- despite having a record quarter in Refinish, and we expect that kind of performance to continue, we do have persistent, I would call them one-off shortages from a raw material standpoint that have led to some of the backlogs in addition to the backlog of work that our customers have, we've got a backlog just to catch up and refill the channel because of these one-offs. That won't get fixed overnight. It continues also to sequentially improve, and I expect us to continue to work our way through that through the rest of this year, which frankly, is some pent-up upside for us because in addition to the high body shop activity levels that we have notably here in the US, we've got this inventory replenishment to catch up on throughout the rest of this year as well.
Operator: Thank you. That is the end of the Q&A session. So I'll now hand you back over to John Bruno for closing remarks.
John Bruno: Thank you, Lauren, and everyone, for listening, for your interest in PPG. I look forward to talking and seeing many of you in the coming weeks. This concludes our second quarter earnings call. Have a good day.
Operator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-04-22 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is Sam and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter PPG Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Bruno. Please go ahead, sir.
John Bruno: Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. Once again, this is John Bruno. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG and welcome you to our first quarter 2022 financial results conference call. Joining me on the call from PPG are Michael McGarry, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Tim Knavish, Chief Operating Officer; and Vince Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our comments relate to the financial information released after U.S. equity markets closed on Thursday, April 21, 2022. We have posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on the investor slide of our website, ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide additional support to the brief opening comments Michael will make shortly. Following management’s perspective on the company’s results for the quarter, we will move to a Q&A session. Both the prepared commentary and discussion during the call may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company’s current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG’s operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For more information, please refer to PPG’s filings with the SEC. Now, let me introduce PPG Chairman and CEO, Michael McGarry.
Michael McGarry: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. I’d like to welcome everyone to our first quarter 2022 earnings call. I hope you and your loved ones are remaining safe and healthy. To say that these have been difficult and challenging times for so many would be a massive understatement. Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, we have been focused on protecting the health and safety of our employees and their families from Ukraine as well as our employees in Russia. PPG and the PPG Foundation have also committed more than $800,000 to humanitarian relief as well as longer-term recovery support. In addition, PPG employees have also been providing direct support to those in need, including taking refugee families into their homes. The war has also made it necessary to scale back and now wind down our operations in Russia. As a result, we have recorded a pre-tax charge of $290 million for impairment of substantially all of our company assets related to our Russian operations. For context, net sales in Russia represented approximately 1% of total PPG net sales for the year ending December 31, 2021. We will continue to closely monitor developments in the region. Before I provide the regular quarterly review of our results, I’d like to provide a concise summary of the key issues impacting our business in the quarter as we look ahead. During the first quarter, we had two major events: the Ukraine-Russia crisis and increased COVID-19 restrictions in China, which have created some new uncertainties about overall regional demand and possible global carry-on effects. You will see due to these increased uncertainties, we have widened our earnings guidance range we provided for the second quarter. Notwithstanding these two major events are other longer standing global impacts which have affected our financial results for several quarters and which are abating or ratably improving. Specifically, we continue to experience improvements in our supply chain and our raw material availability. Additionally, outside of China, COVID restrictions have continued to decrease in many parts of the world. As a company, we have continued to improve our pricing realization in both pace and cadence. This has been necessary to battle the persistence and breadth of inflation. Our price capture this cycle is much faster and we are now pricing in the second quarter for second quarter inflation impacts, so we are basically pricing in real time. We continue to deliver good earnings leverage when we have improving volumes. While many of our businesses and regions have not fully recovered from the pandemic, as a matter of fact, we are still down about 5% in aggregate. However, when a business does deliver volume improvement, we are realizing good bottom line gains. This reflects the hard work from our teams on managing our operating costs and SG&A. Finally, we had a very solid month of March from a financial returns perspective. We have stated many times that March is the most important month in the first quarter given the seasonality of our businesses. Our month of March financial returns are the best return since the second quarter of 2021. I will now move to provide some comments to supplement the detailed financial results we released last evening. For the first quarter, we delivered record net sales of $4.3 billion and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.37. To quickly summarize the quarter, our sales performance was better than our January guidance despite unexpected impacts from the crisis in Europe, COVID-related disruption in China and continuing logistics bottlenecks. More than offsetting these unexpected macro issues was stronger than expected demand across many of our businesses as regional economies and end-use markets continue to recover from the pandemic impacts. Above market sales volumes were achieved in several of our end-use markets, including our PPG-Comex business, which during the quarter, opened their 5,000th concessionaire location in Mexico. First quarter sales in Latin America were a record. In addition, our automotive refinish business performed well with strong sales volumes in the U.S. and Europe. Also, our aerospace business benefited from year-over-year initial improvements in the market and we expect further industry demand growth as we are still well below pre-pandemic levels. Our adjusted earnings were significantly above the upper end of our January financial guide as we delivered strong earnings leverage on the higher-than-expected sales volumes. This leverage was a result of improving manufacturing performance as COVID-related absenteeism subsided significantly as we progressed through the quarter and we experienced increasing raw material availability. In addition, our selling price increases increased 10% year-over-year, marking the 20th consecutive quarter of higher selling prices. Our selling prices are up over 12% on a 2-year stack basis versus the first quarter of 2020, reflecting our continued actions to offset generationally high inflation. Our recent acquisitions also performed well, including the realization of targeted synergies. The Tikkurila business delivered year-over-year sales growth of more than 10%, excluding our Russian operations. Our Traffic Solutions business also achieved greater than 10% sales growth and our first quarter sales were a record and the business continued to have a large order backlog as we entered the second quarter. During the quarter, we also launched a significant expanded Pro Painter initiative with The Home Depot. And despite continuing raw material constraints restricting our ability to fully load inventory, we now have our full Pro Paint assortment available in about 60% of their stores. We expect to have all The Home Depot stores loaded in the coming months. We are excited about the growth opportunities that this initiative provides and have already recognized some significant new professional painter business gains. Our earnings and margins continue to be impacted by elevated levels of inflation and supply disruptions. In the first quarter, our selling prices did offset year-over-year raw material inflation, but did not offset inflation from other sources, including logistics, energy and labor and we did not fully recover prior year inflation. Sequentially, versus the fourth quarter 2021, our overall margins improved by more than 200 basis points. We are targeting continued quarterly sequential margin improvement in the second quarter as well despite further increases in raw material and logistics inflation. We have continued to optimize our commercial processes the last 2 years and as mentioned are now closer to real-time pricing relative to inflation. Due to higher crude oil and energy prices, we are implementing incremental selling price increases in the second quarter and expect that we will exit the second quarter offsetting all inflation categories on a run rate basis. This drives our expectations for operating margins to sequentially improve further as the year progresses. In several businesses, we continue to face certain raw material shortages resulting in our overall sales backlog growing to about $180 million exiting the quarter. The order backlogs are the highest in our aerospace and automotive refinish businesses. Additionally, these are two of our many industries we supply where inventory levels are extremely low all the way to the end consumer. We have continued to control our controllables and once again lowered our SG&A as a percentage of sales, decreasing by about 40 basis points compared to the first quarter 2021. This included delivery of an additional $15 million in cost savings from recent restructuring programs and acquisition synergies. This is also despite expanding our multiyear investment in our advanced digital capabilities. And we are experiencing growing digital adoption from our customers, most notably in the architectural coatings business. In the first quarter, our net debt increased mainly due to the higher dollar value of inventory reflecting inflationary effects. The seasonal working capital increase in the quarter was consistent with pre-pandemic years. We expect our cash flow generation to match prior year end trends, which is to consume cash early in the year and generate strong cash flow as we progress through the end of the year. Strategically, on April 1, we completed the acquisition of Arsonsisi’s Powder Coatings business, continuing our focus on growing our powder coatings manufacturing capabilities. In addition, we divested some architectural coatings businesses in Africa as we continue with our legacy evaluating all regional businesses and product lines to ensure that they continue to have strategic value and meet our financial hurdles. In the first quarter, we continued to take additional measurable steps to further advance our ESG program by issuing our inaugural DE&I report. While I am proud of what we have achieved, we know that there is more work to do and additional areas of opportunity to focus on. If you have not already done so, I would encourage you to read our report and learn more about what we have done and our aspirational goals for the future which are outlined in our presentation materials. Looking ahead, while our underlying demand continues to be solid in most of our end-use markets and regions, second quarter economic activity, in particular in Europe, has started to soften as consumers remain cautious based on the current geopolitical issues in the region. In addition, manufacturing supply chains have been recently impacted in China due to severe restrictions from rising COVID cases. In the last few weeks, up to 5 of our smaller manufacturing sites have been mandated to shutdown due to restrictions plus our principal Protective & Marine Coatings production facility. We are working in both of these regions to manage our operations and costs are reflective of these current macro challenges. We are also assessing impacts both positive and negative these challenges may have on raw material supply and costs. As mentioned earlier, we expect further sequential inflationary pressures on raw materials, logistics and energy. Our 2-year stacked raw materials inflation expected to exceed 35%, but only up low to mid single-digit sequentially versus the first quarter. We are implementing further selling price increases in all of our businesses and expect a quicker offset versus historical lags. Due to the heightened levels of uncertainty, our earnings guidance considers a wider range of outcomes for the second quarter. More generally, our guidance assumes that restrictions in China ease somewhat in May and that geopolitical issues do not expand beyond the current Russia-Ukraine boundaries. While the current environment remains difficult to predict, I expect that as 2022 progresses, we will begin to experience an easing in supply chain disruptions, general inventory rebuilding across many end use markets and still a healthy consumer willing to spend, especially in North America. The future PPG earnings catalysts that I referenced on the January earnings call remain intact and we certainly see a path to return to prior peak operating margins with opportunities to exceed them. This includes continued recovery in the automotive refinish, OEM and aerospace coatings businesses; normalization of commodity raw material costs, which should moderate over time given supply dislocations are improving and there is a softening in certain regional economies. As demonstrated this past quarter and supported by our lower cost structure, strong operating leverage on any sales volumes growth, accretive earnings growth from our recent acquisitions from both their historical base earnings and further synergy capture; above market organic growth driven by our advantage and leading brands, technologies and services. In closing, as we look ahead, I remain confident about the company’s future. I strongly believe in our team of 50,000 employees as we work to do better today than yesterday everyday. The way our employees have dealt with the pandemic and our helping during the Ukraine humanitarian crisis and are navigating through a very challenging business environment are a prime example of how the team is making it happen. Thank you for your continued confidence in PPG. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, Sam, would you please open the line for questions?
Operator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho. Christopher, you can proceed with your question.
Christopher Parkinson: Great. Thank you so much. Can you quickly give us more granular update on the various inputs as it pertains to, I would say 2Q and the second half inflation outlooks and as well as the persistence – excuse me, of certain input shortages on a quarter-to-quarter basis? Thank you.
Michael McGarry: Chris, what I would tell you is that our input shortages remain consistent with what we have seen previously. Motions tend to be at the top of the list. We have had some intermittent, because of manufacturing issues with TiO2, those issues have all been resolved. Force majeures, when we had the last call, they were over 100. We are down to about 50 now. We have seen improved reliability in Europe. We have seen improved reliability, exclusive of the Shanghai area, for Asia. And we are still seeing some challenging with trucking here in the U.S. But sequentially, we do see the pace of inflation coming down. And what’s most important is that our pricing is accelerating and is in a much more real-time basis.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi of Baird. Ghansham, please proceed.
Ghansham Panjabi: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Could you just give us a bit more color on a real-time basis in terms of what you are seeing both in Europe and China both from a demand and supply chain standpoint and in particular, which businesses are being most impacted? And then related to that, just given all the complexity in the world and your strong capital position, how are you now thinking about share buybacks at this point in context of, obviously, the moves in the stock and your peers this year, any changes to that versus acquisitions? Thanks.
Michael McGarry: Okay. Ghansham, let’s start with the share buyback question first. We are always going to look to optimize shareholder value. Our pipeline of acquisitions remains active. But obviously, at the share price, we are going to balance what’s most accretive to the shareholders. And so we are looking at both. And in regards to China and Europe, what I would tell you is the car situation in China is being impacted probably a little bit more than some of the other markets. We do regard that as transitory. We are fully expecting as we’ve seen in other instances. People are going to be much more interested in driving themselves taking mass transit. So we do expect car recovery in Europe and is the largest car market in the world. And they are also shifting from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles faster than some of the other markets. And of course, as you know, we have more content on electric vehicles and we do internal combustion engines. So we feel optimistic about that. So clearly, we’re concerned about the rising number of COVID cases. It has plateaued in the last 2 or 3 days. We have gotten all, but two of our plants back up and operating. And we expect to get the other two plants up and operating in the next 3 to 5 days, I would say, if we’re being a little bit optimistic here. But overall demand in China remains good. I don’t think the Chinese economy can afford to have GDP in the low single digits. That’s not good for them. And I do expect the government to be aggressive in providing a business-friendly environment coming out of this most recent COVID situation. And then in regard to Europe, clearly, the most concerning area for Europe is DIY. We predicted this. This is consistent with what we have told. We continue to have a strong Pro Painter backlog. But DIY and traffic through the big-box stores in Europe is the one indicator that we’re watching out.
Vince Morales: Ghansham, this is Vince. I think if we think more broadly as we put together our Q2 forecast, we do expect China to – some of the COVID restrictions to ease in the early part of May and continue to ease through the balance of the quarter, but they are certainly restrictive right now. We know there’ll be some carry-on effects with respect to logistics and transportation import availability well into May. So that’s baked into our guidance. In Europe, again, we’re concerned about – maybe overly concerned, but we’re concerned about the effect on consumer of energy prices and just the overall environment. So our forecast has baked some of that passiveness – consumer passiveness into Q2. We hope we’re being a bit bearish, but that’s what we’ve forecasted and we will see how the cards fall as we go through the quarter.
Operator: Thank you, Ghansham. The next question is from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. David, please proceed.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning, Michael and Vince. Guys, just on U.S. architectural, are you seeing any discounting by your competitors? And if so, how are you responding to this more competitive pricing environment potentially? Thank you.
Michael McGarry: Okay. David, I’m going to – we have Tim here. I’m going to let Tim handle that question.
Tim Knavish: Hi, David, Tim Knavish here. Look, in our architectural U.S. business, in fact, our architectural business is around the world. We continue to get increasing sequential pricing. And that pricing, while never easy to get, is being accepted by our customers. And we – our customers have to remain competitive every day. So we can assume that we’re seeing that same kind of behavior from others in the market. So we have not seen what you call discounting in the market. I think the industry realizes what’s going on upstream of us and acting accordingly.
Operator: Thank you, David. The next question is from John McNulty of BMO. John, please proceed.
John McNulty: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. So on the pricing front, Michael, you kind of indicated you’re almost at a point where it’s real-time pricing. I guess what are the mechanisms in place that you’ve put so that we can actually see that real-time pricing? And I guess to that also, when the raw materials eventually or hopefully subside, do you give back some of that pricing in real time? Or is that something where we may see the more traditional lag or even stability when it comes to price? I guess, how should we be thinking about that?
Michael McGarry: Well, John, first of all, we’re not going to be giving this pricing back. As you know, we are still lagging. If you look at this on a 2.5-year stack, so there is plenty of recovery. And the reason that we’re able to get more real-time pricing than ever before is it’s impossible for our customers to argue with what’s going on, right? They fully see the same things that we’re seeing. They are seeing energy prices go up. They see raw materials that we buy, they can see it in their own systems going up. They can see transportation going up, they are paying for transportation. And they also cannot argue that our competitors are not pricing. So from that standpoint, most of the bullets that they usually try to fire at us, that our salespeople try to avoid, that’s not happening. And now it’s not a matter of can we take a price increase? Now it’s about how much of a price increase are you going to take. And the other thing that we’ve done much more aggressively than we ever have is withhold shipments. So we’re telling people, this is the new price. And if you don’t like it, please don’t place purchase orders. And if the purchase orders come in without the new price on it, we’re sending those purchase orders back. And that has gotten the attention of our customers and they understand that we need relief and we need relief now. And so you could see that there is a palpable energy in the air to get price increases as we’re doing it. So when you see oil at $107, our customers are getting priced like that. So I’m really pleased our sales teams have gotten much better at pricing than ever in the history of the company.
Operator: Thank you, John. The next question is with Stephen Byrne of Bank of America. Stephen, please proceed.
Stephen Byrne: Yes. Thanks. Michael, I’d like to drill in a little more on this relationship with Home Depot. Michael, you mentioned the 60% level of a particular metric. I didn’t catch what that was. But I’m sure there is many, many steps involved in the rollout of that relationship. And a couple I wanted to ask you about was how many of those 2,300 Home Depot stores does PPG actually have a distribution center available in the vicinity to fulfill orders? And then maybe another one would be how many of those stores have your reps already started to reach out to contractors that are buying materials in The Home Depot, but not paint, as identified by those respective pro desks at those respective Home Depots?
Michael McGarry: Okay. Stephen, I’m going to just tell you the 60% referred to, we’ve only been able to stock 60% of their 2,300 stores, and I’ll let Tim add additional color to it.
Tim Knavish: Yes, Stephen. Look, the program is – while it’s in 60% of the stores will continue to ramp up as we move throughout the next several months as supply situation improves and we continue to build inventory. We’ve got our full pro trade workforce engaged across what’s now an omni-channel between our own network and the THD network. And we’re beginning to see customer conversions already. That will continue to grow as we learn, as The Home Depot associates learn and as the supply continues to build, and we will pivot as necessary. But we expect this to continue to grow throughout the year through a combination of load-in and conversion of contractors. And then we expect this to be a long-term, multiyear growth initiative for both us and The Home Depot in the Pro category.
Vince Morales: And Steve, again, just more broadly, and we talked about this on our January earnings call. We think this relationship and this extended partnership really gives us a considerably higher market access. And again, we’re really targeting availability for the professional painter on a daily basis. And as Tim mentioned, that omni-channel approach that can come to our stores, they can go to our dealers or they can go to Home Depot, and that’s all within a close proximity of their job site.
Michael McGarry: And Stephen, this is Michael. The last thing I would add is, look, at the beginning of the day, every time we go into a new market with Home Depot, we get substantial new wins right out the gate. And what that does is it builds excitement among The Home Depot team and their confidence level grows because what they do is they start creating these winning stories across each of the different markets. And that’s the most exciting thing about it.
Operator: Thank you for the question, Stephen. Your next question is from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Vincent, please proceed.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you very much. Michael, I’d be curious to get your updated thoughts on sort of the home improvement market just given since our last call there is been a big move in interest rates and housing market seems tight still. So how do you – do you think the rising interest rates matters at all in terms of architectural paint demand and renovation? Or how should we be thinking about the evolving housing market?
Michael McGarry: Okay, Vincent, I’ll let Tim comment on this.
Tim Knavish: Yes. Look, there is – right now, there is such a strong backlog, particularly on the residential side. There is so many walls to be painted yet, but certainly not any near-term concern for ours. And even, obviously, rising interest rates, there is going to be some mortgage and affordability impact there, but there is such a shortage of overall housing in multiunit housing. Multiunit housing continues to climb despite the interest rate rises. Residential permits continue to climb here in the U.S. despite the interest rate rises. So absolutely, it’s something that we’re watching. But we’re certainly bullish on that for at least the rest of this year, and we will see beyond that.
Michael McGarry: And Vincent, this is Michael. The one thing I would add to that is that we do a Pro Painter survey, and that Pro Painter survey continues to show a very strong backlog of our professional painters. So we’re very concerned about affordability more than interest rates. But at the end of the day, our Pro Painters still show pretty good backlog. 
Tim Knavish: Yes, in fact, our last Pro Painter survey which we just wrapped up, 75% of the painters had a backlog that was at least as big or higher than what they had 90 days and a year ago, so certainly no impact on the short to medium term.
Operator: Thank you, Vincent. Your next question is with Josh Spector of UBS. Josh, please proceed.
Josh Spector: Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. A lot of investors are focused on your comment last call about EPS in 2023 perhaps greater than $9 per share. You didn’t necessarily reiterate that today. Just curious, based on what you’re seeing from a price cost dynamic but also a demand environment, is that something that’s still achievable? And is that achievable in a scenario that you lay out where China lockdown impact perhaps stay over the next couple of quarters, but Europe perhaps enters into a minor recession.
Michael McGarry: Yes. Josh, I would tell you that the dynamics for $9 remain valid, right? So we’re going to have an improving refinish market. That’s a great business for us. Miles driven, we’re actually almost back to 2019 levels in the U.S. We see miles driven improvement in Europe as well. So from that dynamic, refinishes in solid shape. You see the numbers for aerospace. TSA bookings are all up. Aerospaces continue to get stronger. You probably noticed yesterday, Boeing said they were going to start rebuilding or building 787s again. That’s a positive. There is a strong backlog of planes. Our share with Airbus has continued to grow. So I think that’s excellent. We are only producing probably about 80 million cars this year. And so when you think about what the run rate of car should be, we’re still very bullish that car builds in the U.S. have been muted because of lack of chips, lack of parts. And so this is going to get better. So overall, I would tell you that we’re in good shape. Our synergies are going to be continuing to come in, productivity is continuing to improve. So I feel very good, I feel very comfortable around $9. And the price raws, we’re going to be past that in the second quarter. We’re going to be pricing past all of it. And then we’re going to be catching up on the early 2021 kind of inflation. So we’re on the right track.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is from Michael Sison of Wells Fargo. Michael, please proceed.
Michael Sison: Hi, guys. Nice start to the year. Historically, third quarter tends to sort of seasonally decline from 2Q, but it sounds like the pricing rise is going to get better as you noted. So is this year going to be a little bit different where you should continue to see EPS improvement? I understand it’s kind of tough to guide beyond one quarter, but kind of given so the potential for improving volumes and your sort of pricing mechanism, is that something that likely happens this year versus historical patterns?
Vince Morales: Yes, Mike, this is Vince. Probably one of the most important metrics we’re watching is sequential margin improvement. And I think from Q4 to Q1, you saw our margins move up 200 to 300 basis points, depending on the segment. We think that’s the true indicator of how well we’re doing, how well the industry is doing. It’s really hard year-over-year at this point to compare. So again, we’re looking sequentially. And again, we’re very proud with our performance Q4 to Q1. We do expect – again, there is a lot of noise in 2021. There’ll be additional noise this year. So we do expect, as you’ve heard Michael in the opening, some improvement in demand, as we go through the year, especially as China comes back. We are seeing refinish, aerospace, etcetera. But it’s really going to be hard to compare versus historical patterns. And again, we’re just looking sequentially. Our margin’s getting better Q4 to Q1, Q1 to Q2 versus historical patterns, and that’s really our marker.
Operator: The next question is with Frank Mitsch of Fermium Research. Frank, please proceed with.
Frank Mitsch: Yes. Good morning. I need to give props to John on Slide 5. It tells a very helpful story as to what you’re facing. Obviously, a lot of questions already on price. Michael, I was just curious what the absolute number you’re expecting in 2Q would be versus that 10% in 1Q. And then noted in the comments that your Tikkurila sales were up low teens, excluding Russia. I’m curious how much of that was volume?
Michael McGarry: Yes. So Frank, first of all, we try to give you a guide on that second quarter. So if you take John’s little dotted line on that chart, you’re going to dot a line up to around 12%. So that’s probably a pretty good number. We certainly are internally pushing the team for more than that, but I think that’s a realistic outcome. I think the Tikkurila volume was in that low single-digits if I remember correctly. But the beauty about what we’re seeing with the Tikkurila team is that we’re teaching them how to price. And that is something that they historically have not done a lot of. And so this has been a wonderful thing for us. And we – as we have talked about before, we think Tikkurila can look just like what Comex is. So, we get more growth in the local markets and we get better value for what we are selling and that leads to an ever-improving return on our investment that we invested in buying Tikkurila.
Vince Morales: Since we brought Tikkurila, one of the other businesses that performed really well in Q1 was our Traffic Solutions business, the prior Ennis-Flint acquisition. We saw around 25% organic growth year-over-year in that business and with a seasonally light quarter. But again, we still ended that – ended the quarter with a very strong backlog and now we are going into a very strong quarter.
Tim Knavish: Yes. Hey Frank, it’s Tim. Just to add one more thing on that other large acquisition for us. Vince mentioned 25% top line growth, all-time record quarter for that business. And much like what Michael described with Tikkurila, the prior Ennis-Flint business pricing discipline was very different than what we – how we executed PPG. And we also achieved double-digit price increase in that business for Q1. So really, really pleased with both of the large acquisitions and how they perform for us.
Operator: Thank you, Frank. The next question is from Arun Viswanathan of RBC. Arun, please proceed.
Arun Viswanathan: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to, again, drill into some of the drivers of maybe Q3 and Q4, understanding that your visibility is relatively dynamic. But when you think about the raw material inflation that you saw in Q1 and Q2 or seeing now, are your current price increases sufficient to carry you into Q3, or will you be raising prices even more? And if you do have to raise prices even more, could you also comment on the availability of raws and if that has improved greatly from last year? Thanks.
Vince Morales: Yes, Arun, this is Vince. Honestly, our visibilities in terms of all the dynamics that play into inflation is probably 60 days to 90 days. So, going out to Q3 or Q4 is difficult. And what we could tell you is we are seeing better supply in Europe, certainly. Better supply in the U.S. China is obviously, we are going through a transitory period due to the restrictions. But we do expect supply to normalize for the balance of the year. And as we said many times, we do feel there is enough structural supplier capacity to easily satisfy global coatings demand. So, we have a lot of other noise going on right now. But at some point, we will normalize across supply/demand based on historical patterns, just too hard to predict Q3, Q4 right now. We do have enough – we do have good pricing going in, as Michael said, in Q2, which is enough to compensate for the sequential increase in raw materials. If we see more raw materials in the back half of the year, we will put in that real-time pricing engine again.
Operator: Thank you, Arun. Next question is with Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Jeff, please proceed.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. It seems that your packaging coatings business has slowed down. When we look at beverage can demand globally, it seems pretty strong. What’s the dynamic that’s going on there? And in auto refinish, what were the volumes in the quarter year-over-year?
Michael McGarry: Yes. First of all, let me touch on the packaging. Look, we have picked up new share at, I would say, 70% of the new beverage can plants. So, we are in very good shape from that going forward. Second, when you look at the packaging numbers, you have to remember we had phenomenal comps last year, and that will make it more difficult. But our packaging overall growth this year is going to be quite good. So, I feel very good about our position in our packaging coatings business. I would also tell you that when I think about that business, it’s not just the volume, it’s also the price that we are realizing as well.
John Bruno: Jeff, this is John. I will just comment on refinish. If you look at the U.S. and Europe, on a year-over-year basis, volumes were up about mid-single digit, and that’s off of a tough comp from last first quarter. It was a good quarter, especially in the U.S. Asia was off a little bit, mainly driven by when we talked about the Winter Olympics slowed activity down and there was obviously some restrictions in March.
Operator: Thank you, Jeff. Your next question is from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Kevin, please proceed.
Kevin McCarthy: Good morning everyone. Two questions on manufacturing variance and CapEx. First, on the manufacturing side, back in January, I think you talked about a $0.20 EPS drag in the fourth quarter. And I would like to know if that number declined in the first quarter, and if so, how much? And what your crystal ball might say for the second quarter? And then on the CapEx side, if I read the numbers right, it looked like your first quarter spend was $194 million versus $80 million last year. And just was wondering if there is anything unusual in that in terms of cadence or any change in your annual range of $475 million to $525 million for CapEx this year?
Michael McGarry: Yes. So, we will take the easy one first, CapEx. We had CapEx spending in December that we don’t pay for until January. So, the January number was probably a little bit inflated, but our overall spend for the year is not going to change. And we are still looking at that 3%, $500 million kind of range. So, we feel good about that. As you know, some – a little bit of that is catch-up from the under-spending in ‘20 and a little bit of early 2021. So, from a manufacturing standpoint, we had about $0.20 in Q4. We probably had about half of that in Q1. And the problem is it’s not that we are having challenges making things, it’s we are having challenges scheduling things because of raw materials predictability, what comes in. And if you are missing one item, you can’t make the paint. So, that’s a bigger issue. And of course, some of it is also energy at the plant. So, as you can imagine, going into Q1, we had a certain natural gas number for Europe. And we are well in excess of that once the war broke out. So, I would tell you, overall, the manufacturing is getting better. And I would say for Q2, you should anticipate another 50% improvement in that number.
Operator: Thank you, Kevin. Next question PJ Juvekar of Citi. PJ, please proceed.
PJ Juvekar: Yes. Good morning. Michael, I know you have been back integrating into resin capacity in the past. Just kind of how did that help you during this crazy period of energy inflation and all that? And then second question for Vince. Vince, you mentioned sequential margin improvement. But given your sort of first quarter that you reported, the second quarter guidance, first half is going to be down year-over-year. If you continue to improve margins sequentially, do you think you can grow earnings this year? Thank you.
Michael McGarry: Okay. So PJ, I will take the emulsions question. We, as part of our Traffic Solutions or Ennis-Flint acquisition, it came with a small resin plant. So, we are making more emulsions there. We think we can increase the size of that facility. So, the team is working to do that as well. So, not only we are going to use the asset, it was running five days a week, one shift, now it’s running 24 hours a day, seven days a week. And we are going to improve the size of that. So, we are able to get Ba and some of these other raw materials that go into making the emulsion. So, the availability is better there. And so we feel comfortable that we are going to continue to improve the utilization of that facility.
Vince Morales: Yes. And PJ, on the margins, I am glad you brought that issue back up, because I do feel it’s really the measurement stick because of all the noise last year. Our first quarter last year was very strong, benefited by – the first quarter of 2021 benefited by some pandemic recovery. And then as we got through the balance of the year, our second half of ‘21 was very, very weak. We are not going to give full year guidance on the call here today. But again, the trajectory of margins sequentially for each of these quarters, I think is the true marker for our industry. We do expect, again, from some of the reasons Michael mentioned, abating supply shortages, improvement in our manufacturing and catch-up on pricing, we do expect our margins to improve sequentially versus historical patterns for the foreseeable future.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question, Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Laurence, please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. Good morning. This is Kevin Asberg on for Laurence Alexander. I just had a quick question about the credit market. So, I guess given the moves and also the Fed’s tightening cycle, I guess I was wondering if there has been any shift in how you think about financial leverage and I guess how much you plan or expect that you could flex your balance sheet going forward?
Vince Morales: Yes. We are – our financial – our long-term financial discipline hasn’t changed. We are kind of in the mid-2s in terms of debt to EBITDA. We do have – we do expect to pay down some debt this year. If we see anything strategically, we want to execute on, we will act accordingly. But we are not going to shift our strategies. Again, if you look at our interest rate and blended interest rate, it’s the best-in-class of our space or close to the best-in-class, so again, no change in our strategy or outlook in the near term.
Operator: Thank you. Next question, Mike Harrison of Seaport Research Partners. Mike, please go ahead.
Mike Harrison: Hi. Good morning. A couple of questions on the auto OEM business. First of all, you have been dealing with some operational inefficiencies there. Has that improved either in terms of customer behavior or your ability to manage what’s going on in that space? And then maybe an update on electric vehicle application wins with some of your innovative offerings. Have you seen some wins come through? And are you concerned at all about battery shortages impacting EV growth this year?
Michael McGarry: Okay. Let’s start with manufacturing. I would say the– the auto guys have gotten better at knowing what chips are coming in and when they are coming in. So, they are much better. They are having much less scheduled or unscheduled downtime, it should be phrased. So, our manufacturing has gotten better because their predictability of running has gotten better. And the one question nobody asked, so I am going to throw the answer out there and make sure you know it is our automotive team has priced higher than company average. So, I feel really good about that, where we are in that space. And then from an EV standpoint, we don’t see battery shortages this year. It’s certainly a longer term trend that we are going to be paying close attention to. But right now, when I think about where we are winning in that space, our protective coatings that go into the battery has been a huge win for us. We just picked up two world-class customers this quarter. Dielectric powders, is another area that we are winning in. And so I feel very comfortable about that. So, one of the top five guys, we are also running a long-term cathode binder study with, that’s more like a 3-year to 5-year program, but the fact that they came to us to do that is really a good sign about how they see us playing in this space long term. So, I am very comfortable with the pace that EVs are growing and our ability to service that market.
Vince Morales: And Mike, I just want to – I am glad you brought the question up again because I do want to talk a little bit more broadly about auto build. Michael mentioned, targets from third-party consultants this year is around 80 million builds. Again, we think the market, on a run rate basis, is typically over 90. So, there is at least, let’s call it, 10% to 12%, 15% catch-up that will occur in the next, you pick the number of quarters or months, 12 months to 18 months. On top of that, we think there is a fleet rebuild that has to occur for things like car rental fleets. We peg that as another 3% to 4% of the market. On top of that, there is an inventory replenishment cycle for – in the U.S., for example, dealer lots, so, a very long runway. They are certainly getting better chip availability and more consistency. And there is more chips to come in the back half of the year and early 2023. So, very instrumental in our recovery, and we feel very strong about the underlying demand that supports that.
Operator: Thanks Mike. Next question is from Jaideep Pandya of On Field Research. Jaideep, please go ahead.
Jaideep Pandya: Thanks. The first question really is around your protective and marine business. Appreciate you guys are bigger in China these days, but how do you see your backlogs evolving now that oil prices are high, gas prices are high and also some of the marine end markets are doing extremely well in terms of cash generation? So, do you think that next 2 years we should see a material improvement in this area? And then the second question really is around auto – the auto business of yours. Appreciate, Vince, what you just said. But like if we go by the theory that there is cannibalization where EVs are eating into the ICEs, just want to understand your fixed cost structure. So, in the sense, in the next 5 years, if we have 90 million cars, but 25 million or 20 million of them are EVs, can you actually reduce your fixed costs in your traditional ICE-based auto OEMs? And on the other hand, obviously, win in EVs? And then are you looking at any bolt-on acquisitions, for instance in EV-related coatings for batteries, or do you have already exposure there? Thanks a lot.
Michael McGarry: Okay. Jaideep, we will start with the new builds. Our marine business is up substantially and it’s going to continue to grow. New builds are up 20% year-over-year, and it’s up strongest in China, which is where we are strongest. So, this is a good market for us. The oil and gas assets that are going to be built because of the Russia war on Ukraine are also going to increase. So, that’s really good for us. LNG tankers are really good for us. This is an area where pool fires lead to a product that we sell that are best-in-class. So, I have high hopes for our teams, our Protective/Marine business over time that is continuing to do well. When you talk about the auto business, fixed costs, we actually paint EV cars just like you paint an internal combustion cars. So, we are going to still have all that business and fortunately you sell additional paint for the battery box. So, actually, your fixed – your cost structure improves as the volume goes through. So, the transition from internal combustion engines to batteries is actually a good trend for us. And we are leading in the space in this area. So, we are doing – I would say, we are doing better than our typical market share on internal combustion engines. Now, will we look at acquisitions in that space, we are always looking for things that add shareholder value. So, I would tell you that we are always interested. It is a highly competitive space right now. There is a number of people playing in it, whether it’s the protective coatings, whether it’s films, whether it’s powders, whether it’s thermal gap fillers, there is a variety of different applications on how you win in that space, but we feel very good about this.
Operator: Thank you, Jaideep. There are no further questions waiting at this time. So, I would like to hand the call back over to John Bruno.
John Bruno: Thank you, Sam. Before we wrap up the call today, I wanted to let everyone know that Mary Anne Bendzsuk will be retiring in the second quarter and this will be her last quarterly earnings call. I think a lot of people on the call had dealt with Mary Anne and she has been a valued team member here at PPG for many years and provided excellent support to the investment community, supporting Investor Relations for more than 20 years. We want to thank Mary Anne and wish her and her family all the best in retirement. That concludes today’s call. If anybody has any other questions, please give us a call. Thank you very much.
Operator: That concludes the PPG Q1 2022 earnings call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-01-21 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is Rocco, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. And as a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, today's conference call is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to John Bruno. Please go ahead, sir.
John Bruno: Thank you, Rocco, and good morning, everyone. Once again, this is John Bruno. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG, and welcome you to our fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results conference call. Joining me on the call from PPG are Michael McGarry, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vince Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our comments relate to the financial information released after U.S. markets closed on Thursday, January 20, 2022. We have posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on the Investor Center of our website, ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call, and provide additional support to the brief opening comments that Michael will make shortly. Following management's perspective on the company's results for the quarter, we will move to a Q&A session. Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company's current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on our website reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC. Now let me introduce PPG Chairman and CEO, Michael McGarry.
Michael McGarry: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. I would like to welcome everyone to our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. I hope you and your loved ones are remaining safe and healthy. I will provide some comments to supplement the detailed financial results we released last evening. For the fourth quarter, we achieved record net sales of about $4.2 billion and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.26. To quickly summarize the quarter, we had favorable sales versus our forecast, but incurred significant manufacturing challenges due to COVID-related staffing shortages, intermittent customer order patterns and raw material supply challenges. Our adjusted earnings were aided by a lower-than-expected tax rate in the fourth quarter as we recognize more favorable discrete items. Excluding the favorable impact from the tax rate, our adjusted EPS was about 10% below the financial guidance we provided in October. Our sales performance in the fourth quarter was solid as we achieved higher than sales in our guidance, primarily due to better-than-expected automotive OEM global production, higher selling price realization and strong above-market sales volume in several of our end-use markets. Overall, demand remains robust. Our PPG-Comex business delivered yet again another excellent quarter and finished with 10% organic sales growth for the full year of 2021. This business had record sales and earnings growth for 2021, and continue to expand its concessionary network, and in January, we will have 5,000 concessionaire locations in our network, and we recently added our Traffic Solutions products to its portfolio. The protective and marine business continued its trend of strong top line results, this time led by improvements in the marine coatings, where industry builds are expected to grow for the next several years. We also continue to grow our share in automotive refinish where our full suite of Advantage products and services differentiate PPG from our competition. And in automotive OEM, we were awarded new 2022 business based upon our expanded mobility product offering. And finally, we realized higher increased selling prices globally. Lastly, the recently acquired Tikkurila business delivered record sales and earnings for any fourth quarter despite the difficult operating environment. As I mentioned, overall sales would have been better, but we experienced continuing supply chain disruptions and a significant increase in COVID cases that hampered our ability to fully and consistently operate and prevented us from fully meeting our strong customer order books. Recently, some of our manufacturing facilities have had up to 40% of their workforce out. In several businesses, we continue to face certain raw material shortages with the biggest impacts in U.S. architectural coatings and traffic solutions. Overall, our sales backlog grew, and in total, was about $150 million exiting the quarter, most notably in our aerospace and automotive refinish and general industrial businesses. Our segment earnings did not meet our expectations. While we benefited from higher sales and increased selling prices, it was not sufficient to offset significant inflation, supply disruptions and operational inefficiencies caused by the rapid increase in COVID cases within our employee base, and those that our customers and suppliers. Raw material cost inflation was up approximately 30% compared to prior year, and transportation costs spiked due to shortages of available trucks and drivers. In addition, operating costs were progressively higher during the quarter due to manufacturing interruptions at both our facilities and our customers' operations stemming from COVID. These increased operating costs impacted the quarter by $0.20 per share and COVID-related absenteeism has continued in January. Once we see some normalization, we are confident that we will quickly be able to return our legacy of strong manufacturing performance. We've been taking actions to further diversify our supplier base and increase our internal resin manufacturing capability. PPG has in-house large-scale resin manufacturing in each major region, and we are expanding our capability in 2022 to mitigate future risks. As one example, PPG-Comex sources a high percentage of its residents internally, which has resulted in minimal disruptions. In addition to the historically high level of commodity raw material prices, we're also experiencing rising costs in other areas such as labor and utilities. We expect to continue to proactively work with our customers to implement additional selling price increases in the first quarter. In aggregate, our selling price realization in the fourth quarter was about 8%, with a higher price realization in our industrial reporting segment. Our price capture remains broad, with good traction in all businesses and all regions, and the pace of price -- excuse me, the pace of price capture is much faster than the pace of prior inflationary cycles. Reflecting back to 2021, we achieved all-time record sales of $16.8 billion, led by strategic acquisitions and strong organic growth of 10% despite the various ongoing supply chain challenges we incurred. In addition, we delivered record EPS growth of more than 10% even with raw material cost inflation of about 20% for the full year, the highest level of coatings industry inflation in recent memory. We once again lowered our SG&A as a percentage of sales decreasing by about 200 basis points, aided by delivering $135 million in restructuring savings in 2021. We also advanced our digital capabilities in many businesses, most notably the Architectural Coatings business or sales transaction on a digital platform increased by 20% compared to 2020 as we see our customers' digital patterns become more ingrained. In 2021, we had strong accretive cash deployment, including the funding of our acquisitions, share repurchases made in the fourth quarter and increase in our quarterly dividend for the 50th consecutive year. We're among a small number of companies that have achieved this milestone, along with even fewer companies paying a dividend for more than 120 consecutive years. Our working capital as a percent of sales remain at historically low levels and comparable to last year, even though we purchased more raw material than typical in the fourth quarter. Finally, we have lowered our net debt by about $350 million since funding Tikkurila in June and exited 2021 with a strong balance sheet and optionality for future accretive cash deployment. Throughout 2021, we took actions to bolster our ESG program. As an example, in the fourth quarter, we further strengthened our overall ESG corporate governance structure. We define accountability and oversight for all major elements of our ESG efforts under respective Board committees. We have also redefined and renamed our Technology and Environmental Committee to the Sustainability and Innovation Committee, with a key focus on tracking our sustainability progress and defining climate-related risks and opportunities. A slide reflecting the changes is included in our presentation materials. Looking ahead, demand continues to be robust in most of our end-use markets. Tightened supply and COVID-related disruptions evidenced in the fourth quarter are expected to continue into the first quarter of 2022, impacting our ability to manufacture and deliver product. We expect economic activity to be soft in China during the first quarter as more severe operating restrictions have recently been imposed due to COVID and during the Winter Olympics. We anticipate more favorable economic conditions in the second quarter. We plan to implement further selling price increases in all our businesses as raw materials and other cost inflation remain at elevated levels and are increasing further in certain areas. We will continue to aggressively manage all aspects of our cost structure and are managing to minimize the cost impacts of the current supply challenge. The first quarter EPS guidance that we provided has a wider range than normal. As is typical, the month of March will be the largest component to our quarterly sales. Our current visibility to the second half of the quarter is limited due to uncertainties around the supply chain disruptions and the various impacts of Omicron globally. While the current environment remains difficult to predict, I expect that as 2020 progresses, we will start to experience more economic reopenings and an easing of supply chain problems, general inventory rebuilding across many end-use markets and a healthy consumer willing to spend. I remain very optimistic about future earnings capability of our company and see many catalysts to return to prior peak operating margins with opportunities to exceed them.  This includes: First, continued recovery in the automotive refinish, OEM and aerospace coatings businesses, which collectively account for about 40% of our pre-pandemic sales and where we have broad global businesses supported by Advantage technologies. The volume for these businesses remain about 15% below pre-pandemic levels and we are already experiencing improving order flow that is being crimped by supply availability. Second, normalization of commodity raw material costs, which should moderate over time as supply dislocations improve. Third, higher operating leverage on sales volumes supported by our lower cost structure. Fourth, year-over-year earnings growth in 2022 and 2023 due to further synergy capture from our recent acquisitions, including a 15% increase to our original synergy target. And finally, above market organic growth driven by our Advantage and leading brands, technology and services. An example of the key organic growth opportunity is the recent announcement on our expanded relationship with The Home Depot and HD Supply with the launch of Pro Paint Assortment at all U.S. locations. This initiative strongly supports our asset-light strategy by adding more than 2,000 distribution locations. Together with The Home Depot, we are positioned to outgrow the Pro market in the U.S. Considering all of these catalysts, I believe we have a path to at least $9 of EPS in 2023. In closing, I want to express my thanks and appreciation to our more than 50,000 employees around the world for their dedication to serving our customers and supporting the many communities where we operate. Every day, their hard work and commitment to delivering on our company's purpose to protect and beautify the world are reasons why we are well positioned today and in the future. Thank you for your continued confidence at PPG. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now Rocco, would you please open the line for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And today's first question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning. Michael, just on the Q1 guidance, can you parse out a little bit more of the details around the U.S. manufacturing disruptions and what's happening in China and how it's impacting the Q1 earnings guidance?
Michael McGarry: Well, I think, David, right now, we're not seeing a whole lot of difference between what we experienced in the fourth quarter. So we had about $0.20 of manufacturing negative deviation. If you think about October, November, we have had in December and January, 4x the amount of people out with Omicron. And that includes not just people who are sick with Omicron, but also people that we have to quarantine because they had a close exposure. And what we're really worried about is if Omicron gets to China. So if you think about China who have a zero COVID policy, and our largest plant in PPG is in Tianjin, and just recently, they had a small outbreak there. And in two days, they tested 14 million people. So if Omicron were to get to China and they continue with their zero COVID policy, that could have a pretty disruptive effect. So we're being very careful in how we look at this. And right now, I just -- I think Omicron has peaked in the U.S., but it hasn't started to come down yet.
Vincent Morales: Yes, David, and if you think about our Q1 guide in addition to the production concerns, or limitations we've had, we do know that China will be limited somewhat due to the Olympics. We are also experiencing significant logistics issues in the U.S. and in other parts of the world. We expect those logistics issues to continue into Q1, especially in March when the overall economy starts to improve seasonally. And for us, the month of March is our biggest month by far in the first quarter as is traditional. And we have more muted visibility on March than we typically would, given the issues we've seen over the past six to eight weeks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Robert Koort: Thank you very much. Good morning. Michael, the guide you gave in the first quarter seems to suggest maybe the raw material inflation aspect is starting to hit a crest, obviously, availability and production issues, compounding problems. Do you see any stability in those raws? Have you seen any come down? Are the ones that caused you such trouble in the past the same ones as availability improved? Can you give us any inspiration outside of Omicron that maybe the inflation bubble is hitting a ceiling?
Michael McGarry: Yes, actually, Bob, I think our guide for the first quarter looks at two factors. One, raw materials have leveled off. Obviously, we're watching the recent pop in oil up the mid- to high 80s. So that could have an impact on solvents. But right now, we've modeled 20% to 25% raw material inflation. For the first quarter, we were also modeling that our price is going to be at the same level as raw material inflation. So I think that's going to be a good number for us. We are seeing logistics. And I think I misspoke, I think it's 25% to 30% for Q1. But anyway, so price will equal raw material inflation in Q1. And obviously, we're watching logistics costs, but we are feeling pretty good. We're projecting price to be up between 9% and 10%.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Chris Parkinson with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Chris Parkinson: Thank you. Good morning. Michael, it seems the goalposts keep on moving on both the costs and the procurement front. But it really appears that it's really the raw material shortages, freight, as you highlighted, electricity rates and varying capacities depending on geography and to, I guess, to a slightly lesser extent, labor. I know you've already have been talking about it getting and achieving price, but can you quickly comment on those other cost variables at 1Q? You just hit on a little bit. How we should be thinking about those heading through the balance of the first half of 2022? So it’s the short-term question. The second thing is just are there any other strategic actions that you and your team can take to potentially alleviate these challenges in the future? Thank you very much.
Michael McGarry: Well, what I would tell you is freight is the single biggest challenge we have right now, truck drivers not showing up. So you don't get the contract price that you have negotiated, then you end up having to buy spot loads. That's one. We are seeing labor inflation. That's another one. I would tell you that we anticipate warehousing inflation, although we always try to do those as a long-term contract, but any of that roll off this year we'll be looking for an increase in that space. Overall, I would tell you, though, those have all been anticipated. So there's nothing that we haven't anticipated in regards to that inflation. Our team is well-versed that we're not looking to get just raw material inflation, but raw material and total inflation from our customers, and we've been very explicit in those discussions with our customers as well. So I think that would be the first part. I don't know, Vince, if there's anything you want to add.
Vincent Morales: Yes, Chris, just to stratify the total cost pools here. Again, raw materials remain significant, they're 60%, 70% of our cost of goods sold. If you look at labor, it's a mid-single-digit percent of our sales, a little higher. Obviously, in architectural given the stores and the feet on the street, a little lower in some of our OEM businesses and logistics costs is probably mid- to high single digits as a percent of sales. Again, the distribution businesses, like architecture, we finish a little higher, the OEM business is a little lower. So these labor and logistics costs, while they're building up, and we're covering them with price. They're much smaller cost components for the company.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please go ahead.
Ghansham Panjabi: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Just high level, given all the disruptions of the customer side and the incremental impact from Omicron, will first half '22, the way you see it at this point, be more pressured than the back half of last year? Or do you think there'll be easing on the bottlenecks as the first half unfolds? I guess I'm asking because you have massive labor issues at the homebuilder level, rolling shutdowns in auto OEM and various degrees of logistical constraints? How should we think about that?
Michael McGarry: Ghansham, I think the single biggest thing about Omicron, let me just give you an example about how difficult it is to be a plant manager. The toughest job in PPG right now is a plant manager. They wake up in the morning, check their phone to see how many people call off sick, then they get to work. They go through the dock area to see how many trucks didn't get picked up, and then they go to the receiving area and then find out what didn't come in that was supposed to. And then they move it into the plant and the supply chain people are telling me that they're going to have to make smaller batches because of lack of raw materials. And then the sales team is telling them, oh, my God, we - if we don't get paint out the door, here's how many customers we're going to impact. So by the time they get to their desk, before they even have a morning meeting, they've of issues. But the contrary to that is when I think about your first quarter to second quarter question. What do I see improving? I see automotive OEM definitely improving. The chip shortage is going to continue to get marginally better. They're getting better at handling it. So that is going to get better. Refinish, clearly, this winter that we're having right now is a positive. And so refinish is going to get better first quarter to second quarter. At some point, China is going to approve the 737 MAX. And when they fully approved that, that is going to be a positive for our aerospace business because Boeing we anticipate will increase build rates. Also, we are seeing, and you've heard the CEOs of the airlines talk about how people are already booking post Omicron. So we expect the MRO of our aerospace business to continue to improve first quarter to second quarter. Our packaging business, we kind of continue to see a strong push for sustainability. There are a number of new packaging plants that will be opening up in 2022. And so to transition from plastic to metal packaging, away from single-use plastic is continuing, and that is going to be a positive. So that -- those are the positives that I see coming up now. Clearly, the marine new builds in China are going to be significant, but we don't anticipate that to be a first quarter to second quarter event. I think that's more of a back half of the year.
Operator: Next question today comes from John Roberts with UBS.
John Roberts: Michael, I think Comex, when you bought it, had 80% of their own resin in plastic pail production. You're obviously a lot lower in the other regions. What's the right level of pack integration for PPG?
Michael McGarry: Well, I would tell you that, that's not a precise answer because you have to balance the capital that you put in to build additional resin capacity into the cost of buying it. And so for us, we're actually getting more capacity in Mexico, we're adding a little bit more capacity in the U.S. We don't see the need to do that in Europe because the supply availability is pretty good in Europe. And from Asia, it is certainly not a priority for us. So it is a balance. So I would tell you that we'll be higher and internally source resins in '22 and '23 than we are today.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Michael Sison with Wells Fargo.
Michael Sison: Michael, just curious if you could help us sort of bridge the gap to the $9. I suspect a good portion of that will be closing that pricing raw material gap. But any help and sort of how much of the walk gets us there on that, and then volume, cost savings and such?
Vincent Morales: Yes, Mike, this is Vince. I'll start and Michael can add some color. The biggest issue that we've talked about for the last couple of quarters is just a return of normalcy on some of our biggest businesses, auto OEM, refinish, aerospace. Michael gave you some color a few minutes ago around how we see that just from 1Q, 2Q, but those businesses are down 10% to 15% or more in the case of aerospace versus 2019 levels. We do see strong demand patterns in those businesses. And to get to the $9, we need those businesses to get closer to 2019. One of the other benefits we expect is we had negative price raw exposure all of 2021. As Michael said, we're cresting on raws, prices are getting close to raws or exceeding them, depending on the business. So we expect some year-over-year recovery there. And then if you look over the past couple of years, Mike, we've taken about $250 million of structural cost out via restructuring. We've taken out about another $100 million to $125 million of overhead cost out. So as volume returns, we expect a higher incremental margin than we've had historically. So those are 3 of the bigger pillars that will get us to the $9. And again, a return of normalcy is the biggest one of those.
Michael McGarry: And Mike, I would just add that when you think about the volume, you can use external sources like or in bus and then you could think about how a bigger return in our impacted businesses will be a positive for us. And finally, productivity. Productivity is one item that we're very good at, and this obviously wasn't there in the 2021 time period.
Vince Morales: And Michael, I'll add 1 more, our synergies that we've taken up in this quarter. We're now targeting $150 million in total. So that will also provide some assistance in getting to that $9.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from John McNulty with BMO.
John McNulty: Michael, maybe you can help us to think about the big Home Depot win that you had. Can you help us to maybe scale opportunity there? Also maybe give us a little bit of color in terms of how big the initial fill is and how much incremental help you might get from that.
Michael McGarry: So John, the way I would think about it is, first of all, we had a very extensive test. So we started out in Tampa, Denver, Albany. So we had about 80-plus or in that market. That went exceptionally well. And then we expanded that to Indie, New Orleans and Detroit. We added about another 80 stores. So that's let's call it, 160 stores. And they were very pleased. We were able to share internal data between the companies about who comes into Home Depot, who buys a number of paint sundry items, but do not buy paint. We were also able to pinpoint who comes in the store and buys what type of paint if they optimize their purchase, they'd be able to do a better job in productivity. And as a result of that, we are able to target not winning in Home Depot, but winning externally. And that is the #1 thing that Home Depot and PPG want to do is win externally. And so this is going to be a significant win for us. We will be outpacing the Pro growth for many years to come with the support of Home Depot. So we've basically taken our 800 stores, they're 2,000-plus stores and formed a network, and this will allow them to significantly grow their share in the Pro Paint market.
Vincent Morales: And if I could add, this is Vince. A couple of things for us strategically. This is consistent with our heavy distribution model in an asset-light format using existing brick-and-mortar. This is also consistent with our digital strategy, where we're able to use digital platforms for both us and our big customers. And probably one of the more exciting things that Michael alluded to as we compared CRMs or customer data, we do know that painters of all size build into The Home Depot. As Michael alluded to, they're not always buying paint today, but painters of all size, all Pro Paints of all sizes are going into Home Depot for something. So this will, we hope, alleviate their need to visit 2 different or 3 different retail outlets to get their full needs.
Michael McGarry: Which will drive productivity for the Pro Painter. That's what this is all about. So they can spend more time painting and less time driving the stores.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Stephen Byrne at Bank of America Securities.
Stephen Byrne: Yes, I'd like to continue this discussion on this Home Depot relationship. Some of these really large paint contractors benefit from free delivery to the job site and 5-gallon containers, features that you may provide from your stores but Home Depot doesn't. Is that going to change? And if so, will that service be provided from your stores or will Home Depot provide that? Does it depend on whose digital app is involved in this?
Michael McGarry: Yes. Actually, we will have 5s in the store. So if you go into a Home Depot right now, you'll see PPG 5-gallon containers already in the store. We will be coordinating with Home Depot on delivery as appropriate. And we also have service level agreements with our own stores to provide a fast turnaround to our people that are ordering digitally. And of course, Home Depot already has this on their digital apps as well. So this will continue to be a new dynamic in how paint is delivered to our major Pro Painters.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Laurence Favre with BNP Exane.
Laurent Favre: Michael, in the slides, you highlighted 2 businesses where Q1 is expected to be better than Q4, was OEM and architectural EMEA. You've talked quite a bit about auto OEM. Could you say a little bit more about the architectural EMEA line?
Michael McGarry: Sure, Laurent. And so what you are starting to see in Europe is the continued growth in Pro Painter in Europe. And it's DIY is kind of normalized, but Pro is picking up. And even though there have been a small amount of lockdowns in Europe, that has not really impacted the order pattern so far in the European market. Plus we have the growth that we are expecting to see in Tikkurila. So we have a pretty good line of sight to their -- what they call their preselling season, and that has worked out pretty well. And so we're expecting to have a pretty good first quarter, second quarter in European architectural.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research.
Frank Mitsch: Good morning, gentlemen, and let me give a quick shout out to Mr. Knavish. Congrats, if you're listening. Michael, you outlined why the last couple of quarters we've seen margin compression. And in the release, you mentioned that you see a path to returning to prior peak operating margins and also exceeding them. I was wondering if you could offer a kind of a glide path or a time line that you see the margin improvement over the next couple of years?
Michael McGarry: Well, I think what you should think about, Frank, is that every quarter from this point out, we should start to see improvement in the margins. So we're anticipating raw materials are flattening out right now. Our price increases will continue. So we've had 19 quarters in a row of positive price. So we'll be stacking 2021 out there as well. And so that's going to be the start of it. We'll be getting the manufacturing behind us. Those issues will be behind us as well. So that will be a positive. And then we have a number of productivity programs, capital that we want to put into the business to drive more productivity, so you take less -- need less labor to get paint out the door. So that will also be a positive. So we've talked about being over $9. I don't know why we wouldn't be there in 2023.
Vincent Morales: But I think, Frank, just -- again, the challenges we faced over the past 3 or 4 quarters, we've been playing significant catch-up on pricing. Again, that's -- we think we're normalizing there to closer to parity this quarter. In successive quarters, we hope to get some recapture. So that headwind should turn into at least a neutral, if not a catch-up tailwind. The manufacturing, again, we expect to normalize at some point, we hope in late Q1, early Q2. But the real driver for us is that volume. And again, we're down significantly. We're down probably 6 -- 5%, 6% versus 2019 still with several of our big businesses, as I alluded to earlier, and those are going to come back at nice incrementals. And then as John Bruno mentioned, we'll have the synergy capture latter part of this year heading into next year. So these will be stacked sequentially in that manner.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Kevin McCarthy at Vertical Research Partners.
Kevin McCarthy: Michael, just a follow-up on pricing, you're making some good progress there. I think you mentioned 9% to 10% as an outlook for the first quarter on pricing. So 2 parts: Where are you most happy with the realizations and where do you think you might have more work to do? And then as we think about that 9% to 10% level for the first quarter, how do you think that might trend as 2022 progresses? Would you expect that level to be sustained, move higher or regress in a scenario where the raw pressure might cool off?
Vincent Morales: Kevin, this is Vince. Let me start. The 9% to 10% in the Q1, if you look at it on a 2-year stack, it's closer to 11% to 12%. So I think when we talk about pricing from here going forward, we're going to have to look at it on a 2-year stack because we did get pricing traction early in 2021. So we'll be lapping that as we go throughout the year. So again, that 2-year stack is probably a better marker on a go-forward basis. And that, again, 11% to 12% is what we're expecting on a 2-year stack beginning in Q1. And I'll let Michael talk about the different businesses.
Michael McGarry: Yes. I would say, Kevin, the businesses are probably pretty much what you would expect, right? So we've been working proactively in our refinish business, and we're able to consistently get price and refinish. PMC, we've done a really good job in PMC except in in China. China has been a challenge for us with people chasing volume. So that would be the 1 area I'd say we need to do a better job in. And then when you think about architectural, we've consistently done a good job on that around the world. I have no concerns in that regard. I would tell you that we've gotten traction in automotive OEM. And so automotive OEM was very close to the company average in the fourth quarter, and they expect to be at the company average in the second quarter. So that's been an improvement. I would say on the packaging side, we need to do a little bit better. We have more inflation in packaging because it has higher epoxy component. And I've been pleased with the industrial side. But the around the world way of thinking about this is China has always been the most challenging on the automotive OEM side. We have a number of competitors that are still chasing volume instead of pushing price. So we see that, and so we're conscious of what's going on over there.
Vincent Morales: Yes, if I could just add on some of the auto businesses. For us, our mission is to ensure we're getting good value for our products. If we don't see value, we're going to shed some of the customer businesses. We know some of the competition, especially in China is not doing that. Our marker is to remain a good, solid, profitable automotive business.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.
Vincent Andrews: A couple of things on your acquisitions. One, the businesses you've already brought into the fold, how are you doing there in terms of getting the price cost relationship to the company level? And then just on capital allocation, I think the last time or last quarter, it seems like M&A was less likely this year versus last year just given maybe where the bid-ask spread was, but any update there as well, please?
Michael McGarry: Okay. Let's do these by the acquisitions. So we'll start with the little one. So VersaFlex well ahead, been exceptionally pleased with that team. The 2 in Germany, Cetelon and Wörwag, unfortunately, the prior management before our time had made commitments for 2021. So the good news is 2021 is buying this. 2022 price increases will be significant and is already in place. So I'm pleased with where we are starting, not pleased, obviously, that we had to wait a number of months to make that happen. Traffic solutions, that's the old Ennis-Flint. They've done a really good job on that. They've really have changed the way the industry things about getting value for paint. And I think that has really helped out a lot. And then finally, Tikkurila, we're doing very well there as well. I've been pleased with the team. And we had a good pricing realization in the fourth quarter, and we're starting out Q1 in good shape as well. So net-net, slow on a couple of businesses due to prior management commitments. But overall, for 2022, I feel very good about it.
Vincent Morales: Yes, and then just on cash deployment. First of all, we're still reviewing what I would call an active acquisition pipeline. That remains if it's available and at the proper price priority for us. We'll continue to vet those and use the remainder as a flywheel. We'll certainly look to mop up dilution this year as we've tried to do in prior years, at least on a cumulative basis. We have some debt to service, so we'll do that as well. But right now, we have a strong balance sheet, and we'll use that for shareholder accretion as we go throughout the year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from season with Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets.
Arun Viswanathan: Just curious, I guess, on refinish, have you guys seen a noticeable drop off in the last couple of months because of Omicron? And similarly for aerospace, has that happened as well? And if so, I guess, could you offer any thoughts on when would that reverse, I guess?
Michael McGarry: No. Actually, Arun, on both those businesses, we have substantial backlogs. We finished the year in refinish, especially in Europe and the U.S. with substantial backlogs. Inventories are low. Winter has been helpful to us, especially here in the U.S., so we're anticipating a good start to our refinish business in 2022. And we finished with a very substantial backlog in aerospace. The challenge in aerospace has been the airlines have been ordering MROs, especially transparencies and coatings. And coatings were able to mostly keep up, but on transparencies, we're having a challenge of hiring enough people. It takes a lot longer to train people to build transparencies. And so I would tell you that pretty substantial backlog, and that's only going to get bigger in the first half of the year, and we anticipate both of those businesses doing better in 2022 than they did in 2021.
Vincent Morales: Arun, this is Vince again. If you think about one of the things Michael alluded to in the opening comments, the inventory channels in almost every one of our end markets is very depleted. The most visible economically is in the automotive business, where dealer lots are void of cars. We know Refinish is an extremely light in terms of inventory, not only to complete the current mix of cars that are in need of repair, but also to replenish with a very low distribution inventory level. Michael talked about aerospace MRO, a very light inventory that needs to be replenished with safety stock. The architectural businesses, no matter where you are in the world, the inventory ad market is very light. And so in general industrial markets, some of those have very low safety stock, if any at all. So we're very comfortable if we could make product, we could sell product. And we do feel, hopefully, some of the supply chain issues will resolve in the back half of Q1, early Q2 and allow us to begin shipping we certainly need to get the labor availability back. But inventory replenishment is a big story for 2022.
Michael McGarry: Yes. The other thing I would tell you, Arun, that maybe people don't recognize it with used car price is so high, people are repainting cars that get an accident that might have previously been totaled. And so we're seeing a number of used cars get painted. And historically, where that might have been what I'd call a value paint, a lot of people are now coming in and demanding premium paint. So the refinish business is in really good shape.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays.
Duffy Fischer: A question around the foregone volumes. So your volumes were negative 4%. I think everybody would argue if you didn't have -- or the industry didn't have issues, that number would have been positive. So maybe there was 5%, 6%, 7% foregone volume. But my question is, what's the mix in that volume? Were you able to push those stars resources into higher-margin products or maybe that foregone volume carries a lower margin? Or maybe just help us understand the margin that, that volume would have carried versus the corporate average and how the mix is different in that than what you're actually selling?
Michael McGarry: Duffy, the first thing is I'd probably take a little bit of an exception to that minus 4 going to a plus. I don't think that's likely, I think, a minus 4 would have probably been minus 1 or at best because there's a number of other issues going on in the market right now. To the extent that we can get raw materials, we are shipping product. And from that standpoint, most of our businesses have had challenged getting product out the door. We have significant demand out there. And I don't think it would have been any different mix, to be honest. Clearly, if we'd have been able to get more transparencies and more refinish out the door, that would have been a better mix for us. But I'm not sure that we have really substantially diluted ourselves or accreted ourselves by what we shipped in the fourth quarter.
Vincent Morales: Duffy, I'll add here, the minus 4 is versus a very strong comp in the prior year. We saw in the fourth quarter of 2020, the partial recovery from COVID in our automotive businesses and our industrial businesses. So we had very strong performance in Q4 of 2020 that we were comping against in 2021. If you compare to 2019, we're still down more than 4%. And again, it's in the heavy technology last businesses refinish OEM aerospace that typically would favor that you're referring to.
Operator: And the next question today comes from Prashant Juvekar with Citi.
Prashant Juvekar: A couple of questions, Michael. Emerging markets seem to have slowed down. It seems like Chinese industrial activity is down, but that could be due to dual control and Olympics. Latin America seems to be down as well, maybe because of COVID. Can you just parse out and tell us what you think is happening underlying in emerging markets? And then secondly, you were talking about OEM just recently, just now. I was not sure why your OEM sales were down, or underperformed the industry. Because I think you have good EV exposure, so that should have helped you.
Michael McGarry: Yes, we'll start with the OEM. I would tell you that we were slightly below because when you look at some of our business in China, we decided that we wanted price, and we were willing to walk away. And that business will come back to us. So I'm not worried at all about that. We are definitely gaining share in the mobility section. In fact, we started up a brand-new battery fire protection plant in China, and that's 100% for batteries, and that is going exceptionally well. And we will be doing similar expansions in Europe to support the European growth as well. So I feel very confident about that, but we are committed to getting price up in OEM. And if that means that some of the smaller customers move their business elsewhere, that's fine. From an emerging market standpoint, let's talk about this in several different factors, okay. China is right now a little bit soft, but they're not growing as fast as they used to grow. They're still growing, right? And we're expecting global production in China to be up 4%, 5% in 2022.  Second, I would tell you that India is doing exceptionally well. We're expecting them to be up 8% or 9% this year. And actually, when you look at our Eastern European business in the past 6 months, it was up high single-digits. So we're pretty pleased with that as well. And what I'm most excited about long-term, it won't be a major win in 2022. But with our Tikkurila acquisition, we are now the largest coatings company in Russia. And our architectural business is substantially bigger than the #2 guy, and I think this is going to be an opportunity for us to grow share in Russia through Advantage products. And that's going to be a win for us long-term in Russia.
Vincent Morales: And Michael mentioned earlier, P.J., Mexico, for us, we have big businesses there, obviously, in architectural, which has done exceptionally well once again. The automotive and industrial businesses we have there were somewhat tempered by the lower automotive builds on a year-over-year basis. We do expect those to return as the chip shortages alleviate as we pass through the year here.
Operator: The next question today from Mike Harrison with Seaport Research Partners.
Michael Harrison: I had a question on the auto OEM business. You noted that production was a little bit better than you were anticipating coming into the quarter, but that it was intermittent. Can you help explain why this intermittent production led to operational challenges and higher operating costs for PPG?
Michael McGarry: Sure, Mike. I mean the issue that you have is the suppliers don't have great visibility on when they do or don't get chips. So they provide us an order schedule. And in the old days, a 90-day advance order schedule would give us, let's call it, 85% to 90% confidence. And then at 30 days, it was 100% confidence. Well, nowadays, even at a week out, we only have 80% confidence. And so we're having to make smaller batches, and we're having a shipped get in from a chip standpoint, what we might have to make, and those lead to inefficiencies in our operations. But what I would tell you, looking forward, the industry produced about 75 million cars this year. And we're looking at that being closer to 82 million to 84 million cars next year. So this is still down from its peak, and that is a substantial opportunity for us long term because at the peak, it was 95 million cars. So there is still more runway in the automotive OEM space.
Vincent Morales: Yes, and at the peak, the 95 million cars Michael mentioned doesn't include the fact that we have to replenish the dealer lots. We think that's up to 2 million to 3 million vehicles in 2022 alone if they can make them as well as the rental car fleets in the U.S. are fairly depleted and those needs replenished. And then in Europe, there's a lot of company-owned cars that have been not replenished over the past couple of years. So in addition to the normal demand, the normal consumption from consumers, there's other elements in the automotive market that we believe will allow us to remain an elevated production capability, willing elevated production for multiple years.
Michael McGarry: And Mike, I assume you've also put in the OEM model the growth in the mobility space. So when we do get back at higher levels, there will be more content per vehicle for PPG.
Operator: And our next question today is from Edlain Rodriguez with Jefferies.
Edlain Rodriguez: Michael, again, apologies if you already addressed that. In terms of capital allocation, you have more than $1 billion left on the current share buyback program. What should we be taking in terms of pace and timing? Is this a 2022 event, or will it take longer?
Vincent Morales: Yes, Edlain, this is Vince. We did this just a few questions ago, we'll answer that again. We're going to look at acquisitions, primarily still active pipeline, likely smaller transactions in the past 12 to 15 months. And we'll mop up dilution for sure, this year at a minimum. And we'll do some debt servicing, and then we'll continue to assess as we go through the year where to deploy any excess cash.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to the management team for any final remarks.
John Bruno: Great, thank you, Rocco. We'd like to thank everyone for your time and interest in PPG. This concludes our fourth quarter earnings call. Have a good day.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Today's conference has now concluded. And you may all disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-21 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is Jason, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PPG Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to John Bruno. You may begin your conference.
John Bruno: Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG and welcome you to our third quarter 2021 financial results conference call. Joining me on the call from PPG are Michael McGarry, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vince Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our comments relate to the financial information released after US equity markets closed on Wednesday, October 21, 2021. We have posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on the Investor Center of our website, ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide additional support to the brief opening comments Michael will make shortly. Following management’s perspective on the company’s results for the quarter, we will move to a Q&A session. Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements, reflecting the company’s current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG’s operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risk, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG’s filings with the SEC. Now, let me introduce PPG Chairman and CEO, Michael McGarry.
Michael McGarry: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. I would like to welcome you to our third quarter 2021 earnings call. I will provide some comments to supplement the detailed financial results we released last evening. For the third quarter, we achieved record net sales of nearly $4.4 billion and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.69. As we communicated in early September, our sales and adjusted EPS were significantly impacted by worsening supply chain disruptions and increasing raw material cost inflation. Our raw material costs in the quarter inflated by about 25% year-over-year. For context, this is about three times higher than any previous coatings raw material inflation peak in recent history. We're also experiencing elevated logistics costs and are incurring increased manufacturing costs due to the sporadic nature of these outages. Commercially, we have taken significant mitigation efforts due to the high level inflation through rapid implementation of structural selling price increases. In aggregate, our selling price realization is about 6%, with more than 6% price realization in our Industrial reporting segment. Our price capture pace is much faster than previous inflationary cycles and we have further pricing initiatives underway. Coming into the quarter, we expect that the supply chain and customer production disruptions would impact our sales by about $150 million. However, this actual impact was more than $350 million. Additionally, this prevented us from completely fulfilling our strong order books and further depleted retail inventory in many of our end-use markets. We expect much of this demand will be deferred into 2022. And in particular, these current conditions will elongate the global automotive OEM recovery. To put the automotive OEM situation in perspective, U.S. dealer inventories had a record historic lows in the mid-20-day range. And in 2021, global production in this industry is expected to be about 20% below prior peak levels. Despite the current challenges, several of our businesses, including our automotive refinish, protective and marine, and packaging coatings delivered strong above-market performance, driven by our strong service capabilities and advantaged technology. Our PPG Comex business achieved record third quarter sales with year-over-year organic sales growth of more than 10%. In addition, our U.S. architectural coatings business delivered about 10% same-store sales growth as we continue to expand our customer base with many new wins and increase our digital sales as a percentage of our total sales base. More generally, we continue to experience improving trade painter demand globally and architectural DIY coatings sales returned closer to 2019 levels after notable growth last year was driven by the state home impacts. We remain focused on cost management, which is evidenced by our SG&A as a percent of sales being 100 basis points lower than the third quarter 2020. This is being supported by our ongoing execution on our structural cost savings programs as we delivered an incremental $35 million of savings in the third quarter. We continue to target and on track for our full year 2021 savings of about $135 million. In the quarter, we also continued to make good progress integrating our five recent acquisitions contributing to our overall earnings for the quarter. Our two larger acquisitions, Tikkurila and Ennis-Flint delivered good top line results, despite the challenging supply constraints. We continue to expect them to deliver an aggregate of $25 million of synergies for the full year of 2021. We once again delivered strong operating cash flow during the quarter and had about $1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents at the quarter-end, including sequential reduction of our net debt by about $400 million. This was supported by our continuing strong working capital management as we maintain our positive step change improvement achieved last year and are at multiyear lows on a percentage of sales basis. While we will continue to evaluate accretive deals in our M&A pipeline, we are initiating stock repurchases in the fourth quarter, and we'll continue to focus on debt reduction. As a reminder, based on the seasonality of our businesses, the fourth quarter is typically our strongest cash generation quarter of the year. Also during the quarter, in support of further enhancing our ESG program, we were happy to announce an agreement with Constellation Energy to power our Carrollton, Texas manufacturing facility with 100% renewable solar energy. We are also working on our very first ever diversity report and developing science-based climate targets, both of which we will communicate in 2022. Equally important is PPG's market-leading sustainable products continue to enable our customers to meet their respective sustainability goals. We will continue to provide updates on these initiatives on subsequent quarters. In addition, I'm extremely pleased to announce that yesterday, PPG earned three R&D 100 awards for 2021. The R&D World Magazine honors the 100 most innovative technologies and services over the past year with the R&D 100 awards. Even more importantly, two of the three innovations that we were recognized are growth initiatives in electric vehicles, including BFP SC battery fire protection coating, which protects the vehicle occupants from fire and mitigate thermal runaway events plus Envirocron Extreme Protection thermally conductive dielectric powder for battery packs, providing dielectric protection and thermal conductivity. Our dielectric powder has already been commercialized by a leading EV maker and our battery fire protection product will launch in 2022 by one of the world's largest car makers. Moving to our outlook, we are continuing to evidence solid demand in aggregate. Many of our customers continue to indicate that their order books are at high levels and have lower than normal inventory levels. In the near-term, we anticipate only modest improvements to the supply disruptions that we've been experiencing. Our estimate is that our sales are expected to be unfavorably impacted by about $250 million to $300 million in the fourth quarter, both for the semiconductor chip shortage issue and chronic supplier operational capabilities. Recent production curtailments in China may add incremental pressures to availability and inflation, and we expect our inflation to approach 30% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. As a result, all our businesses are securing additional selling price increases, and now we expect to fully offset raw material cost inflation in the early part of 2022. We continue to strongly believe there is sufficient capacity available in our supply chain as operating conditions continue to normalize. Absent any further disruption, we expect supply chains to operate more normally by year's end, supported by normal seasonality trends. To provide further assistance and assurance a more consistent supply going forward, we are rapidly qualifying additional regional and global commodity suppliers across a variety of our key raw material procurement groupings. We expect these increases in product availability, coupled with continued improvement in the existing supply chain, will provide ample supply beginning early in 2022. While the current environment remains difficult to predict, I remain very optimistic about our specific growth catalyst for 2022. Specifically, we expect continued recovery in automotive refinish, OEM and aerospace coatings, which collectively account for about 40% of our pre-pandemic sales where we have broad global businesses supported by Advantage Technologies. We expect a measurable rebuild of inventories in many of our end-use markets. Specific to PPG is year-over-year earnings growth in 2022 due to further synergy capture from our recent acquisitions. In closing, these continue to be dynamic times, but thanks to our more than 50,000 employees around the world, we are well positioned today and in the future. Their dedication and commitment to make it happen are reasons why our customers, our communities and our many stakeholders who can count on us and protect and beautify the world. Thank you for your continued confidence in PPG. This concludes our prepared remarks. Now Jason, would you please open the line for questions?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Parkinson from Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Chris Parkinson: Great. Thank you very much. Michael, obviously, there's been a lot going on in the industry, but in terms of raw material inflation as well as input shortages. If we start there, particularly on the shortages aspect of it, can you just offer your general views as we approach 2022? What's changed in the past 12 months, what offers confidence? And then also, are there any differences of how these variables are affecting results at the segment level? So anything would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
Michael McGarry: Well, Chris, I would say, starting with the segment levels, the most impacted, of course, are architectural, our traffic solutions business, our automotive OEM and, quite surprisingly, our Industrial Coatings, because there are a lot more chips than people realize in some of these things like appliances and other electronic materials, heavy-duty equipment, things like that. So those were the businesses most impacted. What I see though is, obviously, it's in our suppliers' best interest to continue to sort out their supply chains. And seasonally weak fourth quarter should give them adequate time to do that. Now the flip side is we have an extremely large backlog of demand right now. So anything that they can make in the fourth quarter, we're going to ship. So we feel very good about that. As you know, we've been a little bit more pessimistic and probably right about the supply chain issues. And so, we have put in, like we said on the call, an expectation of further challenges in the fourth quarter.
Chris Parkinson: That's very helpful. And just kind of staying on the topic, it seems demand is fairly strong and kind of building into 2022 and the supply chain disruptions, obviously, are creating a lot of noise in the second half. When you take a step back, look at your own order books, your own customers' outlook, can you just quickly touch on just how you're thinking about 2022 and maybe even perhaps on the one job within the 2023 in terms of the volume recovery aspects for auto, refinish and aero? And then also perhaps touch on the sustainability of momentum in both general industrial and packaging. Thank you very much.
Michael McGarry: Okay. Well, that's a mouthful. Let's start with auto OEM. Clearly, if you look at the inventory in the U.S., we're down about 1.5 million cars from where typical is. Inventories in China are less than one month as well. They're probably in the 25-day range. So that's 15 days less than they typically have. Europe has not been able to supplement what they need. And when you think about fleets, not just rental fleets, but fleets in general, they're short as well. So there's significant OEM demand out there. I would also tell you, from the refinish side, we can always tell when the lockdown's in, in every country, because driving comes up and collisions come up and demand comes up. And there's very little inventory in the chain from that standpoint. And so, we see that also being a strong positive. And then, I guess, finally, I would tell you from aerospace, we see strong order books on the small plane. So A320s and 737 builds are going to come up. Once you start to see some international travel, then I expect Airbus and Boeing will get back to building the bigger planes. MRO is improving monthly. And now that Europe is getting a little bit more open, we expect MRO to improve even better. So our catalyst for 2022 are strong. And if you then start building 787s on top of that, then our catalysts for 2023 get even better.
Operator: The next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi from Baird. Please go ahead.
Ghansham Panjabi: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I guess sort of stepping back, China was first in, first out from COVID, also led the global economic recovery over the past year. Subsequently, the macro headlines and some of the recent data out of China are confirming quite a bit of a slowdown. So, first off, what are you seeing in the region on a real-time basis occurred? Second, how do you see China evolving over the next couple of quarters? And I guess, just more broadly, Michael, how are you thinking about the current inflation cycle impacting your expected recovery over the next couple of years given that consumers will ultimately have to bear all these massive cost increases? Thank you.
Michael McGarry: Well, Ghansham, let's start with China first. So, maybe I think you're aware of this, but maybe some of the other folks on the call aren't. Our plants typically in China are running two shifts today, most of them, not all them run three. And so the dual control issue that's happening in China where they're trying to reduce the amount of energy consumed as well as the energy per unit. We're in a very good position to be able to run off hours and consume the cheaper energy off hours. So, that helps us from that standpoint. Industrial demand is down in China right now, but it's as much from lack of raw materials as it is from demand. As you know, we're not very big, in fact, I would say, almost negligible in the project market for architectural. So, the challenges in that market are really not going to hurt us from that standpoint.  But our Kitchen and Industrial Bakeware business, our Electronic Materials business, our Automotive business are all in good shape over there. Our Packaging business, double-digit kind of demand. So, I feel good about China, both short-term and long-term and I think we have the team that can help us manage through the challenges that are over there. When I think about the higher prices today, I start first with, let's say, oil is $80. Well, $80 historically is not a high number. It would be a -- what I would say is, if you say $70 has been the average, it's only marginally higher. So, from a structural cost perspective, I think our consumers are going to be able to continue to have strong demand. So, I'm not worried about that.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Roberts from UBS. Please go ahead.
John Roberts: Thank you. Because the price increases are so large and happening so quickly, we're getting a bigger divergence than normal between the year-over-year price changes reported by the different companies. Maybe comment a little bit on where the differences are, maybe between you and some of your key peers by region or application or is it just timing differences, Michael, it's resulting in these different prices?
Michael McGarry: Yes. John, let me just start with the basic way it works. We report peer price and we reported for our -- all our businesses. And so when you look at the business mix, that's one thing to take into account. The other thing is the mix by geography. So, if you have a large percentage in a geography that has hyperinflation, and that's going to impact you. But more importantly for us, we are on our 18th quarter in a row of price increases. So, we're stacking increases on top of increases. So, one way you might think about this is whether or not somebody might be trying to catch up to where we are and I think that's probably the most important thing. And the other thing I would say is make sure you look at inflation reported as well as margins. And for us, the ultimate end goal is margins. And I think our procurement team is doing a great job. We have hired people to help us qualify additional raw materials from that standpoint. And so we're in a pretty good shape, I think, from a competition wise.
Operator: The next question comes from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Bob Koort: Thanks Michael. I’m curious, you mentioned that the supply chain issues could moderate as you go through the quarter, but obviously, still some elevation in run rate on the cost side. So are you starting to see some force majeures lessened, or what is it that you're seeing that gives you some hope that maybe it improves through the quarters, is there some tangible anecdotes you're already seeing?
Michael McGarry: Well, Bob, the way I would answer that question is, in Q1, we had 95 force majeures. That was all early, right? And then we only had two in quarter two. And then we have 13 new ones added in the quarter three due to all the IDA issues. And there's been only one added in the fourth quarter. So the pace of force majeures has improved. And at these commodity levels, I know our suppliers and I've talked to a number of them are focused on smoothing out the supply chain. And what I would tell you is they know we can sell, they know we're going to continue to consolidate the industry; they know we're going to win. And so they've been out there protecting PPG as much as they can within the limits of the force majeures. So I see these force majeures starting to decline in the fourth quarter. And so I think we're going to be in a much, much better place starting early 2022.
Vince Morales: And Bob, Mike this is Vince. Michael mentioned in the opening comments. Seasonally, we see a significant downturn in demand for commodity raw materials. So this will allow them to do some catch-up in terms of maintenance, in terms of rebuilding inventory. So we do feel that has a tangible benefit as well entering 2022.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Sison from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Michael Sison: Hey guys. When I add up the revenue impact on supply disruptions, it looks like it's nearing $1 billion, and so just curious, how do you think you'll get that back over time? And how long do you think it will take to get the raw materials in place to do that and curious how confident you are about Halloween?
Michael McGarry: Was that a Cleveland Browns reference? Is that what you're…
Vince Morales: Mike, it's Vince. I think your math is accurate. Two big components here one, as Michael mentioned, the semiconductor chip really impacting our automotive and to a lesser degree our industrial business. We expect that continue to rectify over the next couple of quarters. So really, we would hope in the back half of -- improvement now through the first half of and then more normalcy in the back half of 2022. The other side of the equation is the supplier -- commodity supplier force majeures that Michael just alluded to. We're expecting that to largely rectify in the beginning part of 2022. We will be able to supply our customers and more importantly, rebuild inventories which is a piece of the equation that's missing here. So that -- those shortages we're seeing in 2021, we'll go back into our customer inventories throughout the year of 2022. So we're confident the demand is there and the runability issues and supply constraints around chips should be resolved in the coming quarters.
Michael McGarry: And I guess, Mike, I'd finished by saying that it won't surprise us to see you in a black and gold jersey once again after Halloween.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Byrne from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Stephen Byrne: Yes. Thank you. So about a decade ago, you had a string of four or five quarters with mid-single-digit price increases. And here you just put up a 6% or you have some -- quite a different situation here than you did a decade ago and I just would like to hear your view on whether something of that same trend might be repeatable with a string of mid-single-digit price increases? Or could they potentially be higher than that given the raws you're talking about going from a 25% year-over-year hit 30% in this quarter. And you're talking about being able to offset it in early 2022. Does that seem like a reasonable assumption on our end that those price increases are going to get pushed even higher?
Michael McGarry: Stephen, we tried to convey that in the slides that we published last night. We're expecting to have a higher increase in the fourth quarter than we did in the third quarter. And I would say that is essentially already in place. So, it's just a matter of what it rounds to, but it's going to be higher than the 6% that we posted in 3Q. And in the first quarter, there will be additional price increases as well. So the magnitude of the increases are historic, but so is the amount of inflation. Our teams feel very good about this. Our customers are well aware of what's going on. They also need product. They're also facing logistics challenges. They're also facing raw material challenges, and they buy a number of the things that we buy, maybe not to the level that we do, but they understand it. And so I feel very confident that we're going to continue to put up historical price increase numbers that will help us when raw materials moderate. This will be a significant catalyst for continued earnings growth going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from John McNulty from BMO. Please go ahead.
John McNulty: Taking my question. Maybe just another one on the price versus raws dynamics. So you're looking to kind of catch up in early 2022. Is that all on the premise of pricing, or do you expect some raw material relief as you start to get into the first quarter or so of 2022? And I guess somewhat related to that, you've got about $500 million worth of sales tied to M&A in the third quarter. I guess sometimes it takes a little bit of time to get the pricing wheel of an acquired asset working. So I guess, can you speak to the pricing that you're seeing in the businesses that you acquired and if there's maybe a catch-up phase of that as we look to 2022? Thanks a lot.
Vince Morales: Yes. John, I'll take the first part of the question, I'll let Michael handle the second part on acquisitions. We're in a position now where we believe the inflation levels are crusting. We have 30% targeted inflation in Q4, the supply constraints, as we alluded to earlier, we think, are going to abate somewhat. And so again, our goal is to get pricing up to offset this high level of inflation. And some of this will moderate, and we are starting to see some signs of moderation. But again, given the tightness of the supply chain right now, it's not coming through in absolute percentages, but we are starting to see, in certain raw materials, some abating. For us, though, I think what's most important is we've gone after structural price increases. The vast majority of the pricing that Michael alluded to, the in Q3. Almost all of that is structural in nature. So we're changing unit pricing as opposed to surcharges. We think that's proper to do that will -- so those structural price increases will remain as we head into 2022 and throughout the duration of 2022.
Vince Morales: And John, with regard to the acquisitions, Ennis-Flint. The highest they'd ever achieved price prior to our acquisition was 2%. And they did not have, what I would call, a structured program to analyze what was going on and a structured program to get price increases out in a real-time basis. We have significantly improved that, and we have a PPG legacy leader running that business now, and we are really excited about what that future holds. Myself and Tim Knavish were in Europe, like within days when Tikkurila closed. That was the first thing on the agenda, was pricing. We were much further ahead in the price increase. We've already done our second price increase in architectural Europe prior to us acquiring Tikkurila. They were on their first increase. They are now catching up. They have put in place new processes that will allow them to better process not just raw material inflation, but also the value creation that we bring to the market with our new technology. And I feel very comfortable that we're on top of that, and we are in a good position, not only with the increases we've announced for the fourth quarter with the legacy Tikkurila products, but also the first quarter increases that are to come.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Kevin McCarthy: Good morning. Given all of the dislocations in the external environment that we've been discussing, it struck me that your fourth quarter EPS range was quite narrow at plus or minus $0.03. And so in that context, I was wondering if you could talk about material upside or downside risks if it turns out that you did materially better or worse when we see the results in January. What do you think the potential drivers of those variances could be, based on what you see today?
Vince Morales: Hey, Kevin, this is Vince. We're typically announcing earnings a week or so earlier, but due to the way the calendar fell this year, we're 20 days, three weeks into the quarter. October is a very large month for most coatings companies in the fourth quarter just due to seasonality. We've got a good read on October. We've got a good read on the next couple of weeks, at least, of demand and our ability to supply. So just given the size of the first month plus as it waits on the quarter, we have some level of confidence. That being said, things that could push it up or down, again, as Michael alluded to earlier, everything we can make today we could sell. So, if we do get more raw materials, we are able to manufacture more, that would be a positive for the fourth quarter. As you alluded to, Kevin, there still could be some things out there that could suppress the ability to get raw materials like logistics and that would be a negative. But we think all the other variables, we have a fairly good handle on.
Operator: The next question comes from Laurent Favre from Exane BNP. Please go ahead.
Laurent Favre: Yes, good morning. I've got a question on capital allocation. Nippon just announced the Cromology deal this week. I think you just talked about resuming buybacks in Q4. So, I was wondering can you assume that the M&A pipeline is getting thin? And can you give us a sense of the overall envelope for the buyback you've got in mind for the next 12 months?
Michael McGarry: Yes, Laurent. So, first of all, I would not say the M&A pipeline has slowed down. In fact, I would tell you that, that has picked up because of the high prices that have been paid, so there's more interest out there. What we said about the buyback is, first, we think PPG is a structurally sound company. We think the current price on PPG is undervalued and so we're going to buy some shares back. So, that's the first thing. The second thing is we also generated a lot of cash in the fourth quarter. That's our strongest quarter for cash. So, we're going to pay down debt as well as buy back stock. And we're in good shape as we look at the pipeline to -- for acquisitions. So, I don't think it's any more complicated than that, so.
Operator: Next question comes from Aziza Gazieva from Fermium Research. Please go ahead. 
Aziza Gazieva: Hi guys. So, you're calling for 30% inflation in the fourth quarter. But could you put an estimate on your current read for inflation for 2022 versus 2021? Vince mentioned that some of the raws are abating, but which products are still a particular concern into 2022? Thank you.
Vince Morales: Yes. I'll handle the macro, and I'll let Michael talk about some specifics. But again, when we look at the raw material basket in aggregate, we do feel it's crusting. We'll have some year-over-year inflation in Q1 just because we didn't have last year -- or this year, excuse me. So, there'll be some year-over-year comparisons. But the absolute prices on raws, we feel, will hold as we go into 2022. Michael, can you talked some specific, please?
Michael McGarry: Yes. Aziza, I would tell you that the three items that I'm paying particular attention to are epoxies, emulsions, and isocyanates. Emulsions, in particular, have been elevated purely due to the inability of the suppliers to run their plants. It was impacted by Ida as well because a couple of raw material suppliers there were impacted down more than a month due to that. And so once they're back to normal rates, some of the stress on pricing, I think, will start to come back down and so that's one. The epoxy, especially in China, I'm anticipating that they will moderate the pricing demand as we get into the fourth quarter with seasonality, and that will provide some relief. And from an isocyanates, we did have some force majeures in that area. That will be coming off, I think, in the very near-term. So, those are the ones I'm paying attention to.
Operator: The next question is from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Arun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just a two-part question here. So first on margins. Just wondering, obviously, there's a lot of volatility, and it's going to depend on price capture versus raws. But how should we think about margin recovery next year? Is there anything special that you have as far as cost reduction buckets or anything that would be specific that you could call out? And then secondly, I was just curious on your comments on EVs and beverage cans, two areas that have been robust. Have those been impacted? I know that you called out some supply chain disruptions there, but have those been disrupted from a structural standpoint on demand, or is it just transitory? Thanks.
Vince Morales: Yes, I'll handle the margin question, and I'll let Michael do the commercial side here. If you look at -- we're projecting -- we'll give them obviously more numbers out in January on our fourth quarter earnings call. But we do have an active restructuring program. We're part of the way through that program. 2021 savings on that are in the $130 million range. We would expect additional savings in 2022, as we continue to execute against the actions that we have previously outlined for that. And again, we'll give a number on that in January. More importantly and idiosyncratic for PPG, we do have synergy capture next year, typically 12 to 15 months after an acquisition. We start to realize additional structural synergies. Again, we'll give a number out in January. But those are two elements to the margin expansion opportunities on the cost base.
Michael McGarry: And then, Arun, I'd tell you, on EVs, obviously, you saw how Tesla performed last night when they reported. And I would tell you there's virtually all of the global guys are very dead serious about improving their EV at a faster rate than what the current projections are. I don't know if you saw it yesterday, one of the largest EV producers in China, even though the government says they want 20% by 2025, this particular company said they expect it to be 35% by 2025. So the momentum in EV continues to build. From the beverages, that is going to continue to be strong. We're up double-digits in beverage, and there's -- I've actually lost count of the number of plants. I think there's either 13 or 14 new plants that are in the process of being built. And those new plants will need a lot of coatings. And we are winning our -- more than our fair share in that beverage space. So I anticipate beverage to continue to be strong as people shift away from single-use plastic into recyclable beverage containers. So I'm looking for that to be a long-term sustainable play.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. This is David Horn [ph] here for Dave. Can you talk about why you're below the IHS auto build forecast in Q4? And how much of an EPS impact is from that lower forecast? Thanks.
John Bruno: Yes, thanks. This is John Bruno. So I remind everybody, going into 2Q and 3Q, PPG has been below the IHS forecast, and I think we've come out ahead in terms of accuracy. We do see things improving. We just don't see the velocity of improvement that IHS is forecasting for the fourth quarter. We see more of a gradual recovery into 2022.
Operator: The next question comes from Kevin Hocevar from Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.
Kevin Hocevar: Hey, good morning everybody. You mentioned DIY paint demand being back to 2019 type levels. So, do you think that the underlying demand is back to 2019 for DIY paint? And do you think that the supply chain issues are what's holding that back, or -- yes, I mean, has there been -- is there just been because things were so robust to pull forward of demand? And I'm curious of your thoughts there and how you see it going forward.
Michael McGarry: Yes, Kevin, it's moving back toward 2019. It's still above it. But actually, if you go into a Home Depot, you'll see how bare the shelves are. I mean there's just not enough paint out there and that is a challenge for our partners. Certainly would like to have a lot more paint than they're getting right now. So, we're working hard to try to meet our big box customer needs. So, I actually do think that there's more upward potential there as the supply chain normalizes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Harrison from Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Mike Harrison: Hi, good morning. I was wondering if you could give us an update on the competitive environment within the auto OEM space. All of you and suppliers are hurting, the customers are hurting, do you see any share shift going on in this environment? And can you maybe talk about industry pricing discipline into that auto OEM coatings market? Thanks.
Michael McGarry: Yes. So, Mike, I would tell you that the discipline is better in Europe and the U.S. and Latin America, and it's still a little bit challenged in Asia. That doesn't surprise us. China is historically a difficult place, plus there's more than 80 car guys in Asia. So, there's all the global plus all the locals and so there's a little bit more competitive attention. But what I would tell you is, for us, any time that we might lose some share, get punished for raising price, we get it back very quickly as they roll out new programs because they have to put the finest technology out there on the newest programs to compete in that market because the hyper competitive from an appearance and performance standpoint. So, I'm not worried too much about that. We've been pushing the team to continue to raise price appropriately and that's what we're doing.
Operator: The next question comes from Steven Haynes from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Steven Haynes: Hey thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could go into a bit more detail on your pricing in the Industrial segment by end market. It seems like packaging was potentially pretty strong, maybe double-digits. So, just any additional color there would be helpful.
Michael McGarry: I'm not sure I want to get into that level of detail, Steven. What I would tell you is we've posted more than 6% in the Industrial. We had positive -- strong positive price in Automotive, Industrial as well as Packaging. And these conversations with our customers are one-on-one, and I think that's the way it should remain.
Operator: Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Duffy Fischer: Hey good morning guys. Maybe three questions, if I can sneak it in. On your one chart that you showed the acquisitions, you saw the seasonality of the revenue. Can you talk about the seasonality of the margins off that chart and what that would look like? Then on your Chart 6, where you break out kind of the 60% PPG, 40% PPG that has struggled volumetrically. What is the difference in margins between those two buckets? And the 40% that's been lower on volumes, has it been harder to get price in those businesses because of the lower volumes?
Vince Morales: Let me start just, Duffy, with the first question. The -- well, I'll start with the 60-40 question, because I think that's more relevant right now. If you look at the 60-40 question, the businesses that are down -- the 40% of the businesses that are down, let's call it, low teens in terms of volume versus 2019, these are very technology-rich businesses. They typically command the value for the technology. We've seen good pricing as evidenced by the segment pricing. Two of these businesses fall in performance. Performance pricing is up 6%. They're very big businesses. So they're going to have an impact on the segment. The automotive business is our biggest business in industrial. So it's going to have, again, an outsized impact on the aggregate pricing. So again, we're capturing pricing collectively across the portfolio, but -- and it's not differential based on the 60-40.
Michael McGarry: Yes. And I would say, Duffy, listen, the fact that they're down has not prevented us from getting price. So as you know, in Refinish, we were historically an annual price. This year, we've had more than one price increase in Refinish. So that has not prevented it. Automotive clearly has not prevented it. The automotive guys would like every Hilo of coating that we can provide, so they would definitely would like to get more. And then from the aerospace side, as you know, it's a very technology-driven business and so – and it’s a very spec-driven business and so our ability to get price on the MRO side is actually pretty good. So that has been not been impacted either. So, when I look at the catalyst for 2022, these businesses are certainly going to be a strong contributor to the increase in earnings for next year.
Vince Morales: In terms of this see seasonality from the acquisitions, we did put in the appendix of the materials we distributed last evening, the sales seasonality. You would expect and it's accurate that the earnings seasonality is even more pronounced. These are businesses that have a fixed cost base, especially architectural. So you do get more leverage -- there's more leverage on the peak sales quarters. And there's certainly less leverage on the sales quarters on either end of the peak. So definitely more pronounced earnings impact in Q1 and Q4. And we'll see the reciprocal of that, Duffy, in Q2 next year. We didn't have Tikkurila for the vast portion of Q2 2021. And in Q2 2022, we'll see that positive leverage.
Operator: The next question comes from Jaideep Pandya from On Field Investment Research. Please go ahead.
Jaideep Pandya: Thanks. I have two questions. Firstly, on growth, actually. When you think about the European business in deco and compare it to some of the other periphery businesses like the adhesives industry or construction sort of building materials, light building materials industry, and think in the context of the green wave and the renovation wave that will kick into Europe, as we speak for the next few years. Do you think that paint and sort of adhesives building materials volume growth is sort of similar in trajectory, or do you think that paint actually will slightly undergrow because of the higher penetration for a lot of these materials in the sort of increased insulation demand? That's my first question. And the second question is really around raw materials. So, if you take a step back, I guess, you guys have lost probably 15% to 20% of supply because of Ida and Uri and all the other issues across your basket this year. Fundamentally speaking, do you think your suppliers have invested enough in things like epoxy, acrylic acid to support the growth that your industry is seeing? In other words, do you think that even if supply normalizes, utilization in these products will remain high and therefore, you will always remain a bit susceptible to a storm or two? Thanks a lot.
Michael McGarry: Hey Jaideep, this is Michael. I'll take the first one, which is the suppliers. I think they're clearly hampered this year because I think in the pandemic, they did not do the required maintenance. They postponed some things, and they got caught short by the recovery. And so as a postponed maintenance are underspent, that has impacted their ability to deliver what we wanted. So, I would tell you that, that, obviously, they're all making very good money right now and they're all interested in getting their reliability up at or above where they were pre-2019. So, I anticipate this to get better. I'll let Vince cover the adhesives and sealants versus paying for Europe questions.
Vince Morales: Yes, I think when we just think about ESG, which I think was the heart of your question, typically, these products like adhesive, sealants, coatings, act as an enabler to provide better ESG capabilities, longer term, longer lasting. And the aftermarkets typically provide the same opportunities to reduce people's environmental footprint. So, the coatings industry, the adhesives industry, every time there's been a technology change, we're seeing it in EVs. We typically get more content and we typically are able to provide the functionality needed in order for them to make technology improvements to cover whatever that technology change is. In this case, it's better environmental performance.
Operator: The next question comes from Edlain Rodriguez from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Edlain Rodriguez: Thank you. Good morning guys. Just one quick question on raw materials and, again, apologies if you already addressed that. Like in terms of the raw materials availability issues you've seen this quarter, like was it mostly concentrated in the U.S. because of the hurricanes or was it broad-based in all the different regions?
Michael McGarry: Yes. So, Edlain, what I'd tell you is the worst was in the U.S., okay? So, that was obviously challenged with Hurricane Ida. The next most impacted over the quarter was Europe, because they do buy some things from the U.S. So, that has impacted, especially our architectural business over there. And then the one that got impacted last, but somewhat meaningful was the dual control issue in China that started late in September because there were a lot of government edicts, people were supposed to meet their quarterly goals, and they were not on track to meet the quarterly goals. So, starting about mid-September, there was a lot of pressure to get the dual control initiatives underway and on target. And in China, when they set targets, you can almost rest assured they're going to hit those targets. So that's the way -- there was no real material challenges in Latin America. They came out of the U.S., but we were able to manage through most of those.
Edlain Rodriguez: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Eric Petrie from Citi. Please go ahead.
Eric Petrie: Hi, good morning, guys. Been reading about potential for magnesium shortages, which goes into producing aluminum alloys for auto, aerospace, construction end markets. So are you worried there at all with China still in control and low inventory levels in Europe?
Michael McGarry: Yes. Eric, I would tell you that none of our big aerospace guys have right now put out any concerns about magnesium nor have our EV customers. So right now, that is not currently on the radar screen. We're always trying to look around the corner, but that is one that so far has not raised its head.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. Mr. John Bruno, I turn the call back over to you.
John Bruno: Thank you, Jason, and we'd like to thank everyone for joining the call today, for your time and interest in PPG. This concludes our third quarter earnings call.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-07-20 08:00:00) =====
Company Representatives: Michael McGarry - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Vince Morales - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer John Bruno - Vice President of Investor Relations
Operator: Good morning. My name is Jason, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PPG’s Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I’d now like to turn the conference over to John Bruno, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.
John Bruno: Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. Once again, this is John Bruno. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG and welcome you to our second quarter 2021 financial results conference call. Joining me on the call from PPG are Michael McGarry, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vince Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  Our comments relate to the financial information released after U.S. equity markets closed on Monday, July 19, 2021. We have posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on the investor center of our website, www.ppg.com. The slides are also available on the website for this call and provide additional support to the brief opening comments Michael will make shortly. Following management's perspective on the company's results for the quarter, we will move to a Q&A session. Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements, reflecting the company's current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements.  This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC. Now, let me introduce PPG Chairman and CEO, Michael McGarry.
Michael McGarry: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. I would like to welcome everyone to our second quarter 2021 earnings call. Most importantly, I hope you and your loved ones are remaining safe and healthy. Now let me provide some comments to supplement the detailed financial results we released last evening. For the second quarter, our net sales were a record at nearly $4.4 billion and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.94. Our adjusted EPS was significantly higher than the second quarter of 2020, partially due to last year's second quarter, including various pandemic-related impacts.  Looking back to pre-pandemic results, our adjusted EPS was similar to the second quarter 2019 despite sales volumes being 6% lower than that period, and we're dealing with historical high levels of raw material inflation in the current period. Our strong year-over-year sales reflect a partial recovery from the unfavorable pandemic effects of last year, but also includes better than market performance across many of our businesses for this quarter. We achieved these higher sales levels despite significant supply and component disruptions, including ones that reduce the overall manufacturing capability of our customers. Coming into the quarter, we expected these disruptions would have an estimated impact of $70 million to $90 million; however, the actual impact was much more severe and closer to $200 million. Our adjusted EPS in the second quarter while near all-time record levels was below our April forecast, three main factors impacted the difference. Due to supply disruptions, we experienced unprecedented levels of raw material and transportation costs that continually elevated as the quarter progressed. This drove raw material inflation to be up a mid to high teen-percentage on a year-over-year basis versus our original estimate of a high single-digit percentage increase. Our automotive OEM business was impacted most significantly from supply disruptions, as we estimate that more than 2 million less cars were built than initially expected during the quarter. This impacted our sales by about $100 million or higher than $40 million more than we expected in April.  Finally, as we expected, the supply disruptions led to shortages of certain raw materials. We had anticipated an impact of $30 million to $50 million, but the actual impact was closer to $100 million. We are highly confident that the sales related to these production disruptions will be deferred to later quarters, and this will elongate the global automotive OEM recovery. As I mentioned in April, coming into the year, we're expecting an inflationary environment and had prioritized selling price increases across all our businesses. This helped us to achieve solid price increases year-to-date and our pace of price realization is well ahead of the most recent raw material inflation cycle in 2017 and 2018. Clearly, this inflation cycle is much higher than anyone anticipated and we're continuing on a business-by-business basis, working to secure further selling price increases. This includes executing additional pricing actions during the third quarter. As a reminder, the second quarter of 2021 was our 17th consecutive quarter of higher selling prices.  We're also continuing our strong cost management evidenced by our SG&A as a percentage of sales being 130 basis points lower than the second quarter 2019. This is being supported by our ongoing execution on our structural cost savings programs, realizing an incremental $40 million of savings in the second quarter. We have increased our targeted full year 2021 savings by about 10% to $135 million. In the second quarter, we finalized three acquisitions: Tikkurila, Worwag and Cetelon. We funded the acquisitions through a combination of cash and external financing, which came in at a very attractive borrowing rate. We had yet another strong operating cash performance during the quarter, and ended the quarter with about $1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents giving us continued flexibility to do additional accretive cash deployment in the upcoming quarters. In regards to our other two recently completed acquisitions, our new traffic solutions business, which is comprised of Ennis-Flint acquisition, performed to our expectations in the quarter despite significant challenges with raw material availability and its order book is at historical highs entering the third quarter. Our VersaFlex acquisition was smaller. It’s performing well and it's already helped us win significant protective coatings project in Central America due to the advantage technologies that we acquired. Another notable accomplishment during the second quarter was the appointment of our company's first ever Vice President of Global Sustainability. PPG has been a clear ESG leader in the coatings industry through our market-leading sustainable products and we have plans to further improve our overall ESG program. We will provide updates on these initiatives in subsequent quarters. Moving to our current outlook, most important is that we are continuing to see very robust and broad-based demand globally, including in many industrial and OEM end used markets and strong architectural coatings trade activity in the U.S. Many of our customers have indicated that their order books were at high levels exiting the second quarter. We anticipate this strong global demand pattern to continue. In addition, we expect an eventual restocking of inventory to occur in many of our selling channels either later this year or in 2022.  In the near-term, we expect some of our customers will continue to be challenged with input or component shortages, so their production capabilities and schedules likely to remain choppy throughout the third quarter. PPG is also experiencing the continuation of spot outages of direct coatings raw materials. As a result, we expect some unfavorable sales impacts from both our direct supply chain disruptions and the production curtailment at some of our customers in the third quarter. Our current best estimate is our sales are expected to be unfavorably impacted by about $150 million in the third quarter due to these issues. We expect these sales will be largely deferred to subsequent quarters.  We also expect raw material costs to remain at elevated levels in the third quarter. Our current best estimate is that they will be inflated by as much as 20% compared to the third quarter of 2020 with businesses in our Industrial Coatings segment experiencing the largest increases due to the raw material mix of those types of coatings.  As a result, all of our businesses are securing additional selling price increases. Due to significant increases we experienced in the second quarter and anticipate in the third quarter, we now fully expect to offset raw material cost inflation in the fourth quarter on 2021 on a run rate basis. As I've said previously, these current disruptions are temporary and we strongly believe there is sufficient capacity available in our supply chain once operating conditions normalize. I'm very pleased that we have completed five recent acquisitions since December 2020. In our third quarter, these acquisitions will add about $500 million of incremental sales to our company. As we continue to integrate these acquisitions, we will start to realize meaningful synergies that will be a strong earnings catalyst. We are also witnessing domestic flight activity picking up all over the world. This will begin to benefit our commercial aftermarket business in aerospace in the second half of 2021. In the information we post on our website yesterday evening, we're projecting aggregate sales volumes to be up a low single digit percentage in the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter with differences by business and region. Including our acquisitions, we expect overall sales growth to be over 20% compared to the third quarter of 2020.  In addition, full year 2021 adjusted earnings, excluding amortization expense and other non-recurring items is expected be $7.40 to $7.60, which at the midpoint would be about 13% higher than the adjusted EPS we realized in 2019 despite the significant raw material inflationary pressures we're dealing with this year, and the fact that sales volumes are still not fully recovered from the pandemic when compared to 2019.  Finally, I'm very pleased that our board recently approved a dividend increase of about 10%. Our September payment, coupled with the anticipated payment of a similar quarterly dividend in December will mark 50 consecutive years of annual per share increases in the company's dividend. This is another testament of our company's legacy of consistently rewarding our shareholders and the confidence that the board and I have in our ability to continue to generate and grow our operating cash flow.  In closing, I could not be more proud of our now 50,000 employees around the world, who serve our customers, our communities and our many stakeholders. Their dedication and commitment to doing better today than yesterday, every day helps ensure that PPG continues to protect and beautify the world.  Thank you for your continued confidence in PPG. This concludes our prepared remarks and now Jason, would you please open the line for questions. 
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the Ghansham Panjabi from Baird. Please go ahead. 
Ghansham Panjabi: Hey, guys, good morning. 
Michael McGarry: Good morning. 
Ghansham Panjabi: Yeah. So I guess, Michael, what do you think is a realistic timeline for the recovery in auto OEM production, I mean, between 2Q and 3Q that looks to be about $200 million in total. is this a deferral of a couple of quarters? Or it is longer than that just based on what you see at this point? And then just also more broadly, there's been some concern in the market about slowdown in China. Can you just sort of give us a real-time pulse as to what you are seeing in the region? Thanks so much.
Michael McGarry: Well, Ghansham, first of all, I would say that the auto industry continues to have significant demand in all places around the world, except for Europe. And we do anticipate Europe recovering, but probably at a little bit slower rate because of the pace of vaccines over there.  But I would tell you overall, we're anticipating that there's going to be about a million cars less built in the third quarter than we had originally anticipated because of the chip shortage. And right now if you look at the overall pace of car builds, they're still below peak levels, but demand is recovering. So I anticipate that we're going to have a very strong back half of 2021 and a very good 2022. So from that standpoint, inventories across a lot, whether they're in the U.S. or China are still at quite low levels, and so I still remain very optimistic. From a China standpoint, specifically inventories are probably in that 40-day to 45-day range, which is below average slightly. Demand remains strong. And what's most encouraging to me is that the pace of EVs continues to pick up. And as you know, our positioning on EVs are very strong and so we anticipate continuing to be above industry build rates in content. 
Vince Morales: And Ghansham, this is Vince. Just to dovetail on Michael's comments. If you look at automotive OEM, particularly in the U.S., one other benefit we expect to occur later this year or early next year as chips become available is the rental car fleets. The rental car fleets, there is a sparse inventory in those fleets. And so we know those typically account for 10% to 15% of auto builds annually, and we know that 10% to 15% will be higher going forward until they replenish those fleets. More broadly in China, while we’re seeing a lower growth rate, we are still seeing good growth across many of our end markets. So I think the anecdotal information you referenced is accurate. The growth has come off, what was very high rates, but still solid growth rate going forward. 
Operator: The next question comes from John McNulty from BMO. Please go ahead.
John McNulty: Yeah, thanks for taking my question. With regard to the raw material catch up and where you catch up with pricing and I think you're looking for. I think you said in the fourth quarter towards the end of the year. Is that exclusively on price getting high enough to catch up? Or do you have any assumptions baked in for raw materials actually coming off from these levels? And then I guess tied to that, anything about the raw material environment right now that's making you think about possible changes to your supply chain and how you might be thinking about that going forward?
Michael McGarry: Hi John, this is Michael. First, I'd say there is no change in how we are approaching the raw material. We think this is a temporary dislocation. We've actually been very surprised at the recovery rate in this period. Typically, even if you go back and look at the most severe hurricanes, our suppliers have been able to get online and get back up to full rates pretty quickly. This time, they've been significantly challenged and it's been compounded by the lack of transportation equipment, not just equipment, but more importantly drivers. So we’ve had a number of situations where we had to go out and buy spot material and it was challenging to get trucks to be able to deliver that because of the inability of some of our suppliers. So if you ask me, if there is any change we might do, there could be some additional suppliers brought into the mix to provide us some additional flexibility, but other than that, I don't think there’d be any major changes.  But overall, I would say raw materials, the only one that we're currently forecasting to be moderating is the oil, and as you saw oil in the past week has started to decline. So solvents would parallel the oil price changes. So that’s the only one we have right now in our model.
Vince Morales: And John, your first question on our assumptions on raws in the fourth quarter, we would be assuming that from a - on a sequential basis the third quarter to fourth quarter, the raws would stay in a similar – at a similar level, that's our current assumption. 
Operator: The next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. 
David Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning. Michael or Vin, can you quantify how much worse price versus raws will be in Q3 versus Q2, and how much better do you think they'll be in Q4 versus Q3? Thank you. 
Vince Morales: Okay, David, I think – this is Vince. I think it’s similar to the question John just asked. Again, we gave guidance out, 20% raw material inflation give or take in Q3. We did include in the slide packet that was posted last night to our website. Our initial views of pricing, those views will be somewhere between 4% and 5% in terms of our price capture. That’s still well short of what we need. We typically need 40% to 50% of the inflation to recover fully. So we're still looking at additional pricing actions throughout 3Q, across all of our businesses, all of our regions.  And in 4Q, to John Bruno’s comment a minute ago, well, we expect inflation to remain high. We do expect to remove some of spot buys that we are doing currently. Those are typically coming out large premium to traditional pricing, our list pricing, and we're still looking at additional price capture or a full realization of the 3Q price capturing in 4Q. So again on a run rate basis, our target is to get fully offset in 4Q. 
Operator: The next question comes from John Roberts from UBS. Please go ahead. 
John Roberts: Thanks. The raw material and logistical comments all seem to be North American-centric. Could you give us maybe a more global view of what you're seeing in the raw material outlook in Europe and Asia?
Michael McGarry: Yeah, John, this is Michael. I would actually say that the Chinese raw material inflation was actually higher. That was driven primarily by epoxies, isocyanates. And so those were the most challenging thing in China. The rapidity or the significant increases that we saw in China have kind of leveled off at this point in time.  I would say in Europe, they're also coming up, but not quite the same rate as China. Availability in Europe is better than availability in the U.S., but still not great. Availability in China is there if you're willing to pay for it. So for spot, so we’ve been really pushing our customers hard. If they want to buy more than contract, if they need to pay extra for that additional volume. And so from that standpoint, we've been working closely with our customers on this additional raw material inflation. And I would say for Latin America, it kind of mirrors the U.S. market.
Vince Morales: And John if I could just add, we are seeing with ocean going freight, some of that has been significantly delayed. So even though if there's availability and it's a product that's being pulled at around, it's not showing up in time. So again that's exasperating some of the issues.  We expect again a lot of these logistical issues to begin to self-correct in the third quarter. Q2, we have to remind everybody Q2 is typically the peak quarter for a lot of companies, a lot of industries. Q3 things start to moderate in terms of overall global economic demand from a seasonal perspective. So again, we expect some of this to self-correct. 
John Roberts: Thank you. 
Operator: The next question comes from Stephen Byrne from Bank of America. Please go ahead. 
Stephen Byrne: Yes, thank you. I wanted to gel in a little bit about the MOONWALK rollout in Europe. You mentioned 750 installations. Can you put that into perspective? How many autobody shops are there in Europe? Is 750 just scratching the surface or is this meaningful and we expected a 20% through customers. Are you primarily targeting new accounts and share gains with this technology? Any comments on the outlook for share gains would be helpful here. 
Vince Morales: Yeah Steve, this is Vince. If you look across Europe and the U.S., there's thousands upon thousands body shops. This is a small percentage relative to the total universe. You know I think for us what's most exciting is, every one of these we can make and get to market is immediately sold. We have a back order, significant back orders in Europe. This is now – we are moving this now to the US.  We are certainly providing our existing customers who value the speed that this provides for their paint shops. We value that productivity. We are providing them with the opportunity to purchase this first, but we do have an allotment of these that are really focused on new customer wins, and I think as we roll out kind of this 80/20 strategy, we are going to continue to see customer wins around this body shop productivity which the premium shops, the MSOs prefer, that’s their business model.  So still early innings here, but we are exceptionally pleased with the traction this is getting and I will continue to update you and continue to rollout more MOONWALK devices as we go forward. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Mike Sison from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. 
Mike Sison: Hey guys, good morning. In terms of the raw material pricing gap, any thoughts between each of the segments? Are there some segments a little bit better off in terms of getting pricing and closing that gap or are there other segments that are doing, you know both might take a little bit more time to get – to close the gap. 
Michael McGarry: Yeah Mike, this is Michael. So, I mean it’s a traditional PPG model here. So the gap is the largest in automotive for two reasons: one it had the biggest inflationary gap, and the second is, it’s most difficult to get price increases with the automotive guys. But I am very pleased to announce that we have gotten positive price in every automotive region in the world. So we are making good progress there and well ahead where we were in 2017, 2018.  I would say the next inflationary would be in our industrial coatings business. They also buy a lot of epoxies, isocyanates. So they would have been hit second most difficult. The business that’s impacted the least is aerospace due to the raw material mix we have there.  The place that we probably have closed the gap the most is architectural. We’re working also hard on traffic solutions. This is a business that historically price was a secondary thought. We've elevated that in this business and we've been very pleased at the pace of recovery in our traffic solutions business.  So I don't think it's any different than what we've seen in years past, and I think we're going to continue to push hard to close that gap with our automotive customers, and that's – I'm really pleased when you think about where we are in this cycle versus where we were in the last cycle, it's light years apart. 
Operator: The next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. 
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. I think at the end of the last quarter, you thought that you would earn between 2.15 and 2.20 a share. When did you realize that you wouldn't be able to do that? Was it something that happened at the very end of the quarter or at the middle of the quarter? And in your – in the mis-assessment of how much you might early in the second quarter, what were the real sources that? Was it an information issue or did it turn out that raw materials really rose very, very quickly in June? Can you talk about the history of the way you assessed the quarter, you know over the past couple of months? 
Vince Morales: Yeah Jeff, this is Vince. So if you look, we came out early in April, we were one of the early reporters in April. It was directly after the weather event in Texas. At that point in time we were hearing from our suppliers and as Michael alluded to earlier, that this would be a multi week startup. As we progressed through the quarter, and especially in June we continued to see outages and escalation of raw materials, specifically in the June time period, which is why we're seeing Q3 higher than Q2 in terms of our raw material estimates.  We continue to see outages, particularly around transportation. Those outages continue to worsen, especially in June and our customers continue to have spot production curtailments from their perspective. So as we were in June, we continue to see the automotive market be heavily impacted by chip shortages and a lot of customers in that particular industry who had year marked Q3 for some downtime actually took it in Q2.  So as we went through the quarter, we saw the difficulties continue to grow. So that really was the timeline, and again as you look at our guidance for Q3, you could see some of these things are going to certainly carry forward into the third quarter that we were not anticipating. We are anticipating them being rectified at some point in mid-Q2, certainly not even before late Q2. 
Michael McGarry: And Jeff, this is Michael. I would say we're disappointed that the raw material inflation continued at such a high level throughout the quarter, and it just seemed to get worse. And when you bank on your suppliers saying they are going to get to 20 trucks and they get you 10, that doesn't help you. So we own up to this raw material inflation miss and that's our accountability. 
Operator: The next question comes from Prashant Juvekar from Citi. Please go ahead. 
Prashant Juvekar: Yes, hi! Good morning. Michael, given the shortage of raw materials, are you able to make enough paint products? And where do paint inventories stand in the supply chain; in your stores for example or in the MSOs and refinish. And if painting window is at below normal, could there be sort of paint restocking cycle sometime in second half or next year? Can you talk about that? 
Michael McGarry: So P.J. I tried to cover that in our opening remarks, inventory levels in all our businesses are at exceptionally low level. You saw that in our working capital numbers. I've actually asked our businesses to share with me the amount of product they made in April, May, June and versus how much of that went out the door and virtually everything we made went out the door. So inventories you know have gone backwards for us.  We see very low inventories in the chain in many of our customers as well. So if you look at our architectural guys, they typically don't carry a lot, but they have even less. If you look at our industrial customers, I've had more calls from the customers directly to me in the past quarter than I've had in the past probably three or four years.  So customers have low inventory, as well. I do think they will be restocking, and of course as you know in aerospace inventories I would say are at rock bottom, because they couldn't afford to buy anything previously, and so they're trying to stock up now ahead of what they anticipated increased demand. So I can't really think of a single one of our businesses that have any kind of material inventory either on the shelf or at our customers. 
Vince Morales: And P.J., this is Vince. If you look ahead, we do think again there's very good underlying demand in many of the markets that we supply, automotive being a proxy as we talked about it earlier. There's several steps where we see automotive sales continuing from multiple quarters. There's a restock that will take place, just to get back to normal safety stock levels in our customer's inventory. So we feel good for the next several quarters about the ability to sell product or our customers’ ability to sell product, more so than we have for quite some time because of this very strong underlying demand around the world. 
Operator: The next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Please go ahead. 
Frank Mitsch: Hey, good morning folks. Michael, you mentioned during this call that you maintained enough flexibility to do accretive cash deployment. And so as I'm listening, there's a number of comments in release in the transcript and on this call today that says, you know you guys are very constructive on your outlook. So just curious as to what extent might you be able to be opportunistic on buybacks? 
Michael McGarry: Well Frank as you know, we always prefer the acquisitions over the buyback. Clearly, we take a look at this on a monthly basis. You saw that we finished the quarter with about $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of cash. We're coming into our very strong cash period where we generate a lot of cash in the back half of the year. I think our current ratio is 2.1, so you know from that standpoint and with cash coming in, we're in a good position.  There had been a number of the top 30 coatings company has been taken off the board in the last couple of, let's call it last three or four quarters, so the availability of targets is probably not as good as it was six months ago. So you know right now we're going to keep an open mind for that and we're going to remain balanced in how we deploy cash.  You saw that we increased our dividend. We think that was important, certainly 50 years of dividend increase is a significant milestone and right now I would say that I like our acquisition, you know order log book if you will where we stand, that pipeline, but overall I would say we're going to remain balanced on this viewpoint. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Laurent Favre from Exane BNPP. Please go ahead. 
Laurent Favre : Yes, good morning. My question is on architectural and the guidance on Q3 with volumes down in both the Americas and Europe. I was wondering if you could talk about some, I guess the different buckets of what’s driving that? Is it underlying demand, is it share loss due to pricing, availability of raw materials, DIY comp, [inaudible] etc. Thank you. 
Michael McGarry: Laurent, I would say from an architectural standpoint there's certainly been no share loss. We've been really pleased with how we're performing in architectural. You saw the numbers we reported in both Europe and the U.S., are strong numbers. So from that standpoint you know what we're looking at is a shift as we anticipated would eventually happen, of people moving from DIY to trade as people start to go on vacation and start to spend their money, they are going to hire professionals to come in and do that.  We see our trade order book increasing to offset the weakness in DIY, but what I would point out is DIY is still well above 2019 levels and so when you combine the two, you know we're pleased with the outlook on where we stand. I think the outlook we gave for the third quarter for architectural is quite strong and you know we are pleased with the performance of the business. 
Vince Morales: The other one I would add – this is Vince. I would add, we are still in the third quarter expecting to experience shortfalls for raw material supply from coatings raw materials supply, so it is moderate in our ability to supply some of our key products, especially on the U.S. side, so trade-in in DIY, so that is one of the limiters we do have in terms of our sales outlook. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. 
Vincent Andrews : Very much. Just wondering, you know we're halfway through 2021. You know maybe you could give us an assessment of the cost that came out with COVID, the costs that you’re able to avoid you know as we're now halfway through the year. Do you have a sense of, you know any better sense of how much of that’s going to come back and when? 
John Bruno: Yes, this is John. So we think we're kind of at Perry [ph] now. There might be some travel entertainment, just some modest stuff that comes back as things continue to open up, but we felt that on an annualized basis that we could bank – we said on a quarterly basis $25 million to $30 million of temp savings. We had another $30 million of benefit in the second quarter. So I think this is something we probably won't talk much more about, because at this stage you know I think we've made some of these costs permanent reductions and you know now we'll just ebb and flow more with our volume and demand activity. 
Vincent Andrews : Thanks very much.
Vince Morales: And this is Vince. I do think that when you look at our multi-year selling general and administrative cost as a percent of sales, you can not only see the interim savings as we call these, dropping to the bottom line, but you could also see more importantly the structural savings that we've introduced for a couple of years now and those are also benefiting us.  On top of that, just to dovetail from Michael on the acquisitions, we do have a significant amount of synergy savings targeted for the five acquisitions. We gave out a target earlier in the year. We're on target for that, although some of these have just closed, so a lot of those savings will be visible and more visible in 2022. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. 
Kevin McCarthy : Yes, good morning. Michael, there's been a lot of focus on automotive as a source of the negative variances. I'm curious, if we put automotive on the side for the moment, would you care to call out other businesses that would have disappointed relative to your prior expectations and you know if so, was that more driven by a demand variance or price cost spread that was you know spread across many of your business.
A - Michael McGarry: Yeah Kevin, so the two businesses that were impacted besides automotive the most was architectural due to emulsions and traffic solutions, the same thing. So we had a hard time getting the emulsions and resins from our suppliers. You can't make paint without that and so we were hand to mouth on those kind of things, despite having significant demand. If you go into any of our stores or go in the big boxes or asking the DOTs, they would all tell you that all the suppliers are struggling to put paint on the shelves. So I think that was the most material things.  But it is interesting, you know we didn't track it, because I didn't think it would become a material number, but the number of other places that chips show up, you know whether it's appliances or other heavy duty equipment, so everybody has been impacted somewhat, but it really didn't turn out to be enough of a number to call out, but I would say the two biggest ones are architectural and traffic solutions. 
A - Vince Morales: Yeah Kevin, I’ll just add that in many of our businesses, automotive obviously, the two Michael mentioned, traffic solutions architectural, we can even get into aerospace. Some of our industrial businesses we finish, you know we have a higher order book exiting Q2 that we just could not fulfill. So our order book as we alluded to earlier is very strong. We just got to be able to fulfill that with product availability. 
Operator: The next question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. 
Arun Viswanathan : Alright, thanks for taking my questions. So I guess I just wanted to go back to the last question a little bit and understand I guess potentially some of the bridge items for ‘22 versus ’21. So you have a full year of accretion on many of the deals. You have kind of a normalization in some of your volumes and hopefully you’re all caught up on price cost.  So I think you made the comment that your ‘21 EPS is going to be a double digit growth from ‘19 levels. Is that a fair starting point when you think about ’22 and is there – you know just given what you've seen on the cost side, is there opportunities to continue to grow margins as you recover that price cost spread in ‘22 as well. Thanks. 
Vince Morales : Yeah Arun, this is Vince. A little bit longer look than we want to do at this point in time. There's still a lot of fluidity just in the economies out there. You know I think we’ve tried to lay out today some of the positive things we think are in store, not only for us but the industry, good demand. We do think PPG specific, these acquisitions along with the synergies that come with them.  We hope we get to a normal price cost environment, but it's all too early to make that call for what the supply chain looks like going into 2022 right now. We think it'll normalize, but it's just too early to make all these calls at this point time of the year. We certainly feel very optimistic about you know next year just given the overall demand outlook. Typically when you have strong demand, you know that parlays into positive results, better cost spread on a bigger sales base, etc. 
Operator: The next question comes from Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Duffy Fischer: Yeah, good morning guys. I just wanted to drill down on volume, particularly in Q3 if we can. You know Vince, you talked about 4%, 4.5% price rolling through and relative to your low single digit growth, I mean that's kind of all the growth then that would be in both segments as price, which would mean than volume is kind of flat to maybe down. And Michael called out $150 million of kind of foregone sales because of the issues which you know might add another 4% to that.  So what that would say is kind of the run rate volume growth, looks like it's 3%-ish in Q3, which feels pretty light given how early we are in the cycle. So can you just talk about what you think the underlying volume growth is in your businesses, kind of Q3 and then how does that set the table then for continued volume growth the rest of this year and into next year. 
Vince Morales : Yeah Duffy, I'll try to give this a shot, a lot of numbers in there. Look, when you look by business you know we're still constrained as Michael alluded to, on our ability to fully satisfy our order book. We expect that to continue well into Q3 if not fully through Q3. Some of our customers are still well constrained on their ability to produce, so again we gave out the guidance of low single digit organic growth and we think there's a lot of moving pieces in there.  What again I'll just pass through to you is our confidence level that we're not going to be able as an industry to supply the demand that's out there even by the end of Q3. So you know how these pieces come together Q3 versus Q4, we’ll still see how that's determined, but strong, very strong underlying demand, recovery demand occurring in aerospace, starting to occur in aerospace, some demand in refinish as traffic miles pick up. So we're just confident there's underlying demand there and we just got to be able to fulfill it. 
Operator: The next question comes from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Bob Koort: Thank you. Good morning. Mike and Vince, I think you guys talked about having to go to the spot market for procurement. How tolerant are your customers going to be of that as a basis for price hikes and sustained price hikes then into next year as some of the spot markets start to normalize. Is there confidence you can retain those price hikes and is there any scope for you to use the force majeure impact that you suffer to somehow pass those along on your own terms with your customers or is that just something that doesn't happen? Thank you.
Michael McGarry: No Bob, this is Michael. We have been aggressive in trying to get our customers pay for the additional freight charges that are, you know if they want to move up orders, if they want to – you know us to buy from spot people. In order to keep them running, we have gone to them and asked them to pay for that, but that's a portion of the overall raw material increase.  You know even without the spot we would have still been you know 15% to 17%, so these are real increases. You know they are seeing them in their own cost structure as well, so they are not able to debate whether or not we're having these things. So as Vince alluded to earlier, you know we need to get about 50% of the overall increase and so we've been out there with some very significant increases and I think we’re making a lot of progress in that regard.  Clearly you know we'd like to have moved faster, but when I look back on 2017, 2018, we’re well ahead of that, so. I think the customers are very understanding of this and what it takes is the whole market to move to capture it and you know we've been out early and often and we’ll have to continue to do that in 3Q and 4Q. 
Vince Morales : And Bob, I’ll just add, you know most of our customers are facing similar issues beyond just coatings and they are trying to supply their customers, and they are short of product as well. So this is a pervasive issue that's well known across the materials and industrial spaces and you know our customers are seeing inflationary pressures from a variety of different industries. We’re one of those industries of course and so again the acceptance level as Michael alluded to is higher today than it certainly was in the past cycles. 
Operator: The next question comes from Mike Harrison from Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Mike Harrison: Hi! Good morning. I had a question on the aerospace business. Within the aftermarket business, do you have situations where some of these aircrafts have been mothballed for several months and they need significant maintenance or even repainting before they return to service. Maybe just talk a little bit about how that aftermarket business recovery is playing out. 
Michael McGarry: Yes, so the easy one is on the repaint side. They don't need repainting per say, but if any, if a customer had returned planes to the lessor, those planes, they’d be returned in a white format. So we have been painting a lot of planes white during the pandemic. Now we're not painting any white right now, because they are going to be returned to service, so there will be a pick-up of that. Also, what we historically find is after events like this, you will see some rebranding being done, so we're anticipating that will also happen maybe in 2023, 2024. But overall right now when you take the plane out of storage, if it was properly stored, there is some maintenance they need to do on it before it goes back into service, but then they don't have to do the big heavy check that they do at the big maintenance cycles. But overall inventories are exceptionally low.  Our order book in – or I should say our book-to-bill ratio has improved significantly in aerospace. Our backlog has increased and so right now the biggest challenge we have in our aerospace business is our labor, making sure we get enough qualified labor to work in the plants, to be able to get the product out the door. So we're feeling very, very good about aerospace on the MRO side.  We're not there yet obviously on the OEM side. You know builds are picking up slightly on the 737, they are picking up slightly on the A321, but for the bigger birds, they are not picking up at all and we don't anticipate seeing that range pick up until 2023 time period because of a lack of international flights. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from JD Panjia [ph] from On Field Investment Research. Please go ahead. 
Q - Unidentified Analyst: Thanks a lot. Just a question really around the logistics. So obviously there's a significant increase in container rates out of China. So as and when the container rate or rather logistic situation sort of normalizes, do you expect a sharp reversal in some of your raw material basket, because if I think about oil it has only gone up, let’s say call it their cut 20% in the last quarter, but some of your own materials have more than doubled and literally volumes that are coming out of China into Europe and U.S. are gone down a lot in all the raw materials. So once the container rate situation normalizes, do you see a sharp reversal of raw material dynamics? Thanks a lot. 
Michael McGarry: Hey JD, this is Michael. I would say the container rate is only a portion of the overall raw material spend. The bigger challenge overall has been the supply-demand issue for the base raw materials. Certainly, we're not happy with the container prices. It has escalated significantly, but if we could get the overall base supply-demand balance back in balance if you will in our supply chain, I think prices would start to normalize somewhat. We don't see that happening in 2021, so right now we're still anticipating significant inflation when we said its 20% in Q3 and we’ll have a significant inflation in Q4, so. You know for as far as we can currently look out, we're still looking at a pretty inflationary cycle. 
Vince Morales: Yeah, again this is Vince. If I could just add, so what we've seen is a compounding of events here. One was the – obviously, the shock in March due to the chemical supply chain. That was then compounded by the logistics systems got out of sequence, which was then compounded by some of the international logistics, not only got a sequence, but were higher priced. So these kind of chain events is what really pushed these raw materials up. Some of that will unwind as we get out of the season. As I said earlier, Q2 is the peak season, but we do expect these raw material costs to remain elevated for the balance of the year. 
Operator: The next question comes from the Edlain Rodriguez from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Edlain Rodriguez: Thank you. Good morning guys. Michael, a quick question. I mean one quick one about medium term volumes. So when you look at the couple of businesses that are still below pre-pandemic levels. Do you have a sense of when they catch up and essentially given the pace of activity your seeing, do you get there in 2022 or is it more you know like 2023 or so?
Michael McGarry: Well, the only business that will not be recovered by 2022 in my opinion is aerospace OEM. So aerospace MRO will probably be 90% back. Certainly, the military is already back. Refinish, we saw last year when Europe opened up, we saw the refinish miles in Europe come back very strongly, so we're anticipating the same thing as they get the vaccines out that we anticipate the back half of 2021 will you know recover significantly and by hopefully all of 2022 Europe will be back to normal.  We see in the U.S. already we’re at 90%-plus recovered in refinish, and actually what you're seeing is a little shift from traffic from the cities into the suburbs. So you know collisions are actually improving every month here in the U.S., and of course in China it's all the way back to normal, and we see a snap back in India whenever we see the folks get allowed to travel again. So most places it is vaccine related, and so we're pretty confident.  If you go through the rest of our businesses, we're already back at industrial work, mostly back in automotive. Our packaging business is well ahead, you know the demand in aluminum packaging is very strong, so our packaging business is going to have another record year this year and next year. If you look at our PMC business, you know protective, you know now that that oil prices have recovered, I expect protective to continue to recover as well as they start to protect these high value assets in the oil fields.  So I'm very comfortable that we're going to have a strong back half of the demand for 2021 and a continued demand recovery in 2022. 
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. Mr. John Bruno, I turn the call back over to you. 
John Bruno: Yeah, thank you Jason. I’d like to thank everyone for their time and interest in PPG. This concludes our second quarter earnings call. 
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-04-16 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is Jerome and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PPG Industries First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Bruno, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
John Bruno: Thank you, Jerome, and good morning, everyone. Once again, this is John Bruno. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG and welcome you to our first quarter 2021 financial results conference call. Joining me on the call from PPG are Michael McGarry, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vince Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our comments relate to the financial information released after U.S. equity markets closed on Thursday, April 15, 2021. We posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on the investor center of our website, ppg.com. The slides are also available on the website for this call and provide additional support to the brief opening comments Michael will make shortly. Following management's perspective on the company's results for the quarter, we will move to a Q&A session. Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements, reflecting the company's current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC. Now, let me introduce PPG Chairman and CEO, Michael McGarry.
Michael McGarry: Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. I would like to welcome everyone to our first quarter 2021 earnings call. But most importantly, I hope you and your loved ones are remaining safe and healthy. Now, let me provide some comments to supplement the detailed financial results we released last evening. For the first quarter, our net sales were a record and were about $3.9 billion. And our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were also a record at $1.88. Our adjusted EPS was significantly higher than the first quarter of 2020, partially due to last year's first quarter being impacted by various pandemic-related impacts. We will also be comparing various financial metrics versus pre-pandemic results, and this comparison was nearly equally impressive with adjusted EPS 27% higher than the pre-COVID first quarter results of 2019. This excellent operating performance was driven by strong year-over-year sales growth in our Industrial Coatings reporting segment with the automotive OEM, general industrial and packaging coatings businesses all delivering double-digit percentage year-over-year sales growth. Our global architectural coatings business continued their strong sales growth trends. And automotive refinish had a strong quarter as activity in that end-use market is beginning to recover, and we were partially aided by some customer restocking in the U.S. First quarter segment margins were at a multiyear high as we benefited from strong operating margin leverage on higher year-over-year net sales growth. The significant amount of cost savings we have achieved in the past two years from our restructuring programs is a primary factor contributing to us realizing this increased leverage. We delivered these outstanding results despite sales volumes not fully returning to pre-pandemic levels, including in several key PPG businesses such as aerospace. In addition, we experienced a significant acceleration of raw material and logistics cost inflation during the quarter. Coming into the year, we were expecting an inflationary environment and had prioritized selling price increases across all of our businesses. This has helped us achieve solid price increases year-to-date. With a higher inflation backdrop, we have already secured further selling price increases and are in the process of executing additional ones during the second quarter. As a reminder, first quarter of 2021 was our 16th consecutive quarter of higher selling prices. We also continue to execute on our cost-savings programs, realizing an incremental $35 million of structural savings and maintain our target of $125 million of total savings for the full year 2021. In addition, we retained about $30 million of interim cost savings during the quarter and remain confident that we'll be able to make at least $80 million of these interim cost savings permanent for the full year 2021. We ended the first quarter with about $1.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents. This is a gross-up cash balance as we are preparing for the closing of the Tikkurila and Worwag acquisitions. Contributing to this strong cash balance is a 200-basis point year-over-year improvement in our operating working capital in the first quarter, which drove better operating cash generation than a typical first quarter. Our new Traffic Solutions business, which is the Ennis-Flint acquisition, performed to our expectations in the quarter despite significant challenges with weather and raw material availability. The business has a strong order book heading into the second quarter. In the first quarter, we also completed the VersaFlex acquisition. And the Tikkurila and Worwag acquisitions are expected to be completed in the second quarter. In the accompanying presentation to our earnings material, we included several slides to provide further information and perspective on our four recent acquisitions and our performance for a number of acquisitions. Some items that I'd like to highlight. Each of the four acquisitions bring incremental strategic benefits to PPG, such as product line extensions and geographic expansions. We've continued to deliver strong synergy capture from our past acquisitions and believe our global breadth, regional participation in all coating verticals, best-in-class procurement and mature back-office centers of excellence in low-cost areas allow us to deliver higher synergy capabilities than our competitors. For our recently announced acquisitions, we expect to realize synergies of high single digit of sales, higher than historical industry synergy capture. We also provided an update to our acquisition performance we last shared in May 2019. We included our 10 most recent acquisitions that have been closed for at least 24 months. In most acquisitions and in aggregate, we have achieved higher synergy capture than our initial estimates, averaging about 50 basis points higher. All of these acquisitions will help drive shareholder value creation. The post-synergy multiples for each of these acquisitions is below PPG's five-year average multiple. And for eight of the acquisitions, the post-synergy multiple is below 10. All four of the recently announced acquisitions provide earnings accretion from their historical base business and synergy realization. By the end of 2022, we expect cumulative synergies to total about $75 million and will be at an annual run rate of $135 million once they were all fully integrated. As with many of our initial synergy projections, these initial targets only include a modest benefit from sales synergies, although these acquisitions are well suited for us to drive further top line growth. We expect the Tikkurila acquisition to be completed in the second quarter. We recently extended the tender offer period until May 11 to finalize customary regulatory approvals. Tikkurila is a highly strategic acquisition with leading architecture coatings positions across various countries. As I said in January, I see many similar characteristics to our previous Comex acquisition. We'll have significant opportunities to cross-sell complementary products through our legacy channels to further grow sales and earnings. Our Comex acquisition has well exceeded our initial acquisition economics. Moving to our current outlook. We are continuing to see very robust and broad-based demand globally, including in many industrial and OEM end-use markets and continued architectural coatings activity. Many of our customers have indicated they have strong order books, and we anticipate this global -- strong global demand pattern to continue well into the second half of 2021 at a minimum. In addition, we expect an eventual restocking of inventory to occur in many of our selling channels as the year progresses. One important item to note is some of our customers are experiencing input or component shortages, so their production capabilities and schedules remain choppy, and we are experiencing a few spot outages of direct coatings raw materials. As a result, we expect some unfavorable sales impacts from both our direct supply chain disruptions and these production curtailments at some of our customers. Our best current estimate is that sales are expected to be impacted by about $70 million to $90 million in the second quarter due to these issues. We expect these sales to be deferred in the second half of 2021, and thus, this impact is already included in our second quarter 2021 financial guidance. Also, as I mentioned previously, we're experiencing commodity inflation that occurred quickly due to the weather event named Uri. As a result of this rapid inflation increase in both raw materials and logistics, we have fully mobilized our commercial teams and are successfully securing additional selling price increases. We have a very good head start on this inflation cycle, and we expect to fully offset raw material cost inflation in the second half of 2021. Finally, as you've come to expect from PPG, we remain committed to strong and real-time cost management, which will provide continued strong operating leverage on sales growth. These current disruptions are temporary. And we maintain a positive view on the overall global coatings demand growth, which continues to be robust and broad-based across most of the end-use markets that we supply. This is expected to continue throughout 2021. The strong demand conditions, along with our leading technology advantaged products, provides us with many organic growth opportunities in 2021 and beyond. For the company, aggregate sales volumes are projected to be up by low teen percentage in the second quarter on a sequential basis compared to the first quarter of 2021 with differences by business and region. Adjusted earnings, excluding amortization expense, is expected to be between $2.15 to $2.20, continuing a strong earnings momentum. As a reminder, this guidance does not include any EPS impact from either the Tikkurila or Worwag acquisitions. Our near-term cash deployment priority will be to complete the acquisitions we have announced, which we anticipate to be funded by a combination of cash on hand and debt by the end of the second quarter. In closing, I want to thank and recognize our global PPG team. The character of our employees has never shone brighter than it has during these times of adversity. Our people have shown great resiliency, continuing to serve our customers, our communities and drive a common purpose to protect and beautify the world. Thank you for your continued confidence in PPG. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, Jerome, would you please open the line for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of [Caleb Billy] [ph] with BMO. Your line is open.
John McNulty: Hi, this is John McNulty. So a question on the raw material front. It seems like there's still a little bit of supply chain issues. Are you -- have you seen raw material pricing, have you've seen it peak yet, or are there still some pockets where you're still continuing to see that rising pressure? And then can you speak to the level of price increases that you need to offset some of that raw material pressure that you've been speaking about?
Michael McGarry: John, this is Michael. I would tell you that most prices have peaked. There probably could be a few [nits and nats] [ph] here that could increase further. But what we see is that raw material availability is getting better. It's not great, but it's getting better on a daily basis. Our teams are working hard on that. And we had 1.7% positive price in Q1, and we expect to have more positive price in Q2. So it's probably a little bit early to say how much we need to get, but we're working hard at it. And what I'm most encouraged by is that every coatings business in PPG had positive price, including our automotive business, and we're on track for every coatings business to have positive price in Q2.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Your line is open.
Ghansham Panjabi: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I guess on the strong second quarter guidance despite what we're obviously seeing with massive raw material cost inflation, can you just take us through the mechanics of how you're approaching pricing now versus previous cost inflation cycles? And related to that, I read a new paradigm for the coatings industry, whereby pricing will more quickly align with raw material cost volatility, including when costs start to decline at some point? I guess I'm asking because historically, the industry has been very good about maintaining pricing even as raw material costs have moderated post previous peaks. Thanks so much.
Michael McGarry: Ghansham, what I would tell you is that we anticipated raw material inflation coming into the year. And so we had put our teams on high alert to get pricing early in the year. And the second thing is we're trying to do a better job of surgical price increases as well as value selling, so as we roll out new products to capture that additional value. And we're doing a better job, I think, on services. During the pandemic, it was clear how much our customers valued our ability to help them get their lines up and running. And I think we're doing a better job of capturing value for those services. So I think each of those things is important. Clearly, as the freeze happened, it wasn't any shock to anybody at PPG that this was going to lead to additional raw material inflation. And so we immediately, as we saw Texas going into a deep freeze, put all our sales teams on high alert that they need to start talking to their customers immediately about raw material inflation. I think one of the things that's different, if you remember 2017 and '18, there are -- some of our competitors were distracted. You had the Valspar acquisition being completed. Valspar wasn't raising price. And Akzo is under a lot of pressure. They were not doing anything that were going after value. This is so clear and obvious that I think everybody is more on top of this. Hopefully, this will be a trend to be on top of raw material inflation as a regular ongoing business practice. So I would just tell you, I'm confident that our teams are proactively addressing this.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Bob Koort: Thank you. Good morning. And I appreciate the increased transparency around all the deals and the segment trends. That was very helpful in the slide deck. I wanted to ask on Tikkurila, when is the peak paint season in Northern Europe? So is there some risk of maybe missing the best part of the year if you can't close that more efficiently? And then secondly on Ennis-Flint, I noticed that you didn't check off that geographic expansion. It was one of the opportunities or key attributes there. And I guess I recall you guys talking about maybe getting more aggressive internationally there. So did I misunderstand that in the past? Thanks.
Michael McGarry: No, Bob, Ennis-Flint does have some regional aspects. It is -- got a little bit of share in Mexico, has a little bit of share in Argentina, has a little bit in Australia and a little bit in Europe. We are digesting all that information right now looking at a strategy that will help us accelerate that. It will be a prime focus for us. We have already made some headway, as you can imagine, in Mexico. Our strong PPG-Comex team is all over this, and that's the area that will leverage the quickest. Probably the next area, that will be Europe. So I think these are all positives. So it's a small piece of it. But it will get bigger overtime.
Vince Morales: And before Michael answers, Bob, the Tikkurila question, the geographic expansion on that slide was really for PPG, not necessarily for the acquired company. So Tikkurila definitely gives us significant geographic expansion in Scandinavia, where we have very minor presence. So that line item on that chart was really around PPG's benefit.
Michael McGarry: And then, the paint season in Nordic and Russia, as you can imagine, is more compressed than a typical one. And the best months are April through August and September. It definitely slows down in the fourth quarter. And so clearly, we'd like to get this thing closed sooner rather than later.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrne with Bank of America Securities. Your line is open.
Stephen Byrne: You have these EBITDA synergy percentages for these four acquisitions. Just curious as to whether in those metrics and then also on the slide where you show pre- and post-synergy multiple impacts, do you include in there the revenue benefit from either cross-selling into your other businesses or your ability to accelerate the sales growth? Do you include that in these post-synergy metrics? And perhaps if you do, could you comment on, say, the relative split between them? I would assume that it would depend on the business. Like Ennis-Flint, I would imagine your ability to cut costs with your supply chain could be meaningful. But this VersaFlex, I'm glad you made that comment, Vince, to Bob's question, I would assume that VersaFlex is that technology is one that you could really expand globally.
Vince Morales: Yes. Steve, this is Vince. Typically, in most of these deals, the ones we've completed as well as the ones that we have here as pending. Most of these deals have very, as Michael said in his opening comments, a very minor top line synergies included. So our metrics on a traditional project, the acquisition project are typically based on cost synergies primarily. There are a few in the ones completed. Michael mentioned Comex where we do have further top line synergies than traditional. But I think for us and most people in the space, most of the synergies come from the cost side. I think what's also important is some of these come day one. So these day one synergies certainly help us in terms of the project economics. And you're spot on again, as we look at this chart, all of these acquisitions provide expansion of the acquired companies' products across PPG's footprint. But again, that's typically not the big driver in these synergy buckets.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Your line is open.
Frank Mitsch: Thank you and good morning. I'd be remiss if I didn't pass along that a client told me that your result was [indiscernible] on Saturday; so congrats on that. Michael, you indicated that the first quarter volumes were 2% below 2019 levels. And I'm curious what is embedded relative to 2Q 2019 in your $2.15 to $2.20 guidance, where you stand relative to the pre-pandemic period? And if you could give a discussion as to how much of that volume is related to restock? Because I believe you mentioned in a couple of areas that you are seeing some restock take place versus underlying demand.
Michael McGarry: Yes. Frank, I would say that there's very little anticipated restock in 2Q. The restock that we saw in the U.S. refinish market really had more to do with the fact that we had a more normal winter. And so the guys didn't want to get caught if we had a return-to-work situation. So they've done, I think, whatever restocking they're going to do. So from that standpoint, I would say the volumes that we're projecting for 2Q are still at or slightly below the 2Q of 2019, and that's primarily driven by aerospace. So what I'm encouraged about, Frank, to be honest, is that January and February for aerospace was still pretty mediocre. But March was pretty encouraging. And we know that the aerospace guys have completely depleted inventory. I mean they have virtually nothing in the chain. So at some point, as things get better, they're going to start ordering and that will start to be a positive. We haven't seen that yet. We do track it on a very regular basis, as you can imagine. But I was encouraged by March, and the MRO sales have continued to tick up in April here. Now we expect OEM aerospace to be flat because that's not going to change anytime soon. But the MRO side will be better. So we have military still doing well. MRO is starting to improve. So you should regard that as a real positive.
Vince Morales: And a couple of other channels that are light inventory. We know the automotive market globally is exceptionally light in terms of their historical inventory trends. We think the U.S., for example, is somewhere in the mid-40s days of inventory, which is typically 70 or 80. We know the U.S. car rental agencies are very light inventory. They didn't buy much in the past 12 months. So again, we think auto production, once it's available to run full out will be a good tailwind. The other industries and many industrial markets are light inventory, some of those due to the chip shortages. And we are, as a company, light inventory, we weren't able to produce as much inventory in Q1 as we wanted for the 2Q architectural season. So we do feel there's inventory replenishment across many of the end markets that we supply.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Your line is open.
John Roberts: Thank you. Versus the 2019 pre-pandemic, overall volumes down 1% and looks like second quarter will be maybe up a couple percent. Can you talk about some of the businesses that are well above pre-pandemic levels like DIY architectural, how far above 2019 is that? And are we above or below pre-pandemic in refinish? Kind of hard to tell since it's been moving around a lot.
Michael McGarry: Yes. We're still below in refinish. We're below in every place, but China. So Australia is low. Europe is definitely low. U.S. will remain down. I mean claims even last -- last reported one was down 8%. So that's going to continue to be under. I think we put a slide in there as far as by each of the businesses. I hope I -- well, we'll get into it. So, I think the one that's most negative to think about is aerospace. But then the rest of them should be -- automotive OEMs should be marginally down. That's really due to chips. Industrial should be up. Packaging should be up. And all the other ones will be down.
Vince Morales: Yes. But John, I just want to -- we are expecting volumes slightly below -- in Q2, slightly below 2019 levels. So we do -- again, there's still recovery outstanding in most of these end markets.
Michael McGarry: In architectural, we don't see a slowdown yet. Even April continue to be very strong. So the architectural side globally in every market we participate in around the world continues to be quite strong.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Favre with Exane BNP. Your line is open.
Laurent Favre: Hi. Good morning, all. It's actually a follow-up to that question on DIY versus do it for me. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of at least directional color on what you're seeing in North America and in Europe, especially on do it for me. Thank you.
Michael McGarry: Well, the DIY, Laurent, continues to be quite strong, double digits plus. We were up more than double digits plus in Europe. Same thing in the U.S. Same thing in Australia. So for us, this is -- and Mexico has been it's not much of a DIY market, but it continues to be strong. So we're not seeing any change in that trend. And of course, with the continued lockdown, as you are well aware, in Europe, we anticipate this will continue throughout the summer.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you very much. I just wanted to make sure I understood your comments on raw materials for the back half of the year. I believe you said that you expect pricing to offset raws in 2H. But I just want to clarify whether that means by the end of 2H or for the entirety of 2H?
Vince Morales: Hey, Vincent, this is Vince. Our view of raw materials as they are, we hope, at the high watermark at this point, that will carry somewhat into Q3. We are seeing in some spot outages that we expect will continue through part of April and into May. Then seasonally, these -- we expect these raw materials to have normal seasonal patterns. And our pricing in different businesses by segment will differ. But certainly, in the second half and its entirety, we'll definitely offset raw materials is our expectation.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. You may now ask your question.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Michael, just on the cost savings. On the temporary costs they're becoming permanent, can you give a little more color as to what they are and where they are and how you accomplish that? And just on Tikkurila, I believe you need Russian approval. If that approval was delayed, could you still close on the rest of the company without that approval in hand? Thank you.
Michael McGarry: So the Tikkurila one is easy. We're going to wait for Russian approval and close all at once. That's what we're expecting to do. As far as your second -- your first question, I would tell you that I feel confident that the businesses are well prepared. And Vince, I don't know if you want to...
Vince Morales: Yes. I think on the cost, David, we've couple of things. Obviously, travel is down considerably. We have other discrete cost items that we expect to stay out. We've had headcount freezes on in certain parts of the world in certain businesses. We've learned to operate without some of the headcount. We have done some work in terms of consolidation of warehouses given our lower inventory levels. And given our lower inventory level overall, we don't expect to bring back of some of those warehouses that we've exited. And the other piece that we're -- we've talked about is in terms of digital, we're finding different ways of working that are reducing our cost footprint in different parts of the world. In Europe, for example, which is our highest architectural digital portion, we are looking at our overall footprint in terms of architectural bricks and mortar. So it's really spread out. Every business is in a high alert with respect to these costs. And you could see the benefit in our leverage of earnings. Our volumes were up 7%. That came at around a 40% leverage. So every business sees the value of that, and we're being very mindful of every cost line item on our income statement.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Sison with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Michael Sison: Hey, guys. Nice start to the year. In terms of your outlook for sales growth in 2Q versus 1Q, I think you said low double digits. How much of that increase sequentially is going to be price and volume? And then -- and I'm just curious how much -- what exactly is the inflation delta that you have to uncover maybe either in dollars or gross margin percentages for the year?
Vince Morales: Mike, thanks. I'll start and then Michael can certainly add some more color. But we do expect pricing to be higher than Q1 on a percentage basis year-over-year. The volumes are still a bit mixed by business and segment again due to the shortages, both in our inventory as well as customers and ability to run. But again, we gave you the composite number. So hopefully, you can vet out what you expect to be from a volume perspective.
Michael McGarry: And I would say, Michael, just to be consistent, the primary drivers of the higher volume are going to be on the industrial segment side. As you remember, April and May last year, the automotive companies were completely shut down. Packaging remains strong, and many segments in our industrial business are doing quite well.
Vince Morales: And Mike, maybe just to add one more thing. We would have probably had a little bit more sales in 2Q if it wasn't for the supply disruptions that we noted, that Michael noted of $70 million to $90 million in his opening comments.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. Your EBITDA margins were 17% in 2020. And I think in the first quarter, they were about 18%. You've got all kinds of raw material inflation. Your volumes are not really back to where you want them to be. You've made some acquisitions. Once you get your price increases and businesses back to normal, what's the EBITDA margin? Should it be roughly 20%? Can you do better than that? What's your long-term goal? And what is the profitability of PPG look like on a normal basis?
Michael McGarry: Well, I think, Jeff, one of the PPG's tenets is that we do better today than yesterday every day. So right now, our current target is to well exceed our 2016 peak margin. So if you want to go back and look at that, you'll see one data point. We're well above that in our Performance Coatings segment. We're not there on our industrial side, so we have more work to do. But overall, I think what you should do is anticipate that we're going to continue to drive these margins higher. I think you hit on all the right aspects. We have better leverage. We're going to be able to retain pricing once we get it in place. And we have new products that are coming out. So I think we're doing quite well. I mean we're excited that we had a record quarter. We're forecasting a record second quarter. And that's three quarters in a row of record adjusted EBIT. So we're happy about that.
Vince Morales: Yes. And if I could just add, I think part of the equation here, and Jeff, you've hit on this a couple of times in our prior conference calls as part of the equation is the fixed cost elimination that we've done on a multiyear stack. That's a significant contributor to our margin profile. We still have -- as you asked, I think, in the fourth quarter, we still have more restructuring activities to go, specifically this year and early next year. And the last thing I'd say on this is we are bringing these acquisitions, and they typically come in at below our company margin. So that will temper some of the average margin benefits until we're able to extract the synergies from these acquisitions.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with VRS. Your line is open.
Kevin McCarthy: Good morning. Michael, I was wondering if you might expand on some of the supply chain disruption issues that you're seeing from both an internal and an external perspective? In other words, on the internal side, what is it that PPG buys that is in short supply? And has it impacted your production rates? Then externally, we hear a lot about the semi chip shortages. Is that really the lion's share of the issue for PPG? Or are you seeing customers that are impacted in other industries as well?
Michael McGarry: So on the internal side, Kevin, I mean, proxies, VAM, butyl acrylate, MMA, specialty isocyanate, those are all challenged supply chains right now, and we're operating hand-to-mouth. There's some real minor nits and nats of chemicals you wouldn't really understand -- maybe I shouldn't use the word understand, but very small things that we need to make certain batches of paint, especially in our packaging business. So we are shuffling raw materials around between the plants to make sure everybody has everything they need. So, I would say that the primary issue is on our side, except for the automotive guys, they do have the chip shortages. The automotive guys also had plastic shortages. They had seat shortages. So they are really struggling right now. But we expect it to loosen up and get better. We do see every day, we're getting more emulsions every day. Epoxy is not great, but it's getting better. So we're anticipating that as we get raw materials, we'll be able to better service our customers. But the good news is we're pretty sure we're doing better than our competitors in many of these spaces, especially our smaller competitors, which they're struggling to get raw materials. So we're taking good care of our customers, and our suppliers are doing a good job of taking care of us.
Vince Morales: And I'll just add one comment. From our internal shortages, it's primarily in our architectural businesses. We do have some internal shortages that may affect Traffic Solutions. And we expect these to be transitory. They're baked into our guidance for Q2. But that's where we're seeing from a business perspective, the shortages.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Your line is open.
P.J. Juvekar: Yes. Hi. Good morning, Michael and Vince. In your chart on M&A, which was quite helpful, you showed that Tikkurila's multiple was at the high end of the historical range. Can you talk about Tikkurila exposure in Eastern Europe and Russia? And how do margins compare in those regions and returns compare in those regions to Western Europe? And what are the risks in Russia? And you already have operations there in industrial. Can you just talk about any risks in Russia with respect to FX and all that? Thank you.
Michael McGarry: Well, we're certainly -- we'll look at the FX much like any of our foreign currencies. We do have a fairly sizable presence in Russia right now. We're number-one in automotive. We're number-one in the premium refinish. We're number-one in packaging, number-one in aerospace. So we have a pretty sizable presence. We're used to doing business in Russia. Because we're still competitors, we can't talk about what their specific margins are until such time as we close. But what I would tell you is if you look at their overall margins, they're below our margins in Europe. So that's going to be an opportunity for us to bring those up to PPG levels. And we also think that in some of the countries, there's an opportunity to go beyond that because of the synergies with the warehousing, the raw materials. They're struggling right now with raw materials. And so I anticipate that we'll be able to improve their business pretty quickly once we close.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Arun Viswanathan: Thanks. Good morning. Congrats on the great results. Just wanted to get your thoughts on the margin. So obviously, some pretty strong performance. Is there a way you could kind of help us understand what portion of the upside came from, say, volume leverage versus some of the selling price increases versus to cost reductions in the quarter? And maybe looking ahead, if you expect those buckets to kind of remain similar? Or how we should kind of characterize that? Thanks.
Vince Morales: Yes. Arun, great to hear from you. Look, the majority of our benefit year-over-year and versus 2019 came from the volume leverage. We had 7% volume leverage. We've been talking for quite some time about all the costs we've taken out. So that had a significant, I said, 40-plus percent dropping to the bottom line. If you do the math just on that, you could see the remainder of the gap was modest. So again, we continue to have these volume recovery, especially in some of our key businesses like aerospace. We do expect consistent performance in subsequent quarters. Again, I would profess that our teams are doing very well in terms of discrete cost management. But we also have the structural cost management, the multiyear stack I talked about earlier that's going to provide us benefit here into the future, and we still have more of that to execute against.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Duffy Fisher with Barclays. Your line is open.
Duffy Fisher: Good morning, folks. If you go back and look 2013 through 2019, each first half versus second half was either 50% or 51% of your revenue for that year. This year, with that $70 million, $90 million hole you talked about in Q2, just kind of the rebound, it looks like second half should be meaningfully better than the first half maybe for the first time in that period. So can you kind of help us walk through, excluding the acquisitions, what might the second half look like with your view on things today versus the first half on a top line basis?
Michael McGarry: So Duffy, I would tell you that we're confident that our momentum is going to continue. So if you think about -- if you walk through some of the businesses, right, so automotive inventories are exceptionally low. I think Vince covered that in detail earlier on the call. So we're going to have a better second half than normal for automotive. Our industrial segment, so you think whether that's coil or heavy-duty equipment or any of these other segments in there, they continue to do very well as also. Packaging, we see no slowdown in the packaging momentum. In fact, if you look at the number of new packaging plants, 10 plants that come in, in the second half of the year, that should be all good as well. Again, I talked about it earlier, architectural, we've seen no slowdown in the DIY. And we do anticipate -- we don't -- we're not really seeing a lot of it yet, but we do anticipate the professional side will get better, certainly commercial and industrial. And that market is still quite light, but that should get better. Aerospace will get better. It's not a matter of if, it's just a matter of when. And then I'm kind of excited by the fact that I see a little bit of the big oil guys starting to spend some capital. So if they get serious about spending capital, our protective business will start to get better. So quite honestly, when I look at the various segments that we have, I think we should have a good back half of the year from a volume perspective.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jaideep Pandya with On Field Research. Your line is open.
Jaideep Pandya: Thank you. Just on aerospace, could you just tell us, so much of the fleet has been sort of grounded. So when this fleet goes back up flying, can you just explain us what do you expect in terms of a pickup in MRO because this probably has never happened for a long, long time that such so much percentage of fleet has been grounded. And then what do you expect in terms of recovery in 2022, 2023 with regards to sort of new build and on the military side? And then just sort of on a similar note, Protective & Marine on the infra bill in the U.S., what do you expect has an impact on the protective side. If you can just remind us what is PPG's exposure on the infra and how would that benefit the protective business? Thanks a lot.
Michael McGarry: Okay. I'll try to capture all these questions here. So let's do the easy one first. Military, we see no slowdown in the military side. That's, let's call it, 35% of our aerospace business. Our most important program is the F-35. The builds continue along. We're gaining more share. We have more share on the transparency. We have more share on the winglet transparencies. So we feel good about that. From the commercial side, to be quite honest, our visibility is quite limited because we've never had planes sit on the ground for a year. And so the MRO, how they were put into storage and how they come out of storage is still somewhat of an unknown. What checks they're going to do before they put them into storage is still somewhat of an unknown. So what we do see is that the MRO activity for our aerospace business is picking up. We are getting -- what's interesting is when they put -- when some of the planes are giving back to the lease source, they have to paint them white. So we have been getting some of those white paint sales. And of course, when they come back out of the lease source, they're going to be rebranded again, so they'll be repainted again. So as that happens, that will be a positive for us. Your question on infrastructure; I would tell you that we touch a lot of things in the infrastructure, whether that's the road markings that will be needed, whether that's the bridges that will need to be painted. If they support the building and trades industry, that will require protective coatings. So I would say for PPG, any infrastructure will be regarded as a positive.
Vince Morales: I'll just add some color on the aerospace. If you think about the drivers of volume, we expect it to return in waves. The first wave, I think Michael alluded to in his prepared remarks, which is the domestic flights. We're seeing that certainly in the U.S. We're seeing significant upticks still below pre-pandemic levels. But we care about takeoffs and landings. That's what drives the aftermarket. So the more takeoff and landings in the U.S. and in other countries, internal takeoff and landings is very important to us. The second wave we see is a return of business travel. And then the third wave, which we don't expect until later this year at the earliest, would be international travel. So we do feel there's a couple of opportunities for step-ups in the aerospace industry on the MRO side.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Laurence Alexander: Good morning. What's your expectation for labor cost inflation for this year? And how do you expect pressure to be building into next year? And secondly, in prior kind of inflationary environments, there was a lot of thrifting driven by a shift in the innovation cycle. What can you do this time? What are you seeing from the customers? And will that translate into share gains in 2022, 2023?
Michael McGarry: Well, let's talk about the labor piece first. Labor for PPG is not a huge piece of our business. What I would put into your model is traditional 2% to 3% kind of number. That's typical of what we're seeing. But our goal always is to offset that through productivity. Our manufacturing teams are always a challenge to drive additional productivity year-over-year. They have to come forward in their plan to offset that. So that would be the first thing I would think about from a productivity standpoint.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Your line is open.
Mike Harrison: Hi, good morning. Within the industrial business, if we look at that sequentially, sales were down $30 million, operating income was down more like $35 million. What caused that sequential decline in operating income? Is this discretionary costs that are coming back? Is this the impact of disruption? Maybe just some thoughts on how we should think about industrial margin trajectory over the rest of the year as demand recovers and you get some pricing against Ross? Thanks.
John Bruno: Yes. Mike, this is John. I would highlight two things. We saw the chip issue in the auto OEM side, still robust demand. But that was an impact on the top line. And then we saw raw material inflation sequentially. So that would be the other part that I would call out.
Vince Morales: Yes. And if I could just add just a tidbit there. We did see raw material inflation, and it was very rapid, obviously, following the weather events chronicled earlier. Typically, we don't see that much inflation mid-quarter. But we did see some items, especially around the oil side, spike up mid-quarter. So again, we started to put in pricing, as Michael alluded to earlier but we weren't able to offset that fully in Q1. I do want to go back to, Laurence, you wanted to ask two questions. We didn't get to the second one, which was thrifting. Right now, we're not seeing, in our architectural business anywhere in the world. any significant impacts from thrifting. We're really -- again, we're really light inventory. We think some of our customers are light inventory. So most of our customers as well as customers buying from us are selling what they have on the shelves. So we don't expect for that to be a big event in Q2 just because of product availability.
Operator: All right. There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Bruno, I'll turn the call back over to you.
John Bruno: Thank you, Jerome. And I'd like to thank everyone who participated on our call today and for your continued interest in PPG. If you have any further questions, please contact me in the Investor Relations department. This concludes our first quarter earnings call.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-01-22 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is Amy and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PPG Industries’ Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Bruno, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
John Bruno: Thank you, Amy and good morning, everyone. Once again, this is John Bruno, Director of Investor Relations. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG and welcome you to our fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial results conference call. Joining me on the call from PPG are Michael McGarry, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Vince Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our comments relate to the financial information released after U.S. equity markets closed on Thursday, January 21, 2021. We have posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on the Investor Center of our website, ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide additional support to the brief opening comments Michael will make shortly. Following management’s perspective on the company’s results for the quarter, we will move to a Q&A session. Both prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements, reflecting the company’s current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG’s operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG’s filings with the SEC. Now, let me introduce PPG Chairman and CEO, Michael McGarry.
Michael McGarry: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. I would like to welcome everyone to our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. Most importantly, I hope you and your loved ones are remaining safe and healthy. Now let me provide some comments to supplement the detailed financial results we released last evening. For the fourth quarter, our net sales were about $3.8 billion and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.59. Driven by strong year-over-year sales growth in our industrial coatings reporting segment, we delivered record adjusted earnings per diluted share for the second consecutive quarter, increasing by more than 20% from prior year. In addition, our global architectural coatings businesses continue to perform exceptionally well, eclipsing prior fourth quarter sales and earnings records in most countries. We also delivered the second consecutive quarter of double-digit organic growth for our European architectural business. Our global architectural sales were also supported by ongoing advancement of our digital capabilities. In 2020, our global digital sales in the architectural business were up by more than 60%, and we will continue to invest and prioritize in these digital initiatives. We coupled these organic growth improvements with strong cost management and delivered PPG aggregate segment margins that were about 160 basis points higher than the prior year fourth quarter. The higher margins were achieved with about 30% of our businesses continued to face significant demand headwinds, most notably the automotive refinish and aerospace coatings businesses as the pandemic continues to impact areas of travel and mobility. During the fourth quarter, sales in our China automotive OEM and general industrial businesses well outpaced industry demand with both businesses growing nearly 20% on a year-over-year basis. In auto OEM, we were significantly above industry production rates. Our strong footprint, advantaged technology, and service capabilities continued to serve us well in China where economic growth is the most robust. In addition, sales in our European and Latin American regions returned to year-over-year growth during the quarter. And in the U.S. region, while still lower than the prior year due to the aerospace coatings business, overall sales improved throughout the quarter. We delivered more cost savings during the quarter with about $40 million of interim cost savings. And we also delivered an additional $40 million of structural cost savings. Our interim cost savings were lower than the $90 million we achieved in the third quarter as we incurred certain cost to support the sales improvement in several of our end-use markets. We will maintain about $25 million of these interim cost savings in the first quarter and expect to make at least $80 million of permanent cost savings for the full year 2021. Our team has done an excellent job managing working capital and cash uses in 2020, which allowed us to achieve a record $2.1 billion of operating cash flow for the year. Our businesses reduced operating working capital as a percent of sales by about 100 basis points in 2020. This outstanding performance was one key factor in allowing us to fund the Ennis-Flint acquisition entirely with cash on hand during the month of December. In addition, to completing the Ennis-Flint acquisition, we recently announced some other strategic acquisitions. Each of these companies brings incremental benefits to PPG that will lead to further shareholder value creation. Looking ahead to the first quarter, there are few challenges including more restrictive shutdowns in certain countries and supply chain issues in certain end-use markets that will likely cause some short-term coatings demand disruptions. We’re also experiencing elevation of costs, particularly raw materials and logistics costs. While these issues create some uncertainties in the first quarter, we continue to be optimistic about the first half of 2021 as underlying coatings demand and economic activity in several of our end-use markets is expected to remain robust, including the automotive OEM, general industrial, packaging, and architectural businesses. We also remain confident of achieving further selling price increases in the first quarter in the Performance Coatings reporting segment and have started to pursue selling price increases in the Industrial Coatings reporting segment, which will be realized as the year progresses. For the company, aggregate sales volumes are projected to be flat to up a low-single-digit percentage in the first quarter with differences by business and region. As we progress through 2021, we anticipate multiple catalysts that will help drive further sales and earnings growth, including an eventual restocked benefit as low inventory levels remain in several of our end-use markets. Second, we are well positioned to benefit from the ultimate recovery in the automotive refinish and aerospace coatings end-use markets as congestion and air travel increases with our world-class product and customer service capabilities. In addition, our acquisitions will start to provide accretive benefit as the year progresses. These incremental benefits will supplement the organic growth that we anticipate in our other core businesses as we continue to support our customers with excellent services and technology-advantaged products. For the quarter, we project adjusted earnings per diluted share to increase by more than 20% on a year-over-year basis, continuing our strong earnings momentum. Our near-term cash deployment priority will be to complete the acquisitions we have announced, which we anticipate to be funded by a combination of cash on hand and debt by the end of the second quarter. We then intend to primarily use our free cash flow generation to pay down debt from these acquisitions and reposition our balance sheet for future industry consolidation. As it relates to our recently announced acquisition agreements, let me make a few comments about Tikkurila. From a strategic perspective, this remains an extremely complementary business to PPG. We don’t expect any significant anti-trust issues and are confident that we will be able to keep the entire business intact. And equally important, we will not need to disrupt PPG’s legacy businesses or our customers in the region. Keeping the Tikkurila team together as one unit is not only the best stakeholder outcome, but will ensure a fast start on synergy capture. From a strict acquisition integration execution perspective, we believe that our offer is compelling for all stakeholders and it has the benefit of the due diligence we’ve already conducted. We conducted the due diligence efficiently and worked closely and cooperatively with Tikkurila to resolve to the satisfaction of both parties some commercial issues that arose in the due diligence process. We believe that these commercial issues in addition to the regulatory landscape place PPG in the most favorable situation to acquire Tikkurila from a business continuity and return -- project return perspective. Additionally, we’re expecting substantial cost synergies supplemented by incremental sales synergies, which we were able to fully vet in the due diligence analysis. This includes the fact that our holistic European operations are well established and stable and will result in very little disruption from this transaction. We also have a very well established regional shared service center in Eastern Europe that has been in existence for many years and has integrated many of our prior acquisitions, which will enable us to more seamlessly and more quickly integrate an acquisition of this size. Finally, we will continue to analyze this with our traditional thoughtfulness and historical discipline. On a post-synergy basis, this remains an excellent value creation opportunity for our shareholders. Lastly, as we hear from our customers and investors consistently, there is zero doubt that our sustainability initiatives are far ahead of any coatings company as PPG technology is enabling the conversion from the internal combustion engine to electric and autonomous vehicles in addition to our many other initiatives. Due to where this transaction is from our process perspective, that is we are currently in an open tender offer period and Tikkurila’s Board has received a non-binding competing bid. We will not be able to answer any questions on this matter during the call. In closing, I want to thank and recognize our global PPG team. Our company’s true character has been showcased during these times of adversity. I am proud of how the PPG team has responded with great resiliency and continuing to serve our customers, our communities and one another and has truly lived the PPG way. Our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results are a true testament of our company’s capabilities and allow us to enter 2021 as an even stronger company. Thank you for your continued confidence in PPG. This concludes our prepared remarks. And Amy, would you please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Sison with Wells Fargo. Michael, your line is open.
Michael Sison: Hey guys, nice quarter. I guess maybe let's talk about the acquisitions in total, you've had a really good run here in terms of finding opportunities. What's sort of the synergy run rate, if all of them come together over the next 6 months?
Vince Morales: Yes Mike, this is Vince. Good morning. Hope you're doing well. We'll give some more information on these acquisitions as they close similar to what we do with Ennis-Flint. We got to get them through closing. We have to -- we will give you some annualized as well as specific 2021 numbers. All of them have a different seasonality profile. So again, it would be hard to give you a specific number as it relates to 2021. As I think it's well chronicled, most coatings acquisitions have kind of mid-single-digit synergies as a starting target. Some have more, some have less depending upon their overlap, geographic overlap, product overlap. So again, as we close them, be rest assured it will provide more detail individually per acquisition.
Michael Sison: Got it. And then maybe shifting to architectural coatings, when you -- can you maybe talk about some of the backlogs that your pro painters are seeing, and how big those are relative to what you've seen in the past? And maybe the potential momentum there and whether orange and brown is kind of the hot color that people are asking for these days?
Michael McGarry: Well, I'm not going to go into the orange and brown, Michael, but what I will tell you is we -- sub segment, our business here in the U.S is into maintenance, commercial, residential, DIY, et cetera. And if you look at that momentum by each of those segments, every one of them was significantly more positive in 4Q than 3Q. And each one of them are anticipating being more positive in 1Q versus 4Q. So from that standpoint, we're excited, obviously, permitting for new homes. Construction is not going quite as fast as they wanted challenges on the multifamily side as well. So most of our large painters are feeling very comfortable coming into 2021. And then when we flip over into Europe, without a doubt, we're still having very strong. You saw we had double-digit growth in the fourth quarter through the first 21 days of January. It's a continuation of that trend as well. And then when you flip down into Mexico, we had an exceptionally strong quarter. The economy in Mexico, GDP is minus 7% and 8%, and yet we performed at plus 10%. And we see that same momentum carrying into January, the sell out from our concessionaires is strong. Their liquidity is very good and so I'm very positive about what we're seeing in our global architectural business.
Michael Sison: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Ghansham, your line is open.
Ghansham Panjabi: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I guess, Michael, going back to your comments on pricing and industrial, you referenced some pricing initiatives there to offset higher costs. Looking at the slide deck, you're still expecting kind of stable selling prices for the industrial coatings segment. So just curious as to is there a lag associated with that? Is that what you're referencing? How should we think about that build as the year progresses? Thanks.
Michael McGarry: Well, Ghansham, as you know, historically, there's always a 3 to 6-month lag in pricing and raw materials, because we can't raise price until our customers can see it. And it's, as you know, more challenging on the industrial side than the performance side. And so, raw materials were higher, especially when you think about China, that's a much more spot kind of purchasing environment over there, because that's their tradition. So we saw we have already announced price increases in Europe. We've started to announce price increases in other regions in the world. We are well ahead of 2017. If you remember 2017, some of our peers were distracted because of either acquisitions or fears. And so, we were -- we are well ahead of that. And so, I'm very comfortable that you're going to continue to see price -- positive price. We've had 15 quarters in a row of positive price, you're going to see the 16th quarter of positive price for the company in Q1. And so, I'm not worried about the low-single-digit inflation that we're anticipating.
Ghansham Panjabi: Got it. And then in terms of the supply chain constraints you referenced, can you just give us more color on that dynamic? Which businesses in particular do you see being impacted, the timeline to normalize? I know the world is choppy at this point. But just curious on your thoughts. Thanks so much.
Michael McGarry: Yes, the two biggest businesses, Ghansham, that are impacted right now are automotive and industrial. We finished with backlogs in those businesses by the end of the December. We're still running backlogs in those businesses. Demand is very strong, but it is very choppy. A number of our customers are having significant issues with labor because of the COVID pandemic. In fact, we got an emergency call a couple days ago from one of our large automotive customers that their whole paint shop was shutdown because of COVID and could we bring our people in to run it in the interim. So, we, of course, supported them on that. There's the semiconductor issue that's out there in the automotive space, they all want to run. So many of our customers ran over Christmas, which was quite unusual. So demand is there and inventories in many of these spaces are quite low. Whether you're thinking about appliances or coil or automotive, there's low inventories. So we feel very comfortable. But unfortunately, we can't predict with labor when people are going to be having full labor contingent to be able to run their plants. 
Ghansham Panjabi: Okay. Thank you very much. Stay well.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Frank, your line is open.
Frank Mitsch: Yes, good morning, and congratulations on the Penguin helmets. That's pretty cool. Looking forward to seeing the game one of these days hopefully in person. We'll see. I wanted to follow-up on the performance coatings margins. Got a bunch of questions regarding this, the very large sequential decline that you saw from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. Typically, you do see a decline with your businesses in the fourth quarter. But this seems to be a bit abnormal. I was wondering if you could take a moment or two and talk through the details there.
Vince Morales: Yes, Frank, this is Vince. It really relates to the weightings of the businesses that are in there. The two most impacted businesses, as Michael referenced in the opening comments that we're seeing from a volume perspective are aerospace and refinish. Those are typically our most stable businesses throughout the year quarter-to-quarter. Their demand trends don't significantly change by quarter. The other businesses and performance coatings such as architecture are very seasonal. So while we were down 30% in aerospace in Q3, and a similar amount in Q4, same with refinish, they're waiting in queue -- traditional Q4 is much higher. So, in 2019, it would have been much higher, 2018 would have been much higher as a percent of the total segment. So even though we had good architectural demand and sales in Q4, the fact that that weighting of aerospace and refinish is a heavier Q4 had a bigger impact on the Q4 margins.
Frank Mitsch: Got you. Thank you. And I understand you cannot talk about Tikkurila. But if for whatever reason that transaction doesn't occur, can you talk about your M&A pipeline? Obviously, you've been very active in the recent past. Should investors expect that there might be other sort of transactions or would share buybacks come back into the fore [ph]?
Michael McGarry: Well, Frank, I think you've heard me say this in the fourth quarter back in October, I'll say the same thing now, it’s January. I'll be exceptionally disappointed if we buy back any shares in 2021. Our acquisition pipeline remains robust and remains active and we continue to work in this area. And so I'm feeling confident that we will have further announcements in the back half of the year.
Frank Mitsch: Very helpful. Thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman. Bob, your line is open.
Bob Koort: Thank you very much. [Technical difficulty] responses and price hikes. Wondering if you could tell me what difference it makes, if any, to the demand environment relative to maybe '17, which is quite weaker. Is that going to make it quicker, easier and maybe some sense there?
Michael McGarry: Yes. Well, I think it certainly make it easier. I don't know about quicker. The benefit we have right now in these industrial businesses is that customers are backlogged. They're asking for products. They're calling on a daily basis, wondering where their orders are in the queue. So that's one thing. The second thing is they are so desperate for technical help. The last thing they're going to be doing is asking for any price downs, and so they fully recognize that this is a different environment. And so, our salespeople are never happy when we are pushing them out there, tell them they got to go get bright. But in this case, they have a lot more ammunition to go get price. And I feel comfortable that the industry sees the same thing that we're seeing.
Bob Koort: Can I ask you on the refinish market? We get occasional questions from our investors wondering about the secular threat of driver assistance versus the growing car park and introducing new drivers that might bang up vehicles. How do you see that playing out over the next several years?
Michael McGarry: Well, Bob, I would first start with the fact that the car park continues to grow. It grows marginally in the U.S and Europe, but it grows in Eastern Europe, it grows in China. I mean, think about 25 million new cars every year in China and the slow scrappage rate right now in China. Same thing in Eastern -- excuse me, Southeast Asia and India. So the car park is continuing to grow. And as you know, any kind of autonomous, a lot of these safety features, they're mostly in the developed countries, those things are too expensive to put on cars, and a lot of these other countries. So we don't have to worry about that as much. The other thing I would tell you is that in the fourth quarter, we -- every time we saw, the economy loosen up and work-from-home restrictions loosen, we saw especially in Europe, congestion come up rather quickly, because as you know, the houses are much smaller in Europe than people, it's much more difficult to work-from-home there. So congestion rebounded very quickly. Our refinish in the fourth quarter was minus, let's call it minus 10-ish, but claims were down minus 20. So we've made some significant improvements in that business because of the pandemic. And so I think you should feel -- your clients should feel comfortable that we have this well in hand.
Bob Koort: Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. P.J., your line is open.
P.J. Juvekar: Yes. Hi, good morning.
Michael McGarry: Good morning, P.J.
P.J. Juvekar: Michael, what was behind the strength in architectural coatings, especially in Europe, when I think organic sales were up in low teens? Is that driven by DIY? And does DIY face tougher comps in 2021 starting in second quarter?
Michael McGarry: Well, there is certainly some significant DIY improvement in Europe. But there was also a significant return to our professional network as well. And we have a very strong position as you know in Europe. Number one in a lot of countries, and so we've benefited from that strength. And the improvement in DIY, I think, is sustainable. There's a whole lot of new DIY-ers that weren't there, 2 and 3 and 5 years ago. So I think this is a start of something that's good. And the comps do get tougher, but I would say the comps in Europe do not get tougher until the third and fourth quarter. So the second quarter, as you know, had very significant lockdowns in Europe. And so, Q1, Q2 will still have very positive numbers going into the back half of the year.
Vince Morales: And P.J., for Europe, specifically, the professional painters, Michael alluded to, doesn't have as much commercial exposure as they do in the U.S. So they are working on residential and some repaint activities. We're seeing the same in the U.S., but there's a commercial downdraft that weakens the comparables, Europe versus the U.S.
P.J. Juvekar: That's really helpful. And then secondly, Ennis-Flint, that seems like an interesting acquisition in traffic paints. I think, Michael, you said that autonomous cars need good road markings. And as a result, traffic pain could be a growth industry. Ennis-Flint has, I think, revenues of $600 million. How fast can these sales grow, your traffic solutions business can grow going forward. Thank you.
Vince Morales: Yes. Thanks for asking the question P.J. I'll let Michael answer the growth question. But, again, let's frame Ennis-Flint. I think $600 million in annual sales is a good target. It is a very seasonal business, as you can imagine. It's predominantly U.S., Canada. So, we are -- we do serve parts of the U.S that have certainly a winter effect. So we typically see the majority of profitability in Q2 and Q3, given the seasonal nature -- the nature of the business. And Michael, maybe you can.
Michael McGarry: Yes. P.J, what I would tell you is, the two secular trends that we're paying close attention to is one, the -- some of the states are looking to make the stripes wider. So from foreign stripes, a 6-inch stripe. And the other thing they're doing is they're reducing the distance between the stripes. So that's one. Plus, the other thing that's interesting to this is that they have a number of pre-formed products. And I think, in thermoplastic products as well, and I think with our network, we're going to be able to help them get better distribution of that products. So we're excited about this. But I would anticipate this is not going to be a straight up kind of growth. It's going to be a continuation of a continuous growth [technical difficulty].
P.J. Juvekar: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Favre with Exane. Laurent, your line is open.
Laurent Favre: Yes. Good morning. I was -- that's -- I've got another question on Ennis, on the international expansion. I was just wondering if you could frame for us, what you have in lines. Are we talking about significant cost increase to try and become a, I guess, material competitor outside of the U.S and Canada?
Michael McGarry: Well, it definitely will not be a material cost increases. You may have heard making traffic paying is not as sophisticated making our industrial paints. And as you know, in Mexico and Europe, we have a number of plants. So it will not be a cost issue. It will be a focus and distribution issue, making sure we get ourselves aligned with the winners in the contracting space that consistently win government bids and municipality bids and things like that. So that's where our focus will be. So Mexico will be a start because of our strong base with our PPG-Comex. Team. And then we'll look at it on a country-by-country basis in Europe, and do it in a very methodical and disciplined manner.
Laurent Favre: Thank you. And then Michael, I think in the slides you talked about ESG benefits for all four acquisitions? Could you give us a few examples?
Michael McGarry: Yes, I'm happy to and John can chime in as well. So, if you think about the first one, Ennis-Flint, this is going to help the autonomous driving help the mobility. So as I mentioned in my opening remarks, PPG is far ahead of everybody in this space. So that would be the first one. The second one would be VersaFlex. I would tell you that with VersaFlex, the polyurea technology, if you think about flooring systems, food plants, what you want to do is ensure the cleanest environments that you can and reduce the potential for illnesses in those environments. And that's another ESG benefit. Worwag, I would say the number one thing with Worwag is they have some really nifty technology in the area of automotive parts water-based. And so as you know, we've been trying to push the industry to move much faster away from solvent to water. That's one plus. We anticipate with a full suite of products, we'll get more people switching to powder, which as you know, it has 100% transfer efficiency. And then I think our remarks on Tikkurila are quite clear. Not only will we bring our technology to that space to continue to drive more bio base, more sustainable raw materials, but also will be more water-based solutions, especially when I think about what they have in Russia and other Eastern European countries.
Laurent Favre: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David, your line is open.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Michael, just on the Q1 guidance, typically Q1 is about 15% above Q4. I think this year guidance was down about 6% to 9%. What are the key drivers for that divergence from historical patterns?
Vince Morales: Yes, David. This is Vince. Hope you are doing well. I think the typical seasonality due to the pandemic is very hard to match prior years. We had a strong push from -- activity from Q3 into Q4. As Mike alluded to architectural had a high -- higher seasonal sales in Q4 than we would traditionally see in Q1. We do see some concern about availability of customer production lines. So we do feel some of the activity will flip from Q1 into Q2. Just to give you a point of reference, David, you typically see about a million car drop off in global auto production from Q4 to Q1. We're expecting 2 million cars globally, excluding Japan, 2 million cars globally drop off from Q4 to Q1. And that same type of pattern exists in some industrial businesses. So I think it's difficult from a seasonality perspective to compare historically due to just shifting around associated with the pandemic.
David Begleiter: Got it? And the same -- kind of same question, just looking at performance coating volumes, I do have an easy comp. It was down 6% last year. I think you’re still guiding it to be down year-over-year. Why would it not be at least flat or even up year-over-year from performance coating volumes?
Vince Morales: Yes, the first quarter last year didn't have had virtually no impact from aerospace, in terms of volume decline, and refinish was fairly strong until the tail end of March. And those two businesses, as Michael said, in the opening commentary, are heavily impacted in Q4, and we expect consistent patterns in Q1. So those two businesses are big businesses and that [technical difficulty].
Operator: [Technical difficulty] comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Jeff, your line is open.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. You're not providing financial guidance for 2021. But there’s -- surely there must be internal targets for management compensation. Can you give us an idea of what performance objectives there are for the company? And what targets you have in order for people to reach those goals?
Vince Morales: Yes, Jeff, this is Vince, again. We have the traditional targets established that we would in any given year for management compensation, and also salesperson compensation. Obviously, 2020 was very fluid. 2021, we think will be very fluid. Similar to every other company, our comp committee or Board will look at the fluidness and react accordingly based on their judgment. But we do certainly have internal targets established today for 2021.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay. Propylene settled up $0.12 a pound yesterday. Was that something that was included in your vision of raw materials, or raw material inflation for this year? Or was it larger or smaller than your expectation?
Vince Morales: You said propylene, right?
Jeff Zekauskas: Yes, I did. Propylene.
Michael McGarry: Yes. So, obviously, we don't buy propylene itself. We buy propylene derivatives, and the way the propylene derivatives work it's also driven by supply and demand of the underlying derivative plus the raw material input. So that would not hit us right away. So that would be the first comment. The second comment is, we have anticipated raw material inflation into 2021. So we were readjusting in a lot of our formula and buying strategies in 2020 to anticipate higher increases and try to position ourselves that minimize the impact of those kind of fluctuations.
Vince Morales: Yes, Jeff, I'll add that we are seeing this low single-digit inflation coming into the year. Some of our suppliers are dealing with some of the same issues that our customers are, which we feel some of that's transitory they're having workforce restraint due to the pandemic. So we think as the year progresses, some of these limiting items will fall by the wayside. We know there's good supply out there in most of these markets. And as Michael just alluded to the supply-demand characteristics of our supplier base, at some point will be the predominant factor of pricing.
Jeff Zekauskas: So you don't think you're going to be squeezed this year? Is that the conclusion that we should draw?
Vince Morales: We think low single-digit is -- low single-digit inflation is our forecast for Q1 and likely Q2.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay, great. Thank you so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Chris, your line is open.
Chris Parkinson: Thank you very much. We do saw job managing costs throughout the pandemic, but it's only one they're just -- even on this mid Q&A, there just appears to be this balancing act between improving volumes, your ongoing cost programs, price costs and even mix on an intersegment basis. Can you just discuss your own thought processes on the margin framework, not only in '21, but into kind of '22. And how investors should be weighing each of these variables? Is it basically just control the controllable on your cost programs and price, or is there any -- are there any other things you could do to continue your progression? Thank you.
Michael McGarry: Yes, Chris, this is Michael. I would tell you that the PPG weigh as we do better today than yesterday, every day. And that's how we are managing our -- that's historically been a continuous improvement mentality that we have for the company. And so that's why we said in the first quarter, we would still have cost initiatives, even though volumes continuing to go up. We are holding our teams accountable continue to drive productivity. We know that there is going to be continued cost savings from a, let's call it, travel. That will be one. How we manage internally. Technical services that we are providing to some of our customers, we are going to be providing that electronically. We have more digital initiatives. So I think there is -- when I think about long-term, I think it's going to be less expensive for us to make paint long-term than it is today. And we have more productivity initiatives underway.
Chris Parkinson: Got it. And then you mentioned a few times in your prepared remarks just the potential for a robust restock, which could be a solid tailwind in '21. Can you just quickly comment on what you're currently hearing from your various customer channels? And perhaps, also comment on just expected timing. Thank you very much.
Michael McGarry: Yes. The two biggest ones that we will have to restock; the first one is refinish. So they're all running with an exceptionally low inventories. They don't want to get caught with work-from-home and extended work-from-home period where they can't move product. So that's the first one. But more importantly, aerospace. We see our orders dropping. I mean, I won't get into the various sub-segments how much we break it down into sub-segments, but I had one in the fourth quarter that we only got 6% of our normal orders in the fourth quarter. Now clearly the industry is running much higher than that. So continue to destock at a significant rate. That's going to have to build up. So we're thinking about how do we ensure that we're ready for that restock that will be coming in aerospace and that will be significant. And I'm thinking that people are going to start doing that probably starting in the back half of Q2 and then it will start to accelerate. You probably saw the announcement from Airbus today that they’re increasing their build rate for the A320. That's the first sign. And there will be other signs I think you should anticipate because obviously we're talking to our customers, so we have information that they haven't made public, but that's the first one.
Vince Morales: Yes, Chris, and if you go over to the Industrial segment, we know the car inventories in the U.S. are at very low levels relative to historic terms. Many of our industrial customers were running hand to mouth with backlogs to their customers. And if you look at our balance sheet as a microcosm, our inventory levels are very low and we do have certain stock outs just because we can't get product in certain places. Again, all pandemic-related. So we do expect there to be a restock across a variety of industries as we progress through 2021. That was another example. Most of our customers had a very strong year last year in 2020, as did we. But again, it depleted inventory that would traditionally be on the shelf.
Michael McGarry: And maybe to put that in perspective, Chris, we ran our stain plant in December. I can never remember in my history of us running a stain plant in December.
Chris Parkinson: Great color as always. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. John, your line is open.
John Roberts: Thank you. China began shutting down in February of last year. So you start to see some benefit here in the first quarter and then your comps get pretty easy as we go into the second and third. If I look at the 2-year comp instead, and if I look back to your first quarter of '19, it looks like you're relatively flat in the first quarter versus 2 years ago even with the acquisitions. Is that kind of the right way to think about that still on a 2-year basis, China is going to be okay on a 2-year basis, but a lot of markets are still down that's there. And so you're going to be -- maybe in the first half you're going to be kind of flattish on a 2-year basis?
Vince Morales: You're talking China only, John, or are you talking total PPG?
John Roberts: No, for the total PPG. So total PPG first quarter of [multiple speakers] …
Vince Morales: Yes. Total PPG -- for total PPG on a 2-year comp basis, sales volumes will be down low to mid-single digits still with the guide we gave. Now there is other positives such as acquisition, currency is favorable. As Michael alluded to, we had 15 straight quarters of pricing, but sales volumes on a 2-year stacked basis will be down low to mid-single digits.
John Roberts: Okay. And then you talked about propylene. Maybe a little bit more granularity on the overall raw material inflation. Ethylene derivatives like VAM, urethanes TiO2, they're all different value chains that's there and many of them are not propylene-linked?
Michael McGarry: Yes. I mean, we break down our procurement into about 10 different categories. And in 4Q, I would say that the vast majority of them were slightly negative or flat. When we look at 1Q, we are going to see probably half of them have marginally higher, so inflation. But we are not seeing some significant step up that we are not prepared for. So sequentially, isocyanates are up, epoxies are up, packaging is up, of course solvents are all up. But we are not nervous about this, I guess is what I'm trying to tell you because we anticipated this going into the year and we tried to have our procurement strategy in a manner that we would be able to take advantage of what we had in 2020 and try to carry that forward into 2021.
John Roberts: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent, your line is open.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you and good morning, everyone. If I could just ask on the auto production, there may be some other customer areas where there could be some issues in the first quarter. Vince, I think I heard you say that on the auto side you'll see some autos get shifted into 2Q. Are you anticipating that the shortfall in 1Q would be made up entirely in 2Q or to be spread further out into the balance of the year? And is it something that can be fully made up in the calendar year?
Michael McGarry: Vincent, this is Michael. I would say the biggest unknown in that is what have the auto guys decided to do with their own dealers. As you know, dealer inventory is very low. Dealers are happy right now because you come into an auto facility and you don't have a lot of choice and you have to buy what's on the lot. They're making money on new cars, which is historically something they don't do. So I think the great unknown is due to car companies starting back half of 2Q and 3Q, do they try to rebuild inventories back to the old levels on the dealer lots or do they keep doing what they're doing now. So I think that's a big unknown. So we are anticipating catching up. But there is still more latency there if they decide to go back to the old inventory levels they used to have.
Vince Morales: The one constant, Vincent, is there is demand out there. There is very strong demand in the U.S., a good demand in Europe. The China numbers I think came out today and car sales are up over 20% for January year-to-date. So we know there's good end market demand out there for automotive.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you. That's very helpful. And just maybe on China aerospace, you noted that it's back to -- or I guess, flights are back to 90%. So when you look at -- if we take that business as sort of a case study of how the rest of the world aerospace might come back, are you seeing anything different in customer behavior as the aerospace recovers in China? Are they buying more, are they buying less? Pushing anything out, plan anything forward? And anything that’s interesting that might help us sort of frame how the U.S. and Europe and so forth will come back?
Michael McGarry: Yes, Vincent, what I would tell you, the first thing to remember it's a two-stage recovery. So domestic flights are up 90%, but international flights are down 85%. So they're not flying outside of China. So -- and they're really limiting anybody flying in. So that's the biggest challenge right now. So I'd say the number one factor to look for in the recovery is the vaccine distribution and people opening up their borders. So I would pay real close attention to those. Right now their demand on domestic side, they are buying product and they are happy and their inventory levels are, I would call, normal.
Vince Morales: And Vincent, if you could just expand out some of the other metrics we watch. We do see online inquiries for airline travel, online inquiries for airline travel are up significantly versus a very depressed level. In Q3 and Q4 they were up. They continue to trend upwards. We did see around the holiday periods, both in the U.S. and Europe, sizable step change in travel, whether that was wise or not is debatable. But we do know there is demand out there for folks who want to travel, and we are welcoming obviously the positive impact from a vaccination.
Vincent Andrews: Thanks very much, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Arun, your line is open.
Arun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks. Good morning. I guess, I just wanted to get to the margin question again. In Industrial, obviously, you've had some nice progress here, even in a challenging market. Do you feel like you're fully caught up from prior inflation as well? And do you expect further percent margin growth as we go through '21 and you realize some of these price increases that you've put up there? And maybe you can also comment on performance as it relates to your percent margin trajectory? Thanks.
Michael McGarry: I would say that my answer to that, as always, we have never caught up. We always have a higher expectation in that area. And so we have more work to do. The good news is, demand is strong and people can see raw materials are coming up. So we should be able to get ahead of the curve on this one. As far as performance, we -- as you know, we’ve already announced price increases in architectural, we’ve announced price increases in refinish and we have advantaged technologies in aerospace so that whenever demand comes back, it will be a positive for us. So I think we are feeling pretty good in this area.
Vince Morales: Yes, Arun, let me just add. I think as you've heard us talk throughout all of 2020, due to our discretionary cost management and due to our structural cost improvements that we've made the past several years, we expected very strong leverage on any volume improvement. I think that you witnessed that in Q4 in the Industrial segment. Volumes were up mid-single digits and you saw the impact it had on the bottom line. So as this volume -- as the pandemic volume recovery occurs throughout, we hope the balance of 2021, you should expect very strong leverage in both segments.
Arun Viswanathan: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe you can just provide either kind of a returns profile for the acquisitions in general. Is that kind of like a mid-teens ROIC? And maybe that's why you don't necessarily think share buyback would be of the same ROIC or what’s kind of the calculus into not necessarily pursuing share buyback and pursuing M&A a little bit more aggressively?
Vince Morales: If you look and I think we’ve put something out a couple of years ago with regards to our acquisition record and the returns around that, I think we had a dozen or so recent examples. I think it was May of 2019 we put that or 2018. What you'll find is the return on capital for not only PPG, but the coatings industry. And the IRR for these transactions is typically well in excess of our cost of capital and certainly in excess of a share repurchase. And it's really driven by the fact that these are typically very highly synergistic transactions. A lot of those synergies come with no cash out the door on behalf of the buyer. So you get a very good return. And these are typically low risk because we're typically not acquiring a lot of assets. As you're well aware, Arun, the coatings industry is asset-light. So we're typically acquiring very few assets with a lot of synergy potential. And we at PPG have been very good at extracting those synergies very early. And we've done 50 or 60 acquisitions the past 10 years. And those acquisition timelines are typically less than 24 months. We are able to extract all of those synergies, again very, very -- with very few cash out the door. So those dynamics typically lend themselves to a higher return profile in our space, in the coating space, for acquisitions versus share repo.
Arun Viswanathan: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Group. Kevin, your line is now open.
Kevin McCarthy: Yes. Good morning, everyone. My question relates to architectural DIY coatings. How would you compare your outlook for 2021 in the U.S. versus Europe? Maybe you can talk through what you are hearing from some of your channel partners in general. Things like, inventory levels, seasonal effects and whether or not you can grow the business directionally versus more challenging comparisons this coming year?
Michael McGarry: Well, Kevin, I would say that DIY in the U.S. will continue to grow. What I'm most excited about is the fact that we have a new generation of DIY-ers that we didn't have. We always kind of bemoan that in the past because people our age seem to let their kids get by without painting every summer. So now they are out there painting their own homes as they work-from-home. So that's a positive. The housing stock will continue to grow. That will be a positive. So I think that's all-important trends that you should be paying attention to in Europe. I think we went through a long period of time where there wasn't as much repair and remodel inside homes that historically has happened in the U.S. that now that people were at home and looking at those same four walls all the time has manifested itself in some very significant numbers. So I think this is going to last longer than a lot of people think. Obviously, we will wait and see. But I know Q1, Q2 will all be positive comps. And let's wait and see how we trend into Q3, Q4, but I think long-term, these are positive trends for the DIY industry.
Vince Morales: Yes, Kevin, I'll add one positive trend. In the U.S., the de-urbanization that's taking place moving from smaller square footage into a single-family home, typically favors repaint, residential paint, repaint and typically favors a more robust painting cycle with more velocity.
Kevin McCarthy: Okay. That’s helpful. And then I wanted to ask about auto OEM. Michael, in your prepared remarks, I think you've pointed out you're growing significantly above industry production rates and your heat map shows above average in Asia and EMEA. Can you elaborate on what is driving that? And how much is related to say share shifts versus some of the dislocations? You mentioned around SMEs labor and low inventory levels.
Michael McGarry: Well, the first one that we have is better technology. So we are winning -- so if you look at our new wins year-over-year, our net new wins, that has been a very positive number for us. The second one has been because of the pandemic, now the value of our tech service team is being paid out in space. I mean, people are just saying, wow, this is really important, I need you guys in here. And so we are getting that discretionary piece of business. And the third one is, we are very, very early stages, but we are starting to see the mobility wins start to pick up. And that’s long-term where I think we are going to divorce ourselves when the build rates is -- because we are going to continue to win in this space.
Vince Morales: Just one other I'll add as well, Kevin. If you look at some of our acquisitions in the past couple of years, we did the Hemmelrath acquisition, we've got Worwag acquisition pending. We've solidified many of these customer relationships on ancillary products as well. So that’s been our strategy to expand our technical breadth with customers. The value-add to those customers. And as Michael mentioned, that’s coming through in spades especially in times like this where they need velocity through their plants.
Kevin McCarthy: Perfect. Thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Mike, your line is open.
Mike Harrison: Hi. Good morning. Wanted to ask about the M&A activity. If you've got four deals brewing, and it sounds like you have some additional deals maybe in the pipeline for the rest of the year, at what point do you start to get a little bit concerned about your ability to integrate several acquisitions at once? How do you think about that?
Michael McGarry: Mike, let me just tell you that about 2 or 3 years ago, we had six going at once, and it was not even a blip on the radar. We have done 50 acquisitions in the last 10 years. We have so many people in PPG that clamor to be the integration director. It's a highly prized job in the company. We have a well-worn playbook, dog-eared pages left and right, and this is something we do. And if you think about what we’ve going on right now with these acquisitions, PMC is a VersaFlex, you got Tikkurila will be in architectural, you have Worwag, which will be in automotive. I mean, so they're in different businesses. So I'm not worried about -- Ennis-Flint is a completely new business. So for us, this is not a challenge yet. So, I'm very comfortable in this space.
Vince Morales: Yes. Mike, that is a great question. It's something we know at some point could be a governor of what we do. But given the diversity of these acquisitions, we are not at all challenged at this point with bandwidth.
Mike Harrison: All right. And then on the auto OEM side, you've referred a couple of times the semiconductor shortage issue. And I don't think that you've specifically given some details or some thoughts on whether you think that’s going to be a significant headwind or whether it's a lot of headline risk right now rather than really impacting production rates. Can you give some thoughts on that please?
Vince Morales: Yes, Mike, I think this issue is well-known in the industry, not only in automotive, but several industrial markets. Anything that requires a chip, like refrigerators, washing machines and it's intermittent now. There is production lines that are up and down based on availability. It's too hard for us being passive to that supply base to understand the depths or when it may resolve itself. We know it's extremely tight. We do see customers taking down lines, one or two or three days just because they don't have availability. There is reportedly more supply coming or more ability to supply come, but we don't know how prolong this will be. It's not -- it's still in the single digits in terms of its impact on most of these markets, single-digit percentages that can grow or shrink. But at this point, it's a developing story.
Michael McGarry: Mike, what I would add to that is, they're missing chips on Thursday, Friday and they get them on Saturday, they're running Saturday, Sunday. They're making up any day that they can. So they're running hand to mouth is basically what it is.
Mike Harrison: All right. That's helpful color. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jaideep Pandya with On Field Research. Jaideep, your line is open.
Jaideep Pandya: Thanks. First question is on acquisitions topic. I guess, you guys have been doing a lot of acquisitions in the last few years. Now this company from Europe apparently also wants to stop buybacks and do some acquisitions or they are planning to at least. So, do you feel that in the next sort of coming quarters and years, as more coatings companies are looking for inorganic growth, the multiple of -- the average multiple in the industry is going to sort of eek up, and therefore, return profile on the acquisition pipeline may actually go down or do you think this is on a case-by-case basis, and therefore, it doesn't concern you? And then the second question really is around your Performance Coatings business. From my point of you, it was a phenomenal year 2020 given arrow and refinish was down that you guys almost ended year flat. So just curious, has structural profitability in DIY Europe, U.S. and Mexico improved and you can keep it there or was it a bit inflated because of these interim cost savings that you had, and therefore, shouldn't get carried away? Thanks.
Michael McGarry: Well, let me first start with the -- I think you might have exceeded our two-question limit. The returns in acquisitions are really unique to that acquisition. And who you compete with is really unique in that space as well. So there is no right or wrong answer. You know the general theme is that for -- the higher the risk, the higher the return needs to be. And so -- and the more unknowns, the higher the returns need to be to cover that. So I would say it's just varies considerably and there is no right or wrong answer except we know that discipline is always the right answer. From a performance standpoint, I do think we have lower structural costs going forward. And I do think, like Vince mentioned earlier, the ability to this additional volume when it comes in really leverages itself to a nice return on the bottom line, and I think that's going to continue.
Vince Morales: Yes. I think, Jaideep, as we've talked over …
Jaideep Pandya: Thanks a lot.
Vince Morales: … as we talked over the years, the coatings models are variable cost model. So even though volumes are down, we are able to ratchet down a variety of cost factors, that's been proven once again in 2020, especially in Q2 and Q3. So we could ratchet down variable cost. And then we’ve maintained some of that, as Michael alluded to in the opening comments, carrying into 2021 that we hope to make permanent.
Jaideep Pandya: Great. Thanks a lot, and good luck on Tikkurila.
Operator: Gentlemen, your final question comes from the line of Daniel Rizzo with Jefferies. Daniel, your line is open.
Daniel Rizzo: Hi, guys. I'm on for Laurence. Just a couple of quick ones. You mentioned all the M&A opportunities, I was just wondering if there is an upper limit on the leverage you are willing to go to make these acquisitions?
Vince Morales: Yes, I think our history has been well chronicled here as well, Dan. Look, we want to be a strong investment-grade company. There are times where we lever up to do a transaction or set of transactions. Our intention would be, as Michael said in the opening comments, to immediately ratchet that back down to poise ourselves for the next acquisition. Given the different sizes and natures of these deals, it's hard to pinpoint a specific number, but again, strong investment grade is where we like to live.
Daniel Rizzo: Okay. And then quickly, you mentioned that some of your customers were running over Christmas, which was obviously unusual. I was wondering if that's possible you might see the same thing in China for the Chinese New Year where just, I mean, those trends might continue in the last year the pause you usually see around this time of the year in that region?
Michael McGarry: We will let John Bruno answer that because he spent four years in China. So, John, what's your view?
John Bruno: Dan, I fully expect them to take their holidays.
Daniel Rizzo: Okay. Thank you very much.
John Bruno: You are welcome.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Bruno, I turn the call back over to you. End of Q&A
John Bruno: Thank you, Amy. I would like to thank everyone for their time and interest in PPG. If you have any further questions, please contact our IR department. This concludes our fourth quarter earnings call. Have a good day.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-10-20 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is Michelle and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PPG Industries’ Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Bruno, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
John Bruno: Thank you, Michelle and good morning everyone. Once again, this is John Bruno. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG and welcome you to our third quarter 2020 financial results conference call. Joining me on the call from PPG are Michael McGarry, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Vince Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our comments relate to the financial information released after U.S. equity markets closed on Monday, October 19, 2020. We have posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on the Investor Center of our website, ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide additional support to the brief opening comments Michael will make shortly. Following management’s perspective on the company’s results for the quarter, we will move to a Q&A session. Both prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements, reflecting the company’s current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG’s operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG’s filings with the SEC. Now, let me introduce PPG Chairman and CEO, Michael McGarry.
Michael McGarry: Thank you, John and good morning everyone. I would like to welcome everyone to our third quarter 2020 earnings call. Most importantly, I hope you and your loved ones are remaining safe and healthy. Throughout the pandemic, we have focused on our purpose of protecting and beautifying the world. First and foremost, this is meant to protect our employees, our communities and our customers. This remains our highest priority. Now, let me provide some comments to supplement the detailed third quarter of 2020 financial results we released last evening. For the third quarter, our net sales were about $3.7 billion and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were a record $1.93. Our strong operating results were led by improved sales volumes when compared sequentially versus our second quarter results. The global architectural coatings business performed exceptionally well led by double-digit organic growth in our European business. In addition, our global positioning and advanced product technologies drove significant improvement in quarter-over-quarter sales volumes in our automotive OEM and industrial coatings businesses. We coupled these sales volumes improvements with strong cost management and delivered segment margins that were about 300 basis points higher than the prior year third quarter or more than 18% in aggregate. This clearly demonstrates the strong operating leverage we have on incremental volumes and attribute to the structural cost savings we have achieved in the past 2 years. The higher margins were achieved with about 30% of our businesses still facing significant demand headwinds, most notably in the automotive refinish and aerospace coatings businesses. During the third quarter, our sales recovery continue to robustly advance in China, where volumes grew a low-teen percentage compared to the prior year third quarter. This was driven by above market performance in several of our businesses, including automotive OEM, general industrial coatings, automotive refinish and protective coatings. While year-over-year demand was still lower in other major global regions, it was vastly improved compared to the second quarter of 2020. Specifically on our cost management, we delivered about $90 million of interim cost savings, a little more than $35 million of structural cost savings. We are working diligently to ensure that a portion of the interim cost savings will be made permanent. By going through our annual profit plan process, we will have more details on the additional catalysts in January when we report our full-year 2020 results. Our teams have also done an excellent job managing working capital and cash uses during the pandemic. Through September 30, we have reduced our working capital as a percent of sales by about 150 basis points on a year-over-year comparison. Coupled with the strong operating results of our third quarter, we generated more than $800 million of operating cash flow, higher than what we achieved in the third quarter of 2019. Looking ahead, we expect economic activity to continue to recover with differences across end use markets and geographic regions. For the company, aggregate sales volumes are projected to be down a low to mid single-digit percentage in the fourth quarter with differences by business and region. We do anticipate normal seasonal trend sequentially versus the third quarter, which doesn’t result in lower absolute sales for several of our businesses that have been delivering some of the highest growth. We expect our aggregate global architectural business to remain more resilient and once again deliver higher year-over-year organic sales in the fourth quarter. Although we anticipate continued softness in the U.S. commercial maintenance segment, and for the do-it-yourself demand to begin to moderate somewhat from the elevated levels, we’re continuing to invest in our digital capabilities and expect more activity to be digitalized in the coming quarters. The most recent demand increases experienced in the global automotive OEM and general industrial coatings businesses are expected to continue, including the impact from very low customer-facing product inventory levels in its end use markets. We continue to manage through heightened level of uncertainty with the ongoing pandemic still impacting several of our key end use markets and other geopolitical matters. The more challenged sectors, including automotive refinish and aerospace coatings, will provide further margin expansion opportunities once demand begins to improve. We project adjusted earnings per diluted share to be about 10% higher than the adjusted earnings per diluted share realized in the fourth quarter of 2019, excluding the lower effective tax rate we expect in this fourth quarter’s projected results. Our liquidity position remains strong and we are evaluating earnings accretive cash deployment alternatives, most notably bolt-on acquisitions. Our teams around the world have been providing the essential products and services that our customers rely on for their businesses. As we continue to manage through the pandemic, remain committed to partnering with our customers to create mutual value. Finally, I want to thank our global team, as one PPG, we are effectively managing through this prolonged and extremely challenging time and clearly winning in several of our key end use markets. Our third quarter results are further testimony to my confidence that we will emerge as an even stronger company. Thank you for your continued confidence in PPG. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, Michelle, would you please open the line for questions?
Operator: Yes. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Tom Glinski: Good morning. This is Tom Glinski on for Bob. So first question, just how would you frame the low end of your 4Q ‘20 EPS range? Does this take in another round of lockdowns and then how do you get to the top end of your range? Thank you.
Michael McGarry: Well, I would tell you that we are not assuming any significant lockdowns. We are watching it closely. Clearly, the one area that is most important to us would be France as our architectural business there is number one and it’s one of our largest businesses in Europe. But I would tell you that right now we have a pretty balanced view of that.
Tom Glinski: Got it. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, how are you thinking about the price in raws formula going into next year? I know you’re calling for a sequential increase in raw material costs, but how long do you expect raws to remain – moderated on a year-over-year basis? And then secondly on the price side, on the second quarter 2019 call, you called out that you hadn’t yet caught up on the most recent round of raw material inflation from 2016 to 2018. So, could this help buffer your pricing power, especially on the industrial side going into next year? Thank you.
Michael McGarry: Well, we have had multiple quarters of 2% plus price increases. We anticipate continuing to be successful in raising price on performance coating side. We expect price to be relatively flat in our industrial side, although with all the new products that we are rolling out, they will come with improved margins. So, I think you will need to be paying attention to that. Raw materials sequentially will be modestly higher, you have to look a little bit at oil, you have to look a little bit of propylene you have the force majeures that come through the hurricanes. So we are paying attention to all that. Right now, we are anticipating just moderate, very slight moderate sequential inflation on raw materials.
Tom Glinski: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question will come from John McNulty, BMO. Your line is open.
John McNulty: Yes, thanks for taking my question. Congratulations. So, I guess can you give us a little bit of color around the temporary cost cuts versus the restructuring ones and in particular how to think about the cadence of each one flowing through 4Q and into 2021?
Michael McGarry: Well, John, I would say some of the temporary cost cuts that we are going to make permanent are think about travel and expense. We are learning how to deal with that on a regular basis. So, that’s internal and external costs. Think about digital experiences, so we are trying to convert more things digitally, so that over time will continue to drive more structural cost savings. When you think about the restructuring cost savings, those are more people related as we get more productivity initiatives completed and we have closed a few plants that will turn into permanent cost savings as well. So, I feel good about the pace that we are doing, I think we are meeting or exceeding all our internal targets in that respect, John.
Vince Morales: And John, I think we gave out in our guidance $30 million to $35 million of structural or restructuring-related cost improvements in Q4, so that sizes that element for you.
John McNulty: Got it. That’s helpful. And then, I guess, just as a follow-up question. So your cash flows are coming in pretty solidly and normally as you get kind of into the back half of the year, at least historically if the M&A hasn’t really caught on we tend to see more buybacks and we didn’t really see that this time around. So, I guess, I’m curious, is that a reflection of just what you see as a chunkier kind of M&A pipeline at this point and maybe if you can give a little bit of color as to the types of things that you might be looking at?
Michael McGarry: Yes, John, we’re obviously not going to get into what we are looking at. But the act – we have a very active pipeline. You probably saw somebody make an announcement in Europe, that’s a sign of things loosening up. I anticipate there’ll be further announcements in the fourth quarter and obviously more in the first quarter, second quarter. So, we’re anticipating that the pipeline because of its activity that we are going to continue to look for that to be in our number one priority, just like it always has been.
Vince Morales: Maybe just John one comment, I think it’s important given our global breadth, our participation in all the end markets, we typically have at least similar, if not more synergies in most of our competitors as we look at these deals. So, going forward with the pipeline, Michael talked about robust pipeline, hopefully, we can participate assuming these are at the right price for our shareholders.
John McNulty: Got it. Thanks very much for the color guys.
Operator: And your next question will come from Ghansham Panjabi from Baird. Your line is open.
Ghansham Panjabi: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Michael McGarry: Good morning.
Ghansham Panjabi: So, Michael, on the 30% of the portfolio that you referenced that includes commercial aerospace, auto refinish, etcetera, how did the volumes sort of shakeout in 3Q in aggregate for that 30%, how do you see that rebound building off of 3Q levels going forward? And then on the other 70%, should we anticipate moderation in volumes for any sub-segments as we cycle into 2021?
Michael McGarry: Well, I think we gave pretty clear guidance that aerospace is down 35% and I anticipate a similar kind of number in 4Q. But what’s happening in aerospace right now is they are destocking as fast as they can. So, assuming they get to a new level at say the end of the year, what you should have is a double catalyst going forward, not only as improving demand, but also restocking back to more appropriate levels. So, what I see right now from talking to a number of people is, COVID fatigue, right. So, people – I anticipate people are going to be traveling at the holidays. And so on the back half of the quarter we are going to start to see our MRO activity starting to pick up. Now, they may not buy anything in the fourth quarter but I anticipate that they will re-look at their inventory levels and they re-look at how they are thinking about that in first half of next year. So, I’m not as pessimistic as some of the folks are out there on aerospace, you get a vaccine, I think there is a pent-up demand. We had the highest TSA flow-through of people last week and I anticipate a gradual recovery until there is a vaccine. Now, refinish, I think what you saw, our China business is doing very well, better than prior. So, people are back in the office, and people are working. We saw the same thing in Europe as people start to return to the office, the congestion level starting to get back. Right now, they’re blooming again with COVID, so we anticipate and we have factored into our guidance a slight amount of moderation in our refinish volumes. But then as we get a better handle on this, we anticipate refinish volumes will continue, plus we have a very good light industrial coatings business within refinish, we have our SEM acquisition in there. So, we are benefiting by our good mix within refinish. So I anticipate a gradual recovery of that all of 2021.
Ghansham Panjabi: Okay. And then a second question, at the onset of the pandemic, you were very focused along with others on maximizing free cash flow and I think you made the comment that you are going to work through finished good inventory, etcetera. Can you just update us more broadly in terms of that dynamic? Where you are in your inventory levels at PPG specifically? And then as you rebuild inventory, is that part of the reason that you have seen the sort of ferocious operating leverage in 3Q? Just kind of trying to get a sense as to how sustainable that is? Thanks.
Vince Morales: Yes, yes. Ghansham, actually our inventory is down year-over-year, it’s one of our reasons for strong operating cash flow. It’s actually working against us on the cost side, we’re not running our factories as hard as our demand – our current demand would indicate. We hope to hold that inventory discipline through – certainly the balance of this year and in the next year. So we’re not intending to rebuild our inventories. If you look more broadly, inventories, most of our coated products through our customers all the way to the consumer, are very lean inventories in the automotive – auto OEM business is very lean, appliance is very lean, electronics very lean. As Mike alluded to, we think an aerospace it’s getting leaned out. So, we do feel there is an opportunity if we do see a spike in or some spike in demand for, not only the demand to improve, but also inventory levels to have that second catalysts.
Ghansham Panjabi: Thanks so much, Vince.
Vince Morales: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Roberts from UBS. Your line is open.
John Roberts: Thank you and nice bounce back in earnings. Wall Street Journal had a story this morning on the need for more fire protection in lithium-ion battery-powered cars. It was disappointing that it didn’t mentioned PPG coatings. But is it a problem that car companies might not want to discuss fire protection, including your coatings since that just highlights the risk that it’s something that car buyers don’t want to think about?
Michael McGarry: Well, John, the way I think about this is, every car companies that make can electric batteries are come and add it in a slightly different fashion. And every company has a different solution. The good news is, in a lot of batteries, we are part of the passive fire protection system that helps them eliminate that. So, I would tell you, the opportunities going forward are going to just be really good. I think I shared with you in a prior call, and so for the broader group, China is trying to come out with a standard. So far PPG is the only one that has passed that standard, which is to allow the vehicle occupant five minutes to exit the vehicle in the event of a fire. So, I’m feeling very good about that. We have great technology. We’ve already solved this problem in other company. So we feel confident we can solve it again. Clearly, we would love to see a government mandated fire safety hazard standard, if you will, and we think we can certainly participate in that. But we have so many opportunities in batteries right now and electric vehicles that we’re super excited about it. Every hardly a week goes by that we don’t have a win in that space, somewhere, whether it’s in Europe, U.S. or Asia and we are really – I think we are doing an excellent job there.
John Roberts: And then MoonWalk seems to be getting some good traction. Do the economics to PPG change with MoonWalk adoption or is it just a share gain?
Michael McGarry: Well, it’s both, right? So, we have a subscription model out there on MoonWalk. So we are going to – think about software-as-a-service, so we’re going to be collecting revenue on MoonWalk as you go. We’ve – I would say, about 25% of all MoonWalks that have been installed have been share gained. And the only thing that’s holding us back to is making them. We’re making these things in Southern Europe, and that’s where it was hardest hit by the pandemic. We’re getting over that right now. But there is a lot more opportunities – the people that have them, we have nearly 500 of them installed in Europe are exceptionally pleased with the performance and the ability to drive better productivity in their body shops, and that’s what this is all about is improving the productivity, as well as allowing their painters to spend more time painting. So, those are the two big wins and our team has done an excellent job highlighting both benefits.
John Roberts: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Your line is open.
Frank Mitsch: Good morning, gentlemen. Nice job on the quarter. I guess, things are going better in Pittsburgh in more ways than one.
Michael McGarry: Thanks, Frank.
Frank Mitsch: Michael, if I could follow-up on that MoonWalk given the fact that you are gaining share, I just thought it was interesting in the color heat map that you provide that European auto refinish, your volumes year-over-year were a little bit lower than they were in the second quarter and you indicated that you’re only gaining – you were only growing at market. I would have thought that that would start showing up that you would be growing faster than market. When can we anticipate that we will be flipping that heat map indicator to above market?
Michael McGarry: Well, Frank, as you know, on a quarter-to-quarter basis it’s really hard to justify a market gain. And so, we tend to be conservative in that area. Maybe we should be a little bit more aggressive trumping our wins. But I would tell you from what we have seen we are doing very well there. I do see our results as being very good. Now, obviously, I have a better feel for that after all the company’s report. In the next 10 days, and I’ll be able to give you a little bit more – a better feeling for that. But I feel very comfortable that we’re doing better than average in Europe and especially from a profitability standpoint, our team has done an excellent job. Our ICR acquisition over there, we could have clearly tick that as above market through the acquisition, but that’s not how we do that. But that’s allowed us to get mid-tier and some value opportunities. We’ve expanded that out of Southern Europe off to the Eastern Europe. And we feel very confident that we’re going to continue to grow share in refinish in Europe.
Frank Mitsch: Alright. That’s very helpful. And, I guess, the – kind of the biggest eye opener that I saw in the quarter was the industrial coatings margins. Can you talk about the sustainability of that, how much of it may have been driven by these – by the $90 million of temporary cost savings? So just give us a flavor for where you see that heading down the line?
Michael McGarry: Well, the biggest thing about the industrial segment margins was really the recovery of the volume and our productivity and our paint plants. The productivity has been outstanding. The team has done an excellent job when things were super light in the second quarter they got a lot of people together to think about how can we do different tasks more efficiently. And so, they have been able to drive that productivity throughout the paint plants and that’s been the number one thing. So, any further recovery in automotive is just going to lead to more enhanced profit to the bottom line. So, I would tell you, that part is where I am feeling most comfortable going forward and it’s all being driven by our Lean Six Sigma initiatives.
Frank Mitsch: Thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Sison from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Michael Sison: Hey, guys. Nice quarter. Lucky win on Sunday. But just a quick question on…
Michael McGarry: So we just barely covered the spread, Mike.
Michael Sison: Barely, but nice win. But in terms of sales trends, it looks like September look flattish and you are guiding for down in the fourth quarter. Is October trending down? And just curious why the sales trend couldn’t have been a little bit better, given September looks pretty decent.
Michael McGarry: Well, I would tell you, Mike, we were minus 5% for the quarter and we guided minus 5 to low-single-digit. So, I don’t regard that as trending negatively. I would regard that as trending positively. When I look at our October results to date and obviously, we don’t have a profit number, all we have is a volume number, we are well within our guidance. So, I feel confident that we are going to be at or above where we are in the guidance. So, I am not concerned about that and I would not characterize it the way you did.
Vince Morales: Mike, a couple of anomalies with August, September, Labor Day fell early last year. So, for the architectural businesses we actually had some Labor Day paint spill into August in the 2019 year. Most of that was in September in 2020. Hurricane Laura in Southeast part of the U.S. hit late in August. There were certainly some conservatism around inventory build and some inability to get to some projects. We did have a strong European holiday season that we saw some snapback in September. So I would call those anomalies month-to-month, but it all worked out in the quarter. So the quarter we think was a more representative number for 2020.
Michael Sison: Great. And then if you think about your EPS growth in the third quarter double digits, fourth quarter looks like double digits again. How do you think EPS growth looks when your volumes actually turn positive? Should it be stronger or just some of the interim cost come back and just kind of get a feel for how earnings go should be when volumes look turn up?
Vince Morales: Yes. Again, we are still guiding to negative volumes in Q4. We haven’t given 2021 guidance, little too early to do that, Mike. But I think Michael’s last comment was, we are still expecting very strong incrementals for the foreseeable future on any volume growth. We are holding costs in check. Our operations are running very well. And again, we expect price and raws to be neutralized at a minimum. So, again, we are still expecting very good incrementals. We can’t tell the volume trajectory in the first part of next year. It’s too early.
Michael McGarry: Yes. Mike, the other thing I would add to that is, don’t forget, two of our best businesses, refinish and aerospace, are the ones that are going to be the tailwind, no pun intended, the tailwinds going forward. When their volumes recover, that will be very positive for our margins.
Michael Sison: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Chris Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Chris Parkinson: Great. Thank you very much. So, can you just break down your current offsetting the ‘21 on the U.S. and EMEA architectural businesses? I mean, there are a lot of trends that we are monitoring, resi versus commercial, interior/exterior paint on trade versus DIY. Just what are the biggest trends in the context of reverse urbanization that your team is monitoring? Thank you.
Michael McGarry: Well, I would tell you that in Europe you are not going to have the reverse urbanization that you have here in the U.S., right? They don’t build million – 1.4 million houses in Europe like they do here. But I would tell you, there – they tend to maintain their homes in a better shape than the U.S. does. So, during the pandemic, they have been – when the stores have been open they have been very aggressive in maintaining their properties. And I think we are anticipating that that trend for the next few quarters is going to continue. This has been a market – Europe that has been slight to minus volume on for the last several years. So this uptick does not surprise us in the least. The big concern in the U.S., of course, is the new construction for buildings, once these buildings are completed, there doesn’t to be – appear to be a lot in the pipeline for new ones coming up. So that’s the bigger issue for us.
Chris Parkinson: Okay. Thank you. And you have done a solid job at a minimum holding price and industrial and then you were up low-single digits in the performance, which I think is overall pleasant surprise. But given volumes in most of the industrial markets, there is still a bit sluggish, albeit recovering. How should we think about your ability to raise price in the current environment? And we see some positive moves in mix in terms of like EVs. But are there any other new product launches we should be considering to drive uplift? Thank you.
Michael McGarry: Well, obviously, mobility will come with some attractive margins going forward. Anytime we launched a new product, we are always trying to capture some of the share 50-50 or so with the customers on the value creation, so that will be an opportunity going forward. Overall, right now, our customers are most focused on ensuring their plants are running. And so, our tech service teams are in high demand. So, if you look at automotive, we outperformed the market in three of the four regions. And the reason for that is, our tech service people are so highly valued, they wanted to make sure they captured our tech service people to help them start up and now to keep them running and because run – uptime is so highly critical, we have a number of projects that our customers have asked us to look at where they are trying to drive more productivity in their paint shops. So, I would tell you, right now, their primary focus is on uptime and new products and that’s where they are going forward.
Chris Parkinson: Thank you.
Vince Morales: We do expect positive price in Q4, for the company in aggregate, certainly, positive price in 2021. For the company in aggregate, both segments are exploring targeted pricing as we get to negotiations toward the 2021 calendar year. So, again, these opportunities to price in service, in technology based both of our operating segments.
Chris Parkinson: That’s very helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research. Your line is open.
Kevin McCarthy: Good morning. I wanted to come back to the auto refinish business. My question relates to some of the differences in trends by region. In the U.S., I think you indicated collision claims were down 20% or so and EMEA I think you said your sales were down mid-single digits. I was wondering if you could kind of talk through that disparity, is it wider than you would have expected 3 months or 6 months ago. And how do you think those trends progress over the next few quarters?
Michael McGarry: No. Kevin, I would tell you that the trend lines are pretty consistent with what we expected. Think about the U.S., work-from-home, you – a lot of people have big homes and it’s easy for people to work-from-home. In Europe, the homes are much smaller. I would say, people were claustrophobic. They wanted to get back to the office. And so, they move back to the office as the first opportunity they could. Here in the U.S., there tends to be more conservatism. I mean, it’s somewhat amazing, there’s 100 million people going to work every single day in the U.S., but there is not a lot of people going downtown to various cities to go to work because they are able to work from home. And so, gasoline sales were only down like 5% or 6%. So people are out there driving, but we don’t have that congestion that we normally have as to rush hour. So, you get a vaccine and that will be a catalyst for more people getting back into the office. Clearly, some companies have people back in the office, other companies don’t. It’s really pretty disparate how people are approaching this. But you have got hire speeds in the U.S., so totals are up 2%. So right now, what we see is a lot of traffic in the suburbs and not as much traffic downtown areas. But I know our refinish team has done a really good job of driving share gain and that’s what we are focused on right now.
Vince Morales: Kevin, the one other thing we are seeing in Europe is, there is less utilization of public transportation, that’s been historically more utilized in Europe versus here. So there is still a fear factor of folks getting on public transportation. So, the driving trend there – even if there’s not as many people going to work as they were in the past, more people are driving as opposed to taking public transport. We are seeing the same effect in China as well. And again, our China, we finished volumes were up. We think largely due to that effect.
Kevin McCarthy: That’s helpful color. And then second for Vince, I wanted to ask about your tax rate with regard to the 18% to 20% range in the fourth quarter, I think you mentioned some discrete items in the prepared remarks. My question is, is there any component that is perhaps more sustainable? Just thinking about how you might expect the rate to trend into 2021?
Vince Morales: So, couple of items we are looking at for Q4 and we hope to achieve through tax planning, Kevin, I wouldn’t call those structural at this point. And we are certainly interested to see what happens here with the U.S. elections to determine what our tax rate will be next year. So, we will give some more guidance in January. But the items that were referred to for Q4 for tax planning and we hope to achieve those in the quarter. And not carry forward items.
Kevin McCarthy: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: And your next question will come from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning. Michael just on your heat map, U.S. architectural, you highlighted that trade was below market. I know you had some weather issues in that segment. Anything else you can highlight as to why you were below market in that business in September – in the September quarter?
Michael McGarry: Yes. I would say, David, our two biggest markets are Texas and Florida, and given the hurricanes, we underperformed because we couldn’t keep our stores open or we had limited ability to do that. And, of course, we are a little bit over index on maintenance, think about the hospitality industry, things like that, so that hurts us a little bit when you consider where we are in res repaint – we are under index on res repaint and res repaint obviously doing better, people are much more comfortable. We are doing very well in exterior we are over index in exterior, so we are winning there. We did outperform. We don’t break up in the U.S. and Canada. We did outperform in Canada. So we gained share in Canada and we gained share in some minor markets like Puerto Rico. But I would say, overall, net-net, we felt like we were slightly below market.
David Begleiter: And just going back to these temporary interim cost savings, Michael, should we think about those as a headwind to 2021 earnings, we are thinking about a bridge between 2020 and 2021 or how should we think about those as a temporary cost savings year-over-year?
Vince Morales: Hey, David, this is Vince. Again, we are not having those costs back unless we see at least ratable volume. So I wouldn’t assume those are a headwind going into 2021.
John Bruno: David, this is John. Just to add on that. We had $80 million less of those temporary cost savings in Q3 versus Q2 and our margins were significantly higher. So, I think we will be able to manage it effectively.
David Begleiter: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Your line is open.
P.J. Juvekar: Yes, good morning.
Michael McGarry: Good morning, P.J.
P.J. Juvekar: Michael, do you expect the DIY business to slow down as the weather turns cooler? Or is it – there is still pent up demand from the loss business in the summer months? And can you also talk about the interior versus exterior paint trends?
Michael McGarry: Yes. So, clearly, exterior/interior is a easy one, you can’t paint in bad weather. You can’t paint when it’s really cold. So, at some point that is going to slow down, but we have not seen through the first, whatever it is today, 20 days of October, any change in the demand pattern. So interior is picking up, people are more comfortable with having contractors in their home. DIY remains solid and steady and that’s across the board. So, I look at that number in China, I look at it in Australia, I look at it in Europe. And, of course, you saw our numbers in Mexico, our Mexican team is clearly winning share, we were up mid-single digits in an economy that down minus 8% or 9%. So, in Latin America, we are doing Central America, Brazil. So, I would tell you overall, I don’t see any change yet. We are anticipating that it will slow down at some point. We don’t think it’s sustainable at this rate forever. But right now our fourth quarter we are anticipating a continuation of what we see so far.
P.J. Juvekar: Great. Thank you. And a question for, Vince, Vince, can you take a minute and talk about your digital strategy and what does it mean? Is it mostly customer-facing platforms or is it digitization of entire PPG, including HR, MROs supply chains, can you just – what – where are you exactly investing and what kind of platforms?
Vince Morales: Yes. P.J., I would tell you the most exciting platform for us is our customer-facing platforms, where we are really trying to take the customer experience to fulfillment and digitize that process. We have talked many times with investors about, we are not going into – starting in the middle of a supply chain, we are starting with the customer decision, that’s what we think there is the biggest pain point. We have seen in other retail industries those – in the end digital platforms starting with the customer most effective over a longer period of time as opposed to trying to optimize somewhere middle of the supply chain. So that’s where our biggest investments are. We are able to – again because of our global breadth, we are able to take this investment and not only use it in the U.S., Canada, but Europe, Australia, Latin America, South America, Mexico, so we are able to get a bigger – we hope a bigger breadth of business activity on digital simply due to our geographic cost spread.
P.J. Juvekar: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Laurent Favre. Your line is open.
Laurent Favre: Hi, yes. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. The first one is on the EV side. I think in the slide pack you released last month you talked about the value at least of 2x to 4x per EV. I was just wondering if you could perhaps tell us your line of sight on this for the next couple of years on new product launches. Is the $100 plus value-add pleased actually foreseeable for those new product launches or is it an aspiration for the longer term?
Vince Morales: Yes. Michael – I will let Michael answer the question, Laurent, but just a baseload for everybody on the call. So, we did provide a little bit of foretelling of what we see coming from a coatings perspective in the EV, electric vehicle market. We do believe, at some point in time, there will be 2x to 4x the coatings content on our traditional EV versus the gas combustion engine. And so, that’s the background that we are going to make sure everybody has. And the timing of that, Michael, is the question.
Michael McGarry: Yes. So, Laurent, we are clearly seeing wins on like I had mentioned early on a weekly basis. You know, China has said that 25% of their cars by 2025 will be EV. You have seen Europe make an aspirational target at the same 25%. And then, of course, you saw California’s announcement. So, everybody is working feverishly in this space. I would tell you, we have initiatives with every single company out there. We are the number one guy in automotive OEM. We are also very strong on automotive parts. We are very strong in protective and marine. So, we are the people that can bring all this together, and we are selling gas fillers right now. So we are on that. We have a number of electric battery trials going on as well, adhesives and sealant. So, we have a very broad product offering. And as people try to come forward with solutions, our team has come forward with a solutions-based approach that minimizes the number of people they have to deal with. And I think that’s also exciting to the car companies because they would be inundated with all these new ideas and what they want is to be able to get to market faster, and our teams help them get to market faster.
Vince Morales: In terms of adoption, Laurent, we are trying to have a target to get this by so much percent of their new fleet by 2025. Europe, as you are probably fully aware, different targets by country, we are seeing an uptick this year in EV sales. So, really the adoption of – by the consumer is what’s going to drive the additional sales in the EV market by PPG.
Laurent Favre: Thank you. And maybe as a follow-up for Vince, in the last call, with Q2, you talked about how some of the temporary savings that were binary and they were either in or out. I was wondering if, in the number you disclosed last night, now all those binary cost back in, so to speak.
Vince Morales: Okay. We are bringing those in by region, by business as volume comes back. And so, for those costs that are binary of that nature they have come back in Q3. To John’s point earlier, they have come back when we had margins – when we have volumes come back. So, still very margin accretive, even though we brought back some of those cost from Q2 to Q3.
Laurent Favre: Sure. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question will come from Jim Sheehan from Truist Securities. Your line is open.
Jim Sheehan: Good morning. Thank you. You raised the CapEx guidance for 2020 due to some additional projects being initiated. Can you talk about what types of coating end markets these projects are focused on?
Michael McGarry: Yes. I will take that one, Jim. When you think about what we slowed down in the second quarter, it was mostly in our industrial space, so automotive and industrial coatings. That is no longer the case, obviously, with the automotive guys back, we are ramping all those cost back up. More importantly what I will tell you what we did not slow down is, we did not slow down any investments in China. We did not slow down any investments in electric vehicles, and we did not slow down any investments in our packaging business that we knew would be doing exceptionally well. So, from that standpoint, we feel very comfortable that our run rate is coming out of the fourth quarter – third and fourth quarter will be very similar to what we had last year.
Jim Sheehan: Great. And in auto OEM you talked about outperforming auto builds and your technical service teams. Is that a feature really of the rapid ramp-up that’s happening in 2020 or do you see that as sustainable into 2021? And also, if you could relate that to your pricing discussions, if you are critical to the customer, do you expect to get more pricing leverage as we get into next year?
Michael McGarry: Well, I think the way to think about that, Jim, is that, when we have discussions on price there are a lot less aggressive on asking for things if they need us in the paint shop. And right now they need us and want us in the paint shop. So that makes it a much more forward-facing discussion, instead of a what’s the raw material environment. And so, they are looking for value creation as well and they’re looking for productivity and they are looking for new product ideas. And so, when you can have those kind of discussions that’s way more productive than what I would call, how do you split the pie.
Jim Sheehan: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question will come from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. If there were a large infrastructure bill passed next year, would that make an appreciable difference to PPG’s domestic volumes?
Michael McGarry: Well, I do think there will be an infrastructure bill passed from our standpoint. I think it will come either shortly after the election or Jan 1st – early January. It will be a positive for us, but you have to remember those things take a while. They use the term shovel ready, but nothing is really shovel ready because the environmental due diligence have to do want some of these projects. So it will be a net positive for us. But I would tell you, it might not be noticeable in the first few months that after the bill is passed.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay. And can you describe how much your incentive compensation is likely to change this year versus 2019? And of the $90 million in interim spending cuts, how does that split between SG&A and cost of goods sold?
Michael McGarry: I will let Vince take the back half.
Jeff Zekauskas: Sure.
Vince Morales: Yes. If you look, Jeff, the biggest change in our incentive comp really is around TSR, our total shareholder return, on our stock price. It’s going to be up probably high-single-digit millions, really reflective of the higher stock price this year than last year. In terms of the $90 million split, two-thirds of that would be in our SG&A bucket and one-third would be in cost of goods sold. Those are round numbers, of course.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay, good. Thank you so much.
Operator: And your next question will come from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Arun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, I was just curious on the margins. Usually you have anywhere from a 100 basis points to 250 basis points sequential decline in margins, Q3 to Q4. This year, it looks like your guidance implies something maybe in the 200 basis point to 300 basis point sequential deterioration in margins. Obviously, Q3 was very strong, aided by probably continued robust production and a lot of the cost actions you described. Could you just, I guess, frame your thought on margins in Q4? Do you think that you have kind of now maybe entered a structurally higher level of margins that we should see that persist kind of through the next couple of years? And again, it seems to me that may be the typical deterioration is too much at this time and maybe there is chance that margins would be better in Q4. Maybe what are some of the headwinds that you are seeing on that side?
Vince Morales: Yes. I think a couple there is a lot of moving pieces. Obviously, this year from quarter-to-quarter, so looking back at historical trends, provide some guidance, but I wouldn’t say it provides a viable to how we look at things. What we are seeing in the industrial segment, Q3 to Q4 is much less seasonality. The automakers are not going to – we don’t think the automakers are going to go down as much around the holidays as they did in Q4 prior year. On the other side of the coin, one of our best, as Michael alluded in his opening comments some of our best performing businesses have higher level of seasonality. So, in aggregate for the company, they are going to be more impactful. So, the architectural businesses have been performing well. They typically would have seasonality in Q4. We think there are any off traditional seasonality. So it is again an aggregate for the company, that has a bit of a unfavorable impact on the quarter-to-quarter comments you are talking about, so, just a lot of moving pieces. I don’t think there’s anything abnormal in those, Arun.
Arun Viswanathan: Okay. Thanks, Vince. And then, I guess just on the portfolio in general, you do have relatively low leverage. I know that there is still a lot of uncertainty out there, but – and I imagine that the pipeline, is it mainly still more tilted towards bolt-ons? And what is it going to take maybe to get a larger opportunity on the M&A side? Do you see any of those kind of coming to fruition in the next little while?
Michael McGarry: Well, for the bigger ones it takes a meeting of the minds to make that happen. So, I would say, we cannot predict those. So, I would just say sit tight. So the vast majority of the things we are looking at in the portfolio are bolt-ons. But there are some pretty meaningful bolt-ons that are out there, the pandemic, again, has illustrated to people this is twice in the past 12 years that there has been a meaningful downturn in the economy. And people are looking at, okay, what is the best way for them to manage their private wealth and maybe owning a coatings company where their ability to flex is not as robust as ours is. So, if you think about how quickly this is two times in a row, we have had record earnings of second quarter coming out of the downturn in the economy, and a lot of these private companies that are not able to do that. So, I would tell you, they are looking at that as an opportunity maybe to put some of the earnings from the – selling their business into their pocket in diversifying.
Arun Viswanathan: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I just wanted to follow-up on OEM auto. On the last – on the second quarter call, Michael, you mentioned that some of the outgrowth coming from the tech service, you expect that to normalize in future quarters. And just from sort of the some of the conversation, on this call, it sounds like maybe you are thinking that is going to be a little bit stickier. And I am just wondering, is that the case. And I know you are finding ways to make that market share growth feel a bit more structural?
Michael McGarry: Well, I do think it is going to continue to grow. We have turned our tech service teams into high business. And so, we’re charging for tech service where in many cases we usually give it away for free. And people in the beginning were kind of like Missouri, the Show-Me state, but during the start-ups, they could see the value creation that our tech service teams were allows them to get up faster, run more consistently and think about the – right now, a lot of these folks are running weekends and things like that, so they’re having some unusual period of times where controlling the environment in the paint shop when it’s running more frequently is hypercritical. And I would tell you, right now, they have been willing to pay for those services and we are pleased to provide them. So, I think there is going to be more stickiness on that going forward.
Vincent Andrews: Okay, great. As a follow-up, I just want to ask on the architectural side of the equation, may be more into the retailers rather than your own stores. Clearly, the do-it-yourself trends can’t say at this pace forever, but I am just wondering if things decelerate, it seems like customer inventory levels are probably not that high. So, do we still need to have a pretty big build up into the next spring season in order to just to manage sort of a regular season? I’m just trying to bridge sort of the downturn and take away versus what you have to actually ship into the customer.
Michael McGarry: Well, I would say, clearly inventory levels that our customers are below what our customers would normally have. But I am not going to try to predict how they are going to think about inventories in Q1. So, I will just tell you that inventories are low and we’ll wait to see how they decide to manage them next year.
Vincent Andrews: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question will come from Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Your line is open.
Duffy Fischer: Yes. Good morning. Just after you released last night I was talking with our aerospace guy and he thought your volumes were much stronger than what he was going to see from the average input provider into aerospace. He was thinking things would be down kind of 50%, 55%. So, can you comment on, are your – the business you’re in, is it doing better than the average input supplier into aerospace? Or is there a chance that maybe customers are building a little bit of inventory of your product and we will see a double-dip there where that will come in a little bit closer to what peers are doing later down the line?
Michael McGarry: Yes. Duffy, I don’t see a double-dip. I see – I know a very specific customers that have clearly taken inventories down. And we are on a number of winning platforms. So as those winning platforms continue to rollout, that helps our volumes. But overall, I would tell you, we’re anticipating being down 35% in the next quarter as well in aerospace. And then from that point on, I think it’s going to start to trend up. So, we have a good mix in our business. Obviously, military is helping. Military has been a space where, not only are we strong there, but our business with the F-35 is getting bigger and bigger every year because we are winning more content on that plane. So, it’s not just the build rate for the F-35, it’s also the additional content that we’re winning. So, I think that’s really important for people to understand.
Vince Morales: And Duffy, if you look at our mix of business, we’re about 30% military, 70% conventional aerospace.
Duffy Fischer: Okay. And then I’ll take another cut at this because it’s been the biggest incoming question I have gotten since you guys put out your pre-announcement to people have kind of backed into margins. But if you look at Q3, last 10 years, your margins kind of bounced around between 16% and 19%. So, this quarter was several basis – or several hundred basis points higher than the average of that period. Clearly, 150 basis points higher than the best third quarter you’ve ever had. When we get out a couple of years from now and turn around and look at this quarter, is this going to be an anomaly as far as the margin goes or do you think this really kind of resets the bar and this higher margin level is something more structural?
Michael McGarry: But Duffy, the way I would answer that is, we launched something called The PPG Way two years ago. And one of the tenets of The PPG Way, is that, we do better today than yesterday, every day. So you’re not going to look back at this anomaly in two years because our team is fully committed to The PPG Way and that’s doing better today than yesterday. So that’s going to carry forward.
Vince Morales: Yes. I would just add, Duffy that, if you look at Q3 and Mike alluded to this earlier, some of our most technical business in aerospace and refinish were remain in a recession. So, hopefully, two years from now those businesses have recovered, not fully recovered, and those should help the metrics you are talking about.
Duffy Fischer: Terrific. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Your next question will come from Stephen Byrne from Bank of America Securities. Your line is open.
Stephen Byrne: Yes, thank you. So, SG&A was down sharply, but so was R&D. So, presumably a lot of those are lower costs are part of this interim cost reduction bucket. Other than less travel, what are the big buckets that are in this interim cost savings that enable those two cost line items to be down so much? And do you need to bring them back up when volumes recover in order to drive sustainable growth or could they stay down?
Michael McGarry: So, Stephen, I will take the question. When you think about R&D, the first thing you have to remember is part of that cost is currency. And so, we have not been helped with the currency from that regard. Second, what we – we have our run rate on R&D in the third quarter is back to normal. We had some in the second quarter, we did some things like four-day work weeks and we had the salary – temporary salary reduction. So all those are gone. So, right now the spending on R&D is at the same level as what we had last year. So – but we are continuing to optimize our lab footprint. So we’ll have less labs so that drives permanent cost savings. We also are using digital to drive more productivity. So that’s a permanent cost savings. So, I would tell you that the spending on big projects is at the same level, but the efficiency is better.
Stephen Byrne: And on the $170 million restructuring program, how would you allocate that between COGS, SG&A and R&D? And how long do you think it will take to roll that through?
Vince Morales: Yes. Again, I don’t have those numbers are in front of me, Steve. but I – most of those were not – most of those were optimization of our workforce – our SG&A workforce. We did have some facility and supply chain optimization in there, but the vast majority of that was not supply chain or manufacturing.
Michael McGarry: Yes. Steve, circa 85%, 90% is SG&A.
Stephen Byrne: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Kevin Hocevar from Northcoast Research. Your line is open.
Kevin Hocevar: Hey. Good morning, everybody.
Michael McGarry: Good morning, Kevin.
Kevin Hocevar: Maybe one other stab at some of the interim cost savings. So, it sounds like those coming back going to be volume-dependent early – some portion of them coming back are to be volume-dependent. And with the fourth quarter, it looks like volumes are expected to be down low- to mid-single-digit, which is a little bit better – similar to slightly better than what you saw in the third quarter. So, is it fair to say that $90-ish million will still be what saved in the fourth quarter? Is that what’s baked in the guidance? Just kind of curious what you have baked into the guidance for the interim savings in the fourth quarter.
Vince Morales: Yes. Kevin, if you look sequentially, Q2 to Q3, we think we brought back cost ratably with volume. We do some volume – if you look, Q3 and Q4, we hope volumes on the low – on the higher end, I guess, that range. So we’ll manage our cost back accordingly. But I think $90 million is probably too large of a number, but we’re not providing that. We had embedded that in our guidance where we thought we could retain in Q4 and heading into next year.
Kevin Hocevar: And you talked about mix being a headwind with aerospace and refinish being below the company average in terms of volumes. How much is that holding back margin? So if you were to normalize that and have those businesses performing more in line with the company average, I guess, how much room is there for margins to improve as those businesses recover?
Vince Morales: W don’t give margins by business. But as we alluded to earlier, those are some of our most technical-based coatings business and those typically customers can see the value in those businesses.
Kevin Hocevar: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question will come from Mike Harrison from Seaport Global. Your line is open.
Mike Harrison: Hi. Good morning. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about the protective and marine business. What you’re hearing from customers there? You mentioned some project delays in Europe and the United States. Are those significant and lasting kind of through the fourth quarter? Can you maybe talk about when you see the protective and marine business getting back to growth?
Michael McGarry: Well, let me first start talking about it from the marine side. Marine builds continue to be on the very low end of the spectrum. So new ship builds are down 55%. On the positive side, our mix, we are very advantaged here. We are much stronger in China than we are in Korea. And so, our protective business and marine business is actually, I think doing better than the industry from that regard. Clearly, we saw a lot of infrastructure projects that were delayed because of COVID. They got to figure out how to have a COVID save working environment when they are working on these infrastructure projects. So we think they have been delayed but we think they are coming back now. Of course, now you get into the winter. So a lot of those projects are going to be put on hold again. But I would say, oil and gas is weak, nothing significant change there. But we’re launching some new products. We launched some new polyurea product for the food business. So, we think that’s going to be a nice win for us. And overall, the economy will get better. And so, I’m anticipating that our wins in the refinery side will start to blossom into the maintenance side of that as well. And Asia is the big for us.
Mike Harrison: Alright. And then speaking of Asia, the packaging business, APAC shows up as growing below market, how big is that piece of business Asia packaging and what is driving the weakness there?
Michael McGarry: Well, I would say, it’s not a huge piece of the company. What’s driving it is they transition from what I would call it older generation to a newer generation. We focused on the newer generation of to what they call easy open ends –, as well as a two-piece cans. And so, from that standpoint, we’re focused highly on the next-generation of cans. And so, right now as that transition hasn’t moved as fast as it has in the U.S. and in Europe, we are losing a little bit of share. I don’t regard that to be a permanent. I think we will get that share back, especially because there are a number of global products think about tuna and other things that are made in Asia, that are exported. So, as those global standards take hold in Asia, then we’ll get our share back.
Mike Harrison: Alright. Thanks very much.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Laurence Alexander: Good morning, guys. So, just a follow-up on that. In the North America architectural trade and the Asia packaging as you think about the 2021 growth rates, will PPG be back to growing in line with the market or will the share loss continue?
Michael McGarry: I would definitely say for package in Asia will be back to market because those technologies will rollout. And in the U.S., I see no reason why we wouldn’t be growing at market in 2021.
Laurence Alexander: Okay, great. So, 2021 should really be at market or above market year across the board?
Michael McGarry: Yes. I mean, right now, we haven’t done our 2021 planning process, but our initial assumption going into that will be at market.
Laurence Alexander: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We have no further questions in queue. I turn the call back over to Mr. Bruno for closing remarks.
John Bruno: Thank you, Michelle. I’d like to thank everyone for your time this morning and your interest in PPG. If you have any further questions, please contact our Investor Relations department. This concludes our third quarter earnings call. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you everyone. This will conclude today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

John Bruno: Thank you, Rocco, and good morning, everyone. Once again, this is John Bruno. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG and welcome you to our second quarter 2020 financial results conference call. Joining me on the call from PPG are Michael McGarry, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vince Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our comments relate to the financial information released after U.S. equity markets closed on Thursday, July 16, 2020. We have posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on the investor center of our website, ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide additional support to the opening comments Michael will make shortly. Following management's perspective on the Company's results for the quarter, we will move to a Q&A session. All with the prepared commentary and discussion during the call may contain forward-looking statements, reflecting the Company's current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance.

The Company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC. Now let me introduce PPG Chairman and CEO, Michael McGarry.
Michael McGarry: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome everyone to our second quarter 2020 earnings call. As John noted, we posted a detailed narrative on our website yesterday afternoon. And as a slight process improvement versus prior calls, I will make just a few opening comments on the quarter, and then we'll move into Q&A. First, and most importantly, I hope that you and your loved ones are remaining safe and healthy. Throughout this challenging time, we remain encouraged and proud of all the PPG team members for protecting each other, meeting the dynamic needs of our customers, helping communities and ensuring stability for all our stakeholders. We continue to remain optimistic about our business and continued growth prospects.  I also want to comment briefly on the issue of systemic racism and discrimination that has existed for far too long. As a society, we are at a pivotal moment in history, and clearly, enough is enough. As a global company, we are focused on doing our part to help advocate for equality, justice and inclusive workplace that is free of discrimination. Our global leadership team has been holding open discussions with employees, looking at strengthening our diversity inclusion leadership efforts, reviewing our own policies and processes, and leveraging the PPG Foundation to support non-profits for making a positive difference in these important areas. This is, and will remain a priority area for me and the entire PPG leadership team. Now, I'll move to discuss our financial results. Last evening, we reported second quarter 2020 financial results. For the second quarter, our net sales were $3 billion and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $0.99. These results, which were significantly impacted from the business interruption caused by the COVID pandemic, were better than we originally anticipated. As we communicated in our financial update provided during the quarter, April and May volumes in aggregate were down more than 30% due to the pandemic. For the month of June, strong global architectural coatings demand continued largely driven by do-it-yourself sales and was coupled with sequentially improving auto and general industrial demand resulting in total company sales to be down by a low-teen percentage. I am pleased to report that our global architectural business delivered a record quarter, driven by strong performance in many countries, highlighted by our Mexico team. During the second quarter, our recovery advanced furthest in China where several businesses, including automotive OEMs, general industrial coatings and protective marine coatings all had higher year-over-year sales volumes. The year-over-year demand was lower in other major global regions, but our sequential monthly sales volumes improved in each region during the quarter. Given that we have a large China business, we began our pandemic response in late January, so we were able to implement quick, already tested and decisive actions to help mitigate the lower sales activity and the virus spread outside of China. As a result of these actions, we delivered about $170 million of interim cost savings within the second quarter. In addition to the interim cost savings actions, we achieved more than $20 million of cost savings from our restructuring programs which are permanent reduction to our cost structure. This, coupled with good selling price realization of nearly 2% mostly from our distribution-type businesses, helped us achieve double-digit margins in the second quarter, which is a significant improvement versus the depth of the prior recession in 2008 and 2009. Our operating margin in the second quarter is a strong testimony of the structural cost savings we have delivered in the past few years and higher level of variable costs in our cost structure overall. Also in the quarter, our cash flow from operations totaled approximately $500 million, a level comparable to the prior year second quarter. This was supported by a rigorous management of our working capital, resulting in a $400 million reduction in our working capital compared to the same period last year. Looking ahead, we expect economic activity to continue to recover with differences across end-use markets and geographic regions. We expect our global architectural business to continue to be more resilient and deliver higher organic sales in the third quarter. Although, we anticipate softness in the U.S. commercial maintenance segment to linger and do-it-yourself demand to remain strong, but somewhat less robust in the second quarter. We are pleased with the advancements with respect to our U.S. architectural coatings delivery model, preferred authorized dealer network and our global digitalization initiatives and expect continued customer adoption leading to further growth opportunities in the future. We anticipate demand for our automotive OEM and general industrial products to continue their recovery in the third quarter. Other businesses, including automotive refinish and aerospace will take longer to recover until travel and miles driven return close to 2019 levels. Due to the uncertainty over the economic climate resulting from the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic, aggregates sales volumes are projected to be down 8% to 15% in the third quarter, with differences by business and regions. Decrements to margins in the third quarter are expected to be slightly worse than those experienced in the second quarter. This is related to removing some of the interim cost mitigation actions in the third quarter as demand for our products progresses and to ensure we properly service our customers as they continue to resume their operations. Our liquidity position remains strong and has improved from the first quarter. We remain committed to our legacy of rewarding shareholders and have approved a 6% increase in our quarterly dividend, a reflection of the confidence we have over maintaining and growing our cash flow. We will also continue to be disciplined over our approach to capital allocation. As the pandemic continues, our focus will remain on leveraging the PPG way, protecting our employees and providing excellent support for our customers with the essential products and services they need to resume and ramp up their operations. In addition, we will continue to support the communities where we do business. I am very proud and pleased with how our global team as a one PPG team is managing through this prolonged and extremely challenging time. I firmly believe that we will emerge as a stronger company. Thank you for your continued confidence in PPG. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now Rocco, would you please open the line for questions.
Operator: Absolutely, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning. Michael, just on raw materials in Q3 and the back half of the year. What are your expectations as to how much of a tailwind they might be versus either the first half or the prior year?
Michael McGarry: Well David, I'd look at that in two ways. The first one is, we continue to see moderation on a year-over-year basis. But you have to be a little bit careful that on a sequential basis, things like copper and oil have started to move up. So I think that moderation – pace of moderation will vary in the third and fourth quarter. We're not exactly sure how the pandemic is going to continue to play out. But I would be looking at it on both a prior-year basis as well as a sequential basis.
David Begleiter: Very good. And just on the DIY strength continuing into Q3, how much moderation do you expect? And how much do you think maybe was pulled forward into Q2 from these projects?
Michael McGarry: Well, I don't think there was really any pull forwards. If you look at inventory on the shelves, I'd say that most of our big box customers would advocate that they would like to see more inventory on the shelf. So I don't see a pull forward from that standpoint. But I do think there is a limit on how many rooms that people will paint in their house. So I do think it will start to slow down over time. Now, obviously that's going to vary by how long there is a stay-at-home orders by various states, but we are not expecting the third quarter to be quite as strong as the second quarter.
David Begleiter: Thank you.
Vincent Morales: Thanks, David.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Robert Koort: Thank you very much. And really appreciate the granularity on the slide deck. That's really helpful. Michael, you mentioned that you felt that next quarter maybe aggregates would be down about the same rate as the June month. So is that – am I right to read that as an expectation of just sort of a steady state from the June exit velocity for the firm or is there something else under the hood going on there?
Michael McGarry: No, I think that's a reasonable assumption. I think the question we have is, if you look at some of our big markets, so think about automotive, right. They have demand out there, but they are having people problems, getting their plants up and running, and making sure everybody is safe. So I think that's the challenge that we don't understand is to what extent will they be able to keep their plants operating at the level they want because they have the demand. It's just now, it's just a matter of whether they can keep it going.
Robert Koort: And then you commented that you're able to pull some, I guess what period cost out during the second quarter, but on the industrial side in particular it seems, many of those have to go back in to start supporting or recovering those, in that customer base. How long do you expect that to last? And should we then see the flip side of that which is a really healthy incremental margin improvement as those volumes come back?
Michael McGarry: Yes. So Bob, the way we are looking at it is in the second quarter, we had a number of our plants down for a substantial period of time. Some of them down four to six weeks, right. And we did a really, really good job, our team did a fantastic job with our customers coordinating what colors they wanted when they started up. And we tried to manage that such that they took the colors we had. The colors they wanted right before they shut down and so we were able to actually stay down longer than they were because of that coordination with the customers. So that, we can’t duplicate in the third quarter because basically all our plants are running again. But we have learned a lot of things through this pandemic. Our ability to drive productivity has improved. Our digital initiatives have continued. And so I think a lot of that is a testament to the resilience of the PPG team.
Robert Koort: Great. Thanks very much.
Operator: And our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with R.W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Ghansham Panjabi: Hey guys. Good morning. Hope everybody is doing well. I guess just as a follow-up to the last question on the 8% to 15% volume decline you're forecasting for 3Q. Does the downside extreme assume any incremental lockdowns in the U.S. or any other regions? You mentioned, for example, Michael, in your prepared comments that auto OEM should benefit sequentially from reduced seasonal shutdowns in 3Q. So I would think that would be a positive variance. I'm just trying to understand what operating paradigm you are embedding on the downside extreme.
Vincent Morales: Hey Ghansham, this is Vince. No question, that's a fairly wide range. We just don't know the shape of the pandemic and some of the key regions, we're still seeing effects obviously in Latin America, South America, India, U.S., so the range that we put out and try to bracket the best case and worst case with respect to how that pandemic will affect the quarter.
Ghansham Panjabi: Okay. And then in terms of the decremental margin variances for 3Q relative to the 2Q baseline, I think you said, slightly worse. Can you just give us some more color on that?
Vincent Morales: Yes. Again – I'll go here again. I think one of the issues, if you look, we had a 40% decremental in Q1. The pandemic hit very quickly and abruptly, we weren't able to manage our costs accordingly. As Michael just mentioned, we were able to be very planful throughout the quarter in Q2, managing not only our operations, but our administrative group. The operations are all started back up. Some of those costs are binary, they're either in or out. So regardless of the volume, these kind of semi-variable costs, some of those were back in Q3. So we're not going to be at the 25% for 26% decremental, but we're certainly not going to be at the 40% incremental we had in Q1. So it will be somewhere in between. Hopefully closer to 25%.
Michael McGarry: And Ghansham, I'd say that in the later quarters that will come, we're going to have better incremental margins. I mean I think that's a given. As that volume returns, we're more efficient and we can see that helping us out.
Ghansham Panjabi: Terrific. Thanks so much.
Operator: And our next question today comes from John Roberts with UBS. Please go ahead.
John Roberts: Thank you. China has recovered nicely for you. Is it now steady state as well? Or you're going to continue to grow from this second quarter level in China? And any progress to report on your new coatings for EVs?
Michael McGarry: So John, se see continued improvement in China, but we're not seeing like a massive jump. I think the GDP for our customers are probably going to be in that 3% to 5% kind of range. We are seeing continued improvement in the automotive demand. People are staying away from mass transit. So there are more people driving. So that's positive. We do see virtually every province has some kind of automotive stimulus package to support their own little automotive guys in that province. So we do see that continuing. Our industrial business continues to win share in China, so we expect that to continue. So I'd say overall, we're still very positive on our China team as well as our China business.
Vincent Morales: And John, if I can add – I do think – just to piggyback on the last question. Though China, we haven't seen a full volume recovery we've seen a nice volume recovery. But as we alluded to our financial performance there is above prior year due to those – the effect of those incremental Michael was talking about.
Michael McGarry: And John, back to your last question, which is EV. We are getting orders on a various aspects of the EV battery. So we're getting some, obviously, painting the exterior. We just recently won a new award for – I would say the leading EV maker in China where we're providing protective coatings inside the battery. Obviously, that's to eliminate what they call thermal events, which you and I call fires. So we're very pleased with that and we continue to see more trials underway with all the leading battery guys in China. And we think that's a market that's going to grow the fastest for EVs.
John Roberts: And then I may have missed it, but I didn't see any additional reserve for bad debt. How are you feeling about general industrial because big manufacturers, as you mentioned are having some problems, keeping their plants up. I would imagine it's even harder for the small manufacturers in the general industrial area.
Vincent Morales: Yes, John. Just as a reminder to everybody, we took a $30 million bad debt reserve in the first quarter, anticipating some effects from the pandemic. We were not anticipating to see a big customer problem in Q2. Most of our customers have enough liquidity, certainly last quarter or longer that that $30 million would be something that we would expect to – if it's used at all to come through sometime in the latter part of the year. Our collections in Q2 are actually very strong. We've had, in some regions, some of our best percent currents. We still have a $30 million reserve there. Again, we do expect that to be – we'll vet that as we go through the balance of the year, but we would expect some impact in the latter part of the year.
John Roberts: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Michael Sison with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Michael Sison: Hey guys. Really nice quarter there. Can you maybe talk a little bit about the stores and how to do it for – Do-It-For-Me channel is sort of shaping up for 2Q. I know there was improvement throughout the quarter. Where do you think you're at in July and how do you think that will play out for interior demand in the third quarter?
Michael McGarry: Well, there's clearly improvement every month in our stores business. And so we're pleased to see that. The work that is really being done a lot of is the exterior work right now. And now we're starting to see consumers be a little bit more understanding and they're allowing inside work as well. So I think the pace of recovery will continue. The challenge, of course, in our architectural business in the U.S. is the commercial side and the maintenance side. So the buildings that were underway are going to get completed. And then that we think there's going to be a slow down in new construction. And then, of course, for resident or commercial maintenance, that's going to be the challenging part going forward.
Michael Sison: Got it. And then as a follow-up, Slide 9, you had a nice comparison regarding your margins now versus they were in the last downturn. If – when volumes returned back to pre-COVID levels, which I understand it could take some time. Where do you think the margins will end up given cost savings and better pricing down the road for each of the segments?
Vincent Morales: Yes, Mike. On a like-for-like basis, we're several hundred basis points better, be it Q1 2008 – Q1 2009, or Q2 2009. Again, that's a reflection of all the structural cost savings we've actioned in the past several years. So if you flash forward, hopefully, when the volumes come back, we would expect to hold that couple hundred margin basis point improvement versus the last cycle.
Michael Sison: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question today comes from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John McNulty: Yes. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. When we look at the cash that you generated in the quarter and the strength of the balance sheet, it's obviously, it's huge. I guess can you speak to the opportunities to deploy that capital as you look throughout the rest of the year? Are you seeing any opportunities in terms of M&A? Or are people a little gun-shy trying to not kind of worried about selling at the bottom and that type of thing? How should we be thinking about that?
Michael McGarry: So John, we have a number of books in-house and we're making progress on some of them. As always, it challenges the bid and the app gap now. The benefit is that with the June that we had in June that we expected some of these companies had that bid and the app should start to narrow. So we do expect to have some progress in this area this year. Obviously, I don't think we're going to close on any of them in 2020. But I do expect us to have progress. And I would say the pace of the inquiries has not changed. We had a strong order book, if you will, going into this, and we have good opportunities coming out of this. So I'm pleased with it.
John McNulty: Got it. No, that's helpful. And then I guess, PPG runs a pretty lean ship in the first place. And then this quarter, you announced $160 million to $170 million big restructuring program. I guess, can you give us a little color as to where that's actually coming from and your comfort that you can hit that? I know you were speaking earlier to – this is – you're seeing a lot of new opportunities around digital and that type of thing. I guess, how is that playing into this as well?
Michael McGarry: Well, digital is clearly a significant one. So we are moving much more to a click and collect and click and deliver model, and that has provided nice tailwinds and we expect that to accelerate. And if you think about the traditional trade painter, that was not their method of doing business prior to the pandemic. So we anticipate that's going to continue. Obviously, we have some opinions on and you saw that in the second quarter results. Aerospace is going to take a little bit longer to recover. And so we took aggressive actions in our aerospace business. We're also getting more productive in our refinished business. So those two businesses are there. And, of course, I would say the last one is, the service model that we have in automotive and to a small extent and industrial. We've shifted much more to a pay model and so we will either get paid for our technical service people out in the field or we will have less of them. And right now, I'm pleased to report that our customers are really paying for them. This is a – if you notice for OEM, we were above market in all regions, and that's because they value the technical service that our people provide and allow them to start up. That's really important to them. And so they have been willing to pay for that.
John McNulty: That's great. Thanks very much for the color.
Operator: And our next question today comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please go ahead.
Prashant Juvekar: Yes. Good morning, Michael, Vince. Michael, you seem to be more positive on the refinish market compared to a few months ago with the trends in Europe improving, China now back to 2019 levels. And so even if U.S. and Europe lag by six months relative to China, do you believe that 2021 should be a robust year for refinish? Or would you agree with that logic?
Michael McGarry: Well, I don't know that I would use the word robust, but I think two things I would point to in refinish. One, this second quarter has completely washed all the inventory out of the chain. And so you're not going to have to worry about how much inventory is in the chain. Our body shops ran them down, our jobbers ran them down. Everybody washed them out of the system. So going forward, you're going to see hopefully demand matching up with what we're selling. And I would tell you, also, I was pleasantly surprised by the orders that we saw in June despite congestion being, I would say, mediocre at best, there's still a lot of opportunities out there. So body shops are running at 70% to 80% right now in the U.S. and Europe. And so that's actually a little bit better than I would have projected given how little congestion there is out there on the Street.
Prashant Juvekar: Okay. Thank you. And then secondly, sort of a big picture question. PPG always had good insights into the economy. So my question is, clearly the OEM – auto OME SAAR has come down and there is a view that the auto recovery will be slower than the housing recovery. IHS doesn't see a peak in autos until 2023. So what are your projections in terms of the trajectories in those two end markets?
Michael McGarry: Well, actually it's ironic because we had the same 2023 for getting back to $17 million. But that's not the way. I'm thinking about our automotive business. I'm thinking about our automotive business will have a better volumes than that sooner because of the growth in EV. So I am thinking about this slightly differently. It's going to be builds and EV going forward, not just builds.
Prashant Juvekar: And anything on housing? Thank you.
Michael McGarry: I think housing is actually going to be stronger than people anticipate. I think people are going to be willing to live outside the bigger cities. And so I anticipate housing to get better, faster and sooner. And with interest rates at these kinds of levels, there's really no reason why people can't qualify for mortgages. So the key will be how quickly can we get people back to work. Right now, you've got so many small businesses that I think are at permanent damage risk. That's the thing I worry most about is all these small business people that are out – will likely be out of business.
Prashant Juvekar: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey Zekauskas: Thanks very much. Can you compare the trends in the aerospace OEM market with the trends in the aerospace maintenance and repair market exclusive of defense?
Michael McGarry: Yes. So Jeff, as you know, the builds for Airbus and Boeing have come down appreciably, and we anticipate them to stay down for a while. So last year they were building, let's call it 45, 737s a month. Now they're building, let's call it 20% of that, 30% of that. So appreciably different. Now MRO though is strictly dependent upon the number of times that plane goes up and comes down. And we peaked at about 64% of the flights or planes being parked. And now we're about only 40% of the planes are parked. And so MRO will start to get better because it's – again, it doesn't matter if there's one person on the flight or a 100. And so we anticipate that getting better. So we think a leading indicator, if you want to try to estimate MRO, a leading indicator is the growth in flights, not passengers. So don't pay attention to the passengers, but pay attention to the flights.
Jeffrey Zekauskas: Great. Thank you for that. And can you compare changes currently in titanium dioxide prices in different regions. That is, are the price patterns different in South America, Europe and in the United States?
Michael McGarry: Yes. They're all four regions are different. So you have lower prices in Asia. You have higher prices in Latin America due to currency. You have slight moderation in Europe and very little moderation in the U.S.
Jeffrey Zekauskas: Great. Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Christopher Parkinson: Great. Thank you. Throughout all this malaise, there's been a reasonable amount of debate on market shares in architectural, packaging, coil and refinish, I guess have been kind of the primary four. Just given what you know now, just how do you set your own market share movements? And then also, how would you assess your competitive positioning for the balance of this year? And then also outlook into 2021? Thank you.
Vincent Morales: Hey, Chris. This is Vince. I think there's a lot of opaqueness out there, so it's really hard to determine market shares. We'll certainly go through this quarter, next quarter, look at all of our results, our competitors’ results. I think the biggest thing we see, obviously, there's a share shift right now from Do-It-For-Me to DIY. That helps our DIY business, it’s our trade business. Competitively that has different impacts. In the other business as you mentioned, there's really a lot of variables by region, for example, in packaging, a lot of the packager or a lot of the can guys in Asia had to shut down for COVID reasons. So it's really hard to discern what you're asking until we are on a more steady or run rate basis. We're comfortable with what we're doing. We're comfortable in some of the strategic initiatives we laid out like digital delivery. Those things are coming into favor. So the work we've put in the past couple of years around those are helping us. Some of our technical items, some of our technical things like Michael mentioned earlier with respect to – EVs are coming into favor. So a lot of the long lead items we put in place due to this pandemic are coming into favor, which is helpful for us.
Christopher Parkinson: Got it. And just within the architectural, could we just get – dive into this a little bit more just – can you just quickly comment, obviously, it's maybe difficult also to discern in this type of environment. But it seems like you still have a lot of momentum at home depot with Timeless and DIAMOND. You've had – you previously were talking about some new initiatives that even at independents and then even some stuff on online and digital. So just – how should the market be thinking about your U.S. growth rate outlook versus peers and just relative competitive positioning, because it seems like you're doing a lot in both resi and even non-resi. So do you have any comments on that?
Vincent Morales: Again, it's hard with not a lot of market information at this point. But our digital sales are up triple-digits off of a very small base. We definitely see – as Michael alluded to earlier, we definitely see our customer base more willing to move to a digital platform. We're certainly holding our own in DIY market, but the whole market has been elevated. We moved to this preferred authorized dealer network really to be more optimal in our full delivery. Our dealers are up consistent, mostly consistent with the DIY market. So again, we'd like to see more competitive information before we comment. But we feel we're holding our own in this market. We feel right performing in Mexico, depending on – in Europe, depending on the country. Again, the DIY market is just outperforming and we're well favored right now.
Michael McGarry: Chris, I wouldn't want you to miss my comment in my opening remarks where we had a global architectural record performance.
Christopher Parkinson: Great. Thank you very much.
Vincent Morales: Thanks Chris.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Kevin McCarthy at Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Kevin McCarthy: Yes. Good morning. With regard to your architectural business, so I was wondering if you could elaborate on what you're seeing in Europe in terms of trends by country or at least UK versus continent and also by channel there.
Michael McGarry: So Kevin I'll start with France. As you know that's our largest market. And France, April, we had a lot of challenges in April because of the stores were shutdown because of government mandates. And starting in May, they started to loosen up and by June, all the stores were open and in July, we're doing quite well. So France was just a steady upward trend. The UK started really strong April, May kind of a little bit of a downturn in June as the re-spike in numbers came up. But in July, they're back to really, really good numbers. Poland is doing great. There's no doubt we're taking share in Poland and the rest of our Eastern European business is quite strong. The Benelux, we're definitely doing exceptionally well there. So I've been pleased with our European performance.
Kevin McCarthy: That's helpful.
Vincent Morales: Just from a channel perspective, Kevin, same phenomenon we're seeing here. DIY is very strong both in the UK and on the continent. Trade is feeling the same effect of it this year.
Kevin McCarthy: Okay. Thank you for that. And then second, if I look at your heat map on Slide 6, it strikes me if I counted correctly, you've got 11 boxes that show above market growth and zero that show below market. I think two quarters ago, below market might have been a half dozen boxes or so. So I appreciate, it's got to be very difficult to gauge what the market is doing when conditions are so dislocated. But I guess my question would be, did you feel as though you've gained share in any of your businesses due to the pandemic, whether it's ability to operate or execution or otherwise? Or am I reading too much into that?
Michael McGarry: Well, I think Vince tried to cover this previously. And these kind of times it's always difficult to put your finger on exactly whether you're gaining share or losing share. But I do feel – there's no question that we're gaining share in Australia. I mean that's an easy one to measure. I would say the UK pretty easy to measure there. I would say those are the areas that we're most comfortable with. Clearly automotive is easy to measure. We know exactly what the builds were, and we know exactly what our sales are. So that is a given. I think the rest of them can be quite tricky to figure that one out.
Vincent Morales: Yes. I would just add. One, we were comfortable with is, in certain regions, our protective business due to our technologies, again, it's come into favor as customers are looking for functionality in these times. And I think also in some of our general industrial businesses where we're working with our customers to startup, we're typically one of the favorite coatings companies to help customers startup and have that secure launch process. But again, it is very difficult Kevin, until we see a bigger array of results and really over a couple of quarters.
Kevin McCarthy: Fair enough. I appreciate the color.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Arun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Congrats on the results. Just wanted to ask about Q3, so your pace of sales decline in June was 12%, the guidance for Q3 is 8% to 15%. So at the midpoint you're around 11.5% or so down in Q3. So that's not much better than June, I guess in aggregate. So is it your assumption that there will be some considerable moderation in architectural as automotive comes back and that's what kind of drives a similar result in Q3 versus June? Or is there a possibility that maybe we could see some upside to that if architectural doesn't decline as much. How are you thinking about the offset between architectural and automotive in Q3?
Vincent Morales: Yes. Arun, as we mentioned earlier, we have a wide range for Q3. It's really based on the uncertainty around the pandemic in some of our key regions. So we're hopeful to be at the low-end of that range if you will, but we maybe on the high-end of 14%, 15% if the pandemic continues to worsen in certain parts of the world. So that's really what we're looking at. It's still very difficult to predict on a month by – certainly, week-by-week, but on a month-by-month basis. What our customers are going to do? What customers can actually run? We're seeing spots shutdowns from customers due to COVID, we're seeing spot shutdowns from customers due to parts issues. So that's why there's a wide range there and expect some volatility throughout the quarter.
Arun Viswanathan: Okay. And then as a follow-up, just on the cash issue, going back to the – you have a very strong balance sheet here over $2 billion of cash on the balance sheet as well. You stated in the past that you do not want to build cash, but it does appear that it maybe difficult to consummate, and close any deals this year and you said earlier as well. So just curious, what your plans would be if you're not able to deploy that cash in M&A, would you prefer to keep that as liquidity and reserve for now? Or would you be able to put it to work in capital return?
Vincent Morales: Yes. Certainly for the near-term, we're carrying excess cash. Again, our side lines are limited in terms of how this is going to affect us. We're not health experts. We're hearing there may certainly be a flare-up in some of the key countries in the fall. So we're going to be conservative. As Michael alluded to, our acquisition pipeline is refilling. Those are bolt-on in nature. We maybe able to execute on some of those, whether we can close or not this year, I agree with Michael probably be difficult given we're months out before the end of the year. But we'll certainly manage our acquisitions and our cash around that. We do have the capability to pay down some debt. If the sky is clear here, we have our short-term facility that it's free to prepay, so all those are variables. We really just need more visibility on the economy before we start to make some key decisions. We don't want to grow cash. As you mentioned, we will look for earnings accretion opportunities, whether it be acquisitions or other, but we just need more visibility before we start to pull triggers on some of those.
Arun Viswanathan: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Stephen Byrne with Bank of America Securities, Inc. Please go ahead.
Stephen Byrne: Yes. Thank you. You reported that some auto body shops switched over to PPG refinish coatings, and I was just curious where you saw that, and whether it's due to that new paint mixing product that you rolled out in Europe. What is the status of that rollout? Are you getting traction from it? Have you considered expanding it into other regions? And is operating at a 70% rate help you in your process of trying to cause a body shop to flip over to you because they may not be running flat out?
Michael McGarry: Yes. So Stephen, just to get start talking about Moonwalk. We've had 250 installations put in, 150 of which got put in, in the second quarter and 30 of them were new body shop wins. So it is performing at a good level. Obviously, we've been a little bit challenged of getting that out into the field because we have to send tech service people into the field with the equipment to make sure people are trained on running it. So we anticipate that we'll continue to roll that out. We will be looking at moving that into the U.S. as well. Obviously, it's most important in the high labor markets and the high markets where labor is hard to come by. And so that would say that we're probably not going to roll that out in Asia, as a likely place. But we have been picking up share in refinish. We track that quite closely. It's a net win basis because you win some, you lose some, but overall we feel comfortable. The key with refinish though will be getting the miles driven back as well as congestion.
Stephen Byrne: Well, thank you for that. And I had a follow-up for you on the trend of shifting from do-it-for-me to do-it-yourself. Do you see that same trend in your own stores where you're picking up more homeowners coming in or ordering online to buy paints? And was just curious as to your view, based on those relationships and discussions, do you think that some of that impact could be lasting i.e. those homeowners continue to paint the rooms themselves rather than hiring a contractor post-pandemic?
Vincent Morales: Yes, Stephen. We said for multiple years, the shift between DIY and do-it-for-me is highly correlated to the unemployment rate. So certainly last five years, as the unemployment rate has come down and you've seen more do-it-for-me, you've seen obviously a spike in the unemployment rate during these times, you've seen abrupt shift back the other way. And again, I would just look at that unemployment rate on a go-forward basis to determine how these channels will react. It acted the same in 2008, 2009, and it's recurring now. So that's the key. We still think long-term do-it-for-me is going to continue to grow. But certainly for the foreseeable future with unemployment high, do-it-yourself market will remain robust.
Stephen Byrne: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you. I just want to ask a clarifying question on the cost savings to make sure that we have our model right and we don't do any double counting. If I assume your volume constant on a go-forward basis, and you had $170 million of interim cost savings that came out in the quarter, and then you've got the new restructuring program, which is $160 million to $170 million in annual saving. Or let me try it this way. The $170 million that came out on an interim basis is presumably going to come back over time and the $160 million to $170 million that's on the comp should offset that. Now maybe it won't be one-for-one, but is that the right way to think about it, that those two things will ultimately offset each other?
John Bruno: Hey, Vincent. It's John Bruno. That's exactly right. The $170 million, we can call is a transitional or temporary. It will come back as volume comes back and the restructuring savings are intended to be permanent.
Vincent Andrews: Okay. And then just one last follow-up on that. Are you done with the large scale restructuring cost for the year with the charge in the quarter? Or will there be some trickles out in the third quarter and fourth quarter?
Michael McGarry: Well, there are certain costs that are related to restructuring Vincent, that we cannot based on GAAP accounting take until they're incurred. So there'll be some modest trickle outs in Q3, Q4 and even Q1. Again, based on the accounting guidelines, they're very modest.
Vincent Andrews: Understood. Thanks very much guys.
Michael McGarry: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sean Gilmartin with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Patrick Fischer: Vince, can you hear me. This is Duffy.
Vincent Morales: Hey, Duffy. We can hear you.
Patrick Fischer: Okay, great. I just wanted to drill in a little deeper on the DIY versus trade split. So in the two summer quarters, where this effect looks like it's going to be important, roughly, what is the normal DIY versus trade breakout, just size of the two businesses over those quarters? And then what would be the influence in that shift kind of on margins? As I'm assuming gross profit margins for DIY is higher than trade? And then on the cash flow as well, as I imagine there's less credit in DIY than there would be in trade. And is that big enough to kind of skew the numbers or influence the numbers for the overall company?
Vincent Morales: So it's different by market – it's different by regions Duffy first of all, that we we'll stick to the U.S. market for clarity. Typically trades 55% to 60% on a gallons basis of the market. It's less – it’s 50/50 on a dollar basis. For PPG, we're close to that mix. We are seeing obviously double-digit growth in DIY. We've seen a decrement in our trade business. Part of that is due to the stores just being shutdown in certain parts of the country. Again because of double-digit growth in DIY in Q2, that's been beneficial for that part of the business. But trade business is higher fixed cost. We have stores, we have leases. So volume there when it comes back typically carries a nice incremental. We don't give out profitability by channel, so we're not going to go there. But again, as long as we're producing positive volumes in architectural business and as Michael alluded to, we had very strong financial performance in all regions, certainly in the U.S., it's beneficial to us and our shareholders.
Patrick Fischer: Great. And then Michael, question for you. I imagine you're getting ready for kind of you're meeting with your business leaders planning ahead the next year, this fall. When you look through the slate of your businesses, are there some of the businesses that you think are just structurally different over the next one to three years because of what happened, where they're going to have to meaningfully change their business plans. And if so, kind of which ones would be the most obvious there?
Michael McGarry: Well, I think, Duffy, the one that is on a – what I think a temporary lag is aerospace. I’m fully convinced that whenever it's safe to get on a plane again, the planes will fill up. You know, when I look at the number of cruise ship bookings for next year, it's radically up, people want to travel, people don't want to be locked in their homes. So probably don't have to wait for the vaccine, but a vaccine would certainly be a huge benefit. But we are aggressively managing our cost structure in aerospace. So I think that's the one that will probably be a little bit longer. I think refinish, we had an incrementally every month was better April versus May versus June. So I'll be in a better position to answer that question by the end of the next quarter. But I would say that we'll probably be 90% of the way back at refinish in the back half of the year. And then it's a matter of what do we have to do to get that last bit back. But those are the only two that I think of – I mean I see cars as a long-term getting back over time. And for us, we will be growing faster than the market because of our EV exposure. And industrial, similar kind of thing. So I don't see any structural deficiencies except aerospace in the short-term.
Vincent Morales: And Duffy, if I could add to that. As we alluded to earlier, we do see this digitization especially in the architectural space, we see some paradigms being broken now that makes the entire supply chain more efficient. We see behavior – typically in a crisis, you see behavioral changes, which is where we're evidencing. People are just more willing to adopt to delivery, more willing to adopt digital. Again we've been talking about this for certainly more than six months, and we're seeing a structural modification of behavior in that channel, not only in the U.S., but we're seeing in Europe, we're seeing in Australia. So I do think that will be something we're going to measure and monitor and try to continue to promote.
Patrick Fischer: Great. Thanks fellows.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Kevin Hocevar with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.
Kevin Hocevar: Hey, good morning, everybody. Michael, I think you mentioned earlier that on the DIY side, you thought your retailer customers would probably like to have more inventory. So does that imply that manufacturing hasn't been able to keep up with the really strong demand? And does that also imply that we could see a re-stock coming at some point? And is that a regional comment or global?
Michael McGarry: Well, it's definitely regional. I would say we're understocked in Australia, UK and a little bit in the U.S. At this point, the paint season they never want to miss the paint sale, that's the key. And then they typically de-stock in the third and fourth quarters as they especially after Labor Day. So I would tell you that this year is a little bit different. How much inventory they are going to carry going into the fourth quarter is a total unknown at this point in time. And so if I had a crystal ball, I'd tell you that there is a potential for some continued strength beyond what you see in the market, but I think that would be probably a little too much speculation.
Kevin Hocevar: Okay, great. And then pricing was up nicely for the quarter 1.7% for the company and particularly out of the Performance Coatings segment, up 2.7%. So just want to get your sense on how sustainable you think that that pricing is. I know in your slide deck, you said you expected pricing to be up about 2% year-over-year in performance coatings, in the third quarter. So a little bit of the year-over-year fade, sequentially, I don't know if that's just a comp related or any expectation that there is some type of price fade. But just curious with volumes doing what they're doing, particularly on the industrial side of the business, how sustainable you think pricing is at these types of levels?
Michael McGarry: Yes. So the reason that 2% is a comp over year-over-year the timing of when these increases come vary. So we feel very comfortable on the performance coatings side that pricing is there and it's sticking and will be there. On the industrial side, obviously that's always a harder place. But right now, we're maintaining price. We're going to continue to maintain price from a PPG perspective. We'll be willing to walk away from business to make sure we get paid for the value we think we're going to deliver. Right now I see customers much more focused on us helping them get up and running, and price hasn't been a discussion, a significant discussion at this point in time. Obviously, that's going to change once they're up and running and fully operational and things like that. But by and large, you know, what I tell people on the industrial side is, we can get all the price that we needed in the last up cycle, and so we should not be giving away any price just immediately when this – you see raw material start to moderate. So I think there is a give and take here, and right now I feel comfortable that we should continue to maintain price through the balance of the year.
Kevin Hocevar: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Jim Sheehan with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
James Sheehan: Thanks, good morning. So on the heat map, Brazil seems to stand out to me is the biggest anomaly, growing year-over-year and PPG. You're growing above the market. It seemed like coronavirus issues worsened there. So could you give some more color on what happened in Brazil?
Michael McGarry: Yes. So we're down in the Southern part of Brazil. There's three states down there that we're very strong in. So we're not that strong in think about Rio and Sao Paulo, that's not where our strength is and where we are the pandemic is not as robust as it is up in the major cities, plus we have a new leadership team down there in Brazil and they've done a really outstanding job of growing with our, not just our big box customers down there, but also on our trade side. So it's been two factors.
James Sheehan: Great. And then maybe you could talk a little bit about your raw material inventories. I suspect that you've moved through a lot of the high-cost raw materials, but where are you in that process. It seems like with automotive builds ramping up that you're going to hit through the higher cost raw materials in short orders. Is that right?
Vincent Morales: Yes. Jim, if you just look at our volumes in the quarter. We came in, obviously, the quarter with seasonally high inventories. We worked through that more quickly in performance given the volume trends there versus industrial, where we were down 30%, 40% in some businesses. We're eating into that industrial inventory now. So – and then we're also – to Michael's earlier point, we're a seasonal business. So we're going to be very mindful of what inventory we build or what raw materials we buy as we get further in the year here. We want to obviously manage our inventories down seasonally toward the end of the year. Typically, where we're ratcheting down are coatings manufacturing production beginning of this month and carrying through the summer and trying to obviously work our inventory down in Q4. So very mindful of that, but I think your assumptions are accurate.
James Sheehan: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Laurence Alexander: Good morning. A quick short-term one and a long-term question. On the short-term, with $130 million, the interim cost savings, if that is on top, for Q3 that would be on top of the $30 million to $35 million highlighted in the slide deck. And then do you expect that to come back in a linear fashion as volumes recover or do you see it as a sort of a lumpier kind of way that will flow back into the income statement in 2021. The longer-term question, as you look at your learnings on digitalization distribution, should we expect to chunk your investment cycle in the next two years to three years in order to shift to help PPG drive the mark – the shift in market behavior and leverage it? Or how should we think about the investment cycle on that front?
Vincent Morales: Laurence, this is Vince. I'll take the first one and Michael will take the second one here. So yes, we have $170 million of interim cost savings in the quarter. So we've actually gross higher, but we had lower manufacturing throughput that took away from some of that. That will come back in a more – as we alluded to earlier, I think that will come back in a more lumpy fashion in Q3, some of these costs are semi-variable as we start up plants. We do have to bring back certain cost pools in their entirety, so would not be linear with volume and we're obviously working aggressively to manage those costs, not only in Q3, but on a go-forward basis. So it would be – it wouldn't be completely ratable with volume and it will be lumpier around how we're bringing our operations back.
Michael McGarry: And then Laurence on the digital question, there will be some lumpiness on the capital side, it will vary by business. So once we have a solution in place in architectural, we will replicate that around the world without a lot of significant capital expenditure. But as we roll out some of the solutions that we have for automotive and industrial, those things will need to be replicated and will be a little chunkier. So our capital spend this year is down, but not in digital and digital it's up.
Laurence Alexander: Wonderful. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Michael Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.
Michael Harrison: Hi, good morning. Wanted to ask about the auto OEM business, the heat map is showing you guys were above market across all regions. I think you mentioned, they're getting customers to pay for technical personnel and their plants was part of that, but can you talk a little bit more about what was driving that and maybe quantify how much of both market growth you saw in auto OEM?
Michael McGarry: Yes. So Mike, I would tell you that the number one thing, the auto guys want is to get their plants up and running and the paint shop is at the end of the line. So if you end up with a car that's made, but you can't get it paint, that's really expensive for them. So they wanted our people in the plant before they started up to make sure that they were ready to go and then they wanted actually helping the plants to ensure a smooth start up at which we've been able to do. So I would say the amount that we were above market varied anywhere from 2% to 10% depending upon the market. But that's not sustainable, it will be probably above market in the next couple of quarters, but then it will probably be ratably back to market performance. At the end of the day, the customers are very much interested in helping them grow their business. So productivity is another thing that we're focused on. So our tech service people are in the plants to help them drive productivity and the more that we can do that the more that they're willing to pay for those services.
Michael Harrison: All right. And then in the refinish business, the European piece is showing as yellow and everything else is red. Can you maybe talk about what you're seeing regionally, and I guess I'm a little bit surprised that given the recovery in China that Asia Pacific was still showing as red in that heat map. Can you talk about what's going on regionally in refinish?
Michael McGarry: So in refinish, actually in China, if you think about the big cities, they are already back I would say at about 90% plus of congestion, not during the day, but peak rush hour in the morning and in the evenings, look just like they did pre-pandemic. What we're seeing is that people are consolidating their trips and therefore, you don't see that those extra trips during the middle of the day. So the roads are a little bit more open. So that's the only negative in China. In Europe, they did a much better job of handling the pandemic as we've done in the U.S. And so congestion is coming back a little bit quicker in Europe than it is in the U.S. So we're actually quite pleased and they've done a better job of managing their inventory as well. There's not as many large, super large distributors in Europe like we have here in the U.S.
Michael Harrison: All right, thanks very much.
Michael McGarry: Thanks Mike.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to the management team for any final remarks.
Michael McGarry: Thank you, Rocco. I'd like to thank everyone for your time and interest in PPG. If you have any further questions, please contact our Investor Relations department. This concludes our second quarter earnings call.
Operator: Thank you, sir. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-04-28 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the PPG Industries First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Elisa and I will be your conference specialist today. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Bruno, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
John Bruno: Thank you and good morning everyone. Once again this is John Bruno. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG and welcome you to our first quarter 2020 financial results conference call. Joining me on the call from PPG are Michael McGarry, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vince Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our comments relate to the financial information released after U.S. Equity Markets closed on Monday, April 27th, 2020. I will remind everyone that we have posted detailed commentary and a company presentation slides on the investor center of our website ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide additional support to the opening comments Michael and Vince will make shortly. Following management's perspective on the company's results for the quarter, we will move to a Q&A session. Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements, reflecting the company's current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the Appendix of the presentation materials which are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC. Now, let me introduce PPG's, Chairman and CEO, Michael McGarry.
Michael McGarry: Thank you, John, and good morning everyone. I'd like to welcome everyone to our first quarter 2020 earnings call. First and most importantly though, I hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy, never before had we experienced a crisis as broad as a COVID-19 pandemic. PPG operates in more than 70 countries around the world, and every community where we operate has been affected by this virus. We have 12 factories in China, with one located in Wuhan, so our PPG people have been managing through this challenge since January working around the clock to protect our people and our customers. Throughout this crisis, we frequently hear about PPG employees going the extra mile at work and in their communities. I could not be more proud of our employees around the world who work tirelessly to keep each other safe and healthy throughout this unprecedented time. At our locations that have remained operational, we have and will continue to employ stringent health and safety measures, which are at a minimum in alignment with the local health and government guidelines. From a business perspective, we will not know the full impact of the pandemic on PPG for some time, but we are working with urgency and have taken proactive actions to limit the impact as much as possible to employees, customers, and shareholders, while also continuing to support the communities and support agencies in need. Given the breadth and urgent community needs resulting from the COVID crisis, PPG has increased and accelerated our charitable contributions around the world. Last week, PPG and the PPG Foundation announced plans to contribute more than $1.5 million to organizations supporting the immediate community relief efforts and emerging recovery needs amid the pandemic. We're also donating personal protective equipment, antibacterial coatings, and other resources where help is needed. Our contributions will touch each major region we serve. We believe that, even as we respond to difficult markets and business conditions, it is vital to remain an active partner in our communities and help our most vulnerable neighbors at this critical time. Now, let me turn to our financial results. Last evening, we reported first quarter 2020 financial results. For the first quarter, our net sales were approximately $3.4 billion and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.19. These results include a significant impact on the business interruption caused by the COVID pandemic. We estimate that our sales and earnings per diluted share were unfavorably impacted from the effects of the pandemic by approximately $225 million and $0.35 respectively. For the first 10 weeks of the quarter, excluding our business in China, most of our businesses in major regions were performing at least at the financial expectations we set in January. During the second half of March, we saw a rapid and wide ranging deterioration in global demand. Many of our large OEM customers were forced to shut down. A number of architectural paint stores were mandated to close or materially alter the way they service customers. And miles driven and the number of commercial flights fell sharply with many countries and states imposing stay-at-home orders. This materially impacted demand of our customers’ products and services, and in a matter of days led to a quick and steep decline in sales for our automotive OEM, automotive refinish, aerospace, and certain parts of our global architectural business. These lower demand levels have continued well into April. We took immediate decisive actions to help mitigate the lower sales activity, which included across the board salary reductions with our senior leaders impacted the most, temporary shutdowns of various manufacturing and distribution operations, temporary employee furloughs, reduced spending across all businesses and functions. We also deferred many non-essential capital expenditures. While many of these actions were difficult, they are necessary basis abreast [ph] and uncertain duration of the crisis. Many of these mitigation actions were implemented during March, so only had a modest impact in the first quarter. We expect these mitigation actions to have more meaningful impact in the second quarter. From a liquidity perspective, our record level operating cash flow in 2019, and historical disciplined approach to capital allocation, has our balance sheet properly positioned to weather the crisis. We will review more details on our forward-looking expectations in a few minutes. But let me quickly summarize the results for the first quarter. In aggregate, our net sales in constant currency were down 5% compared to the prior-year. Sales volumes were down 8% with about 6% of that decline estimated to be associated with the pandemic. Our selling prices were 1.4% higher with broader increases in our Performance Coatings reporting segment and more targeted activity in Industrial Coatings. Last, net sales were negatively impacted by unfavorable currency translation of more than 2% or about $75 million, as the U.S. dollar generally strengthened versus other emerging and major currencies. We expect unfavorable currency translation to continue into the second quarter and be in the range of $130 million to $150 million based on recent exchange rates. Looking at some of the business trends in the first quarter, in China, sales were down about 30%. Most of our end-use markets experienced significantly lower demand, including automotive OEM where regional builds were down about 50% in the first quarter. Since early March, in China, we've seen a measured recovery in demand patterns. Our factories in China have been running at 70% to 80% of capacity utilization for several weeks, moving closer to our 2019 levels and mirroring the needs of our customers demand. We've also learned a lot from the restart in China, which we'll be able to leverage and optimize as other countries are beginning to restart their economies over the coming weeks. In other parts of Asia, our business performed solidly in the first 10 weeks of the quarter and till the pandemic spread, which impacted several countries including Australia, India, and South Korea. In aggregate, sales volumes in the Asia Pacific region were down 20% in the first quarter. In aggregate, the EMEA region sales volumes declined by high-single-digit percentage compared to the previous year, driven by a lower demand in most end-use markets through the pandemic. The automotive OEM, automotive refinish, and industrial coatings business experienced the steepest declines due to customer shutdowns. Through mid-March, organic sales were slightly higher compared to prior year in the architectural EMEA coatings business, but this fell sharply as many countries in Southern Europe, including France mandated closures of retail paint stores. Our architectural business in Northern Europe performed solidly for the entire quarter, and our protective and marine coatings business had modest sales volume growth reflecting that a portion of these businesses are late-cycle in nature. In the U.S. and Canada region, sales volumes were down in mid-single-digit percentage, including the unfavorable impact from the pandemic. Sales volumes were strong in certain end-use markets, including packaging, and architectural DIY coatings businesses which we believe both will be more resilient through this crisis. In the U.S., the automotive OEM and refinish businesses were most impacted by the pandemic in the first quarter, with the vast majority of some favorable impact occurring in March. Finally, in our Latin America region, sales volumes were modestly lower down a single-digit percentage, as the pandemic had less impact on this region during the quarter. We saw a positive sales volume growth in both packaging coatings and Mexican PPG Comex businesses during the first quarter. During the quarter, about 25 new concessionaire stores opened in Mexico, bringing the total to approximately 4,800 stores, which I would remind you, has a much higher variable cost structure. From an earnings perspective, our first quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.19 is lower by $0.19 compared to the prior first quarter. As I said earlier, the estimated impact from COVID-19 reduced our adjusted EPS by $0.35. Despite our sales volumes being lower by 8%, our gross profit margin rose to 43.5% or 70 basis points higher on a year-over-year basis. This was supported by higher selling prices and continued excellent progress on cost savings from our previously announced restructuring programs. Unfavorable foreign currency translation during the quarter lowered earnings by more than $10 million, which is impacted by a broad number of currencies devaluated against the dollar, including the Mexican Peso that fell by about 20% in the quarter. Now let me ask Vince to provide some commentary on our liquidity position and some thoughts on the second quarter.
Vince Morales: Thank you, Michael. I also want to echo Michael's comments; I hope everybody is healthy and remaining safe. With regards to our financials, first, let me discuss our balance sheet. As we've discussed many times on these calls, we have a conservative approach to managing our balance sheet which is especially important during these times. As a quick reconciliation, I'll remind everyone that we ended 2019 with approximately $1.3 billion of cash and short-term investments on hand. We supplemented our beginning of the year cash balance with an $800 million mid-March borrowing from our revolving credit facility. This borrowing was completed out of an abundance of caution and our expectation of uncertainty in the debt capital markets. We subsequently ended March with an elevated cash and short-term investment balance of about $1.9 billion including the $800 million revolver proceeds. As we recently reported in mid-April, the company entered into a $1.5 billion, 364 day term loan and utilized a portion of the proceeds to fully repay the revolver borrowing with remaining $700 million in proceeds further supplementing our quarter end cash balance. The company's $2.2 billion revolving credit facility is currently undrawn. These strategic actions provide ample liquidity to weather this crisis for an extended period of time. Also during the first quarter, our commercial teams heightened their focus on cash. As a result, we lowered our working capital as a percent of sales by 120 basis points versus the first quarter of 2019. This included strong quarter ended accounts receivable collections in a rapid response to lowering demand through the minimization of our seasonal inventory build. With regard to receivables, we did increase our bad debt reserve during the first quarter reflecting uncertainty regarding the breadth of the crisis in eventual customers' liquidity especially for many small customers globally. To-date through April, near the end of April, we haven't experienced any unusual bad debt trends, and we will monitor this reserve accordingly. In the second quarter, we plan to continue to optimize our cash and overall liquidity. With respect to working capital, we expect to drawdown our finished goods inventory and are dramatically minimizing the purchases of raw materials based on our reduced manufacturing operating rates. This reflects the current lower coatings demand, we're experiencing. With respect to cash uses, as Michael mentioned, versus capital spending, and we're deferring all non-essential capital spending and currently anticipate full-year CapEx in a range of $200 million to $250 million. Second, we remain committed to rewarding our shareholders through dividend payments. And on April 16, our board approved a $0.51 per share dividend to be paid in the second quarter. Next, we will continue to look to optimize our short and long-term debt portfolio basis to capital debt markets and we've created flexibility to access these markets at the time of our choosing. Finally, given the low level of commercial visibility, we are currently prioritizing maintaining ample liquidity over acquisitions and share repurchases. We'll continue to monitor the external environment here. Before I turn back to Michael, I'll provide an update on what we're expecting commercially for the second quarter. As we look ahead overall, we are currently experiencing and continue to expect global economic activity to significantly contract in the second quarter. We then anticipate moderate demand improvement from this lower base level of demand as the year progresses and as economies begin the process of getting restarted. We have provided in today's presentation materials, our expected qualitative second quarter and pace of recovery expectations for each of our coatings businesses. These expectations are based on our past experience and what we are currently hearing from our customers relative to their potential to restart and our mid-term order books. Overall, we expect our aggregate coating volumes to decline 30% to 35% in the second quarter with shut down continuing throughout April and a large portion of May and measured start-up of activity later in the quarter. These estimates are obviously based on what we know today and will likely change as the quarter progresses. However, we wanted to provide as much real time information as reasonable to the investment community. Highest rates of demand decline will be in the U.S. and Europe followed by Latin America and partially offset by the early recovery underway in China. The detail on the presentation slide, we're expecting the packaging coatings, architectural DIY, protective and marine coatings businesses to be more resilient. Also, some sub segments in the general industrial business are expected to be resilient or even possibly grow. However, this will be more than offset by weak demand in other general industrial sub segments, activity declines in trade or professional painting, and very weak demand in automotive refinish and automotive OEM. Aerospace new build and aftermarket sub segments are also very weak, but partially offset by growth in military which represents about 30% of PPG's aerospace business. A few data points and anecdotes with regards to these assumptions. Global industry auto builds are expected to be down about 50% year-over-year in the second quarter. We do expect global auto builds to begin to recover from this very depressed level much more quickly than other end markets and are evidencing this currently in China where we still expect global auto builds to be done notably for the full-year. Both packaging coatings and architectural DIY have experienced strong margins -- strong March, excuse me, and good April demand matching similar trends that occurred in early 2008/2009 Great Recession. With stay-in-home mandates currently in place in many countries miles driven is expected to significantly fall year-over-year for the entire second quarter. Many of our body shop customers in Europe and the U.S. have been operating at less than 50% of their capacity for the past four to six weeks. Architectural trade and professional painting is currently impacted by the regional economic slowdowns and after initial surge as the regional quarantine mandates are lifted, demand is expected to remain somewhat subdued following more of a W-shaped recovery. About 30% professional trade painting is for commercial and non-residential activity. Maintenance represent the majority of this activity and we anticipate weak commercial maintenance with many of the larger key end-use markets such as hotels, hospitality, retail, restaurants, office complexes, universities and airports likely deferring painting. Start of new build commercial projects will continue where we expect an air pocket of activity once these in-flight projects are completed, likely later this year or nearly 2021. With regard to residential painting, which is about 70% of overall demand, the largest portion is also repainting, and some portion of this will likely be deferred or cancelled. This includes the effects of social distancing, along with end consumers repairing their individual balance sheets, which we also expect to have a knock-on effect and slow new home construction after the current in-process construction is complete. As I stated earlier, some of these lower trade business impacts will be offset by higher DIY, similar to what happened in 2009. Also, albeit still very small, we are seeing triple digit percentage increases in digital use by consumers. And our strategic move to more of a delivery model for architectural painting is being validated as most in the industry are now touting this as the primary fulfillment option. Finally, miles flown globally are down dramatically and demand for our aerospace products is heavily impacted especially in the aftermarket. Also, some of our OEM customers are beginning to resume production but delivery rates are expected to be lower than pre-crisis levels. And therefore, we expect an extended recovery timeline in our commercial aerospace, OEM, and aftermarket businesses. In addition, we've included some details what we are currently experiencing during the early stages of the China pandemic recovery in our presentation materials. Regionally demand continued to improve in China and is expected to return to growth in the second half of 2020. Consistent with the timing from the Great Recession, year-over-year auto builds in China are expected to be comparable in the second quarter and retail auto sales are increasing on a sequential basis now for a number of weeks, and approaching levels close to 2019. Other end-use markets in China are in different stages of recovery, but all are directionally improving. Also data shows that traffic congestion in China is nearing 2019 levels, which should a demand for auto refinish. Finally, we provided this further reference, our aggregate coating segment earnings trajectory during the Great Recession. During the depth of that recession, which was the first quarter of 2009, our coatings earnings declined about 66% on a volume decline of just over 20%. The current shape of this pandemic related economic crisis is broader given the abrupt near full stop of certain economic activity, which is why we expect volumes to be down 30% to 35% in the second quarter of 2020. As Michael mentioned, we're continuing to aggressively manage all elements of costs within our business, especially our variable and semi-variable costs. Approximately two-thirds of our cost structure is variable or semi-variable. Also, we continue to execute against our restructuring programs and expect about $20 million of incremental savings to be realized in the second quarter. We have accelerated many of the actions in these programs and now expect to achieve higher savings for the full-year 2020 of about $80 million to $90 million. We continue to closely monitor the macroeconomic environment and will be fully prepared to implement further cost reduction actions, if necessary. Our target is similar to the 2009 time period where we exited the Great Recession as a much stronger company. Finally, due to the heightened level of uncertainty, and lack of mid-term visibility, we have suspended all financial guidance previously provided. Now I'll turn it back over to Michael for some final thoughts.
Michael McGarry: Thank you, Vince. As we look ahead in the coming quarters, we will be faced with an evolving and uncertain economic environment. It's too early to predict the full picture and impact of the Coronavirus. In light of this uncertainty though, we continue to carefully reduce and manage costs and focus on cash generation, identify additional ways to simplify and streamline the business processes, and work with our customers meet their needs. As the environment begins to stabilize, we will have opportunities to create more value and fully leverage our scale for the benefit of our shareholders, customers, and employees. I'm confident that our team will deliver by using our diverse global footprint and continuing our focus on cash, margin management, and earnings. While we will be prudent, and defer some capital expenditures, we're continuing others that will help us support future organic growth. In addition, we remain committed to research and development investments in new technologies and digitization, which has proved to be effective with our customers as we exit this crisis. Most importantly, however is that PPG people are committed to operating safely and providing the products and services that our customers count on. That is what inspires us and we call it the PPG way. We will continue to prioritize the safety and wellbeing of our employees and support the communities where we do business. Finally, as I recently stated during our annual meeting at the center of our company's purpose statement as a commitment to protect and beautify the world. Today, the word protect is taken on even greater significance to all of us. We're focused on protecting our people, our customers, and all of our stakeholders. I'm confident that with the continued efforts of our people around the world, we will get through this unprecedented time together. Thank you for your continued confidence in PPG. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now Elisa, would you please open the line for questions?
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. The first question today comes from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning. Michael and Vince, how should we think about decremental margins both in Q2 and in the back half the year? They were quite high in Q1. I suspect they'll be high in Q2 but perhaps lower in the back half the year?
Vince Morales: Good morning, David. How are you?
David Begleiter: Good, thank you.
Vince Morales: This is Vince. I think one of the markers I’d look at is what we provided in the earnings information relative to Q1. We had about $90 million lower of segment earnings on $225 million lower sales for the segments. So, the decremental margins there were a bit more than we're accustomed to, but they reflected a somewhat non-traditional rapid decline in demand. A couple of points. We do have, as I mentioned, a high variable cost model in many of our businesses. As we look at Q2 though, just due to the nature of this crisis, we did -- we are effectively paying our employees for those who've been furloughed for their first two weeks. So, it's going to temper somewhat our ability to react to the lower demand on a cost basis. Also, given the staggered timeline of recovery by each of the regions, some of our businesses aren't able to as aggressively manage some of the cost falls, because we need global support as China is starting back up. With all that being said, I think we're hoping to do better than what we did in Q1 relative to the decrements, David. So, we're targeting a better or an improved decremental in Q2 than we had in Q1.
David Begleiter: Very helpful. And Michael just in the back half of the year, if the cadence recovery occurs as you expect, would you expect the 30% plus volume decline in Q2 to be cut in half in Q3, perhaps down 10% to 15% year-over-year?
Michael McGarry: David, I think it's a little early to predict that. We see a lot of positive signs in China. Now, of course, China has a lot more ability to control their environment than we do here in the States. They have apps that allow people to say that they're good to go into restaurants whether or not we develop anything like that here in the States, we'll be open to further discussion. But I would tell you everything I see in China, miles driven are up; flights in China are more full every day. There's more intra-China flights. So I see a lot of positives, but I think it's just too early to predict that.
Operator: The next question today comes from Ghansham Panjabi of R.W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Ghansham Panjabi: Yes, good morning. Thank you and I hope everyone's doing well.
Michael McGarry: We are indeed. Thank you, Ghansham.
Ghansham Panjabi: Good to hear. So I guess first-off on your outlook for 2Q volumes down 30% to 35%. Michael, just give us a sense as to how much of that decline is due to customers being flat out, just shut down for parts of the quarter. And related to that, how do you expect volumes to kind of play out by the month? I guess I'm asking because it looks like you're baking in some level of improvement in [indiscernible]?
Michael McGarry: Sure. And really, if you think about it by the major segments, our OEM guys are down in Europe and the U.S., and they won't be restarting until May 18. And even when they do come up, they've told us that they're going to run at slower rates as they try to figure out how to maintain the social distancing. So we factored that in. The second one of course is our large OEM Airbus and Boeing customers. Boeing has taken an extended period of downtime, Airbus is back up and running, but they each have cut their production rates. So that has an impact. And of course, MRO for the airline business is still unknown, right? So, we're going to wait and see. The good news is there are planes flying even if they're flying empty, they will need MRO. So, we'll be watching that carefully. If you look at refinish, I've noticed, and if you look at the gasoline sales of last week, gasoline sales have improved, so people are starting to drive more. What we will be really looking for is congestion to improve, so get back to a normal rush hour in the morning, rush hour in the afternoon, that'll be important to our business. So, I think those are the most important things. If you look at the rest of our customers, they're not really shut down. They're just having to moderate their production rates for the time being, so their ability to come back quicker will probably be likely. 
Vince Morales: Hey Ghansham, we're seeing staggered startups by region, different parts of our business, very public in the periodicals. So that we're making our best guess of what -- that's going to look like as we get further into the quarter here.
Ghansham Panjabi: Okay. And I guess for my second question on Slide 11, you basically have the financial crisis playbook. And so, looking specifically at 4Q 2008 and the first quarter of 2009, it looks like EBIT declined between three to four times the rate of volume declines. Obviously, the business portfolio has changed meaningfully since then. Can you just give us some insight on how the changes may -- the changes may -- in the portfolio may change the magnitude of these declines?
Vince Morales: Yes. We included on Slide 11, Ghansham, is the coating segments only. So, well we have different regional splits and businesses are different, a little bit different in size than they were then. And this is the coatings business only. As you can see volumes were down again, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks about 20% the first quarter of 2009, segment earnings were off over 60%. There hasn't been, I'd say a significant shift. We have lowered our breakeven points, and in many of our businesses with the restructurings we've done in the past couple of years, but this crisis is broader than what we saw in 2009. 2009 crisis was centered on housing and auto. This obviously affects some of our aftermarket businesses that were impacted but not to the degree they are. So it's really hard to draw complete comparison. But the point I'd make is we did lower our break evens in many of these businesses, so we're trying to manage around that.
Operator: The next question today comes from Christopher Parkinson of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Christopher Parkinson: Thank you. Hopefully, everybody's doing well. Just very quickly on the raw material fronts, you discussed depleting inventory due to the weaker demand environment. Can you discuss roughly on your implied raw material savings and whether or not you'll actually see the benefits in 2Q or if this is more -- if this is going to be more of a second half and potentially in the 1Q 2021 story. So just any color on what you expect like raw baskets would be incredibly helpful. Thank you.
Michael McGarry: Yes. So Christopher, the lower raw materials will not have a material impact on Q2, we're going to be buying very few raw materials, we were coming into our busy point of the season, right and the plants were gearing up for regular paint season. So inventories were moving up as they always do at that period of time. So now with lower demand rates, we have plenty of inventory. So the plants that will be starting up will be running at a lower rate. And plus, when you think about it from a LIFO and FIFO standpoint, a lot of those raw materials don't flow through for 50 or 60 days. So there would be minimal impact in Q2. You should expect to see more -- much more impact in Q3 in the back half of the year.
Christopher Parkinson: Thank you. And just a quick follow-up just on packaging. It does appear you're trending fairly well in the U.S. and EMEA. But you're still experiencing I should say a little bit of noise in Asia and China is improving one would assume that's now Southeast Asia. Can you just quickly run through just globally food versus beverage and then just highlight what's going on in Asia on a go-forward basis, please. Thank you very much.
Michael McGarry: Yes, so beverage is continuing to be strong. You probably saw the bev can numbers in the U.S., they were up 8% in the first quarter. Food was up 3%. Beverage up in Europe is up low-single-digits. Food is recovering. They had a bad year last year because of a weak harvest. So we expect them to be up low to mid-single-digits as well. We're seeing recovery in China. So that's providing some good tailwinds. So and then the other thing that you probably don't put a lot of recognition in but aerosols is a good segment for us. And so with aerosol cleaning products and things like that, that should also be positive. So all the demand trends in packaging are moving up.
Vince Morales: We are seeing in the second quarter though is Thailand is a big food pack region and we're seeing that down due to the virus.
Operator: Your next question comes from Kevin McCarthy of VRP. Please go ahead.
Kevin McCarthy: Yes, good morning. I think you made a comment that two-thirds of your costs were either variable or semi variable. Would you speak to the outliers in your portfolio in terms of businesses that would be materially above that level or materially below?
Vince Morales: Yes, Kevin, it's Vince. The businesses that have the highest variable cost structure, highest fixed cost structure, excuse me, are businesses where we have leases and employees like our architectural business, regardless of the demand up or down in a given day, it's hard to flex those businesses. The businesses that are strictly OEM have a higher variable cost structure. We are able to reduce our folks at those facilities based on demand. We're able to ratchet down production, there's typically less distribution involved, it's usually straight from our factory to their factory. So I bucket into the categories of lower, lower fixed cost those OEM businesses in our industrial segment.
Kevin McCarthy: Okay, that's helpful. And then on Slide 9, at the bottom, I think you provided a useful framework for the expected sequence of recovery in your various businesses. Can you speak to the OEM and refinish blocks there so to speak. But why is it that you would expect OEM to recover quicker than refinished? Is that based on the credit crisis experience or what you're seeing here today?
Michael McGarry: Yes, I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that the current aging of the fleet is almost 12 years. And we expect people to continue to want to buy new cars. We also see that happening right now in China. So if you think about China car sales, they've incrementally improved each of the last half a dozen weeks. And actually last week, they were almost flat with prior-year. And so our experience has been that people still need vehicles, there's a likely positive out of this is that people are going to shun public transportation for some period of time, which means they're going to want to either buy a new car or they're going to want to continue to maintain the car they have. So I think those are going to be positive for us coming out of this.
Vince Morales: And one other consideration, Kevin, is because the refinish business is a distribution business, we do know there's inventory in the chain. People were expecting as Michael alluded to earlier normal season. Typically, the distribution channels stock up ahead of spring, that stock up did occur. But then again, we have a rapid decline of demand. So we do know we'll have to work through inventory in the entire channel as well.
Operator: The next question comes from John Roberts of UBS. Please go ahead.
John Roberts: Thanks, and you guys all sound well, so that's good to hear. In the trade architectural paint or pro applied, you indicated that completion of in-progress construction would provide some help in the current quarter, is it possible that September quarter will be very depressed as well because once that rolls off, it'll offset recovery in some of the maintenance paying that might come back?
Vince Morales: Hey John, if you look at the normal commercial projects they are typically nine to 24 months or even longer -- even longer. So we expect those to carry-forward for the most part, certainly through Q3. They haven't been stopped, they'll be restarted and carry through Q3 if not in 2021. On the residential side, homebuilding occurs in weeks instead of months. So we do think after the current slate of homes are that are in-progress or constructed, we'll see a little bit of a void there. But that'll be again after probably the summer at a minimum.
John Roberts: Thank you. Do you expect trade paint to be sequentially up in the September quarter, I guess a different way to phrase it?
Vince Morales: To Michael's comment earlier, the visibility is just not there for us to make those comments on that far.
John Roberts: Okay. And then in the bad debt reserve, is that concentrated in any area? What kind of assumptions are you making there? Is it more dealers or auto body shops? Or what are you assuming in your bad debt?
Vince Morales: Yes. We went through the mix of customers we have. Globally, we did certainly look at it from a business and size of customer and their liquidity. So it's really a mix of all of our businesses and our expectations algorithmically against their metrics. Now, I'll point out, John, in 2008 and 2009, we didn't see a significant uplift in bad debt in that crisis. We did take this reserve because this crisis affects it's just broader and affects a lot of smaller customers differently than 2008/2009.
Operator: Next question comes from Michael Sison of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Michael Sison: Hey guys, glad you guys are all safe. It sounds, in terms of your stores, can you maybe talk about how many of your stores are shut down and what maybe what percent and maybe just run through what they've changed in terms of their ability to do business during this social distancing shut down type of environment?
Michael McGarry: Yes, so, Mike, you have to go by various regions around the world. So if you look in Italy, all our stores are closed and they're doing delivery. In France, we have -- we had gone through a period of time, the last two weeks of March and say the first two-and-a-half weeks of April where they were all closed, but now we've gotten permission to open up a few of them, and we have latent demand as soon as we open a store you can immediately see a pop in sales. So right now we have about, I would say about 40 stores open in France. And when you move over into the UK, they were mostly running all the way through near the end of March. And now we got probably about 40% of the stores are back open again. And again, you see a significant demand pull as soon as you can get a store open. So that helps us. We did not have to close any stores in Denmark, they had a record quarter, we had no store closures in the BENELUX, so that was also very solid performance. In the U.S. right now we have about 250 stores closed. But that is really more trying to not only comply with local regulations but also because we moved to a delivery model. It doesn't really matter whether the store is open or closed where we've moved to delivery. So the painters just want to know you get the product at the right place at the right time. So we'll continue to manage in that kind of environment.
Michael Sison: Right. And a quick follow-up on that, I know you won't feel the raw material impact or low raw materials for the second half of the year. But can you maybe talk about directionally given where oil is at what you see in the basket as you head into the second half of the year, is it going to be down double-digits and maybe -- maybe talk about each of the paint buckets in terms of the direction?
Michael McGarry: Well, I think right now, I think directionally it's all we're going to say right now is it's down. It will depend upon July 1 type pricing, because solvents are immediately passed through, we'll start to see some of the resins benefit. But at this point, I think, I would, given that it's going to be so little and we'll have another chance to talk again at the end of the second quarter, I think I'd rather defer when we have more visibility into that number.
Operator: The next question is from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Bob Koort: Thank you very much. I was wondering, if you guys look back at architectural to the financial crisis, I guess it was, at least for a period a shift towards DIY, maybe gaining some share. Sounds like maybe you think that's going to happen again, and I guess curious what kind of duration or impact you think that might have?
Michael McGarry: What we're seeing right now, Bob, the DIY numbers across our business are up significantly. And people they have free time on their hands. They want to get projects done. They're out there getting them done. We expect that to continue probably the whole summer. So I would say there's no likelihood that's going to stop anytime soon. And I think this has been consistent with when people nobody wants to be unemployed but when they're unemployed that gives them free time and that has been a positive force. Our DIY in Australia is up, our DIY in Europe is up, our DIY in Mexico is not much of a market but it's positive and certainly in the U.S., it's positive.
Bob Koort: And can I ask you on refinish? If we look back to the last financial crisis, you mentioned density is improving, but still not high enough on roads for collision rates. But is there some level of drifting by consumers such that when the collision rates climb, they still don't actually get their car fixed because they're trying to save that money or pocket that insurance money, is there going to be any delay in pick up there or did you not see that in the last economic crisis?
Michael McGarry: We did see that in the last economic crisis, Bob. It's probably too early to tell you right now what that's going to look like. Nobody is getting in an accident right now. But we'll be paying close attention to that. It's easy to tell because when you're driving down the road, you'll be able to see one and two panel accidents that aren't getting repaired, but we'll be paying a lot of attention to it.
Vince Morales: I think the duration of the last crisis, Bob, was a contributor to that. People weren't unemployed for a longer period -- long periods of time. We're certainly hopeful, we don't know but we're certainly hopeful the duration of this crisis is shorter.
Operator: Next question is from Frank Mitsch of Fermium Research. Please go ahead.
Frank Mitsch: Good morning, gentlemen and kudos on your charity efforts. I appreciate the commentary on the raw materials and the outlook. I just wanted to see the other side of that calculation on the -- your ability to raise pricing, you've done a really good job over the last couple of years with price increases in each quarter, et cetera. Must be a very difficult environment right now, how should we think about that side of the equation?
Michael McGarry: Frank, this is Michael. First of all, I hope you like to judge draft, so --
Frank Mitsch: Loved it. Thank you, loved it.
Michael McGarry: Okay. So I would tell you that we're sorry -- yes pricing, yes. When I think about pricing, it's going to hold in there. The reason why is when I think about the production rates for most of our employees, our customers they are going to be down. And so they're not going to have a lot of leg to stand on in regards to the production rates. The second thing is the raw materials from, started going up in fourth quarter 2016 all the way through the first quarter 2019, and therefore we haven't quite captured back all that pricing. And so I think from that standpoint, we're going to be in good, good shape. So I don't -- I do not anticipate the pricing fallen off. We still have some other price increases we're going to be doing later this year. So clearly with the currencies being weak, that we'll have opportunities in Latin America, we'll also have it in our refinish business later in the year. So I think from that standpoint, pricing will continue to be a positive force.
Frank Mitsch: Interesting, very interesting. And if I could -- if I could ask a question about the allowance for doubtful accounts obviously, that's something that you don't typically do, this sort of magnitude. Are there specific industries that you're most concerned about in that regard? How do we think about that? And well I guess it's too early to say is there scope for additional charges in the second quarter. But just based on what you've done in the first quarter, what are the industries that you're that you're most concerned about there?
Vince Morales: Yes, Frank we alluded to earlier. We're most concerned about small business who has less levers of liquidity. And that that goes across many of our regions. So we took a more detailed approach with respect to trying to understand those small businesses and their capability to withstand a crisis like this.
Frank Mitsch: All right. So we can exclude auto OEM and aerospace, et cetera and focus on some of the smaller customers?
Vince Morales: Well, we took some reserve in every one of our businesses and every one of our regions, but if you ask where we were heightened in terms of our concern in small businesses.
Operator: Your next question is from P.J. Juvekar of Citi. Please go ahead.
P.J. Juvekar: Yes, hi, good morning. Some of the painting projects for this point you've said could be delayed into the fall, they may slip into next year or get cancelled. And how do you think about those three buckets? And given that you slowed down utilization for your plants what is the inventory level in the channel for the spring? Thank you.
Vince Morales: P.J., I just tell you a little hard to hear you there. I think you asked about deferral or cancellation of projects into the spring or fall and again, we're getting information from our customers on a real-time basis. We do think as mandates, stay-at-home mandates are lifted, we'll see a surge of activity, projects that have been started are completed. There's certainly some pent-up demand as Michael alluded to, we're seeing in Europe as stores open there. But if you look at the reality is some of these hardest hit markets, especially in the commercial side, we expect to have a prolonged recovery. And in terms of their -- size of their business, and also in terms of their balance sheet repair. So those are the ones the maintenance work in any -- certainly any new commercial projects are ones where we expect to be either delayed or postponed or canceled.
P.J. Juvekar: Thank you. And then what about inventory levels, have you sold paint into the channel for the spring? And did you have to slow down your plant as a result and can you just update us on sort of inventories in the channel? Thanks.
Michael McGarry: P.J., I would say the only one that had significant inventory build would have been refinish. They had -- they anticipated a spring rebuild of the accidents that they had in the backlog. So now they're just working off the backlog. I would say that's the biggest one.
Vince Morales: And as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, our finished goods inventory was elevated which it normally is at that point in the season. So we're working that down as we go through Q2 into Q3 as well.
P.J. Juvekar: Okay. I just wanted to clarify something you said about raw materials. You said you will give more comments on second quarter, Michael. But does that I mean given that your volumes are down does it take longer for raw materials to flow through? Is that what you meant because you want to give guidance on second quarter? Thank you.
Michael McGarry: Yes. We won't get a lot of benefit in Q2. But when we talk to you again in July after the second quarter earnings are released, we can give more clarity on how it will flow through in Q3. I mean, typically raw materials flow through in that 50 to 60 day time period, but since we're going to be buying a lot less, we don't anticipate much benefit in Q2.
Operator: The next question is from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. In the 2009 recession, you were really able to move your SG&A expenses down pretty rapidly. But you're a leaner company than you are now or than you were then. So order of magnitude is your goal to try to knock your SG&A costs down maybe 15% year-over-year for the next three quarters, or do you have a different goal?
Michael McGarry: Yes, Jeff, we're certainly looking today at all of our discretionary cost items. The one thing that we don't know is the duration of this crisis. And as I mentioned, I think with the first question, we are seeing staggered startups. So in 2008/2009 everything was down for an extended period of time and we've worked our cost accordingly. Here it's a little more dynamic. And we're certainly trying to manage our costs aggressively. As you mentioned, we mentioned our break-even points are lower. So it's going be a little more difficult till we understand the duration of the crisis.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay. I guess for my follow-up, can you tell me what were the volumes like in your domestic store network in April?
Michael McGarry: Yes, there if you look at that segment right now, they're probably down 15% through the first 27 days. I would tell you that it's a different mix than what we typically see. So a lot of that also has to do with like res repaint, people are not able to get into homes to do that type of work. You're seeing a lot less maintenance type work because of obviously the hotels aren't going to be spending any money. So it's a little early to tell you whether or not all these trends are going to continue. But I certainly think that the likelihood of lower maintenance especially in anything in the hospitality segment is going to continue to be significantly negatively impacted.
Operator: The next question is from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you and nice to hear everyone's voice this morning. If I could just ask you on two specific raw materials TiO2 and propylene. The TiO2 looks like itself flat for the second quarter in most regions, despite obviously very challenging development conditions. And propylene holding up quite well despite the decline in oil prices. Some suggest that's a function of slower refinery runs and therefore less refinery grade propylene. So just any thoughts on whether you think those dynamics will break down over time as the sort of the lower volume demand works their way into the S&D balance or if these are going to be a little stickier this time around?
Michael McGarry: Well, let's start with TiO2. We're convinced that this is a supply demand driven market. I'm sure we're hearing a lot about costs on their side about ore. Frankly, that's kind of a red herring. So we are seeing lower TiO2 prices for Q2 not as much as it should be, but we're still working the system there. Demand obviously in the second quarter is going to be down considerably on the paint side, which is their largest end-use market. So we'll be shifting suppliers around to able to make sure we get the lowest TiO2 price. From a propylene standpoint, it's not just propylene; it's the downstream derivatives of the resins. And so on that side, that will be long as well. So we're anticipating that we'll continue to see some price relief in that area although that won't be a significant purchase in the second quarter like it normally is.
Vincent Andrews: And as a follow-up, Vince, on working capital, impressive that you took 120 basis points of sales out so quickly given the unprecedented nature of what took place late in the quarter. So can you just level set us on sort of how we should expect that to progress through the balance of the year? Have you already fully implemented your plan or is there more to come in the second quarter or just how should we be modeling that?
Vince Morales: Yes, again the visibility here in Winslow and our operations teams deserve a lot of credit. They reacted and are reacting exceptionally quickly to the environment. As Michael mentioned, we're measuring the start-up of our facilities around customer demand. It's just too early to predict on what the drawdown will be of our finished goods. We have to see the demand patterns more fully in order to understand the working capital impacts. It's certainly a high focus for the company as it is at every company.
Operator: The next question is from Kevin Hocevar of Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.
Kevin Hocevar: Hey, good morning, everybody. Glad to hear everybody's safe. On Slide 9, curious on how you select the mix of product line performance to impact your margins here because on Slide 9, you show that aerospace and refinish are likely to be the slowest to recover, which I believe are two of your higher margin businesses. So curious if you could comment on the mixed impact to your margins?
Vince Morales: Yes, Kevin, if you look at the segments, obviously there are several businesses on this slide that we say a higher volume impact that are in our performance segment -- performance coating segment which does have higher margins. So that is a negative mix impact as you alluded to. The businesses we expect to recover quicker have been in the industrial segment, that segment got hit hard in Q1. We do expect again some progression as we get to late Q2 and early Q3 in terms of the margins in that segment. I think your analysis is accurate.
Kevin Hocevar: Okay. And then curious on the corporate expense, it looks like you're guiding at $40 million -- or is it $45 million to $50 million in the second quarter, which looks like the first half is tracking up quite a bit versus the first half of last year. I think last year it was $90 million, this year it's on track to $105 million to $110 million. Why is that up that much? Is that where bad debt expense is showing up? Or -- because I think with incentive comp reversals, and I think there's some stock-based comp in there that would drive that down. So just curious why that's running higher?
John Bruno: Hey, Kevin, this is John. So I would remind everybody, it's slower than what we guided to in January. In the first quarter of last year was a lower historical first quarter. So this first quarter came in, more in line to where we are typically in Q1. And I would say Q2 is forecasted to be a little bit lower than a normal Q2. So we do have some initiatives. We're still funding digitalization, which Michael talked about in his opening remarks is a new program that we're funding out of corporate. So we have some example like that that also impacted.
Operator: The next question is from Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Arun Viswanathan: Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Happy to hear everyone is safe and sound for now. I guess I just wanted to ask about the 30% to 35% volume decline in Q2, is there a way you could potentially size your business maybe into three buckets, automotive, architectural, and industrial? And what's the typical lead time that you have in the -- in those areas? And maybe automotive you'd have to switch into refinish and OEM but what's a typical lead time and I'm just trying to gauge your confidence level in that 30% to 35%. Would you consider that kind of a conservative estimate? Or could it end up being better or worse than that? And then again, maybe just to help us with by vertical? Thanks.
Michael McGarry: Yes. So that number is our current best estimate. If you think about automotive, we're just in delivery business. Now we do have some inventory on hand that we were going to be delivering in late March when they abruptly shut down. So we'll be asking our auto guys to take that inventory first, so automotive paint has aging requirement to it. So we try to make sure that we give them the fresher stuff. But otherwise we're -- they're placed in orders. I always tell people in the automotive, they give us a 60-day outlook, which is probably 80% accurate, a 30-day outlook, which is 90% and then a week or two before its 100% accurate. So right now, we're still sitting upwards of 21 days before they're starting up. So what they have given us a start-up number, we've factored that into the estimate that we gave you. We've looked at demand. And so we anticipate that they will ramp-up rates throughout the back half of the second quarter, so that's how we factor that for automotive. For refinish, we think the orders will be light given the fact that there's no density, no congestion, no miles driven. And so we're anticipating that we won't see significant inventory in the refinish side until the back half of the quarter. We obviously commercial transport, light industrial coatings, we're going to continue to see those. And then on the architectural side, those orders are placed the day before. So, they don't give you a lot of notice. You do know when the big projects are coming. So you're geared up for the big projects. But the day-to-day kind of stuff, they show up and tell you what they need, place their orders by noon, pickup 7 A.M. So we expect that to continue that order pattern, we don't expect to get a lot of visibility differently than we're getting now.
Arun Viswanathan: Okay, that's helpful. Then just on the margin front. When you look at the Q1 margins they held relatively well, all things considered. When you consider the cost actions that you're accelerating what -- how should we think about the decremental margins are in Q2? Is there opportunity for those to be slightly better than what you've experienced from the COVID losses in Q1? Thanks.
Vince Morales: Yes. Again, as we mentioned earlier, that's certainly our target. There's some things working against that. But we're certainly targeting to improve versus the $90 million segment earnings decline on the $225 million sales decline that we experienced in Q1.
Arun Viswanathan: Anyway to potentially quantify that or help us figure out how to do that?
Vince Morales: Again, only I tell you, Arun, as I said at the outset of the question-and-answer session, so there's things working for us and things working against us, we have more time to be planful and have implemented discretionary cost controls that we didn't have at our benefit in March. But we again are being respectful of those folks being furloughed. And as I mentioned, there's a stage start-up going on. And we do have some costs that are global in nature that we need now in China and hopefully need them in Europe in the next coming weeks.
Operator: The next question is from Duffy Fischer of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Duffy Fischer: Hey good morning, folks. Question just around a couple of your end markets and your customers there. You talked about maybe the potential on the debt side for those small contractors. But if you look at auto refinish, if you look at contract or architectural, how do you judge the health of those customers of yours? Were they able to get some of the money from the government? Are you setting up funding plans for them? And if you use 2009 as an example, did you see significant consolidation and kind of customers going away in a reset of that model?
Michael McGarry: So from the architectural side, no we are not funding our painters. We're certainly more than happy to work with them. Right now, there still is a fair amount of commercial; there is backlog out there that they're going to work out. The question is, when does that backlog go away? They also have variable cost structures. So they hire painters during the busy season and then let them go as the season winds down. So they have the opportunity to manage their cost structure from that regard. So we'll be watching it. We do think that this could lead to more MSO type activities from the body shops. Clearly that's a benefit for us if that happens, and when that happens. So we'll be watching out for that. But the small body shops, I would say, they also have somewhat of a variable cost structure as well. But I would anticipate that they would be applying for the PPP money to support them in this regard.
Duffy Fischer: Okay. And then, if we could just focus on the Comex business in Mexico, with the fallen the Peso and they seem to be a little bit slower on the COVID response, how would you judge the health of the Mexican business? And then what are the costs down there that are somewhat dollar-based versus the cost structure that's Peso-based down there?
Michael McGarry: So from a raw material standpoint, Duffy, about now call it 60% of the raw materials are dollar-based. So hence that's why we'll be able to pass-through a price increase down there to offset that here in the near-term. When you think about the rest of the business, our concessionaire network is not owned by us. It's owned by our partners. And so we don't have that big fixed cost structure that's hanging over our heads down there. What I can tell you right now is that the sellout in April is actually pretty good. We have about 1,200 stores that are operating what we call curtain down. So you can't physically walk in the store. But only 250 of those 1,200 are actually not delivering. So the vast majority of them are still delivering products. So, that is continuing to progress. And I would tell you, our overall Mexican team is somewhat cautious though because the current government is not as pro-business, as the prior government. And so we think that the back half of the year will be a little bit more challenging. Construction projects that are underway will probably be completed. But there's not a whole lot of new big stuff being started. And so that does give us a little pause for concern. So we're going to be watching that very carefully.
Operator: The next question is from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Laurence Alexander: Hi there. Two quick questions. Can you talk to us about incremental margins on the recovery if you expect any significant difference between Europe and the U.S. and secondly with the successes or the learnings that you've had from the shift to the delivery model? How should we think about this longer term? Do those volumes switch back to the stores on the restart or is the goal to grow that? And is the cost to the consumer similar or lower than purchasing through the stores?
Michael McGarry: Laurence, I would say that the incremental margins on the way up in Europe and the U.S. will be somewhat similar; they should be on the higher end of the spectrum. So that will be a positive. From the delivery aspect, as you know, we've been a proponent of the delivery model for some time now; we're working with our premier authorized dealer network. We had a good quarter from that standpoint in the first quarter. So we think the delivery model will continue. And right now, once our customers get used to it, I think that trend line will continue. Obviously, we've tried to convince the owners of the businesses that when their painters come in our stores, they're not painting, they're not getting paid. And so the more that we can keep them out on the job site, the better it is for the owners. And I think they're going to start to see that become more evident in their business, so I think this is a long-term trend that's going to continue.
Operator: The next question is from Mike Harrison of Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.
Mike Harrison: Hi, good morning. The increase in restructuring number to me that implies a structural cut that isn't including areas like reduced travel and entertainment, furloughs, other discretionary cutbacks that you're kind of temporarily reducing. So can you just verify that those temporary reductions are not included in that restructuring number and how much could we be talking about in terms of SG&A savings from these furloughs and other temporary cutback?
Vince Morales: Yes, Mike, the restructuring savings that we cited does not include these other discretionary costs. We haven't itemized or sized that level. Again, it's going to be part of the tempering we're going to try to do on the decremental margins that I alluded to several times.
John Bruno: Hey, Mike, this is John. Just this is the second time; we've got an SG&A question. So I just want to remind folks that in the financial assumptions slide, we did provide a range of 28% to 29% for SG&A for Q2. So we did want to give you some help in modeling. So that might be a number you can take a look at.
Mike Harrison: All right, thanks very much. And then kind of a two part question on aerospace. Number one, you've mentioned, I believe the aftermarket business about half of your business in aerospace, you mentioned that planes are flying empty, but a lot of them are still flying. So how much lower is the aftermarket business versus normal? And then the second piece of the question is does this downturn fundamentally alter the long-term secular positive view that we've had on new commercial aircraft?
Michael McGarry: So right now, just to be clear like 60% of the global fleet is parked. So that is an unprecedented number from that standpoint. Your estimation of the aftermarket is relatively a good number. So you can continue with that kind of number. Right now, we're not thinking that this is a fundamental shift in the aerospace business. The global trends are going to continue I think. I think the fact that you're seeing all these people want to get up and get out of their houses reinforces that. We're seeing travel intra-China continuing to grow every week. So we do not see a fundamental shift. Now I do think the order book for the big OEMs will be materially lower because they're going to obviously going to try to figure out what their exact needs are. And right now they have no cash. So they will be looking to cancel some of that. So you have seen a significant cancellation. If you look at the net new orders for Boeing, they were minus 307, if I remember, right. Airbus did have some net new orders. So, the backlog I think will come down. But I think overall, this is still a good industry for us.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.
John Bruno: Thank you. I would like to thank everyone for their time and interest in PPG and please remain safe and healthy. If you have any further questions please contact our Investor Relations department. This concludes our first quarter earnings call.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-01-16 14:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon and welcome to the PPG Industries Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Chad and I will be your conference specialist today. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Bruno, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
John Bruno: Thank you, Chad, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG and welcome you to our fourth quarter 2019 financial results conference call. Joining me on the call from PPG are Michael McGarry, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vince Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our comments relate to the financial information released on Thursday, January 16, 2020. I will remind everyone that we have posted detailed commentary and presentation slides on the investor center of our website ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide additional support to the opening comments Michael will make shortly. Following Michael's perspective on the company's results for the quarter and for the full year and a brief financial update from Vince, we will move to a Q&A session. Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements, reflecting the company's current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ.  The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation slides, which are available on our website, reconciliations to these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC. Now, let me introduce PPG's, Chairman and CEO, Michael McGarry.
Michael McGarry: Thank you, John, and good afternoon everyone. We appreciate you joining us on our call. Today, we reported fourth quarter and full-year 2019 results. Before we review the results, let me just make a few additional comments. We are very pleased with our financial performance for the quarter and the full-year as we delivered strong year-over-year results in the face of weakening global manufacturing activity. We delivered record fourth quarter and full-year adjusted EPS and our full-year results were in the middle of the financial guidance we gave last January despite softer global economy. Additionally, we continue to execute on our long-term strategic and cash deployment initiatives focused on shareholder value creation. These initiatives included the completion of several acquisitions, which expanded our technology reach and customer intimacy and our legacy rewarding our shareholders, including the 48th year of annual per share dividend increases. We continue to invest about 3% of our sales in research and development and progress the commercialization of new products and technologies allowing us to deliver above market growth in several of our businesses. We will continue to communicate our progress on these initiatives and in new key products for 2020. More tactically, we begin 2020 continuing to benefit our aggressive and decisive operational management, including achievement of our self-help commitments from our cost savings program as we delivered by 85 million for the full year higher than previously committed target. In addition, we delivered record cash from operations in 2019 of about 2.1 billion including further reductions in working capital. Our strong 2019 performance was possible due to our broad business portfolio supplying both the OEMs and aftermarket, along with individual consumers and individual industrial customers in all major regions. I also want to thank the dedicated PPG team that remains focused on delivering value-added services and technologies for these customers all around the world. And let me summarize the financial details we released earlier today. For the fourth quarter, our net sales were nearly $3.7 billion, up about 1% in constant currencies. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.31, which represents a 14% increase versus last year’s fourth quarter. This is our second consecutive quarter of adjusted earnings per share growth of more than 10% with EPS up 14% this quarter and 15% in the prior quarter. For the quarter, our segment margins improved about 160 basis points versus last year and are up 120 basis points for the full-year despite broad contraction in the global manufacturing activity that worsened as the year progressed. As one data point, actual global industry automotive builds in 2019 were about 10% lower than projected at the beginning of 2019.  Our segment results benefited from continued selling price realization and strong cost management. Last, we continued our unwavering support of our customers all over the world and continued to advance our sustainability initiatives. I’m very proud that PPG earned the Ecovadis Gold Rating for corporate and social responsibility progress. Our team will continue to prioritize these programs and will provide a full update when we issue our 2020 sustainability report in the spring. Now, let me ask Vince to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter and full-year results as the guidance we communicated earlier today.
Vince Morales: Thank you, Michael. Again, just to renew the fourth quarter results, our net sales as Michael mentioned were about $3.7 billion, up about 1% year-over-year. That consisted of sales volumes, which were down 3%, reflecting the weakened global industrial production environment that Michael mentioned. This include a global automotive OEM production and many of our general industrial end use markets, which declined in the quarter and they were most pronounced – the declines were most pronounced in the U.S. and European regions. Our aggregate selling prices were up nearly 2% marking the seventh consecutive quarter with selling prices of about 2%. We have announced additional selling price increases in several of our businesses heading into 2020 and we will continue to work with our customers to ensure we are receiving fair value for the products and services we supply. Summarizing some business trends for the fourth quarter, our Performance Coatings reporting segment, Aerospace coatings continued to deliver very strong volume growth, outpacing industry performance in both the U.S. and Asia regions. This caps off what has been a truly excellent year for this business, which well outperformed strong industry gains. This reflected increased customer demand for our specific technologies. Automotive refinish organic sales were higher with solid growth in the U.S. offset partially by weaker volumes in Europe where customers continued to closely manage inventory levels. Our SEM acquisition has delivered strong financial performance in its first year and we are now commercializing various keys SEM products in certain international markets providing us with further growth opportunities. The soft trading conditions in Europe impacted our architectural coatings, the EMEA business as we experienced lower sales volumes partially offset by higher selling prices. Despite this very challenging economic environment in Europe, during this past year, the business was able to grow organic sales for the full-year. In Latin America, our PPG Comex business increased organic sales aided by improved selling prices. Sales volumes improved sequentially versus the prior quarter, but remained generally soft year-over-year as consumer demand reflected overall lower Mexican economic activity. For the year, PPG Comex delivered another strong financial performance growing both sales and earnings in this reduced economic climate. We also added 160 new stores in 2019 bringing our regional total to about 4,800 concessionaire locations. Organic sales volumes in architectural coatings U.S. and Canada increased modestly with positive sales in most channels during the quarter, including our U.S. same store sales. This is traditionally a slower quarter seasonally. Led by continued strong growth in the Asia region, our protective and marine coatings business delivered above industry sales, volume growth of a mid-single digit percentage during the quarter. We expect sales to remain at elevated levels in the first quarter, although growth rates will be moderated given the strong prior year comparisons. In our Industrial Coatings segment, overall sales volumes were down about 6% in the quarter reflecting the weak industrial demand. In China, automotive sales fell in December marking 18th consecutive monthly declines and in Europe manufacturing activity contracted for the eleventh consecutive month. We have implemented aggressive cost actions in reflection of this lower demand and despite the lower volumes year-over-year, our segment earnings were higher for the quarter and for the full year. As we look at individual business units, PPG’s automotive OEM sales volumes were lower by mid-single digit percentage, consistent with the industry rate. Our automotive OEM business continued to realized higher selling prices in the quarter and for the year. Weak global industrial production activity impacted most of our general Industrial Coatings business subsegments. And our packaging coatings sales volumes decreased as higher beverage can demand was more than offset by continued weakness in food can demand. From an overall PPG perspective, our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $1.31, our adjusted effective tax rate was about 24% for the quarter, similar to our adjusted tax rate for the year. Our results were supported by broad increases in selling prices, improved manufacturing performance in cost, and excellent progress on cost savings programs as we delivered more than $20 million against these cost savings programs during the quarter, slightly ahead of our targets. The acquisitions we made over the over the past 12 months also contributed positively the earnings in the quarter. We recently added the acquisition of Texstars, a manufacturing of higher performance transparencies and wing tip lenses for aerospace and defense vehicles. We also recently announced the acquisition of ICR, a manufacturer of automotive refinished products. Now, I’ll quickly comment on our full-year results from continuing operations. Our full-year sales were $15.1 billion. Our full-year 2019 adjusted earnings per share were $6.22, which was up 5% versus 2018. Excluding foreign currency translation, our adjusted earnings per share were up about 8%, firmly within the 2019 earnings guidance we provided last January. Most of the growth and earnings was driven by our strong operating discipline and generated higher segment operating margins each quarter this year. Specifically, our industrial coatings segment achieved 5% earnings growth despite sales being up $175 million for the year. Additionally, each of our major regions improved operating margins. As Michael mentioned, we continue to focus on cash deployment in 2019 and are pleased to announce or completed various acquisitions over the past 12 months. These acquisitions have had aggregate annualized revenue of about $500 million of which $100 million is in Asia Pacific. We realized just over $300 million of acquisition sales in 2019 and expect the remainder to occur in 2020. In addition to acquisitions, we repurchased $325 million of PPG stock during the year of which $150 million was completed in the fourth quarter. Before I turn it over the Michael, I’m going to review some of our 2020 financial guidance. Let me briefly cover some of our current economic expectations regionally. We anticipate overall positive economic growth to continue in the U.S. and Canada as levels generally similar to 2019. This is being aided by accommodative interest rates that remain supportive of the construction markets and also stability in the regional auto market. Latin America, we anticipate modestly improved economic expansion in Mexico versus a lackluster 2019. And in South America, we also expect modest economic improvement. Automotive builds in China are expected to fall more than 10% in the first quarter and industrial production demand conditions in India are forecasted to be challenging earlier in 2020. However, we do anticipate growth improving overall in Asia as the year progresses, and demand trends in the region, in the later half of the first quarter following Chinese New Year will be an important measurement of the region’s prospects. Economic growth in Europe is expected to remain subdued overall and varied by country. We expect the potential for greater volatility and automotive builds throughout the year, due to the onset of new emission standards as the year progresses. We have included in today’s presentation materials, available on our website, a summary of specific financial assumptions. These are included on Slide 11 and 12. As we included on our earnings press release issued earlier today, we expect full-year 2020 sales growth in local currencies of 1% to 3%. This includes the acquisitions I discussed earlier. We also expect full-year 2020 EPS growth of 4% to 9%, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. We fully acknowledge the earnings guidance range is wide and this is primarily due to the current high level of uncertainty as the year begins. Imbedded in our guidance are the following key elements. We expect continued soft industrial demand in Europe and the U.S. in the early portion of the year. Automotive production globally is expected to remain challenging, including weak Q1 China production, forecast, which were revised further down as early as this week. Additionally, we don’t have visibility on overall China demand trends this early in the year with forecasting increasingly difficult given the early Chinese New Year, which is about a week away. Our guidance also includes updated first half 2020 Aerospace OEM production forecast which has tilted lower. Additionally, despite the lethargic economic backdrop, our raw material costs have remained stubbornly high relative to overall supply and demand in reflecting recent crude oil volatility. Also, included in our guidance are any favorable impacts from the recently approved U.S. China trade agreement, the pending U.S. MCA trade agreement over the benefit of reduced uncertainty regarding Brexit. It is certainly too early for us to access what impact, if any, these noteworthy regional items will have. Also, given all the self-help actions the past 18 months, any increase in volume PPG realizes, we expect to translate into strong earnings contributions giving our strong operating leverage. In addition to general items I just mentioned, following our PPG’s specific assumptions. First is a carryover impact from acquisitions that we completed during 2019 and the full-year impact of the recently announced ICR acquisition we expect about 170 million in sales from the acquisitions in year 2020. These acquisitions will typically deliver at or below segment margins as we work to fully integrate their operations in the PPG. We are forecasting continued general inflation, including higher wages, medical and logistics costs. We are closely monitoring the cost environment for our raw materials with the recent spikes in crude oil prices. We are working with our customers for targeted additional selling prices in 2020. As referenced earlier, we are still completing our 2018 and 2019 restructuring programs. We anticipate these programs will deliver an incremental 75 million in combined savings in 2020. We expect our annual corporate cost to increase, including general inflation and we expect the increase to this general inflation and higher management incentive comp as we accrue at targeted bonus levels. Next, we anticipate the company’s 2020 tax rate on ongoing earnings from continuing operations to be 22% to 24%. The comparable rate for 2019 was 24%. As the year progresses, we will work to tighten the tax rate based this current information, including geographic earnings forecast. We also provided EPS guidance specific to the first quarter. This guidance was $1.32 to $1.42 and this does include a modest unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. This also includes a modest impact from large aerospace customers announced production curtailment. We continue to manage our capital expenditures based on the basis to current economic climate and a budget of our spending to be [2.5% to 3%] of sales consistent with our 2019 range. As I mentioned, the summary of these and other financial assumptions are contained in the presentation material for today’s call. And now, I’ll turn the call back over to Michael for some final comments.
Michael McGarry: Thank you, Vince. As we look at the current year, while there continues to be geopolitical concerns and some lingering uncertainty over trade activity, we were optimistic that the global economy will grow in 2020. However, given the heightened uncertainty, we will continue to aggressively manage all elements within our control and we continue to target EPS and cash flow growth supported by achieving aggregate segment margins that we maintain prior to this recent inflationary cycle, which we believe this is achievable in the back half of 2020. We’re expecting that better visibility on demand trends by the end of the first quarter and we will adjust our guidance as necessary. Strategically, we will continue to pursue organic and inorganic growth opportunities. We have a strong track record of creating shareholder value and acquisitions and we intend to remain active, but methodical. We have an excellent balance sheet and will remain consistent with what we said in 2019 that we don’t intend to let excess cash growing our balance sheet, but we will remain disciplined in deploying this resource. Finally, while our guidance is reflected by uncertainty of when the industrial demands will improve, I am confident and our 2019 results solidified that PPG remains well positioned strategically and financially to deliver increased value to our shareholders and worldwide customers supported by our outstanding team differentiated industry expertise, broad foot print and product innovation engine. In conclusion, I want to recognize our employees around the world for their outstanding contributions. We have a strong engaged and dedicated global team. Every day our employees are focused on delivering results the PPG way by partnering with customers to create mutual value. They make it happen and work hard to do better today than yesterday every day. This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, we appreciate your interest of PPG and now Chad would you please open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question will be from Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Christopher Parkinson: Thank you. Just real quick on the price cost, can you comment on your just any broad expectations for the resin basket, and anything on TiO2 just – and on the former and on any puts and takes regarding Chinese supply, including winter operates? Any changes in your views on environmental and safety and just trends in the New Year, just anything you could add to your expectation would be greatly appreciated? Thank you.
Michael McGarry: Okay. Christopher, I'll try to get all those questions. Let's start with TiO2. I don't expect this to be a topic we’ll talk about this year, obviously there is one supplier out there that's cutting rates. The rest of the guys are out there supplying. At this point in the cycle, you need to expect to see lower prices. It's been still kind of hanging flat, but I think the underlying fundamentals of supply and demand would echo reduction in that over time, but I would just say that, that should be a non-event this year. I would say that propylene and ethylene, the things that go into resins continue to be well supplied. I would tell you that I'm cautiously optimistic that there'll be some moderation, but it's a little bit too early to tell the crude oil prices are, as you know under a lot of fluctuation volatility right now with the world. So, it's hard to pin that number down right now. China is moderating production rates and varied by province. And so, it's not always easy to predict when they will have a blue-sky day, but they do periodically do ask for people to moderate their production in order to help facilitate the environment over there.
Christopher Parkinson: Great and just a quick follow-up on aero. Just given the customer production disruption and noise in the growth rate, can you just break down just, you know commercial any private exposure versus military in particular? And then also just anything to add on recent acquisition performance and services? Thank you.
Michael McGarry: So, we have a very broad aerospace business. We're into the transparencies, adhesives and sealants and coatings and now with the acquisition of Dexmet lightning protection. So, we don't have any one customer that dominates our sales, but the recent customer announcement is impactful and that you'll see our aerospace growth rates still being very positive and still being better than the industry, but not quite at the high-single digits, I said it was earlier in the year. But I would tell you that we're really pleased with aerospace business, they had a record year. And I anticipate them having another record year in 2020.
Christopher Parkinson: Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Bob Koort with Goldman – I'm sorry, it's Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Ghansham Panjabi: Yes, thank you. Hi, everyone. I guess, first off, the comment that industrial activity in China began to stabilize in your fourth quarter, can you just give us more context on that, which specific end market stabilized and do you think the stability reflected any pull-forward from the timing of the Chinese New Year in 2020?
Michael McGarry: So, I would say, it was pretty broad. We saw some benefits in the appliances. Of course, it was less negative in automotive. It's potentially a possibility that there was a pull forward for Chinese New Year, given it's much earlier this year and it's really too early to tell that. Right now, we did see November was better than October and December was better than November. So, that's a good question to come back to us in March after we return from the Chinese New Year and have a little more visibility into it.
Ghansham Panjabi: Okay. And then Michael, your comments on margins for 2020 approaching levels prior to the current – the recent inflation cycle, I guess in context of the uncertainty still obviously demand in 4Q and your early quarter expectations for 1Q anyway, I guess what gives you confidence in being able to approach those levels as the year unfolds with this current macroeconomic backdrop? Thanks.
Michael McGarry: We were – in this past quarter, our volumes were down 3% and our margins improved by more than 150 basis points. So, if you start to put any volume on the bottom line, you should expect to see the Industrial Segment margins significantly improve. So, you've already seen us close the gap on the performance coatings side and I think you should expect to see us continue to close that gap on the Industrial Segment side.
Vince Morales: Yes, this is Vince. Two other elements there. One, we are doing targeted pricing across the portfolio in the regions and in addition, as I mentioned in my opening comments, we do have additional cost savings projected for 2020 that we're comfortable we will realize.
Ghansham Panjabi: Yes. Thank you so much Michael and Vince.
Vince Morales: Thank you.
Michael McGarry: Thanks.
Operator: The next question will be from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Bob Koort: Thank you. I was wondering, you guys talked about 6% volume erosion in industrial in the fourth quarter, is there any element of that that can be destocking or is there any hope that maybe if you go through 2020 you could get a little restocking or is that not really an element of your product lines?
Michael McGarry: Yes, Bob, we do know similar to PPG, people who are working down their inventory levels as we ended the year really reflection of the tepid environment out there. We do believe our customers are holding low [end] [ph] stock of their products. So, if there is a pickup or recovery, we do feel there'll be at least a modest inventory rebuild, but those will be the two elements that we're aware of.
Bob Koort: And Vince, you guys gave some specific quantitative guidance for next year, which is, – which is helpful. I guess when I triangulate when you talked about acquisitions and then the carry through the price efforts you made in 2019, it suggests no real volume growth. I think, Michael, you asserted that you've got confidence that the economy will grow. So, can you help me understand that disconnect?
Michael McGarry: I think the big disconnect right now Bob is, two segments that are important for us are automotive. So, you just saw the downgrade on where they're anticipating China being down more than 10%. You have Europe that's going through the transmission or the emission change on the engines. So, that's a big uncertainty. Right now, it's too early to call, heavy duty equipment. I think the recent signatures in Washington yesterday will help the farmers, but I don't think they'll immediately start buying equipment, but I do think that will come over time. And then you certainly have aerospace, there is a significant demand for new planes. They're not being met right now. So, hopefully over time that will get back on track. And we do know that the military side of aerospace is going to continue to be pretty strong.
Bob Koort: Got it. Thanks for the help.
Michael McGarry: Thanks, Bob.
Vince Morales: Thanks, Bob.
Operator: The next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Michael, looking at the M&A pipeline, does the fact we bought back shares in Q4, signal any change in the M&A pipeline or your expectations in that area?
Michael McGarry: David, no change. We have a very strong pipeline of acquisitions, we're looking at, but we also generated a lot of cash. We know that we always generate a lot of cash in the fourth quarter. We've committed that we're not going to let that cash sit on the balance sheet. So, we took some of that cash off the sidelines and bought back stock. We can continue to do both, right now, as you know, we still prefer acquisitions, but it just seemed like a prudent thing to do given the amount of cash that we knew was coming into the fourth quarter.
David Begleiter: Very good. And just on packaging coatings, in Slide 5, you highlighted it was below market in all four regions in Q4, did you lose share in that business in Q4?
Michael McGarry: I would say marginally, it's more of a matter of the mix. We are much bigger in what I would call food and MAT, which is monobloc aerosol vent and tubes. So, think about deodorants and various other odd ball sides cans. So, we're bigger in that segment than beverage. We did have positive growth in beverage, but beverage is growing at a much faster rate than the other segments. So, it was more of a mix, but that's the fact.
David Begleiter: Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question will be from Matthew Skowronski with UBS. Please go ahead.
Matthew Skowronski: Thanks for taking the question. In your 2020 guidance, what would be the major businesses expected to be most up and what would be the most down? If you could break that down between the performance and industrial that would be appreciated.
Michael McGarry: So, the most up obviously would be aerospace and PMC, those businesses will have another fantastic year in 2020. Probably the one that will be a little more challenged will be automotive and then industrial.
Vince Morales: And if I could add, we do expect Comex to be up as well in 2020.
Matthew Skowronski: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Michael Sison with Wells Fargo.
Michael Sison: Hi, guys. You had good earnings growth in the fourth quarter, and it sounds like the sales levels or sales sort of weakness will persist in the first quarter, but just curious, is there anything going on in the first quarter that your earnings growth is going to be better driven, it sounds like the sales levels will be about the same fourth quarter than in the first?
Michael McGarry: Yes, part of the difference is just comparisons as you know, we have strong pricing throughout 2019 on a year-over-year basis. We're still going to get some price in Q1, but not the same year-over-year level, as we did in the fourth quarter or prior quarters in 2019. Q4 for Comex is their largest quarter, typically seasonally, but we're not going to see that same effect in Q1. We talked about Aerospace already. We had strong volumes in Q4 in aerospace. We know that's going to be tempered. In Asia, Q4 is the automotive market peak in China, even though the volumes were down, overall production is up sequentially, Q3 and Q4 that drops back down, as we will have as much fixed cost coverage in Q1. So, if you're trying to compare the quarters, I would pull forward of those big elements.
Michael Sison: Got it. And then, you should have good leverage to better demand, obviously, but is there a way to think about, if the trade deal is a positive and then going forward, what the upside or where we would see maybe stronger results in PPG if things get better this year?
Vince Morales: I'll start with it and Mike will finish. I think broadly, we'll see it in our global industrial segment. That's the one that we think has been most impacted by the delays in the agreements. Again, as I mentioned just a few minutes ago, inventory levels, we think and end product inventory levels for our customers in those segments are very low. So, you could see a production pick up in a halo of inventory build.
Michael McGarry: Yes. And the other thing I'd say is that incrementally, not just Europe, where we say 40% of any incremental dollar drops to the bottom line, but we're seeing that same kind of incremental benefit in the U.S. and Latin America now. So, that's another positive. So, I would say we see any pickup $0.30 on the dollar is going to befall into bottom line.
Michael Sison: Great, thank you.
Operator: The next question will be from P.J. Juvekar of Citi. Please go ahead.
P.J. Juvekar: Yes, hi, good afternoon.
Michael McGarry: Hi, P.J.
P.J. Juvekar: I am a little confused about China automotive comment. You mentioned that auto production was up in 4Q year-over-year, but should be down 10% in 1Q. So, can you just flush that out and talk about things like what are the dealer inventories in China or what are pricing discounts on autos in China? Thank you.
Vince Morales: Yes, P.J., as we mentioned auto production was up in Q4, that was a mistake on our behalf. I think, we intended to say auto production was down, but not as much as it was in prior quarters. So, it's still down in Q4. We expect it to be down again low double-digits in Q1. We do feel that inventory is generally are in check in China. So, they've been matching inventory with lower sales. So, sales do pick up that should be a straight translation through to production.
P.J. Juvekar: Okay, thank you. And just secondly, as interest rates moved down last year, do you see a pickup in housing activity this year, in particular your architectural business? And in your experience in terms of past cycles when the rates go down, how long before you begin to see some positive impact on your business? Thank you.
Michael McGarry: Yes, P.J., I would say that right now, rates are down, but they've been down for a while and we're expecting another 2% to 3% kind of growth year for architectural U.S. I don't expect to see anything significant. Our trade customers have a significant backlog. I still expect to see, trade to be better than DIY, the do-it-for-me trend is going to continue.
P.J. Juvekar: Great, thank you.
Operator: And the next question will be from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Please go ahead.
Frank Mitsch: Thank you and good afternoon. Michael, I appreciate the comments regarding the active pipeline on M&A and the fact that you didn't want to let cash build up on the balance sheet, which is why you reentered into the buyback markets. The prior few years certainly, you had been doing more on the buyback front, this past year 2019, you did double on the M&A front. Is that – is your expectation as we look at 2020 that that PPG will be kind of in that same order of magnitude, where M&A will be double of what buybacks are or how should we think about the interplay between those two uses of cash?
Michael McGarry: Well, Frank, I think if you look back the last three or four years, we've consistently done about four or five acquisitions a year. I would be disappointed if we don't do four or five this year. We've already announced ICR. We have a very active acquisition review committee in the company. It is a matter of timing. We are working generally with the private owners. They can be temperamental sometimes to get to the finish line, but I'm still optimistic that we'll do more acquisitions in 2020 than we'll do share buybacks.
Vince Morales: Yes, Frank and that's really, and if you look at our history, we've done a variety of acquisitions. We've delivered really good returns on those, which is why it remains a priority for us. We typically were able to capture synergies and easily cover our cost of capital, but if those acquisitions don't materialize, as Michael mentioned, we fully intend not to let cash grow in the balance sheet.
Frank Mitsch: That's a very fair point, the Whitford deal was a very good deal in hindsight as well. And just turning back to the interplay between price and raws and the fact that you've got a cost cut program that you're continuing to execute on, you were able to deliver better margins through each quarter in 2019 with some acceleration at the end of the year, how should we think about the progression on improvement in margins in 2020?
Michael McGarry: Yes, the first part of the year, we're going to continue to be volume challenge as we denoted earlier. That will certainly affect our ability to grow margins in our Industrial segment. We do expect Performance to continue to perform well on a relative basis, Frank.
Frank Mitsch: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Kevin Hocevar with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.
Kevin Hocevar: Hi, good afternoon everybody. Wanted to dig into the guidance a little bit. So, sales growth of 1% to 3%. I think that 1% of that is acquisitions. So, kind of flat, flattish to 2% volume, price, and again of which I think most is price. So, wanted to dig into the whatever pricing is baked into that, how much would you say is based on carry-forward pricing from 2019? I know you have some other actions out there, now, so how much is from those and how much is from any future price increases you might do throughout the year?
Michael McGarry: Yes, Kevin, I'll remind you that we gathered most of our price gains in 2019 at the beginning of 2019 in the first quarter, both in Industrial and Performance. So, all price gains in 2020 will be primarily based on actions that we're executing from the beginning of this year. So, very little carryover pricing in every business and we do have again in the back half of the year some volume growth layered into the guidance.
Kevin Hocevar: Okay, got you. And can you comment too, sticking with pricing, how the competitive response has been to the pricing action you have out there? Competitors followed suit or are you flying solo on any of those actions?
Michael McGarry: Well the answer to that question really varies by sub-segment. So, I would tell you in the Performance Coatings side, there is more – there is more support than maybe there is in the Industrial segment.
Kevin Hocevar: Okay, got you. Thank you very much.
Operator: Next question will be from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Arun, perhaps your line is muted on your end.
Arun Viswanathan: Alright, sorry about that. Good afternoon. Sorry about that. Yes, so I was just curious, couple of years ago there was a chance to or it's or a statement that you'll be focusing on low single-digit volume growth and cost reductions at the same time when Michael took over. Now, I know volume growth has been disappointing just given the macro backdrop, but maybe you can just catch us up on the cost reduction side. What do you see in the future, I guess, as far as cadence and what can we kind of model through our estimates for cost reductions from here? Thanks.
Michael McGarry: Well, we achieved $85 million in lower costs in 2019. And I think John mentioned that we were going to do $80 million in 2020 and I would say that we're always looking to be better year-over-year. There is no additional program we're out there thinking about right now, but we do want to be in a continuous improvement mode. So, you should expect us to continue to push our cost lower, especially in such a weak demand environment.
Arun Viswanathan: Great, thanks. And then just on that weak demand environment, could you characterize kind of the price discussions with your customers? I'm just curious if there has been any kind of push back just given that raw materials are likely potentially a little bit deflationary in Q4 and then maybe even the next couple of quarters, how are you fighting those conversations with the customers? Thanks.
Michael McGarry: Our customers are very sophisticated, generally, they look at it over a cycle not over a single point in time and they can tell by looking at our margins, that we have not returned yet to our margins that we had in 2016. So, they also know we have continued inflation in wages and logistics, things like that. So, that's also something that we factor in. So, the discussions are constructive.
Arun Viswanathan: And just lastly, just talking about the M&A pipeline, could you discuss maybe some of the verticals that you're looking at? You have done [dura coat] in the past in some areas, ancillary to core coatings, is that still an area of interest for you, maybe in adhesives or anything like that or what are your areas of focus for M&A? Thanks.
Michael McGarry: Well, we always say that we're looking at all acquisitions in our space. So, we are big in adhesives and sealants, but we won't do a commodity one in that space. We only do specialty ones. If you look at aerospace, we do want to continue to grow our presence in that segment. And then the traditional core coatings segments, we're going to continue to look in. So, we're not going to go out and create some new third-leg though. So, we'll stick to the businesses that we know.
Arun Viswanathan: Okay, thanks.
Operator: The next question will come from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead.
Don Carson: Just a couple of questions on U.S. architectural. Michael, you had another quarter of growth in your dealer network, which certainly versus a long trend of declines. Is this your new strategy helping out with your premium dealer network? Or is it just because you had some easy comps? And then on your company stores, do you think you can get further price increases in 2020?
Michael McGarry: I will take the latter one first. So, we did announce an increase in our company-owned stores and we do anticipate being successful in that. In regards to the dealers, we are making a significant push for our premier authorized dealer network and it's way too early to talk about success in that name, but we do think the program makes a lot of sense, where we work jointly together with our dealers to better service our customers. So, I'm glad to see the growth in the dealer network and we'll continue to push forward.
Don Carson: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. I think your consolidated prices were up 2.6% in the third quarter and 2% in the fourth quarter. So, is it fair to say that maybe they'll be up 1.4, or 1.5 in the first quarter, is that the progression?
Vince Morales: Yes, Jeff, this is Vince. A little more precision than we typically guide to, again I would say 2019 was on the heels of very modest pricing in 2018. We did have very strong pricing, if you recall in the first quarter of 2019. So, the comparable is much more difficult, but I wouldn't give specific guidance. We do expect a positive number, but again nothing specific.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay. And your tax rate expectation for the year is between 22% and 24%, but I think for the first quarter it's between 22% and 23%, does that mean that your base case is 22% to 23%, or is there something unusual about the first quarter tax rate?
Michael McGarry: We are expecting a true-up of one of our major geographies in the first quarter, which is why we signaled that to be lower. That's an ongoing number, but it's a true-up of a discrete item that will occur during the quarter.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay, great. Thank you so much.
Michael McGarry: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Vincent Andrews: Thanks so much. Vince, on the cash flow conversion this year, you did a nice job in generating more cash, should we expect further improvement in cash flow conversion off of EBITDA in 2020?
Vince Morales: Yes, you must be listening to our internal management meetings. We target every year half to a full turn on our working capital. We've been improving that for the last several years, but we still have more room to go, specifically on inventories. We do have a very good receivable conversion rate, but there is still more room there. So, our intention is to lower our working capital, full year working capital, another half turn to full turn in 2020.
Vincent Andrews: Okay. And if I could just ask as quickly on the refinish inventory levels in the EU, are we at the point where you've kind of lapped that issue and we shouldn't see it as much in 2020? Or is there another quarter or so left of that?
Michael McGarry: That's always hard to tell because it's two-step distribution Vincent. And we don't always have perfect line of sight into that. So, I would hope, the answer is yes, but I have no real positive knowledge of that.
Vincent Andrews: Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Michael McGarry: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.
John McNulty: Yes, thanks for taking my question. So, when we look back at 2019, oil prices were down $10 a barrel, 14%, 15% and yet to your comments earlier the raws remain sticky. I guess, is crude the right barometer for us to be looking at going forward in terms of how your raw material is moving? If so then when should we start to see any relief because it still looks like other than the pricing that you've been able to put through, you really haven't seen anything on the actual raw material relief side.
Michael McGarry: Well, crude does impact a large chunk of our basket, but it doesn't impact things like TiO2, probably doesn't always impact things like packaging and so there are some other things like, let's call it pigments, that doesn't impact it. So, there are some other facets of our raw material basket that are not impacted by crude, but it is the larger driver.
Vince Morales: But just echoing on what Michael said earlier, we feel our suppliers – our supply demand is well supplied. And it's just been stubborn in terms of passing down the food chain here.
John McNulty: Okay, fair enough. And then, Vince, just a housekeeping question, it looks like your interest expense guide for 2020 is up 10% to as much as 25%. I guess, what's driving that?
Vince Morales: Yes, a couple of things. One, we did have good cash in the back half of this year. So, we were able to retire some debt in the fourth quarter. We will typically be borrowing money in the first quarter as we build inventory for the season. So, there is nothing significant about that other than interest rates in some of our key regions like LATAM are coming down, where we had interest income in prior years.
John McNulty: Got it. Okay, thanks very much.
Operator: The next question is from Sean Gilmartin with Barclays.
Duffy Fischer: Hi, this is Duffy for Sean. Can you walk through what your market, so 2019 architectural, what do you think the markets grew in Europe, North America, and Mexico?
Vince Morales: Okay. The U.S., we think it grew between 2% and 3%. In Europe, we think it declined in the 1% kind of range, and in Mexico, the volume was probably down 1% net organic growth positive because of price increases, and the same thing in Europe we had price increases that offset the negative volume. So, net-net, I would say, marginally positive from an organic growth side in both markets.
Duffy Fischer: Okay. And then can you help size the issue in aerospace, so if the slowdown continues all this year, how should we think about the size of that impacting your business. And then when does the maximum pain happen? I mean, obviously there's probably a lead lag as you go through, and it's slowly kind of working its way through, when does the brunt of that issue start impacting your P&L?
Michael McGarry: So, Duffy, maybe, I'll tell you what it is not, some people have said it's 1%, that's not even remotely close. So, if you want to factor up and down off a 0.5%, somewhere in that area code, but it is a really complicated question, because as you know we supply transparencies, sealants and adhesives, as well as coatings and some of those things we are a Tier 1 suppliers, some of them were Tier 2 supplier. And some of the suppliers were running faster than the customer stated line rate and some were matching it. So, we're trying to figure out what the inventory in the chain is, and then it will be more complicated by the fact that the airlines are going to be running their planes a little harder. So, that will lead to some additional MRO opportunities for us, but then they have to find the time to do the MRO. So, it's not a straightforward answer. And so that's why it's – we've given a larger than normal for our guidance.
Duffy Fischer: Great. Thank you, guys.
Operator: The next question is from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.
Kevin McCarthy: Good afternoon. Michael, I recognize the ink is still drying on the Phase 1 trade deal, but I'd be curious to hear your initial thoughts as to what effect it might have in losing up some of the supply chains, where you had encountered a fair amount of friction over the past year or two, any thoughts on end use markets product lines that could benefit?
Michael McGarry: So, the one that I am optimistic on is Mexico. I think the government is going to start to turn loose some money, they wanted to know what environment they were dealing with. Now they have a little more certainty. So, I anticipate the government spending more money that's going to be a positive for us, for our PPG-Comex business. And then obviously, we're looking forward to the farmers having more money in their pockets as a positive, but that I think that's a long-term putt.
Kevin McCarthy: Okay. And then, Vince for 2020, do you have a strong feeling today as to whether the capital budget could be up flat or down, and maybe you can talk about some of the swing factors or chunkier projects that you are considering for this year?
Vince Morales: Yes, first of all for 2019 our cap spending matched almost exactly our 2018 number. We did start some larger projects in 2019 and given the economy, we kept those projects running, but we feel back off of some smaller projects. We're still expecting, Kevin, for 2020 in 2.5% to 3% of sales as our CapEx bogey, we're going to obviously topple that based on the economic environment.
Kevin McCarthy: Okay. So, it sounds pretty similar then. Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Steve Byrne: Hi, you have these online apps, they are meant to help homeowners and property managers identify contractors and mostly to buy paint from you. How much traction are you getting with this initiative? How are you raising awareness level on these apps? And has it affected the driving volume to your dealership’s relationships even in areas where you don't have stores?
Michael McGarry: Yes, so Steve, I would say this is still in [indiscernible] digitization of the retail and trade paint network, I would say is slow going. Not for a lack of effort, but traditionally, I would say these are small business people a little bit slow to change, but they all recognize the need to do that, and so we're working with them on trying to help them understand how they can improve their own businesses by moving to more digital apps, but I would say it's still in the first couple of innings.
Steve Byrne: Alright. And maybe this one is also in the first couple of innings, or do you have this this this retail refinish, pardon me, mixing technology that you acquired in Europe? Can you provide an update on how that's rolling out whether you can bring that across the pond and whether you could drive market share gains with that?
Michael McGarry: Yes, so Steve that was something we developed ourselves, it's a trademark Moonwalk, it's an automated mixing system for the refinish market that allows the painter basically to scan the paint of the car, stick the chip basically into a machine and it premixes the paint, so that way the painter can be way more productive. We've already sold 100 of these machines in Europe. The interest level is very high. We've got a tremendous amount of recognition. Obviously, we're starting with our own paint shops first, and then we'll be pushing it out into a competitive environment, so that we can start to gain share. We do have people outside of Europe that are also asking about it, because of the significant press we received. But I would say right now, we're focused on Europe and then we'll look at how we're going to expand that over time.
Steve Byrne: Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Jim Sheehan with SunTrust.
Jim Sheehan: Thank you. On the emission standards in Europe that you referenced how would you compare the disruption this year to what happened in the last go around for Euro VI. Is there a single date in which that occurs? Or is it or is it going to be phased in?
Michael McGarry: I'd say it's way too early to call. There is so much challenge in Europe with the emissions, that we'll just sit back and wait. So, no real insight.
Jim Sheehan: Okay. And then on your pricing versus raw materials, I think maybe your general industrial business is the business that's furthest behind in terms of inflation, is that correct. And if so when would you expect that business to fully catch up to raw materials, if there is no macro acceleration?
Michael McGarry: Well, we said it would be in the back half of the year, we obviously need a little volume to help drive that, but I would tell you that, we've made significant progress in all three of those businesses, whether it's packaging, industrial, automotive. They've all made significant improvement so far.
Vince Morales: And that's Jim, an addition, that's really, we're focusing a lot of our self-help activities as well. That's helping us March back to those prior margin levels.
Jim Sheehan: Thank you very much.
Michael McGarry: Jim, just for your information, the forecast for Europe is minus 2% on cars. So, that's the external forecast on how the emission packages were impacted.
Jim Sheehan: Much obliged.
Operator: The next question will come from Kevin Estok with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Dan Russo: This is Dan Russo, actually on for Laurence. Could you just tell me, could you hit the lower end of your guidance if there is no volume reacceleration in the second half of the year?
Michael McGarry: Yes. We have a guidance range for a reason. We do, we don't see any pickup in activity basis, our internal expectations we will be more discerning on costs. So, I would certainly expect us to hit our guidance either through our own self-help or through economic activity.
Dan Russo: Okay. Thank you very much.
Michael McGarry: Thanks Dan.
Operator: And the next question will come from Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities.
Mike Harrison: Hi, good afternoon. Wanted to ask you about SG&A costs. Looks like they were up more than 100 basis points year-over-year as a percentage of sales. Can you walk us through some of the dynamics on the SG&A front? Is there a reason that we're not seeing better fall through from restructuring actions at the SG&A line? Was there a change in incentive comp? Or what's going on there?
Vince Morales: Two main items, Mike. One, as we brought these acquisitions in, they're typically coming in at a much higher SG&A baseload. And we'll work that down over time that’s part of our synergy capture that we do. The second is, we did have higher – a higher stock price this year, which resulted in a higher TSR from a management and incentive perspective. Those were the two main factors.
Mike Harrison: Alright, thanks. And then my other question is on the architectural market in China, you noted that as an area of strength and said you're growing above market. Can you talk about what you're doing in China to drive growth, while some of your other competitors struggled to gain traction in that market?
Vince Morales: I'll start, I'll let Michael finish. I think we referred to Mike in China was our protective and marine market, not necessarily architectural. We do see even though China is down in terms of industrial activity, we do see a tremendous amount of infrastructure under way there. We're participating in that. We think we're winning more than our fair share of the business. Marine is also up slightly in China. So, those were the two items I think we earmarked not necessarily architectural. Michael, if you want to add?
Michael McGarry: Yes, the only thing I would add is, our marine business is winning in the shipyards that are winning business in China. And China is winning more business than Korea and we're better positioned in China than we are in Korea. So, we're in the places that are growing.
Mike Harrison: Yes, I guess I'm looking at Slide 5 in the...
John Bruno: Mike, Mike. I'm sorry, Mike, this is John. Yes, I see what you're looking at. So, just as a reminder everybody, we do have architectural business in China. It's a small business, and it's in part of China as a regional business within China and it's performed well. So, I just would remind people that it is on the smaller side.
Michael McGarry: It's regional. It's mostly in the Shanghai and Southern China piece. So that's where it's been benefiting from.
Mike Harrison: Alright. Thanks very much.
Michael McGarry: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.
John Bruno: I would like to thank everyone for their time and interest in PPG. If you have any further questions please contact me. This concludes our fourth quarter earnings call.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-17 14:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon and welcome to the PPG Industries Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Carrie and I will be your conference specialist today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to John Bruno, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
John Bruno: Thank you, Carrie, and good afternoon, everyone. Once again, this is John Bruno. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG and welcome you to our third quarter 2019 financial results conference call. Joining me on the call from PPG are Michael McGarry, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vince Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our comments relate to the financial information released on Thursday, October 17, 2019. I will remind everyone that we have posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on the investor center of our website ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide additional support to the up - sorry, the opening comments Michael will make shortly. Following Michael's perspective on the company's results for the quarter, we will move to a Q&A session. Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements, reflecting the company's current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials which are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC. Now let me introduce PPG's, Chairman and CEO, Michael McGarry.
Michael McGarry: Thank you, John, and good afternoon everyone. We appreciate you joining our third quarter earnings call. Today we reported third quarter 2019 financial results. For the quarter, our net sales were about $3.8 billion and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.67. Earnings were a record for any third quarter. Consistent with our improvement targets, we delivered strong year-over-year adjusted earnings per growth - per share growth of 15%. Our earnings growth was driven by continued selling price realization and strong cost management. This quarter we accelerated our momentum in margin recovery with segment margins up about 220 basis points versus last year. As we stated in the past, our overall objective is to return to the aggregated segment margins that we maintain prior to this recent inflationary cycle and we believe this objective is achievable in 2020. Now let me provide some additional color on our third quarter results. Our net sales in constant currency were higher than the prior year by about 2%. Sales volumes were down nearly 3% and were notably impacted by weak global industrial production that continue to affect global automotive production and most of our general industrial end use markets. This weakness was also broad based geographically. Aggregate selling prices were 2.6% higher, marking the 10th consecutive quarter of improved selling year-over-year selling prices and our sixth consecutive quarter with selling price increases of at least 2%. We're continuing to work with our customers to ensure that we are receiving fair value for our products and services and expect price gains of about 2% in the fourth quarter, despite a more difficult pricing comparison in the prior year fourth quarter. Finally, our net sales were affected by significant unfavorable currency translation of about 2% or nearly $80 million. We expect unfavorable currency translation to continue at a similar rate in the fourth quarter. Moving to some business trends in the third quarter. In our Performance Coatings reporting segment, Aerospace coatings continued to deliver very strong volume growth, outpacing industry performance in most major regions. In automotive refinish, sales were higher as strong selling price gain and acquisition sales from SEM outpaced lower sales volumes reflecting lower demand in most regions as many of our customers focus on inventory management. Year-over-year organic sales were again higher in our architectural coatings EMEA business driven by higher selling prices. Aggregate sales volumes were slightly lower as we saw mix demand trends by country during the quarter. In Mexico, our PPG-Comex business increased organic sales aided by higher selling prices. Sales volumes remain soft as consumer demand reflected the overall lower economic activity in Mexico's economy. The PPG-Comex business continued its growth by adding nearly 100 concessionaire stores through September of 2019. Organic sales volumes in architectural coatings Americas and Asia Pacific modestly increased during the quarter as sales volume growth in the DIY and independent dealer channels offset lower sales volumes at our company owned stores, including a difficult comparison period last year where we delivered strong high single-digit percentage growth. Led by strong growth in the Asia region, our protective marine coatings business continued to deliver above industry sales volume growth, a mid single-digit percentage during the quarter. We expect sales to remain at elevated levels in the fourth quarter, albeit with lower year-over-year growth due to the significant growth we have experienced in the past year. In our Industrial Coatings reporting segment, sales volumes continue to be adversely impacted by weak industrial demand in most major regions of the world. Global automotive OEM industry builds declined, including the impact of unexpected or unintended and extended customer shutdowns in multiple regions during the quarter. In aggregate, PPG's automotive sales volumes were lower by mid to high single-digit percentage, consistent with the reduction of global builds. As a partial sales offset, our automotive OEM business realized higher selling prices in each major region for the third consecutive quarter. Weak global industrial production activity impacted most of our general Industrial Coatings business subsegments, including wood, general finishes and transportation end markets. Also, our packaging coatings sales volumes decreased modestly as solid beverage can demand was offset by weakness in other packaging end market segments. We expect this business to return to growth in 2020. From an earnings perspective, as I mentioned earlier, our third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $1.67. Our earnings were negatively impacted by about $10 million on unfavorable foreign currency translation, or about $0.04 per share. Our effective tax rate was about 23% in the third quarter, which is higher than the approximately 21% rate in the third quarter of 2018. The increase relates to realizing lower nonrecurring favorable discrete tax items in the third quarter of 2019. We're anticipating a tax rate of about 24% for the full year 2019. Our EPS results were supported by increase in our selling prices, improved manufacturing performance, excellent progress on our cost savings programs, which delivered about $20 million in cost savings during the quarter and remain in line with our objective. In addition, as we targeted, we benefited from achieving comparable margins in our U.S. and Canadian architectural business to the third quarter of 2017, before our customer assortment changes. The four acquisitions that we have made in the past year also contributed positively to earnings, although at overall lower than company average margins. As we look ahead, we expect global economic activity to remain weak in the fourth quarter. We expect global general industrial demand to remain unfavorable year-over-year and roughly comparable to what we experienced in the third quarter. Year-over-year sales comparisons will ease in the automotive OEM business, but we still forecast aggregate global automotive builds to decline in the fourth quarter compared to prior year. Positive developments around regional and country trade disputes could provide a spark to industrials demand as inventory levels in many of our end-use markets remain low. Specific to our businesses, we believe that lower U.S. interest rates could add growth in the U.S. housing market and also favorably impact automotive OEM and U.S. architectural sales. There will be continuing impact to our sales related to customer shutdowns in the automotive OEM business in the U.S. In Latin America, we anticipate economic activity to be similar to that experienced in the third quarter, and we'll continue to add new PPG-Comex concessionaire locations to expand our customer reach. In Asia, demand rates are expected to remain consistent in comparison to the third quarter. In the fourth quarter sales comparisons to last year will be easier given the weakness in Asian demand that occurred late last year. We expect demand growth will return in China next year. Economic demand in Europe, is expected to remain soft as industrial production is forecast to remain at low levels. And our Automotive OEM business comps are also easing year-over-year and we should experience a lower sales volume decrement in the fourth quarter. We expect our architectural business to continue to grow, driven by higher selling prices and strong cost management. Brexit remains an overhang and is beginning to modestly impact our business trends. We continue to closely monitor the situation and then prepare contingency plans to the best of our ability to prepare for unknown impacts. As we said last quarter, we continue to work with our supplier base to ensure that our input costs are reflective of current industry demand conditions, including the ongoing uncertainty and weak global industrial production. We will continue to focus on reducing our cost structure, and we target to reduce $20 million of cost in the fourth quarter related to our cost savings program, including the newest program we announced in the second quarter, which will have a full-year run rate savings of about $125 million upon completion of the program. Earlier today we provided EPS guidance specific to the full year of 2019. The guidance of $6.17 to $6.27, which includes an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of $0.18 to $0.20 per share. This puts us at a low to mid range of our original full year 2019 adjusted earnings per share growth of 7% to 10%, excluding currency translation impacts. While we would like to be closer to the upper end of the range, our earnings performance has been very solid when considering the severity of the downturn in the global industrial activity. We have generated strong cash flow through the first nine months of 2019, with cash generation of nearly $1.3 billion. This is an increase of about $600 million when compared to the same period last year and has been driven by strong working capital management. Our focus on cash flow generation will continue and our goal remains to reduce working capital as a percent of sales compared to 2018 levels. We completed the Dexmet acquisition early in the third quarter and continue to be pleased with the early performance of all four recently completed acquisitions including Hemmelrath, SEM and Whitford, which collectively will add about $400 million in annualized revenue. Acquisitions remain one of our preferred cash deployment options given the value that these have created for our shareholders over the year and currently, our pipeline continues to remain solid. In addition to acquisitions, we progressed our key capital expenditures during the third quarter, and we still expect total spending to be up to 3% of sales in 2019. In the third quarter, we increased our dividend to $0.51 per share or roughly a 6% increase. We have paid uninterrupted annual dividend since 1899 and we are pleased to continue to prioritize our dividend increases. We ended the third quarter with more than $1.5 billion of cash and short-term investments, which continues to provide us with significant financial flexibility. Finally, I'd like to recognize and thank our employees around the world for their continued commitment to serve our customers. Every day, our dedicated employees are focused on driving the PPG Way and delivering value to all our stakeholders and shareholders. This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG, and now Carrie, would you please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.
Ghansham Panjabi: I guess, first off, you've obviously given us a really good detail on how to think about volumes for the fourth quarter. I understand it's early, but what is your initial view as it relates to the volume outlook for 2020 at this point as it relates to your major end markets, and on your margin recovery comment by 2020, Michael, are you referring to the run rate at the end of the year or margins on an absolute basis? Thanks.
Michael McGarry: Yes. I do expect margins to continue to improve. As you can see our margins in our performance coatings segment are essentially back to peak, and we think there is still more upside there. So we're going to continue to work hard on that. We also have made as you saw a significant more than 200 basis point improvement in the industrial segment and we still have more runway to go there. As we said, we had positive price coming in the fourth quarter, and I would expect that we would continue to push price as we move forward as we still have an environment where we have inflation and think about salaries, warehouses, freight and distribution, things like that. So.
Vince Morales: And then Ghansham on your question with respect to the 2020, again a little, a little early to answer that question. But what we can say confidently is a lot of our customers are carrying very low inventory levels. Typically, they achieve their inventory levels at the end of the year, not by the end of Q3. As they've done this year, so heading into 2020 we do think there could be some inventory upside. It's too early to make a call on the economy and the other geopolitical issues, but a couple of our key industries we know auto we feel a little bit better about auto next year specifically in Asia, the biggest market and a couple of other markets in general industrial are down this year, we're hopeful they'll have at least a modest rebound next year, not counting the inventory rebuild.
Ghansham Panjabi: And just as a follow-up to that Vince, for the industrial segment, specifically, how should we think about operating leverage for that segmented volumes start to recover. I mean obviously you're adjusting the cost footprint and I assume some of the costs will reverse as demand picks up. I just wanted to get your sense as to operating leverage during the initial phase of improvement. Thanks.
Michael McGarry: Yes, Ghansham, this is Michael. That's going to be a strong positive for us. When you think about the past quarter, earnings in that industrial segment were up despite volumes being down. And we anticipate to continue to drive costs out, and so you should expect to see a nice operating leverage should volumes come back, and right now we're certainly planning on our outlook for 2020 would include some modest recovery.
Operator: The next question will come from Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse.
Christopher Parkinson: Regarding your volume outlook, can you kindly walk us through the key end market verticals for which you believe PPG is poised to benefit from, let's say, secular themes regulatory changes under new products, new non-BPA and the move towards aluminum cans will be one I guess in packaging, [low care] [ph] products and EV battery protective in auto. Just - you know if there are few others just generally based on what's inside of your control. What are the key verticals through which we can expect you to outperform and why? Thank you.
Michael McGarry: So, Christopher you covered automotive pretty well. So, I'll pass on that one. We have and in the industrial business as part of the industrial segment that one I would point to like high edge powder as one of them. And if you think about moving into packaging itself, the sustainability of the can is number one. So you could see the shift away from plastic that's going to be a long-term secular win. For us, housing is continuing to - we got low interest rates around the world. So I think housing is continuing to be a nice little market for us. Aerospace is clearly going to be a continued winner for us, we're going to continue to outgrow the industry there with the launches that we have had, whether it's new transparencies or new coatings. And then talk about them, we talked about in our press release MOONWALK for refinish. This is a new technology that allows people in Europe to be able to mix refinish paints more precisely, allows the technician to spend more time painting the car as opposed to mixing paint, drives higher productivity in the paint shop. So I think net-net, we're in a pretty good shape long-term wise.
Christopher Parkinson: And just regards to your margin outlook. Can you simply outline in order which variables will be the most material to achieving and surpassing prior peak margins just between price, input cost deflation, mix, acquisition integrations and just broader volume improvement. Just any key thoughts on how The Street should be thinking about that as we head into 2020? Thank you.
Vince Morales: Yes, Chris, I'll start and Michael could certainly add to what I say. But we're still sitting on a significant amount of inflation that's multi-year inflation. We have seen very little of that unwind to this point. We alluded in our call about the economy, the weakness in industrial activity. So we're still working to get price to offset this accumulated inflation, but there is a significant amount of Inflation we would not expect with the supply demand environment where it is in our supplier base. We always do self-help; we announced the Self-Help program in May. We still have a variety of actions do against that program. We're expecting significant savings from that program that will be primarily in next year, and then the last one is, we don't know the volume outlook, so the things within our control we're managing but, as Michael just mentioned on the prior question, if we do get any volume, especially in some of our industrial businesses, we should have a significant amount of leverage. So those were - those would be the way I prioritize them.
Michael McGarry: And Chris, I would - the one thing I would add is that with couple of the acquisitions we made, they're below company average, they're fairly decent sized ones. I'm excited because I get a monthly report on the integration as well as the performance, and we are seeing month over month improvement. In fact, when I looked at the Hemmelrath numbers for the month of September, it was the best month they've had ever, and obviously they're benefiting from some of our abilities to integrate them but I see even more positives coming, they have relationships with the customers that are slightly different customers than we have from a standpoint of mix, and so we're able to take the best of both worlds. They are great relationships and our great technology and put the two together. And we've already won substantial number of new program wins since we bought Hemmelrath.
Operator: The next question will come from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs.
Bob Koort: Michael, you guys gave some commentary about your U.S. architectural business and I guess it seems like going on a few years now there's puts and takes and maybe not complete uniform consistency by channel. Can you talk a little bit about the DIY market? It sounds like maybe that's starting to percolate a little bit. Certainly we're seeing some of these housing stocks rally dramatically? Are there some signs that maybe we're going to get lift off in DIY and then in your store base, I guess I would have thought maybe some of those contractors that were hiding from the rainy weather in the June quarter would come back out in the September quarter. So is there anything idiosyncratic to your store base either regionally or end market-wise that would have precluded you from having a little bit better volume there?
Michael McGarry: Yes. Let me first start with the DIY. So we're gaining share in the DIY segment. Our customers are doing pretty well and inside our customers we have continued to launch new products and that's been a real positive. So when you think about the PPG timeless at Home Depot, as well as the Olympic Stain at Home Depot, both those guys are growing above company average. So we're really pleased with that. I think the one thing that doesn't really come through when you think about our company store average is, if you remember, and some of the prior calls, we kind of talked about doing a little bit of everything in that segment. So some of its delivery, some of it is the store and some of it is what we call our premier authorized dealer network or where we're trying to make it simple for the customer to say I can pick up in a dealer location or I can pick up in a PPG store location. And obviously we have, let's call it a little bit less than 900 stores between U.S. and Canada. But if you include that plus the nearly 5,000 dealers that we have that gives our customers a lot more opportunities to pick up paint. And so if you look at our dealers, if you noticed in our commentary in our press release, we said dealers were positive and historically, as you know, this has been a long-term secular minus one kind of trend line dealers age out and move on. But with this new strategy we are picking up additional business through the dealers. We added 50 new dealer locations in the third quarter. We're up to about 140 locations in the third quarter, a total of 427 new locations where they can pick up paint, and we expect that to continue to accelerate as other dealers see this work. They're going to want to jump on that bandwagon as well. So I think that's a little bit of nuance that maybe doesn't come out in the overall numbers. Hello Bob?
Bob Koort: Can I ask you on the balance sheet, you've been accruing cash nicely through the year and haven’t been doing any share repurchase? Would that be a reflection of the acquisition activity, or is there some other reason you want to put more of that capital back to you through repurchase?
Vince Morales: Yes, Bob, as Michael pointed out in the opening remarks, and we've had a very good cash generation year-to-date, we've got about $1.5 billion on the balance sheet. We do have some term debt coming due in Q4, so some of that cash will be applied to the term debt coming due. But besides that, we do have a strong balance sheet and we're still looking at a variety of acquisitions, acquisition pipeline is still rich. We are not immune to doing share repo. We haven't done any-to-date basis, the acquisition pipeline. But if the acquisition pipeline lessens or we think there is a need to do share repo for different reasons, we will do so.
Operator: The next question will come from Michael Sison of Wells Fargo.
Michael Sison: Question on the - just quickly on the stores. You said you're a little bit less than 900. Can you maybe walk us through what your strategy is there? Going forward, are you looking to continue to expand the stores or is kind of this dealer network really the area where you can have a combined growth for your business there, but just kind of curious where you think the store strategy and growth potential is going forward?
Michael McGarry: Yes. So Michael, what I would tell you it's our strategy hasn't changed. We're going to add stores where it makes sense in those markets that are growing. So I think the southeast and the southwest. We're not going to be adding stores in the Northeast or in the West or the upper Midwest those our focus areas for us for stores, what they are focus areas for us for this premier authorized dealer network, because we think there is plenty enough to in our stores and our dealers to adequately service our customers. So we're going to continue to do that and I compare and contrast that to Mexico where we've added nearly 100 stores year-to-date and we're going to finish the year at nearly 200 new stores. Same thing where we've added stores in the UK, we've added stores in Australia. So we're going to take, what we call the micro-market strategy. We're going to look at each of the different markets and make the best decision for our shareholders in that regard.
Michael Sison: Right, and then just a quick follow-up. When you think about volume growth, whenever, I mean whether it comes next year or sooner than later. What do you think your leverage is going to be meaning, if you grow your sales to 1% is that a leverage of 2% EPS growth, 3% EPS growth and just kind of want to feel for the upside potential as we all hope that demand picks up at some point.
Vince Morales: Yes, Mike, this is Vince. In the past we've said pretty regularly that our leverage on a normal increase in sales is somewhere in the mid-20% range and in Europe, it's higher because of the latent opportunity we have there. So we said, in Europe, it's in the mid 30% range. I'd actually say that if you look at the costs we've taken out globally, we're inching up to 30% on average for the globe in terms of leverage factor. Now it's always going to be based on which business etc., but on average, I think we're closer to 30% now than the 25% we were previously.
Operator: Our next question will come from Frank Mitsch of Fermium Research.
Frank Mitsch: Looking at the refinish business, following the second quarter, there was an expectation of the volumes were to improve in the third quarter given the easy year ago comp because of inventory destock that occurred and that didn't come to the - volumes were down in 3Q, and you called out inventory management as well, lower collision claim activity. Is there any reason for us to anticipate that we're going to see, a rebound in this business? Obviously, you highlighted MOONWALK so maybe from a technology perspective, but just from an overall macro perspective with new safety features in the cards, etc. How should we be thinking about automotive refinish down the line?
Michael McGarry: Frank, this is Michael. I think this is still a great business. So I don't want anybody to walk away, think anything differently. Certainly claims were down 1.2%, a little bit more in that in Europe, but we had a couple of large customers CEO changes who came in and take even a more aggressive approach on inventory, and we've continued to have net body shop wins in all regions of the world. So that is a positive. When you look at our integration of SEM that is primarily a U.S.-based business. We've launched those products in Canada. The first set of products went to Australia in September. So we'll start to see some sales there. We're doing better in sundries. But I think overall the one message I want to leave you is our earnings in refinish will be up year-over-year, at the end of the year. So we're able to price effectively in this business. And this remains a great business for us.
Frank Mitsch: Very, very helpful. Thank you for that. And just in general, as I thought - I look at the third quarter, you hit the high end of the guidance that you put out following the second quarter. And it's clear that the macros were mostly running against you during the quarter, particularly in European activity in autos, etc. So I'm just curious what on the other side really went right for you in order to again hit the high end?
Vince Morales: Frank this is Vince, I'll let Michael again add here, but we are pacing ahead of our cost targets. So we did have additional cost benefit in Q3, but we thought it may come in Q4, we got off to a little bit earlier, that's one item that was helpful to us. Mike if you want to add.
Michael McGarry: Yes. The other one I would tell you is the automotive team. We've been challenging the automotive team to get ahead of this volume decline and they really have worked exceptionally hard to do that in the second and third quarter. And I think what we saw in the back half of the third quarter was that accelerating. So I think that would be the other one I would point to.
Frank Mitsch: Very interesting, so the automotive side and I presume you're talking about the OEM side was able to outpace kind of your initial expectations even though builds were down, you faced strikes et cetera that - that's very interesting that would be the area that you would point out to.
Michael McGarry: Yes. It's the automotive team had done a good job this year, OEM.
Operator: The next question will come from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank.
David Begleiter: Michael, the raw is up year-over-year in Q3. And what are you thinking about for Q4 on raws?
Michael McGarry: Well, of course, we think about our cost is more than raws David. So in the third quarter, they were moderating. We had a couple up, we had some down, but net-net, they were moderating. As I tried to point out in my opening comments, we still have freight and distribution. If you take about dangerous good warehouse costs, especially in Asia, they have significantly increased, and so that's, that's why we continue to invest in our business, we continue to invest in our people. So that's obviously a cost on the rising side, but net-net I would say raw materials were moderating.
David Begleiter: Perfect, and just on the impact of the GM striking Q3 and Q4. Do you have an estimate on that impact?
Michael McGarry: Well, we're not going to talk about any individual customers. What I would tell you is that we have a very diverse customer mix in automotive, and so no one particular customer is going to have a significant impact on our overall business. And our team, when it was announced immediately took aggressive cost action to ensure that the impact was minor. So I think overall, like I said to Frank's question the automotive team did a good job.
Operator: The next question will come from P.J. Juvekar of Citi.
Eric Petrie: This is Eric Petrie on for P.J. So what kind of vehicles represents a market opportunity for you. How much coatings could you sell into the EVs compared to other light vehicles?
Michael McGarry: Well, Eric, we've always said is that the EV vehicles can be anywhere from 2 to 3 times more coatings on them than a standard vehicle. Right now, I don't have the latest number in my figure, but I think it's 0.7% of our cars are electric vehicles. So it's still a very small number. And what's interesting is that everybody does that differently. So the one guy might do their batteries might need protective coatings and other guy might just need Industrial Coatings another guy might use all three, some are using powder, some are using liquids, some use third parties, some do it in-house. Right now, unlike when you look at a traditional car, you can use kind of broad guidelines. Right now this is still in its infancy and there is still a lot of unknowns about how this is going to shake out. But clearly what we see in every case is more paint on an EV vehicle then on a traditional vehicle.
Eric Petrie: For my follow-up in packaging, can you discuss the market opportunity to continue gaining share in non-BPA coatings? And then as the industry shift from plastic bottles to cans, is this a tailwind for the business?
Michael McGarry: Certainly the plastic to can will be a tailwind. It's too early in that process to know what that curve will look like, but it is certainly a long-term positive. Our BPA-NI as we significantly outpaced the market in '16, '17 and '18, we've been slightly less than the market in '19. We expect to be back on that track of at or above market in 2020. We have some new technology that's coming out right now. Probably, I would say food has been probably, let's call it 70% converted, beverage is less than 50%, and it varies considerably by region with Europe much farther ahead and Asia much further behind, but there is still more work to be done there.
Vince Morales: Eric just back on your first question, I mean the statistics, we've seen is on our statistics, but 1% drop in plastic bottles if it converts to aluminum cans, a 6% increase in cans. We are seeing also efforts in the industry to replace single use serving cups as well. So I think the industry, the overall packaging, aluminum packaging industry does have some positive traits forward as we head into next year.
Operator: The next question will come from Kevin McCarthy of VRP.
Kevin McCarthy: I think you've been very clear that your contribution margins are higher regionally in Europe relative to the U.S., for example. I was wondering if you'd be willing to comment on which product lines are your highest and your lowest contribution margins in a given region?
Michael McGarry: Not something we typically comment on Kevin.
Kevin McCarthy: Secondly, I had a small question on the financial side. Your Slide 9 indicates net interest expense of $27 million to $28 million. And I believe the 3Q number was $23 million. And so I'm wondering why your net interest would increase $4 million or $5 million sequentially when your leverage seems to be down roughly $450 million. Does that have to do with capital structure or deployment plans?
Vince Morales: Well, a couple of things on that Kevin. First of all, we are paying off some term debt, but the term debt is very little interest associated with it. And one of them was close to 0% interest. So even though we're paying debt off, it doesn't have an effect on lowering the interest cost. We have been carrying extra cash and earnings of money on that cash in Q3. That will go away in Q4 as we pay down that term debt. And we do have, as its traditional in our business, seasonally a much higher CapEx spending in the fourth quarter. We typically spend 30% to 40% of our capital between October 1 and the end of the year. So we have additional capital outlays. First of all we did that earlier in the year. So those would be the biggest factors.
Operator: The next question will come from John Roberts of UBS.
John Roberts: Michael, there've been some press reports that PPG has been working as part of a joint bid for Axalta. Could we assume any trust issues for both auto OEM and refinish would be really high so that your interest is primarily in the industrial non-auto?
Michael McGarry: Well, John, first of all we are always flatter in people associate ourselves in the rumor market, but as you can imagine, we're not in a position to comment about another public company. We are going to continue to drive the consolidation in the coating space. And as we mentioned earlier, our pipeline remains active, but as far as any particular company, it would be inappropriate for us to comment.
John Roberts: Then maybe based on the IHS auto builds outlook for the fourth quarter. Could you - just based on their assumptions, can you give us maybe a range for your auto OEM coatings volumes in the fourth quarter by region and what it would roll up to in aggregate?
Vince Morales: So John, we're going to benefit from some easing of comps as we look at prior year. So I would look at IHS has revision that just came out this week and we would be looking at our performance being somewhere in line with those build forecast.
John Roberts: Okay. Thank you.
Michael McGarry: John, the only other thing I would add is that from a very, very small minor green shoot area, we did see build start to pick up in the last two weeks of September in China. So we'll wait and see whether this is a trend line, some of the local Chinese guys who are behind the curve on meeting the emission standards. So maybe there are just catching up, but we'll continue to keep an eye on it.
Operator: The next question will come from Don Carson of Susquehanna.
Don Carson: Yes. First question on the sustainability of the price increases. Michael, you mentioned that it was probably price increase will moderate in the fourth quarter but you've had six quarters now of over 2%. How much longer do you think you can sustain that, and particularly as you get push back from customers in the industrial sector?
Michael McGarry: Well, first of all, John - sorry, Don. We have not had any push back yet from customers. I mean, you get to normal push back but, at the end of the day they know full well that we've had more inflation then what we've recovered they can read the financial statements just as well as you can. So they know we're behind. They also know that we are - if you look at some of our regions, we're below then the curve line if you will on volume and some of that is because we've said we're going to need to continue to get price, and we're going to take price and if they want to move volume away, that's perfectly acceptable to us. And so right now, we know we're going to get price in the fourth quarter, pretty optimistic we'll still have a positive price number in Q1. And we're going to continue to push because at the end of the day, we should be asking for value commensurate with the value that we create for our shareholder - or our customers and so we're going to continue to ask for it.
Don Carson: Then a follow-up on U.S. architectural. How do you see the industry growing given some fairly good housing data both maintenance and new homes and now that you've got the - lot of the customer mix issues behind you, do you think PPG can grow in line with the market or greater than the overall market?
Michael McGarry: Well, for the industry, next year, we have budgeted between 2% and 3% growth. We think that's a realistic number. Our architectural team is on the optimistic side, but I think this is a point where we have to show and not kind of like to show me state. Let's see what happens. And I think our goal would be to start with continuing to meet the industry numbers and we'll see how well the team does.
Operator: The next question will come from Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets.
Arun Viswanathan: Just a question here. Higher level and looking into 2020, if I could just ask this a different way. You guys had referenced kind of 2% plus price now for a little while. Volumes have been kind of flat to down. Next year if I think about some of your end markets, aerospace faces some pretty tough comps, architectural could be up slightly and your comments here, automotive, it doesn't really appear that it's getting better, although you cited maybe slightly better than your expectations. So when I put all that together, it sounds like next year volumes could be also flat to down slightly, and then I don't know if you're necessarily going to have the price. So just kind of trying to understand how you're thinking about sales growth from here, it would appear that next year would likely be lower than this year just given the lack of pricing actions? Thanks.
Michael McGarry: Well, Arun, I think it might be a little bit early to call that. When I think about some of the innovations that we have out there, I think if you think about low temperature cure that's still an opportunity for us. For aerospace we have a number of customers who were qualifying e-coat for airlines, so that's still an opportunity for growth. We still have more share to gain back in Europe, because we have been leading the price charge over there on that. So I'm not where you are right now, it's a little early to say that. So I'm - I will say that we should be more on the positive side.
Vince Morales: Yes, Arun, I'll just reiterate what I said earlier. We think most of our customers and many channels are carrying very low inventory levels. So with any modest economic recovery we think there's going to be a dual effect, the recovery itself plus some kind of inventory replenishment level. So it's again too early to make that call, but as we talk to our customers, they are very low in there in terms of inventory on the balance sheet.
Arun Viswanathan: And just as a follow-up, it looks like you've taken some very swift action on the cost front. Those are coming through nicely. Your price cost is heading in the right direction. I guess, I'm just curious and then you have the new product pipeline. What else could you do - from a standpoint you've completed four deals, are you also open to something a little bit more transformative, the strategic review kind of unveiled that breaking the company up isn't really advantageous. But is there anything larger or more strategic that you could pursue to shift the focus a little bit forward, I guess?
Michael McGarry: Well, Arun. I would tell you that nothing is off the table. We're always going to be looking to do what's in the best interest of our shareholders. We're going to be disciplined though. We're not going to be doing anything that doesn't create value. We still have more opportunities when I think about the EV market, that is still a wonderful opportunity for us. And we're obviously anxious support to play out sooner rather than later we can't control that. There is still a challenge, where the EV cars cost significantly more than a traditional car, and they have to figure out a way to get those costs more in line to selling some more cars.
Operator: The next question will come from John McNulty of BMO Capital Markets.
John McNulty: Just going back to the architectural stores business that you have. Last quarter you had expected for this quarter at least in the guidance you had kind of indicated you were looking for low single-digit demand growth. And I guess given some of the pent-up demand around the wet season, we would have thought it would be even better than that. I guess relative to those expectations what change or what was off. Is it just that it went more and more quickly to the independent dealers or is there something else in the mix that we should be thinking about?
Michael McGarry: Well, John, first of all, I'm not sure that in your influence came from, we grew third quarter of '18 at high single-digits, and jump in over that comp was going to be a challenge. And given the way we structured the stores and the dealers, we thought it would be a challenge. So overall, I would tell you that we're pleased with the rollout of this premier authorized dealer network. So, Vince I don't know if there's any...
Vince Morales: No. Well, I was going to say the same thing then maybe a different way. We look at the stores in our dealer network as were kind of merging that into a singular channel. We try to - we're trying to optimize what we do on our micro-market basis as Michael mentioned earlier. So we're not overlapping as much and whether this - whether the sale goes to a dealer or to our store is inconsequential to us. So we have to look at these combined. And if you - again, if you look at the dealer results this quarter and year-to-date, they're up nicely, and that to lower cost to serve for us. So I think we are - it's probably more semantic than anything.
John McNulty: Now, that's helpful. And then on the unexpected customer shutdowns, is this something that you typically recapture as the volumes come back on. I mean do you see the customers - your customers essentially try to run harder to catch back up or is it something where look to business it's come and gone and it's kind of something we are going to have to just get passed?
Michael McGarry: No I would suspect that if you take the case of our friends up in Detroit, you know they're going to be short of trucks. So they're going to be trying to catch up that volume. Now on the car side, they're probably not as worried about that. But net-net I think they will be trying to optimize their inventories and it may be different at one plant versus another on how hard they are going to ramp up, but some of that volume will come back, but definitely not all of it.
Vince Morales: And we've seen customers curtailments on both sides of the quarter. We saw, July shutdowns are normally traditional annual time period to do shut down, some of those were extended. We saw obviously different shutdowns in September. If you look - but again, if you look at the inventories as a microcosm in the automotive OEM business, the inventory levels are very low in almost every region relative to historical levels. And so again, I think that's another good news story at some point, they're running below - well below the historical inventory levels.
Operator: The next question will come from Jeff Zekauskas of JP Morgan.
Jeff Zekauskas: Earlier in the call Michael, you talked about raw materials moderating. Were they down about 2% in the quarter? And can you comment on raw materials in the United States and that propylene is I don't know, $0.38 a pound. And last year at this time, it was $0.58 a pound. So maybe it's down 35%. So is there much more raw material depreciation in the United States than there is in other regions?
Vince Morales: Let me take the third question Jeff and Michael will...
Jeff Zekauskas: Sure.
Vince Morales: In total, our cost buckets were not down 2% anywhere near that. We did, as Michael mentioned, have a variety of other costs that are elevated or still elevating. We aggregate that, and when you aggregate that we had very modest moderation of raw material cost in the quarter and year-over-year, and again that's after several years of accumulation of inflation.
Michael McGarry: And Jeff, I know you sounded like one of our customers with selectively picking up propylene in North America, but you forgot to mention ethylene in North America is at $0.27 in this time last year is at $0.20. So, and I always tell people we don't buy ethylene. We don't buy propylene; we buy the derivatives of these supply and demand of the derivatives is also important. So where you might have propylene down 15% you have ethylene up 30%. So there are some puts and takes.
Jeff Zekauskas: Well, contract ethylene was $0.33, but so secondly when you contemplate your acquisition strategy, are you - do you have a bolt-on strategy or is it something larger than a bolt-on for the next year.
Michael McGarry: Well, I think as we've always mentioned, we're active in looking at the pipeline and we're going to take the best use of our shareholders' money and we're going to be disciplined in that approach. So it could be either or, but right now the opportunities are historically have been on the bolt-on.
Operator: The next question will come from Duffy Fischer with Barclays.
Patrick Fischer: You mentioned a number of times kind of the cumulative impact of the inflation you've seen over the last couple of years. How much price do you need from here if you hold those cost constant, do you need to get back to par?
Vince Morales: That's a great question Duffy because we still need more price. And that's what we tell our sales guys and ladies every day, that we're still not on a cumulative basis recovered. It's different obviously by region by business, but we still need - we're not going to give an exact number, but it's, it's a more than we have today and cumulatively our prices that we've given at the past couple of years were up just shy of mid-single digits and then we need to be just north of mid-single digit.
Patrick Fischer: All right, and then historically when you've built cash sometimes you put parameters around that cash flow. You will give us a timeframe where either via acquisitions or buybacks you'll consume that cash. Is that worked in your mind historically when you've done that, and if it has or hasn't how would that impact what you might do going into 2020 with the cash you've built?
Vince Morales: I'll remind you that we have about $600 million or $650 million of the cash on the balance sheet today slated for term debt pay down and we did some term debt issuance in Q3. We like the interest rates and we're going to swap that out for payment in Q4. We'll look at our - we look on a recurring basis on monthly basis at a minimum at our cash and our cash uses and potential cash use for the next couple of quarters. We'll do it again certainly through the fourth quarter. And if we want to give guidance on that we'll do so in January. Right now, as Michael said the acquisition pipelines are active and we still like to keep some dry powder to some of the things out there, but we're not immune to give it or not immune to not giving it. It just depends on what we see going forward and what we feel shareholders want to hear from us.
Operator: The next question comes from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies.
Dan Rizzo: It's Dan Rizwan for Laurence. How are you? You mentioned before on the Brexit is kind of cropping up as a headwind. I was just wondering if a - no deal Brexit means or what a deal means or if it doesn't matter as long as it is like just remove the uncertainty?
Michael McGarry: Well, the best thing would be, the removal of the uncertainty without having boarded prices. Right now we're not able to predict that, as you're going to get, we are prepared for either way. What we do see is our architectural business has hung in there pretty good, but then if you look at our little business up in Northern Ireland, that is way more consternation and churn up there, then there might be in, say, Southern Europe - Southern England. So I'd say it varies but at this point in time, it's still a huge watch out for us.
Dan Rizzo: Okay, thanks for that. And then maybe my second question, you mentioned I think adding 50 new distributors this quarter, I was wondering if we should think about it as kind of a general run rate going forward like 50 a quarter 200 a year. I mean am I thinking about that right?
Michael McGarry: Well, it's a new program this year. So we do have some earlier sign ups. That's probably a good number, we should probably look at for Q4 call and try to give you guys some parameters. It's too early to make that call right now.
Operator: The next question will come from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley.
Vincent Andrews: Just trying to think through the comments earlier about the potential for customers to rebuild inventory next year and I guess where I'm trying to square on my head is that we've had, as you say, six quarters of a very solid 2% price increase is going through and yet the customer base seems to be running lower than average or normal levels of inventory despite the fact that it's very clear. You're going to - to continue to take pricing. So other than some economic fly up, what is it that's going to - or could cause customers to rebuild inventory levels versus if they've been at low levels for a long period of time and they're generating greater cash flow. For that reason why wouldn't they just stay where they are. So what are the pros and cons on that?
Michael McGarry: For the first reason why they've rebuilt and if they had confidence that their end-use demand is going to pick up. So think about the heavy duty equipment guys right, they're wondering what the heck is going on in the farming business and whether or not they're going to be selling more combines. Right now there is a lot of churn in that segment. So they're trying to figure that out. If they had more clarity on what's the future look like, the farmers would be more willing to spend their money if they had a better idea about the crops, they'd have a better chance to spending it. So I think that would be one. The other one is consumer confidence in China. Right now, consumer confidence in China is down TMI and China is down. And so, if they thought that the trade churn was behind them, I think people in China would get behind that and start making major purchases. Right now they have deferred on major purchases.
Vincent Andrews: Okay, thanks very much. I'll leave it there as we are toward top of the hour.
Operator: The next question will come from Stephen Byrne of Bank of America.
Stephen Byrne: Yes, thank you. You mentioned just a few moments ago about your volumes in OEM auto to be roughly in line with IHS expectations. It seems your third quarter volumes underperformed or were more challenged than the global auto build rate contracted. Is there something in there that you can attribute that to?
Michael McGarry: Part of it, Stephen, was in China. So we have a pretty good split of the local Chinese OEMs. And these guys were behind on the emission changeovers and so they were suffering from that standpoint. So they underperformed significantly, the China as well as the Asian standard. So that's probably the single biggest thing.
Stephen Byrne: And then just a quick one on your store - your architectural stores. If you have a loyal paint contractor to your own stores, if they were to shift to a dealer location or - is that particular mix of paint that they're buying in the composition and menu and all of that is that transferred to that dealer and how is your margin on that gallon of paint that's shifted from your store to a dealer?
Michael McGarry: Yes. So think about this way without getting into the specifics, we're agnostic to whether he picks up in the store, or picks up at the dealer. The key is that he can pick up at his price at the location that's most conducive for him winning the business.
Operator: The next question will come from Mike Harrison of Seaport Global Securities.
Mike Harrison: Just wondering if I can maybe build on this idea of the premium dealer channel or dealer network. Can you help us understand exactly what is changing in the model and maybe if there are any costs associated with it and what stage you're in, in this process?
Michael McGarry: Mike, I think we heard your question about trying to understand the differences in the business model. Your coming through pretty lately. But if I understood your question right, I will just give you one example that we have said in the Midwest. We had 8 or 10 stores in that city. We sold those stores to the dealer in that area. We're selling through that dealer, and we're no longer competing with them, slowed everybody's cost to serve. The paint contractor has the same opportunities they had before. So again, what we're trying to do is optimize our distribution points to the customer. That's really the focus of this strategy. I hope that was your question.
Mike Harrison: Yes, I guess, the question I was really trying to get to is what stage are we at in that process of shifting to a different strategy with the dealers or other costs associated with it?
Michael McGarry: Yes, Mike. We're in I would say a little bit more than a year. The first, early on it was a trial stage. We saw some real good positives with that. Now we've accelerated it. There is no real additional cost. There is some - we need to make sure when they pick up in our dealer stores that they are getting the PPG price. So, there is some transfer data that has to happen, but that's electronic, and so I would not regard this is any material cost and as Vince said earlier, typically it's a lower cost to serve channel to support our dealers.
Mike Harrison: And then the other question I had was within the Industrial business, where there pockets within that business that were stronger or weaker. And just in terms of the trends across all four regions that looks like volumes were down during the quarter. Were the trends stable or were the trends worsening in industrial?
Michael McGarry: Yes. So I would say that the trends were somewhat moderately lower and they really varied by region. So, Europe was a little bit lighter. Asia Pacific, a little bit lighter, U.S. relatively the same, Latin America relatively the same. The segment that outperformed were like Extrusion, electronic materials, those kind of things who are on the upper end of the curve. The clear the ones that were work - weak were general finishes, wood and parts or transportation equipment under - the end of the hood parts that typically show up in our industrial segment.
Vince Morales: Based on our cautious outlook Mike, I'd say industrial activity modestly weakened throughout the quarter.
Operator: The next question will come from Dmitry Silversteyn of Buckingham Research.
Dmitry Silversteyn: Good morning. Thank you or good afternoon, I should say. Thank you for squeezing me in. Couple of questions. Kind of regional, I guess. Vince, you talked about sort of in your expectations for 2020 that you would expect China to recover a little bit from a macroeconomic perspective. Trying to understand, besides the easy comps in automotive, what gives you the confidence that the Chinese economy and the Chinese consumer is going to come back in 2020?
Vince Morales: Well, we've been talking about this all year Dmitry, the Chinese consumers still accruing buying power. Unemployment rate there is no different than it was three or four years ago. They've moved to more of a saving economy. I think they're feeling, they're apprehensive about the geopolitical environment. And our expectation, our hope is that get some more result and or some of that breaks free because they are - they moved to more of a consumption model and they've saved for, I'd say well over nine months to a year now. And I think there'll be more comfortable spending next year. That's the biggest single item. If you look at the service economy there it's doing well. So again, I think there is still so some good trade in that economy, that would bode well for increased consumer spending.
Dmitry Silversteyn: And then to follow up on your comments on Comex about the growth there being on same-store basis, at least in the low single-digit range. It was a much faster business when you bought it. I think you grew it very nicely in the first few years of ownership. You talked about some kind of political headwind and economic headwind. Looking - at your key leaves, when can we or when do you expect, whatever the situation there that's going on to resolve itself or is it something that's going to drag on to - through 2020. In other words, is there a particular data point or an event that you're looking for or is it just a matter of anniversarying whatever headwinds are being faced by that business?
Michael McGarry: So Dmitry, I'd say there are two factors that we're watching closely. The first one is government spending. So with the transition to the new government run by AMLA as they call him, they are cautious and they have not cranked out the government spending that we typically see. We think that will loosen up, so that should be up year-over-year. And then the other one that we're watching cautiously is major project. So a lot of the folks that have the money who are nervous when AMLA was elected, and so they let their major projects wind down, they haven't restarted new major projects, but what's interesting is that the President has the highest approval ratings ever. And so I think - I think over time people are going to start to loosen up and start to go back to restarting major project. So those are the two factors that we're watching. The good news is our mix continues to improve significantly. And our earnings are going to be an all-time record for Mexico and we're projecting another record year for them next year, the business feels very good about themselves. We're moving into the major paint season. As you know, the holidays, Thanksgiving through Christmas in Mexico, huge family time and this is going to be a period of time when we see our highest volumes in fourth quarter.
Operator: The next question will come from Garik Shmois of Longbow Research.
Garik Shmois: Thanks for squeezing me in. I just wanted to follow-up just on the dealer network and the evolution there. Will that end up changing your end market exposure in architectural particularly in the U.S., does it make you more exposed to new construction versus repaint or not really?
Michael McGarry: No, material change, Garik.
Garik Shmois: And then just lastly, just on aerospace, you talked about in the outlook for the fourth quarter moderating growth, but I think it's really just a function of the tough comp from a year ago. So I just want to be clear on that. And then just wondering if you could maybe provide an outlook into 2020. How you view aero just because the comp will be tough throughout the balance of next year?
Michael McGarry: Yes. We still expect clearly the comps that we've put in place this year in high single digits and even in Q1, Q2 and we had low double digits, it's going to be tough to jump over. But when I look at the new technology we rolled out, the new wins we've had, I'm still optimistic that they're going to have a very, very good year in aerospace.
Operator: The next question will come from Jim Sheehan of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
Jim Sheehan: In packaging you talked about some customers were trialing some things you had some pack tests. Could you give some more detail on that? Were these food packages or beverage packages and how did the test turn out?
Michael McGarry: Well, that's mostly on the beverage side, as I had mentioned earlier. Jim, the food guys are much, much further along in these conversions. So on the beverage side, you know, basically we don't get pack test results for quite some period of time. It depends upon the severity of it, whether they're moving all around the world. Send them to hot spots like Saudi and cold places like Norway or how extensive the change is, so we basically have pack tests going on all the time in this business. What I would tell you is that we fared pretty well in these things and as these tests come in typically that's been pleased to new business.
Jim Sheehan: And then in the European automotive OEM, I think that you had some difficult comps with last year, due to some emissions changes which had pulled forward demand and you would think that might lead to an easier comp in the fourth quarter, but it looks like the IHS numbers are still not that optimistic. Is there something else or is the export demand trend from Europe offsetting the benefit you might get from the change in the WLTP implementations?
Vince Morales: Yes, Jim, I think you hit the nail right on the head. We do see fewer exports out of Europe to Asia. That's one of the drags year-over-year. No different in the Asian sales in the indigenous in the region. So that's a factor, and obviously the industrial activity and the lack of industrial activity in Europe's another factor.
Operator: And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.
Michael McGarry: Thank you, Carrie. I'd like to thank everybody on the call today for your time and interest in PPG. If you have any further questions, please contact our Investor Relations department. This concludes our third quarter earnings call.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a great day.

Michael McGarry: Thank you, John, and good afternoon everyone. I want to thank you for your continued interest in PPG. Today, we reported second quarter 2019 financial results. For the quarter, our net sales were slightly more than $4 billion and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.85. Consistent with our improvement targets, we delivered higher year-over-year operating margins for the second consecutive quarter as both gross profit and segment margins improved versus the prior year. Our margins benefited from continuing selling price realization and strong cost management across all our businesses and regions. We were still in the early days of margin recovery, and while we are building some momentum we still have more work to do. Our overall objective is to return to the aggregated segment margins that we have maintained prior to this recent inflationary cycle. To provide some additional color on our second quarter results, our net sales in constant currency were higher than in the prior year by about 1%. Sales volumes were down nearly 4% impacted by weaker global industrial production that significantly affected global automotive production in many of our general industrial end-use markets, and was evident in all major regions. Also, about one-third of the total sales volume decline relates to the prior year customer assortment changes in our U.S. architectural coatings DIY business. We have now reached the one-year anniversary of these changes and it will no longer be a comparison deviation. We remain committed and are on track to fully offset the earnings impact of this assortment change in the third quarter. Selling prices were 2.3% higher marking the ninth consecutive quarter of higher selling prices. We're continuing to work with our customers to ensure we are receiving fair value for our products and services and expect selling prices to increase at a similar rate in the third quarter despite comping against improving gains in the prior year third quarter. Finally, our net sales were affected by significant unfavorable currency translation of more than 3% or about $130 million. Going forward, we expect unfavorable currency translation to continue albeit at more modest levels with our current estimate for the third quarter of on unfavorable sales impact of between $30 million and $50 million. Moving to some business trends in the second quarter. In our Performance Coatings reporting segment, aerospace coatings continued to deliver very strong volume growth, outpacing industry performance in most major regions. In automotive refinish, sales volumes were lower year-over-year reflecting lower collision claims in the U.S. which were down 2% for the industry in the second quarter and in comparison to strong sales volumes in the prior quarter. We expect refinish volume comparisons to improve on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter as our prior year included an unfavorable impact of PPG-specific customer inventory destocking. Year-over-year organic sales were higher in our architectural coatings EMEA business driven by higher selling prices. Aggregate sales volumes were slightly lower as wetter-than-normal weather patterns impacted overall regional demand during the quarter. In Mexico, our PPG-Comex business increased organic sales aided by higher selling prices. Sales volumes were tepid as consumer demand reflected increased uncertainty around Mexico's economy and economic policies. PPG-Comex business continues to perform very well and continues its growth by adding nearly 70 concessionary locations in the first half of 2019. Sales volumes in architectural coatings Americas in Asia-Pacific decreased due to lower net DIY sales of about 60 million stemming from the prior year customer assortment changes. Same-store company-owned sales growth in the U.S. and Canada were relatively flat including impacts from fewer shipping days year-over-year and wet weather that impacted most of this region during the quarter. Led by strong growth in the Asia region, our protective marine coatings business continued to deliver above-industry organic sales volume -- excuse me, organic growth of high single-digit percentage during the quarter. We are very excited that this business was recently awarded a five-year contract with the U.S. Navy to supply coatings and technical services to the military Sealift command which includes about 125 ships. In our Industrial Coatings reporting segment, sales volumes were adversely impacted by soft industrial demand in most regions of the world. Most acute were automotive OEM industry build break which declined by nearly 20% in China and remained soft in Europe. In aggregate, PPG's automotive sales volumes were lower by high single-digit percentage consistent with reduction of global builds. One statistics we track is automotive OEM dealer inventories, which decreased as the quarter proceeded, which may help demand in the second half of the year. As a partial offsets our automotive OEM business realize higher selling prices in each major region for the second consecutive quarter with similar expectations for Q3. Softer global industrial production activity impacted many of our general industrial coatings business sub-segments, most notably coil, general finishes, appliances and transportation and markets. Also our packaging coatings sales volumes decreased modestly in comparison to above-market growth in the prior year, driven by customer adoption to our INNOVEL interior can coatings products. Our packaging business has achieved above-market growth in the past five years of about 20% compounded. We expect this business to return to growth by the end of the year. From an earnings perspective, as I mentioned earlier, our second quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $1.85. Our earnings were negatively impacted by about $20 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. On a constant currency basis, our adjusted EPS is modestly higher than the prior year. Our effective tax rate was about 24% in the second quarter, which is higher than the 22% rate in the second quarter of 2018. The increase mostly relates to recognizing nonrecurring favorable discrete items in the second quarter of 2018. We are still anticipating a tax rate between 23% and 25% for the full year 2019. Our EPS results were supported by the increase in our selling prices, improved manufacturing performance, aggressive cost management and excellent progress in our cost savings programs, which delivered about $20 million in cost savings during the quarter in line with our targets. As we look ahead, we expect global economic activity to remain sluggish in the third quarter. We expect global automotive production in general industrial demand to remain unfavorable year-over-year and roughly comparable to what we experienced in the second quarter. Positive developments around regional and country trade disputes could provide a spark to industrial demand as inventory levels in many of our end-use market remain low. Specific to our businesses, we believe that the potential for lower U.S. interest rates could aid growth in the U.S. housing market and also favorably impact automotive OEMs and U.S. architectural sales. In Latin America, we anticipate economic activity to be similar to that experienced in the second quarter and we'll continue to add new PPG-Comex concessionary locations to expand our customer reach. Also we have a new manufacturing facility under construction in Panama to localize production and support our sales growth in Central America. In Asia, demand rates are expected to remain consistent in comparison to the second quarter as we move back into the back half of 2019, sales comparisons to last year will become easier given the weakness in Asian demand that began to occur late last year. This will result in easier comparison and relative performance improvements year-over-year. We intend to remain laser focused on our cost structure. We remain confident that demand growth will eventually return in China. Economic growth in Europe is expected to remain tepid. And our automotive OEM business year-over-year growth will be difficult in the third quarter as last year benefited from inflated sales from purchases brought forward ahead of the WLTP implementation. Later in the year, the year-over-year comparison should improve into positive territory. We expect our architectural business to continue to grow, driven by higher selling prices and strong cost management. Brexit uncertainty is not yet impacting our business trends. However, we expect to closely monitor the situation and prepare contingency plans to best address the potential impacts to overall demand and relating inventory needs. With ongoing uncertainty over global industrial production, we have intensified our cost management and costs, including working with our supplier base to ensure that our input costs are reflective of current industry demand conditions. In addition, our focus on our cost structure remains elevated as evidenced by our recently announced approval of a new cost savings program, which is a result of a comprehensive internal operational assessment to identify further opportunities to improve our profitability. We have begun implementation of this program, which we expect to have a full year run rate savings of $125 million upon completion of the program. In addition, we are on the final stages of the execution of the cost savings programs announced in 2016 and 2018. We expect the total benefit from all of these programs to be about $20 million of additional incremental savings to be realized in the third quarter. Earlier today, we provided EPS guidance specific to the third quarter of 2019. This guidance is $1.57 to $1.67 and includes an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of $0.01 to $0.02 per share. We are also reaffirming our full year 2019 adjusted earnings per share growth of 7% to 10%, excluding currency translation impacts. In the second quarter, we generated operating cash flow of about $550 million, nearly $200 million more than last year and through the first six months of the year have generated about $350 million more operating cash flow than the same period last year. Our focus on cash flow generation will continue and our goal remains to reduce working capital as a percent of sales compared to 2018. We completed the Hemmelrath acquisition earlier in the second quarter. I'm happy with the early progress and performance of these three recently completed acquisitions Hemmelrath, SEM and Whitford, which will add about $400 million in annual revenue, of which approximately $100 million is in the Asia-Pacific region. Acquisition remains one of our preferred cash deployment options, given the value that these have driven for our shareholders over the years. And currently, our pipeline remains solid. In addition to acquisitions, we have progressed our key capital expenditures during the second quarter and we expect total spending to be about 3% of sales in 2019. Also, earlier today, our Board of Directors approved a $0.03 per share dividend increase. We have paid uninterrupted annual dividend since 1899 and 2019 will mark 48 years of increased dividend payout. And we are pleased to continue to reward our shareholders in this manner. We ended the second quarter with more than $1 billion of cash and short-term investments, which continues to provide us with significant financial flexibility. Finally, I'd like to thank and recognize PPG's 47000 employees, all over the world, for their continued support and strengthening our position as a leading paint, coatings and specialty materials company. Every day our employees are driving our cultural initiative the PPG way to provide innovative solutions for our customers' most pressing challenges and to deliver value to all our stakeholders. This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG. And now Jamie, I would you please open the line for questions.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Michael just on raws, how are you looking at raws in the back half of the year? And what do you expect to happen with the TiO2 prices in the back half of the year? Thank you.
Michael McGarry: David, you know there's been a lot of focus on raw materials in-house. But when you think about it, we have some of our commodities. Most of our commodities are near flat. Maybe one of them is still up, and we have a couple that are trending down. But overall, between that and overall inflation with salaries and everything else, we are still in a marginally inflationary environment. And we still not recovered all the margin from our pre-inflationary peak. So as you heard in my opening comments, we are still progressing with price increases, and we anticipate having further price moving forward. In regard to TiO2, what I would say is the same answer I gave at the very beginning of the year is that TiO2 is really a non-event this year. And we are going to continue to focus on using TiO2 very efficiently. And our program, as you know has been to optimize our formulation to minimize TiO2 usage. And this year, we are on track again to take an additional 1% out of our TiO2 consumption. So I don't see the trends really changing, you know, there's excess capacity on the sulfate side. And later in the back half of the year you have the chloride plant coming on. So that's why we remain confident that TiO2 will be a non-event.
David Begleiter: And Vince just on buybacks, what were buybacks in Q2? How should we think about buybacks in the back half of the year? Thank you.
Vince Morales: Thanks, David for the question. In Q2, our share count was relatively neutral year-over-year. We did minimal if any buybacks in the first six months of the year except to offset some dilution we did with an acquisition. The – for the full year, our focus remained on not building our cash position. We have on a year-over-year basis we have an active acquisition pipeline, which Michael alluded to in the opening remarks. That remains an important part of our cash deployment strategy for properties at the right price, create value for our shareholders. Absent that, if we can't execute on those we would look to share repurchase.
David Begleiter: Thank you.
Vince Morales: Thank you, David.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Roberts from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.
John Roberts: Thank you. There's a Bloomberg report about PPG being among others looking at Axalta. I don't expect you to comment on the speculation, but could you just remind us how concentrated the auto OEM and auto refinish markets are maybe just in general terms?
Michael McGarry: Well, I think the way to think about that is that – the different numbers vary by region and by automakers. So, it's probably inappropriate for us to comment on not just the speculation but actually market share because we could overestimate or underestimate the various people shares. And I wouldn't want to put incorrect information out there, so I probably would prefer to pass it.
John Roberts: It's all right. Sorry, I didn't mean to put you on the spot. In the U.S. DIY retail channels we've had some share shifts first at Lowe's then at Home Depot now Ace. If you look in aggregate at the U.S. DIY retail channels, have market shares in aggregate changed much over the past year? Or just been a lot of shuffling around between different channels?
Michael McGarry: Well, if you go back and look at the space over 20 years, you'll always see some movement as the various retailers try different strategies. By and large I would say that market shares have stayed relatively constant by and large. There's been a little bit of shift here in there, but not that much. More of a rounding there what I would call it.
John Roberts: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
Bob Koort: Thank you. Mike I noticed in your heat map that refinish seemed to be in the marketplace a little bit weaker. Is that -- you mentioned accident rates, but is there any function of price hikes and volume patterns of your customer base of the market that has shifted from one year to the next? And then secondly you mentioned I guess you're lapping some very robust trends in the packaging market that sort of stalled out but you indicated getting back to growth later in the year. Could you give us some more specifics on why that happens? Thanks.
Michael McGarry: Sure Bob. So let's start with refinish. We had a very strong 2Q last year with refinish. There's a couple of very large what we call multiline or people who buy refinish from multiple suppliers. We had a pretty robust 2Q last year with those guys. Then they elected to not purchase in the third quarter. A lot of this is what I call trying to take advantage of the pricing cycle in refinish. So, from a demand standpoint though we're still picking up share. Our net gains on shops is a nice positive and pricing has been very good in that sector. Claims are down about 2% and totals are up 1% to 2%. So, that puts that negative overall at about minus 3%. So, our team has just rolled out new technology in Europe on precision metering of refinish products. It's got an excellent traction so far. So, we are looking forward to seeing how that -- since we're very early we just rolled out a month ago we are very, very early in that. But we anticipate that we'll continue to gain share in refinish given our strong water-based technology and the fact that we've converted more shops at water than anybody else -- everybody else in the industry combined. As for the packaging side, we still have very good technology and we are trialing some additional new technology for the packaging space. That goes -- pack tests are going on right now. Once those pack tests are completed we anticipate that the customers will be shifting some additional business our way, which will be a net positive for us. So that's what we are looking at. Obviously we have to wait till the conclusion of pack tests, but we’re feeling pretty good so far.
Bob Koort: Great. Thank you, Michael.
Operator: Our next question comes from John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.
John McNulty: Yeah, thanks for taking my question. Look there's a lot of noise between the weather and home sales and I guess the contract that you lost last year. Can you give us your thoughts going forward now that you've anniversaried that, how we should be thinking about the architectural -- the health of the U.S. architectural market and how you're thinking about the next 12 months the overall volume growth in that market?
Michael McGarry: Yeah, John we see that market is growing. This year we would have said 2% to 3%. Given in the challenging whether that we've had, they'll try to pick up as much of that as they can. So we might finish 1% to 2% for the year. But overall our customer still have very good backlogs and they feel very confident. They still are challenged to find enough labor to get all their projects done. But they've been able to successfully continue to win business that trend again from DIY to do it for me. That's going to continue. So overall we feel like we’re in a good position. Plus as you heard in my opening remarks, we have committed and we are on pace to out-earn in the third quarter what we are making pre-customer assortment loss. So business has been focused on that and they're going to be in a position to start delivering that in the third quarter.
John McNulty: Great, thanks. And then just a question on the architectural EMEA market. It sounds like you're expecting the usual seasonal dip. It did sound like the second quarter was a little bit washed with bad weather. Is there a way if we have a normal seasonal weather pattern if there is such a thing these days that that you could sequentially see stable to maybe even up scenario for EMEA architectural? Or is that too aggressive?
Michael McGarry: Well, first of all we have -- we're going to have positive sales growth because of pricing. Right now through the first whatever you want to call it 17 days, volumes have been more consistent to the prior patterns. But as you know Europe takes August off. And so we’re always hesitant to predict the third quarter until we see how much vacation time all our big painters take and then how they come back. So I would be -- if I were sitting in front of your model right now, I would use the same prediction you've used for years past, but knowing that we are getting nice price gains in that business in Europe.
John McNulty: Got it. Thanks very much for the color.
Michael McGarry: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi. Please go ahead with your question.
Ghansham Panjabi: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. In your slide deck, you basically commented on additional pricing actions for the Performance Coatings segment in the third quarter. Is that specific to any region or business? And I didn't really see same comment as it relates to Industrial Coatings. I guess, are you where you need to be in that business at this point as it relates to pricing?
Michael McGarry: We have positive price in every business in every region of the world. And it's been a positive story now. We've had positive price for nine consecutive quarters. We're still not where we want to be. We've had 11 quarters in a row of inflation, so we still have some catch-up to do. But when I look at our Industrial Coatings segment and our industrial business within that, they're doing pretty well. And so, I'm not concerned. Obviously, the biggest gap is in the automotive piece and that's where we're working the hardest to get prices up. But we still have more traction in all our industrial businesses.
Ghansham Panjabi: Got it. That's helpful. And then, just in terms of the outlook, you commented on 3Q volumes basically mirroring 2Q. How should we think, Michael, about the fourth quarter? Your comparisons are quite a bit easier. You commented on auto dealer inventories in China, for example, as a potential positive. Just as we cycle into 2020, how are you sort of thinking about the world at this point? 
Vince Morales: Ghansham, Vince here. Little early to call Q4, we got to make our way through Q3. But in the back half of -- really in the back half of 2018 we had several key issues that make the 2019 period, make it a little easier from a comparable basis. We did have refinished destocking, Michael alluded to earlier. We did have just started the customer assortment changes. We will anniversary very shortly the China automotive downturn. And just from a top line perspective, currency has been a negative in the first part of this year and it mutes out in the back half of the year. So we have several things specific to PPG that we think give us some comfort in our forecast.
Ghansham Panjabi: Thanks so much, Vince.
Vince Morales: Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from Michael Sison from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.
Michael Sison: Hey, guys. Nice quarter there. In terms of the outlook for the second half of the year, it certainly seems that demand is weaker. Volumes are going to come in a little bit weaker, I guess, than prior expectations. When you think about what has been -- what you've been able to do to offset to that, can you may be frame up, was it mostly the cost savings, the new cost savings program? Are you getting a little bit of price raws? And any other factors that might help you stay on track with your earnings guidance.
Michael McGarry: Yes. So Mike, I'd say, it's everything. With 2.3% price $20 million of costs down, better manufacturing, we pretty much have hit on all cylinders, everything within our control. The team has executed very well on. So we're going to continue to look at that. Volume in a lot of our businesses has been pretty good. Aerospace has had a very good volume quarter. PMC has had good volume quarter. So there are pockets of success. Unfortunately, when you look at OEM-type businesses, they've been a little struggling.
Michael Sison: Okay. And then, a quick follow-up on architecture Americas and Asia Pacific. Your outlook's low single digits for third quarter. Are you seeing -- do you need to see that now? And is it kind of a fluid on a month-to-month basis as the year unfolds? Or is there any lumpiness in that outlook for the third quarter?
Vince Morales: No just picking up what Michael said earlier, we -- there's growth in this market in the U.S. It's been tempered by the weather patterns. Anytime we see decent whether we see a good pickup in sales. So we think there's some pent-up demand there. And we do expect growth in Q3 and a seasonally lighter quarter in Q4, but continued growth. So there's definitely a backlog of demand here.
Michael Sison: Great. Thank you.
Vince Morales: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Please go ahead with your question.
Frank Mitsch: Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Hey. You had a difficult comp on auto refinish in 2Q. You're suggesting that 3Q is going to be an easier comp due to the vagaries of the year-ago period. So I was just curious so. How should we think about the underlying volume growth and sales growth that you can get in the refinish business?
Michael McGarry: Frank, I still see refinish as a flat long-term market. We are going to get positive price. We are going to work through our water. More people are going to convert to water, which uses less products than solvent. At some point in time China will start to put in regulations. We are the number one guy in China. So when you factor in the solvent to water conversions, you will see some negative volume over a longer period of time. But we don't see collisions changing materially in the near-term. Collision rates in Asia continue to happen. So – and of course, there's still a growing car park around the world. So this is a great business for us as you know, and we are one of the global leaders. And we are still very excited about this business.
Vince Morales: And just to expand on that Frank, our customers pay for technology. We're part of the leadership in terms of technology in the industry. So as Michael refers to price, we really talk about price/mix. The whole mix of the industry is moving up reflective of the technology that everybody is bringing to the table. So even though the absolute volume might be down a little bit, the costs per unit or cost per liter is up, because of the mix component.
Frank Mitsch: That's very helpful. And I guess my follow-up will be it's been about two months since you did your strategic review and decided to keep the portfolio as is. I'm just curious in terms of the feedback that you've received from your shareholder base. Is there any color you can provide in terms of the positive or negative feedback that resulted from that decision?
Vince Morales: Yeah. Frank, we talk obviously to a lot of shareholders. Those are conversations we have individually with them. The feedback we look at is what happens in the stock every day in the marketplace. That's what I would reference you to.
Michael McGarry: Yeah. And Frank one other thing I might add back on the refinish question, I should have pointed out. We do have a light industrial piece of that business and a commercial transport. And both of those segments are growing. Of course, they're much smaller than the base refinish business, but those were help offsetting some of the trends we talked about earlier.
Frank Mitsch: Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. I was looking at your corporate expense. I think for the first half, its $90 million versus $66 million than a year ago. And I think for the third quarter you said, your corporate expense will be $45 million and maybe last year it was $26 million. So it looks like that through the first three quarters your corporate expense will be up I don't know $40 million or $45 million. What's going on there? What's behind that? Or is it a timing issue and corporate expense in the fourth quarter comes down a lot?
John Bruno: Hey, Jeff. This is John. I think there is two key drivers. One is last year we made some adjustments to our incentive compensation accruals in the second and third quarter. And last year, we had a little bit more favorable pension expense, but based on the different items like the discount rate and consensus data that we have. So, the former is the bigger driver but a couple of things there Jeff that are driving the upswing this year.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay. And then for my follow-up the -- your SG&A costs year-over-year were down a little bit both in first quarter and the second quarter. But last year your SG&A really fell pretty sharply in the third quarter. It went from I think something like 9.41 to 8.67 from the second to the third quarter. Is your SG&A going to be lower year-over-year or roughly lower year-over-year in the third quarter? Or does it rise maybe because of the compensation expenses you're talking about? How does the SG&A look year-over-year in the third quarter?
Vincent Morales: Yes Jeff, those two questions I think your first questions are interlinked. Some of the numbers John mentioned are located in our SG&A cost pool, so there's variability in there. Currencies if you look at it on an absolute number basis currency is a big impact to just absolute numbers. So we did have a weaker foreign currency last year so that has an impact as well. We're -- our steady run rate we're adding Q2 of 2019. We expect to be comparable as a percent of sales in Q3. We do have lighter seasonality in Q3 versus Q2 as well so that's not--
Jeff Zekauskas: Sure. Okay, great. Thank you so much.
Vincent Morales: Thanks Jeff.
Operator: And our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Please go ahead with your question.
P.J. Juvekar: Yes. Thank you. So, Michael you talked about China auto inventories coming down and that's a good thing. When you talk to your customers in the OEM market what signals do you get when you look at their production schedules for 2020? Do you think market can grow come back to growth again in 2020 for Chinese auto OEM?
Michael McGarry: Well, I do believe it will be up in 2020. I think it's a little early to call that though. I don't think the trends that we're seeing right now are going to continue. But the single biggest factor in this is the trade war if that's what you want to call it. People have money in their pocket in China. People are employed. It's a lack of consumer confidence. These -- our Chinese employees themselves they're also looking at the same thing. I was just over there six weeks ago. And the fact of the matter is for major purchases, they are sitting on the sidelines to see how this turns out. So, the first thing that I'm looking for is a settlement where everybody can move on from the current positions that everybody has staked out. Consumer confidence will flow very quickly because it's not like they have to get people reemployed over there. They are already employed and they are saving money right now in this environment. And so they have a lot of firepower to put to work. So, I think whenever this dust settle, we will see a pop not too much different than we saw what quarter was it? It was third quarter last year when they changed the tariffs or the VAT. So, I think there'll be a pretty good movement in that.
P.J. Juvekar: Okay. Thank you. And for my second question recently there was a market share change at Ace Hardware and you talked about that a little bit. Was PPG involved in any of those discussions? And then when you lost some volumes at one of your retail customers, are those volumes still available if you get an order? Or do you shut that capacity down?
Michael McGarry: P.J., I don't think it's appropriate for us to discuss specific customers. You should assume that any place there's somebody buying paint that we're actively talking to those customers. From a paint plant standpoint, we did shut down some plants in response to the customer assortment change, but we still have capacity in the marketplace. And as you know ramping up a paint plant sometimes is as simple as adding as another shift running over time. So we are definitely flexible enough to respond to the market.
P.J. Juvekar: Great. Thank you.
Michael McGarry: Thanks, P.J.
Operator: Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.
Arun Viswanathan: Thanks a lot. Good afternoon. Just a question on the guidance. Last quarter you had mentioned that embedded within your guidance there was a little bit of recovery in China. And, obviously, production rates have continued to lag on the auto side, potentially seeing some continued slowing due to the trade scrimmages. So I guess where do you stand on China? Is that part of the -- what would push you to the seven -- to the upper end of the 7% to 10% of recovery there? Maybe you can just give us your comments there? Thanks.
Vince Morales: Yeah, Arun if you noticed we did talk about the sales guidance being low single digits. I'd see a stretch to get to the bottom end of our prior range on sales. So that's really where we saw the down take. We didn't -- they're up, we didn't experience during Q2. We do have as we walk into every quarter three, four, five, six weeks of order book in hand for most of our OEM customers not just our auto customers. So we typically have at least early read on what each quarter is going to look like. We don't -- as Michael mentioned in the opening comments, we don't see a significant uptick in Q3 in Asia or China specifically. So again we lowered our sales guidance for the year. As you would expect from us we're compensating on the cost side to account for the lower sales.
Arun Viswanathan: And just as another follow-up on the raw material side, obviously, there was some deflation in Q2. When you see that flowing through your system? And maybe you could just relate that to the inventories of raws that you have? Thanks.
Vince Morales: Yeah, couple of points therein. One, we're still seeing pockets of inflation. And, secondly, we have to recognize there's still two years of inflation we absorbed. So we still have a lot of catch-up to do on the pricing side and we're going to work through that. Furthermore, if we do see changes in our raw material basket, they have to flow through inventory. We’re getting to a period of the year where, obviously, sales seasonally are going to be lower. So we typically hold on to our inventory a little longer. 
Arun Viswanathan: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christopher Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.
Christopher Parkinson: Great. Thanks guys. When you think about your progression back towards prior peak margins just generally, how should we think about your expectations for industrial and performance just towards the end of this year and 2020 just very broadly? I mean what additional levers can you even pull now given the volume environment? Or could you even just pull them harder to get back to this level? Just any key moving parts will be appreciated. Thank you.
Michael McGarry: Chris this is Michael. The levers are going to still be the same. We talked about having more than 2% price in Q3, so that's going to be a positive moderation, and the inflation that's going to be a positive. We're going to have additional cost savings. That's going to be positive. The teams are working really hard on the manufacturing side. So that's going to be a positive. So, I think, the trend lines that you've seen will continue in that regard. The big challenge we have is, obviously, we needed a lot more price in our automotive business and a little bit more price in our industrial business, to get back to where we need to be. And so, that's front and center.
Christopher Parkinson: Got it. Hey, can you just talk a little bit about more of your performance in aero and how sustainable that is, just in the intermediate to long term? I understand you're obviously doing a lot more than paint in the end market, including, obviously, a growing presence in services. So how should we just generally think about your long-term strategy, versus, let's say, the core growth on the coatings side? Thank you.
Michael McGarry: Well, we expect to outperform industry for quite a number of years in this business. If you look at the segments that we're in, we're leading in coatings. So we're going to be slightly better than the market there. If you look at our transparencies, we've been -- our customer pull on new programs has been quite significant. And so, we have customers that are asking us to bring them new technology, which they're more than willing to pay for it and that's been a significant win. And then, of course, on the sealant side, our new technology on lighter weight sealants and cure on-demand is going to be trend lines that our customers all value highly and it drives tremendous productivity in their businesses. So they're going to stay on top of that. And then, for a lot of our customers, because we're so important to them, we provide chemical management services or unique packaging to help their productivity on their lines. And so, we have consistently -- so you look at in this past quarter, the industry grew about 5%. And we almost grew double digits. We grew double digits to prior quarter and we're going to go somewhere in that double-digit range in the third quarter. So even though this has historically been a lumpy capital-intensive business, this is a market that we're super excited about and we continue to outperform in all the major segments.
Christopher Parkinson: Thank you.
Michael McGarry: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from VRP. Please go ahead with your question.
Kevin McCarthy: Good afternoon. Vince on slide 9, I think, you indicate anticipated cost savings of $17 million to $20 million in the third quarter from your restructuring efforts. My question is, what does the glide path look like in 4Q and beyond as the new program ramps and the older ones are executed upon? Is that a relatively steady pace we can extrapolate?
Vince Morales: Yes. We said 80 -- 70 to 80 for the year, Kevin, for 2019. We're pacing slightly ahead of that right now and that's basis of the old programs we have. We'll pick up a few million dollars in the fourth quarter on our new program. But the new program won't really kick in earnest until early 2020 and there are some longer lead items in there. So by the end of 2021 we'll be at $125 million run rate. So I would assume a linear progression, as we go through 2020 into 2021.
Kevin McCarthy: Great. And then, shifting gears, the text of your prepared remarks indicated that you had some customer wins in Latin America. Can you comment on which businesses those were in and how large they are? I'm not sure if they're material or not.
Vince Morales: Yeah. These are mostly in our industrial segment, Kevin. We have some benefit in our auto business. We – it's really customer mix. We underperformed in the U.S. We over-performed in Latin America, really serving the same market. But given we give regional outlooks in addition to business outlooks we had to flip between those two regions.
John Bruno: And Kevin just on top of that, this is John. Packaging has been doing very well in South America.
Kevin McCarthy: Did you win business in packaging there?
John Bruno: Correct. South America packaging has been winning business.
Kevin McCarthy: Okay. Thank you very much.
Michael McGarry: And of course Comex continues to win on a daily basis.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Byrne from Banc of America Securities. Please go ahead with your question.
Stephen Byrne: Yes. Thank you. That sealants and adhesive technology that you have in your aerospace business is that suitable to be transferred to one of your other businesses such as autos end markets or construction?
Michael McGarry: So we have sealants and adhesive business in our aerospace, our automotive, our architectural and a teeny tiny bit in our industrial business. We share technology across segments. So when we launched the most recent liquid nails product, it use some of the technology that we had in our aerospace business. And that was a win. We currently have also launched some new products for the U.S. military. And that technology can also be shared across the various platforms. So we routinely share technology across our various business segments.
Stephen Byrne: And then on this most recent cost management program this $125 million program it reads basically three buckets so manufacturing consolidation some trimming of low-margin businesses and then headcount cuts. Can you allocate that program into those three buckets? And were these readily identifiable? Do you see another round after this one?
John Bruno: Steve, this is John. So we are not going to get to that specific level of detail. But these are opportunities we've identified both in continuing to improve our cost structure and inflection of the demand environment that we have today.
Stephen Byrne: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Harrison from Seaport Global. Please go ahead with your question.
Michael Harrison: All right. Good afternoon.
Vince Morales: Hi, Michael.
Michael Harrison: Just a question on the regional pricing dynamics in auto OEM and on the sustainability of pricing there. You had said that pricing has increased in all regions. I believe that was the comment last quarter as well. So how much was pricing up? And if there were any differences from region to region what was driving it?
John Bruno: No, Mike. We have pretty much similar pricing across the regions. You can well imagine, we deal with global customers. And you're dealing with people that are very sophisticated in how they deal with you. So we are getting it across the regions, and across the platforms. And we are getting it with the local Chinese in case that was your next question as well.
Michael Harrison: Okay. And then my other question is related to the refinish business and these lower collision claims in the U.S. I mean is that accident rates coming down? Are we starting to see the impact of collision avoidance system? Any thoughts on what's behind that?
Michael McGarry: Well, really what you have is a plateauing. Collision is driven by congestion which is driven by implement which is driven by miles driven. And right now unemployment has plateaued at let's call it 3.8, 3.7 whatever you want to call it and so that leads to less collisions when it plateaus. And there has been some impact from lane departure and smart cruise control. But you have the negative impact of distracted driving which I hope you're not doing Michael. But overall I would say you should assume a minus one is kind of what you should probably think about in the long-term.
Vincent Morales: I mean again as we said earlier Michael there's a value uplift in this business as it there been for many years as all the participants add new technology. And the technology is definitely desired by the body shops for productivity purposes.
Michael Harrison: All right. Thank you very much.
Operator: And our next question comes from Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.
Duffy Fischer: Yes, good afternoon. First question is just around the delta between inventory -- or not inventory between volume being down 4% and GDP being positive 1% or 2% a pretty big gap. Anecdotally when you talk to our customers are they destocking? Or maybe they're real consumption is running at higher levels in that and so we'll get a bounce back sometime in the next couple of quarters.
Vincent Morales: Yes. Duffy we really look at industrial production not GDP. GDP includes services. So, industrial production is one -- has certainly not been strong in the first half of the year. But more like to the heart of your question we see most of our customers running lean on inventory, leaner than we've seen in the past. Michael again alluded to that in the opening comments. If there is any surge in demand, there might be a little bit of a two stack here not only in the demand surge, but also inventory replenishment. So, that certainly possible.
Michael McGarry: Yes. And Duffy I would say think about the volume more at a two level not a four level because of the customer assortment changes.
Duffy Fischer: That's fair okay. And then just last one quick one Vince. The $1 billion in cash you have now if you found a place to use now how much cash do you need to run the business? How low can you take that cash balance?
Vincent Morales: Well, that's a seasonal question. We obviously are building inventory at the beginning of the year. We run that down in the back half of the year so we need a little less cash on a daily basis. Somewhere between $400 million and $700 million depending on the season.
Duffy Fischer: Great. Thanks guys.
Michael McGarry: Thanks Duffy.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gary Shmois from Longbow Research. Please go ahead with your question.
Garik Shmois: Hi thank you. I know it's early to be looking out to 2020 and thinking about pricing. And you've been very committed to getting price over the last several years. But in slower volume environment, just wondering how long can you keep pushing this 2% or so price cadence?
Vincent Morales: Well I'll start Michael can finish the question here. But we saw our suppliers push price for two and a half years. And we had an amiable demand environment when that occurred. Again we're just trying to catch up maintain the value chain. So, that's -- again we saw it on our -- coming into our front door for 2.5 years.
Michael McGarry: And I would add innovation, our customers are always very willing to pay for innovation. And if you think about the cost of the paint versus the cost to their final product, if we can get one more car to the body shop or one more heavy duty equipment out, we can make the packaging line run a little quicker. Anything like that they are more than willing to pay for it. So that's why we’re so focused on innovation. And sometimes innovation leads to slightly lower volumes but at least a richer mix with higher pricing. So that's also something you should factor in.
Vince Morales: And if could just speak up one, because what we typically do see when demand is a little choppy like it is today, customers are looking for ways for cost savings. And it plays right into the innovation center that we have.
Garik Shmois: I just want to get an update just on paint store openings in the U.S. how that's tracking year-to-date? And what the outlook is for the second half?
Michael McGarry: Yeah, I tried to always get people up this question. For the U.S. it's not the key driver for our business. We’re focused on servicing our customer needs. We have an authorized dealer network. We have our own paint stores. We have our own DIY customers. So for us, we’re doing different things in different markets. So we add stores in place that are growing like Texas and Florida. And we might be subtracting stores from contracting markets. So for us our store count was relatively flat overall. And that's not a metric that we're a driver of in the U.S. If you want to look at Mexico where we have a 50% market more than a significant share down there, we are driving additional store growth down there. And we are continuing to take share.
Garik Shmois: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Sheehan from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead with your question.
Jim Sheehan: Thanks. Regarding China, you mentioned the unexpected early implementation of China 6 emission standards in large cities. Did you see that impact retail buying patterns at all? Or was that just an impact on OEM production schedule?
Michael McGarry: Well, you do see a little bit of it, because the dealers are trying to get those vehicles off their mark -- off their lots in Shanghai so they don't have to move it to tier three type city. So you did have sales were up I think 6% in June. And sales in July appear to be trending positively as well. But I would tell you that it's hard to parse between how much of that is the change in emission standards versus the actual demand.
Jim Sheehan: Terrific. And then there's some deals in the coatings space announced recently including aerospace coatings. Are you seeing a lot of competition for M&A given the attractiveness of the aerospace market?
Michael McGarry: Well, what I would say is that any asset that comes up for sale in the coatings space always attracts interest. There are some natural buyers. There are people who are consolidators on a continuous basis. And you should assume that when any asset comes up for sale that unless there's an issue with it that's going to trade at a pretty reasonable multiple.
Jim Sheehan: Thank you.
Operator: And our last question today comes from Dmitry Silversteyn from Buckingham Research. Please go ahead with your question.
Dmitry Silversteyn: Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in there. A lot of my questions have been answered, but I'd just like to go back to Vince's response to Gary's question on pricing. You mentioned that you've taken price for 11 quarters, when the demand conditions were amenable and we've had strong economic conditions. We're seeing a pretty meaningful slowdown across the globe, when it comes to industrial economy. And if you kind of read the early signs, it may actually gets worse before it gets better. How does this environment, given that, yes, you are aiding technology, but you're competing against other very competent players out there with technologies of their own, are you -- am I fair in citing that you may be sacrificing a little bit of volume growth to make sure you get the pricing? And that is to the most important part of your strategy in the short term, is to restore your margins through price and then worry about volumes later?
Michael McGarry: Dmitry, that's 100% accurate. We are expecting to get paid appropriately for the technology we deliver. If we haven't been able to get that, we've been willing to walk away from volume. We -- as you saw our volumes in 2018 in architectural Europe were down as we were the only ones out there leading price. Now that the other parties are up there leading price along with us, volume is flowing back our way. We've always said that, we might get short term penalized for raising the price. But ultimately most of our customers want to do business with PPG. And as soon as our other friendly competitors, if they decide to raise price independently, some of that volume cloud flow back to us and we do see that happening sometimes.
Dmitry Silversteyn: Okay. That's very helpful. And just a follow-up, just a couple of housekeeping items. In your drill industrial business, you talked about your revenue being down. What was -- there's got to be a price component in there. So what where the volumes in GI down? And then, a similar question on European paint, what was the foreign exchange impact on the European paint business?
Vince Morales: Those are granularities we typically wouldn't give Dmitry. We did say that the segment volumes, I think, were down about 5%, general industrial. Auto is more than that. Excuse me, in our industrial segment auto is more than that. General industrial was less than that. I think, the proxy for currency in our architecture EMEA business would be just euro to the dollar, to get you pretty close.
Dmitry Silversteyn: Got you. Thank you. That’s all I have.
Vince Morales: Thank you. Great. Appreciate it. 
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference call back over to management for any closing remarks.
Michael McGarry: Thanks, Jamie. I'd like to thank everyone for their time and interest in PPG. If you have any further questions, please contact our mix relations department. This concludes our second quarter earnings call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. We do thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-04-18 14:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the PPG Industries First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Andrea, and I will be your conference specialist today. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Bruno, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
John Bruno: Thank you, Andrea, and good afternoon, everyone. Once again, this is John Bruno, Director of Investor Relations. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG and welcome you to our first quarter 2019 financial results conference call. Joining me on the call from PPG are Michael McGarry, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vince Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our comments relate to the financial information released on Thursday, April 18, 2019. I will remind everyone that we have posted detail commentary and accompanying presentation slides on the Investor Center of our website, ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide additional support to the opening comments Michael will make shortly. Following Michael’s perspective on the Company’s results for the quarter, we will move to a Q&A session. Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the Company’s current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG’s operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. The presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG’s filings with the SEC. Now let me introduce PPG Chairman and CEO, Michael McGarry.
Michael McGarry: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported first quarter 2019 financial results. For the first quarter, our net sales were approximately $3.6 billion, and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.38. Two primary factors that impacted our adjusted EPS were lower global industrial production and significant foreign currency translation headwinds. On a constant currency basis, our adjusted EPS was modestly higher than the prior year. We’re in the early stages of a margin recovery and delivered higher year-over-year operating margins for the first time in two years. This achievement is one quarter ahead of our internal target as we’ve benefited from continued and further progress and selling price realization and strong cost management during the quarter. For the first quarter, our net sales in constant currency were flat with the prior year. Sales volumes were down about 3% impacted by weaker global industrial production, most evident in the automotive OEM in market and geographically in Asia. Also half our sales volume decline related to prior year customer assortment changes and our U.S. architectural DIY business. We will anniversary this assortment change after the second quarter. Our selling prices were 2.6% higher marking the eighth consecutive quarter of higher sequential pricing. In addition, we passed on modest amount of business this quarter as we prioritize margin recovery. Finally, net sales were negatively impacted by significant unfavorable currency translation of more than 4% or about $160 million. We expect unfavorable currency translation to continue into the second quarter and be in the range of $130 million to $150 million. Looking at some business trends for the first quarter, in our performance coatings reporting segment, aerospace coatings had its fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit percentage sales volume growth led by above industry performance in all major regions. In our automotive refinish business, we continue to see flat industry demand in developed regions. As an example in the U.S. automotive collision claims were down 1% in the quarter. Our refinish business began the integration of the SEM acquisition, which is off to a great start and delivering above segment margins. And we are beginning that process of expanding their geographic commercial scope. We were pleased that the architectural coatings EMEA sales volumes increased for the second consecutive quarter, a combination of positive sales volumes and higher selling prices supported by mid-single digit percentage net sales growth in the quarter. Importantly, all major sub regions were higher. As we discussed in the past, this business and this region delivered high incremental margins on increased volumes as we do not need to add any additional costs to support the growth. Our sales volumes in the Mexican PPG Comex business were slightly lower year-over-year driven by the timing of Easter holiday promotion, which will occur in the second quarter. Paint sales in Latin America are historically higher in the weeks leading up to this holiday. We expect stronger sales volumes in the PPG Comex business in the second quarter. During the quarter, we opened 25 new stores in Mexico and Central America. Sales volumes in architectural coating in Americas and Asia-Pacific decreased due to lower net DIY sales of about $60 million stemming from the prior year customer assortment changes. We did have positive year-over-year sales growth at our other two key DIY customers for the quarter. Same-store company-owned sales growth in the U.S. and Canada was up a low-single digit percentage impacted by soft market demand for most of the quarter. Protective marine coatings continue to deliver excellent sales volume growth of more than 10% for the quarter. In our industrial coatings reporting segments, sales volumes were adversely impacted by our soft industrial activity and most of the major regions of the world. Automotive builds were significantly lower in China and Europe. In aggregate, our automotive sales volumes are lower by a half or by high-single digit percentage consistent with global industry build rates. The automotive OEM business made good progress in implementing selling price increases, realizing sequentially higher price in each major region of the world. Soft global industrial production activity also impacted our general industrial coatings business, most notably in the coil and general finishes segment. As expected, our packaging coatings sales volumes decreased modestly and in comparison to strong above market growth in the prior year, driven by customer adoption to our INNOVEL interior can coatings products. From an earnings perspective, our first quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.38 was slightly below the prior year quarter. Our earnings were negatively impacted by about $20 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. As I mentioned earlier, excluding this impact, our adjusted earnings per diluted share were modestly higher than prior year. During the quarter, we continue to be impacted by raw material inflation, which was nearly all carry forward inflation from 2018. This was our 10th consecutive quarter of raw material inflation. In addition, we encourage logistics and wage inflation in the quarter. Recent increases in crude oil prices and some supply disruptions in China and Texas could affect our input costs unfavorably in the next quarter. Selling price increases 2.6% with comparable contributions from both of our operating business reporting segments. In addition, we made excellent progress on our business restructuring actions delivering more than $20 million in cost savings during the quarter, pacing with our targeted savings. Our effective tax rate was about 24% in the first quarter, which is higher than the 21% rate in the first quarter of 2018. The increase mostly relates to recognizing non-recurring favorable discrete items in the prior year first quarter. We’re still anticipating a full year 2019 tax rate between 23% to 25%. As we look ahead, we expect global economic activity to remain subdued in the second quarter. We anticipate improvement as the year progresses. Global automotive production is expected to decline in second quarter compared to the second quarter of 2018 and general industrial demand is likely to be modest and uneven by end market and region in the second quarter. Positive developments around regional and country trade dispute could spark return to higher industrial activity in the second half of 2018. Specific to our business, we believe that more stable interest rates in the U.S. will help drive modest growth in the U.S. housing market and also favorably impact automotive OEM sales. For the second quarter, we expect U.S. industry automotive builds to be flat. Our U.S. architectural business sales volumes will be down about $60 million, due to the unfavorable customer assortment change. This will be the final quarter for this impact. In Latin America, we intend to face higher sales volumes from normal seasonal demands in the PPG Comex business. Growth rates in Asia are expected to remain soft with some modest improvement compared to the first quarter. We expect our sales volumes in the automotive OEM business to be stronger in the second half of the year based on recently implemented stimulus, and easier comparisons to the prior year. Overall economic growth in Europe is expected to remain weak with no clear catalyst. We expect sales volumes in our automotive OEM business to be lower than prior year and similar to the first quarter as decreases in industry production builds are expected to continue in the second quarter. The delay of Brexit will probably continue to lead to higher levels of uncertainties and could impact consumer confidence and overall demand. We expect our regional architectural coatings business to produce favorable sales volumes in the second quarter. We will continue to manage all elements of our business within our control to ensure that we remain competitive regardless of economic conditions. In addition, the execution of our research and programs will carry on and we expect about $20 million of additional incremental savings to be realized in the second quarter. As mentioned in that earnings press release, we continue to closely monitor the macro economic environment and we will be prepared to implement further cost reduction actions if necessary. We provide EPS guidance specific to the second quarter of 2019. This guidance is $1.76 to $1.86, which includes an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of $0.05 to $0.07 per share remain fully committed to delivering on the full year targets we announced in January for 2019 of 3% to 5% sales growth and 7% to 10% of adjusted EPS growth, both excluding foreign currency translation. Our focus on cash generation continues. In the first quarter, our cash flow from operations was a net use of cash. This is consistent with our normal seasonal pattern of using cash in the first quarter to prepare for higher sales activity in the second quarter. In addition, this year we intentionally build inventories due to our preparation around Brexit and anticipation of a second quarter ERP conversion in our U.S. automotive refinish business. This ERP conversion is the last major conversion for all of our U.S. and Canadian businesses with all the previous U.S. coatings businesses successfully converting over the past two years. In addition, the recent SEM and Whitford acquisitions added to our working capital. Our goal for full year remains to reduced working capital as a percentage of sales compared to 2018. We completed the Whitford acquisition in the first quarter and just recently announced the completion of the Hemmelrath acquisition. The three recently announced and completed acquisitions including SEM, we’ll add about $400 million in annualized revenue and provided with a broader range of products and technology to grow our business. Accretive earnings acquisitions continue to be our cash deployed preference and our acquisition pipeline remains active. In addition, acquisitions, we continue to invest organically in our business. Capital expenditure is expected to be about 3% of sales in 2019 and we continue to invest in research and development at similar levels as we have done historically. We ended the first quarter with more than $800 million of cash and short-term investments and we continue to have significant financial flexibility. Finally, as I stated in our annual meeting this morning, in 135th year of business, PPG, 47,000 employees around the world are focused on strengthening our position as the world’s leading paint, coatings, and specialty materials company. We remained steadfast and our commitment to provide innovative solutions for our customers most pressing challenges delivered consistent growth and power people to grow and succeed, create value for our customers, operate our businesses safely, sustainably, and effectively while delivering value to our shareholders. I’d like to thank and recognize the outstanding employees of PPG who help us deliver these objectives each and every day. This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG and now Andrea, would you please open the line for questions?
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Kevin McCarthy: Yes, good morning. Michael. I was wondering if you could expand upon your outlook for China in the release, you indicated that you are cautiously optimistic and expect a better back half of the year. Just wondering, how much of that is predicated on a trade deal or are you starting to see stimulus related benefits, any color there would be helpful.
Michael McGarry: Kevin, as you know 13th National People’s Conference took place in the first quarter. The VAT for coatings was dropped from 16% to 13%. VAT for cars was dropped from 10% to 9%. Social insurance contributions were reduced. So, there’s a lot of what I would say, I don’t know, total stimulus is the right word, but there’s a lot of influence in the marketplace that lead to better performance. As you know, we do see automotive numbers in real time. And so we’re optimistic that the second half of the year is going to be better than the first half and we do have insight into, like I said previously, 90 days we have a fair amount of confidence 60 days, 30 days. We have high confidence. So we’re starting to see the early signs of that.
Kevin McCarthy: Okay, that’s helpful. And then, state side, what is your outlook for U.S. architectural and perhaps you could touch on the subjects of whether weather was an impact at all in your first quarter. And what you’re seeing in terms of the macro indicators for architectural coatings demand in the U.S.
Michael McGarry: Well, okay. NOAA, as you know, reported the wettest January and February around. But as we always tell our operating teams, we have to be able to function because somewhere else in the world you get good weather always have a different put and take on that. So we’re not going to point to that. We do see our customers have a good backlog. You know, we do have a slightly different mix and maybe some of our competitors, as far as our stores. But overall, we still think this is a very good market and we’re anticipating favorable comps going forward.
Kevin McCarthy: Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Sison of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Michael Sison: Hey guys, nice quarter.
Michael McGarry: Thanks, Mike.
Michael Sison: In terms of the second half of the year, you’ve talked about maintaining your outlook for sales growth ex-currency. So can you maybe walk us through by some of the sub businesses, what type of growth you’re going to see in the second half to sort of hit that full year number?
Michael McGarry: Well, Mike, if you look at the various pieces, let’s start with aerospace. We’re going to continue to see very, very good growth in that business. The underlying trends are very nice. So whether it’s the build rates, whether it’s the military, however you want to frame it, aerospace is going to have a very solid quarter and back half of the year. Refinish, we had a lighter comp numbers in the third and fourth quarter last year, so we’re going to be comping against a little bit easier. PMC, as you saw from the first quarter, are up double digits. We continue to see a recovery in that segment. Marine bouncing off the bottom, strong protective sales in that segment. So I would tell you that we have a lot of confidence in that. And probably the most encouraging one is architectural Europe. We try to kind of lead you to this conclusion in prior calls. We were the first one to raise price in Europe. We raised it significantly. So last year, we were giving up share preferentially to get prices up. Now our competitors are up. They’re raising price to that business that has historically been ours. It’s been flowing back to us. We had a very good quarter in the first quarter. We anticipate that trend line continuing the second quarter as well as the back half of the year. Comex and our team is just doing a phenomenal job in Mexico, Central America. So I would tell you that, that’s – we’re getting price there. We’re having customers trade up. Ever since we’ve owned Comex, we brought higher value-added products in there. That’s been a positive. Automotive OEM is a little bit of a wildcard. We see the U.S. as relatively stable, 16.7, 16.8, somewhere in that range. Europe kind of ticking down marginally. But eventually, they’re going to have all these diesel things behind them, and it’s a solid market. So we anticipate a better second half of the year. And then when you think about Asia, similar to what I said earlier, we’ll have very soft comps to compare against in the third and fourth quarter. So that will be better. General industrial, more the same. We see the stimulus having a little more positive impact. So I think there’s a lot of things we would point to that gives us this confidence.
Michael Sison: Great. And then, just a quick follow-up on 2Q earnings outlook. The year-over-year decline in EPS is larger than basically flattish in the first quarter. So are some of the headwinds more daunting in 2Q than they were in 1Q? Because it seems like maybe it should be less. But just curious on your thoughts there.
Vince Morales: Mike, this is Vince. Just a couple of key items to put forward. One, the customer assortment change that Michael talked about earlier, that actually was announced last year March 1. Once that was announced in 2018, we took out most of the support costs before we got to Q2, but we had a full sale in Q2, we would take or pay with that customer in Q2. So they took a full allotment without the support costs. So that assortment is a bit more penal in 2019. We did have obviously a strong automotive market last year in Q2, we didn’t see erosion in the auto market until Q3. Q2 is typically a higher seasonal quarter. So bigger impact in Q1. And finally in Q2 of last year, if you look at our corporate line, we started to make adjustments to our incentive compensation on our corporate line. I think our corporate line was in the mid-20s – $20 million range last year and we gave out a projection in the release that will be almost double that in Q2 of this year. So those three of the primary factors that put this a little bit different than Q1.
Michael Sison: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Ghansham Panjabi: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone.
Vince Morales: Good afternoon.
Ghansham Panjabi: I guess first off on auto refinish in Europe and some of the weakness you called out Michael in your prepared comments. I know you touched on pre-buy in Europe, that benefited 4Q. How would you characterize overall market conditions in the region specific to auto refinish?
Michael McGarry: The market over there is not that much different than the U.S. and you have a slightly softer, less collisions down the 1% or 2%, slightly more totals. But overall, we’re still gaining the shops over there, so that’s a positive. Prices, we’ve been able to successfully raise price over there. So I don’t see the trends in Europe any different than I do anywhere else. Now, obviously sequentially, second quarter will be better than first quarter for refinish Europe because of the timing of the price increase. But, I’m not concerned at all about that refinish sales volumes.
Ghansham Panjabi: Okay. And then just sticking with Europe and architectural EMEA, last couple of quarters have been positive. They are smaller quarters on a relative basis. I know you mentioned the pricing dynamics and sounds like just some reversion from a market regained perspective. But taking that in context with what you said, Michael, in terms of just the European macro and Brexit, what do you think that is reasonable to expect for the market itself to grow in 2019 there?
Michael McGarry: Well, we still have the same kind of perspective is that it’s going to be a low growth market, let’s call it zero to 2%. But I think what we’re most excited about is the share that’s flowing back to us. And I think the fact that, we do see a number of countries, especially Eastern Europe, which we always view as a good sign when Eastern Europe is doing well. That’s a very good market for us. They’re having some strong numbers and probably a little bit of a surprise to us is UK and Ireland. They’ve outperformed our expectations, we thought with Brexit it would be a much slower market. But surprisingly, we continue to grow nicely in that market.
Ghansham Panjabi: Perfect. Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Roberts of UBS. Please go ahead.
John Roberts: Thanks. First a short one and then I have a question on raw materials. Do you think you’ll have the portfolio review by the outside consultants done in time for your Investor Day in early June or do you think it’s going to take until the end of the quarter?
Michael McGarry: John, we’re looking to have something by the end of the quarter.
John Roberts: Okay. And then, is the potential raw material disruption in Texas related to the tank farm fire that occurred in the shipping terminals or is it something else? And how do we think about the volatility in oil prices? Some of your raw materials like solvents follow oil quickly, some a lot more slowly, so they probably didn’t change much in the quarter. And then customers often look at oil is kind of a leading indicator of price. So, I don’t know if you had maybe more pushback on price early in the quarter and now you might have some tailwind here with the oil coming up?
Michael McGarry: Yes, John the fire in Texas didn’t impact anything we buy. But what it does impact is the access to the other products that are in that terminal. So that’s been the challenge. So we regard that as a one quarter disruption. As far as oil, remember we have a – I always like to say, we have like nine different buckets of raw materials. You got half of them up and half of them down, one of them flat. Oil will impact solvents. But most of our other raw materials are impacted by supply and demand derivative. So, obviously we’re encouraged to see that propylene remains weak, ethylene is – we view ethylene as the long-term over supplied market, which will help us. So I would tell you that, we still remain firm on our raw material projection, which is low single digits. And that the back half of the year comps will be much easier on raw materials.
John Roberts: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Michael, just on raws again, TiO2. Do you expect to see higher TiO2 prices in 2019 versus last year?
Michael McGarry: So David, our response is the same one we gave in the fourth quarter that we don’t think we need to be talking about TiO2 this year. You have some pluses and minuses but overall it’s a nonevent in our market basket. So that would be the way we would describe that.
David Begleiter: Understood. And just on auto OEM, Michael. Very good job on pricing but obviously weak volumes. Are the weak volumes jeopardizing at all your price initiatives, your price traction in OEM?
Michael McGarry: David, I don’t think so. I’m viewing this the same way we saw with architecture. We were the first ones out with price, we’re the most aggressive and trying to hold our customers accountable for us to recover our margins. We provide a lot of values to our customers, a lot of new technology. And obviously we’re getting price across the world in that. So when our competitors are getting as aggressive as we are, if they do that, then we would expect to see some of that volume flow back. Right now it’s more important for us to get price and that’s our number one objective.
Vince Morales: And David it’s Vince. I think our customers clearly understand that calendar year 2017 and calendar 2018, we got little to no price. So we’re still well in arrears in terms of value capture for what we delivered to them.
David Begleiter: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Chris Evans: Good afternoon, guys. Chris Evans on for Bob. So on pricing, eight quarters in a row of improvements, recognizing your industrial coatings margins are still pretty depressed. How much more price is needed there to recover the loss profitability. And then maybe more specifically does the consolidated 1Q pricing you printed this quarter represent a high watermark for the year as comps get harder throughout?
Vince Morales: Yes, Chris this is Vince. I’ll take the second part of your question. We’re still on pricing in Q2. We’re still doing surgical and targeted pricing in not only the industrial segment but in other businesses. So I would definitely not consider as high watermark. And I think you alluded to it properly, we’re starting to stack price on top of price. We still got some need to recover in certain businesses or regions. And we’re going to continue to push to try to fully recover this over the course or balance of this year.
John Bruno: And Chris this is John. Maybe on your cumulative question, if you look at the past 10 quarters, raws are up in cumulative amount of low single digits and pricings maybe up 3% – a little bit more than 3%. We typically say, we need to get half for the raw material inflation to be even. So that’s the delta we’re looking at.
Chris Evans: Very helpful. And then just sort of stacking that on top of the raw material commentary. And you put up a pretty good – the best margin performance year-over-year in quite a while. So how does the cadence of your margin sort of trends as the comps in your raw material basket gets lighter and you continue to push price?
Michael McGarry: Well, I think the way I would answer that Chris is that, Vince said that we’re all recognizing that when you compare margins at 2017 and 2018 below our 2016 levels, we need to get back to those levels. The sales teams are well aware of the gap that still exists and the marching orders have not changed. So we’re going to continue to work hard to capture that gap. Our customers know that gap still exists and it’s up to us to get the additional price but also provide additional value to our customers. So it’s a win-win.
Chris Evans: Very clear. Thank you.
Vince Morales: Thanks Chris.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christopher Parkinson of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Christopher Parkinson: Great. Thank you very much. So it appears you guys were successful in getting regional OEM pricing all synchronized positively, which I’m sure your team is pleased with. Can you just comment on whether or not this is simply a functionality of just prior price initiatives and obviously everything you’ve been fighting for a while or any additional pricing actions for 1Q? So just basically asking on what assurances does the investment community has that the trends of sustainable moving forward. Thank you.
Vince Morales: Yes, Chris, it’s Vince. Again for us, we worked extremely diligently the past 12, 18 months to secure the pricing that you’re seeing here in Q1. We fully expect that to carry forward for the balance of the year. And again, we do have additional targeted pricing coming in not only in auto OEM but other businesses. So again, our emphasis is to recover our margins fully. But to Michael’s point, we’ve got to make sure we’re demonstrating to our customers the value we bring.
Christopher Parkinson: Got it. And then also in just on the capital location front, given your socks that had a bit of a run here and where you see leverage, just how are you assessing share repurchases on a go forward basis versus mid and potentially large size M&A? Thank you.
Michael McGarry: Yes. As we said coming into the year, it’s pretty active acquisition pipeline and our preference right now remains to vet those acquisitions before we make any considerable decision regarding share repo. But our active pipeline will keep us busy for a little bit of time and will determine whether those are value creating in auto, whether we’re considering them for our portfolio. If that doesn’t work out, we’ll reassess how we’re going to deploy our cash.
Christopher Parkinson: Thank you very much.
Michael McGarry: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar of Citi. Please go ahead.
P.J. Juvekar: Yes. Hi, good morning. Michael, the China’s stimulus, automotive stimulus went into effect I think on April 1. Is that why you feel more positive on second half? And I think a lot of companies are talking about secondary recovery. I mean, do you see any momentum in second quarter now that do you think could last into second half?
Michael McGarry: P.J., we do see how our customers are preplanning. And so we have insight into that. So that’s one item that gives us a little more confidence. Clearly, we see the current production levels that we see in April, but that’s 15 days. Remember, China’s had, if I remember right, nine or 10 consecutive monthly declines – 10 monthly declines in a row. So I’m not going to jump out in front of this right now. Let’s wait until we see how the actual numbers turnout.
P.J. Juvekar: Okay. And then on architectural business, it seems like your store business is growing at or better than the market. So I guess, my question is why not accelerate the store growth by opening more stores? Because the national retail stores and the independent stores seem to be lagging here. So why not grow your own store ways? Thank you.
Vince Morales: Repeat events. Yes, I don’t know that we’re growing better than the market. We didn’t say that. We do have a definitional difference with some of our competitors. We include industrial coatings and our industrial segment. Other folks can include those differently. And our industrial business was, as Michael mentioned it, lighter this core in Q1. So again, I would not say, we’re outpacing the market. For us, we go to market with a multichannel approach. We’ve always done that. We do well, certainly, with the Home Depot and other major merchandisers. Our dealer channel, albeit a lower growth channel, is a good channel for us with a low cost to serve and we certainly support our trade network as much as possible. And we’re doing selective additions. We’re doing selective pruning in all those channels.
P.J. Juvekar: Thank you.
Vince Morales: Thanks, P.J.
Operator: Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch of Fermium Research. Please go ahead.
Le’Veon Bell: Yes. Hi. Good afternoon. This is Le’Veon Bell sitting in for Frank. Michael, in a difficult macro environment, in the first quarter, you were able to post a nice result. Especially, relative to the guidance that you guys had issued. So I mean, I just curious as to what were the key factors for PPG to be able to outperform those expectations.
Vince Morales: Hi, this is Vince. A couple things that differ from the beginning of the year, one, we certainly secured pricing at a level that we had – as hope a little bit better than that. The second issue, as we were very aggressive on our cost management, given the uncertainty in the economic backdrop. And we’ve also seen currency coming in a little better than we anticipated at the beginning of the year, but still negative year-over-year. So those are the three primary factors that deviate favorably from our guidance.
Le’Veon Bell: All right. So we might want to dial in all three of those factors in for Q2 relative to the $1.76, $1.86, just kidding. On the restructuring side, you posted, you said $20 million or I think better than $20 million in savings during Q1. And you said that you’d get that again, in 2Q, or at least I think you said that, where do you stand on 2019? I think I heard you guys talk about $80 million savings in 2018 and around $70 million in 2019. What sort of expectations should we expect that of – out of the cost cutting actions that you guys have underway?
John Bruno: Yes. This is John. So our number one priority is to complete the restructuring initiatives. We’ve identify those alone. We’ll probably get as close to $70 million and we have additional initiatives that are not necessarily restructuring, that are other costs areas throughout the business, throughout the world that will get us to the $80 million. So we still feel very comfortable with that number.
Le’Veon Bell: Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead.
Don Carson: Yes, thank you. A question, a couple of questions at architectural. You mentioned that obviously you lapse the Lowe’s loss in Q3. But how about your Home Depot business in some of the new branch you have there? What kind of year-over-year growth can we expect as we get into the second half of the year? And then on EMEA, can you remind us where you are in terms of volume is relative to your 2007 peak, and what we should think of as incremental margin, so that business as you load more volume.
Michael McGarry: Yes. So Don, I’ll take the first half and let Vince take the second half. We started shipping Home Depot early May, so we’ll have three months of Home Depot versus two months in the second quarter. Obviously, there was a lot of confusion in the marketplace. Olympic was at both Lowe’s and Home Depot. This year, it’s only at Home Depot. So they were still be some people looking around and make sure they find the world’s greatest thing Olympic. But I would envision that, we will continue to have positive comps. I won’t speculate about how much because I think that’s Home Depots business. But the relationship is very good. They’re the best retailer in that space and we’re very privileged to be a partner with Home Depot. So maybe Vince, you want to tackle…
Vince Morales: Yes. In terms of your question, Don, around where we are versus the 2007 peak. We were down still almost 20% in volume for the whole architectural Europe region. So we still have not seen this is the really the first signs of recovery. We’ve seen since the recession in our volumes. That’s a holistic comment. We certainly seen differences by countries, as Michael mentioned, the UK has been a good country for us for the past couple of years, but we’ve seen other markets that have continued to vein. But holistically, we’re down, just under 20% cumulative since 2007. We are recording very high incremental margins, as Michael mentioned in his prepared remarks. These are coming in somewhere in the vicinity of 35% to 40%. So that volume is extremely lucrative to us when it does occur.
Don Carson: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Arun Viswanathan: Hi, guys. Sorry about that. Good afternoon. Just a quick question for you guys on the margin. So obviously, a little bit better than what we had thought. How would you characterize them versus your own expectations? And you mentioned three things as far as slightly better FX, price and cost. Could you kind of bucket that out for us on Q1 and how those three were potentially progress through the year?
Michael McGarry: Well, I think, Arun, the cost management, something – we were watching our order book every day, where we’re taking necessary actions, business by business, region by region, based on the order book. Q1 was very choppy in terms of the macro. So several of our businesses took immediate and swift action to minimize any cost. If we see the volume come back, I think we’ll have a more traditional cost structure. From a pricing perspective, the only thing we did was get price a little earlier than we anticipated. We thought some of those would drag on into Q2, but the level of pricing that we achieved is what we were targeting. We just had a little earlier than what we anticipated in our guidance. With respect to currency, I’ll let you guys – you guys are the experts on currency. We just make paints. We don’t predict the currency markets. I’ll let you guys opine on that.
Arun Viswanathan: Okay, thanks. And as a follow-up, your discussions around on margin recovery, I mean, if you guys have targets as to where you want to get back to as far as percent margins. If I went back to the 2008 to 2010 period, it looks like they suffered by 500 basis points and they actually recovered within a year or two. Is it fair to assume that something like that could happen in industrial, because we’ve seen that kind of deterioration over the last couple of years. Thanks.
Michael McGarry: Yes, just generically speaking where we’re targeting 2016 as a marker. There’s a lot happened in the world from 2016 to 2019. So it’s not going to be a straight linear comparison, but 2016, the point in time where we’re using as a marker from our margin perspective. We have work to do as you pointed out. We were targeting to get margin parity by the middle of the year. We were glad to get there in Q1. And then we’re open to improve on our margins year-over-year in the back half of the year.
Arun Viswanathan: And just lastly on that point, would you need incremental volume growth to get back to full parity or continue with that trend? Or could you potentially continue to see margin recovery even in a kind of sluggish volume environment?
Vince Morales: Well, there’s two sides to that equation. We certainly welcome volume. That makes the story a lot easier. In a nascent volume environment, we would expect supply/demand to work in our favor on the raw material side.
Arun Viswanathan: Thanks.
Vince Morales: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Haynes of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Steven Haynes: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to quickly clarify. So you’re talking margin recovery came in ahead in 1Q 2019, and you’re commenting that will be up in 2Q 2019 as are in the second half of 2019. Can you just comment on whether or not the first quarter was an inflection for margins and how we should we be thinking about that for 2Q.
Vince Morales: Okay. It’s Vince again. Just reiterate, I think we’re anticipating doing the margin parity in the first half of the year, so by the end of the second quarter. Again, we got there a little earlier. Let’s be clear, we’re still several 100 basis points below our targets. So we still have a lot of recovery underway and we’re going to start working our way back there for the balance of this year.
Steven Haynes: And then if I could just get a quick follow-up too. So, the press release talked about you guys passing on some business. Could you just maybe talk a little bit about what categories you are foregoing business in?
Vince Morales: Well, automotive is clearly one, industrial is another. So those are the two biggest areas. And China and Asia in general, what we’ve said is getting price in China is not easy. You have to do it a lot of times by backing up your request for price by saying if you won’t meet the need that we have, we’re happy if you take your business somewhere else and then they get serviced at a, I would say, lower level. And then they’re happy to come back and pay the higher price, and/or if they’re missing the technology, which is generally the biggest thing they miss, so they come back to us and say we really need that better technology, whether it’s a waterborne, whether it’s the products that help their productivity in their plants or whatever it is, that generally is important because once it’s showing up in their manufacturing line and once their manufacturing people have to account for it, that’s when the purchasing people have less power.
Steven Haynes: Yes. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick Fischer of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Mike Leithead: Hey guys. This isn’t Patrick. This is Mike Leithead on for Duffy. Hey, I guess, circling back to volumes, volumes seem to have decelerated the last three quarters even if we exclude some of the customer assortment changes. Can you maybe just talk about how we should think about volume trending into 2Q in the back half? And then, maybe I was hoping you could quantify how much volume or the volume impact from the businesses you’ve passed on in the quarter?
Michael McGarry: So, I think I’ll pass on saying how much we passed on. I think that it varies by business and it varies by region. But what I will tell you is that in the second quarter, we’re still anticipating a little bit softer on the volumes. But when you look at the third and fourth quarter, you’re seeing us comping against a different environment from the third and fourth quarter of 2019. Plus we see the stimulus impact is going to be a positive. We see the U.S. continue to be good market, Mexico continuing to be a good market, and some slight recovery in architectural business in Europe. So, I think there’s enough things out there that give us good confidence level that our predictions are going to be relatively accurate.
Vince Morales: And Mike, I got to add, I think the volume erosion, if you look over the past four quarters or three quarters, as you mentioned, is really coming in the industrial segment. That segment had been producing 3%, 4% volume growth up until really the third quarter last year. And everything we see in that particular segment has really been macro-driven. Obviously, with China auto coming off, European auto coming off, the halo effect of that around the general industrial businesses that get affected by kind of Tier 1, Tier 2 suppliers. So that’s all macro. And again, we’re going to anniversary some of that as we go into the back half of the year here.
Michael McGarry: And Mike, just to put that in perspective, we had 13 quarters in a row of positive volume in our industrial coatings business. So I’m not going to – I don’t like this quarter, but we’re still looking at our sales teams doing a very good job on the marketplace.
Mike Leithead: Got it. That’s helpful. And then if I could drill into aerospace, strong solid green, and when I look at your slide, and above-market growth in every region. I was hoping maybe you could talk a little bit more about what’s driving that growth, whether it’s product mix or new share gains or other factors that’s driving the above-market growth there?
Michael McGarry: Well, it’s actually a factor of everything. Our sealants business continues to gain share. Our coatings business continues to gain share. And certainly, our transparencies business has done a phenomenal job of winning new programs left and right. So every one of those is a positive. You have commercial aero. Commercial is doing very well. Military is doing very well. And the only semisoft would be the general aviation. But our biggest customer, who is very large in that general aviation market, is winning share. So we’re also affiliated with the right customer. So we did factor into our second quarter guidance some of the most recent commentary from one of the large OEM plane makers. But overall, we’re going to have a very solid second quarter and a record full year in aerospace.
Mike Leithead: Great. Thanks, guys.
Vince Morales: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gary Shmois of Longbow. Please go ahead.
Gary Shmois: Hi, thanks. Now that margins have recovered year-over-year and pricing is like set now on pace. Wondering if there’s any lessons over the last couple of years that you could take forward if inflation does again start to ramp so that you can offset inflation maybe faster than expected?
Vince Morales: Yes. I’ll let Michael answer the question, but I want to make sure for our salespeople on the phone, our margins are not recovered. So we’d be very clear for that. We still have room to go. Go ahead, Michael.
Michael McGarry: So, clearly, as I tried to explain the last time, there were two events that clearly impacted the rate of initial early recovery. And the first one is our friends in Cleveland, Valspar, I think the Valspar team, without speaking for one of my peers, they were a little slow off the block. That was a challenge. We were trying to buy our friends in the Netherlands. At that time, they immediately went into a mode of saying they were going to grow 4% volume. And that doesn’t work in an environment where raw materials are going up, you need to be focused on getting prices up. So the competitive environment is the challenge at that point. So clearly, a couple of us got off a dime and were moving quickly than the others. Now, not everybody, but most everybody is on looking at their margins and getting a lot of pressure from the shareholders and they’re trying to recover margin. So I think that’s one lesson learned. And maybe the other lesson learned is we need to stick to it and maybe we should have walked away from some volume a little bit earlier. And so maybe that’s the lesson learned.
Gary Shmois: Thanks for the color. A follow-up question on, just going down I think $10 million from $55 million to $60 million, not a $45 million to $50 million, is that part of the cost savings program? Or is there something else going on?
John Bruno: Gary, that’s our normal seasonal trend. Our corporate cost are historically higher in the first quarter for some different reasons and then the second through fourth quarter normally are at a lower level, but similar.
Gary Shmois: That’s helpful. Thank you.
Vince Morales: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. Nippon Paint seems to have agreed to buy Dulux in Australia. Was that a property that you were interested in and you didn’t want to pay as much as they paid? Or was that just not a property that interested you at all?
Michael McGarry: Jeff, this is Michael. What we always tell everybody is on every acquisition in the coatings, paint and specialty products space that we have, we’re always interested in looking at everything. And just because we don’t get something doesn’t mean that we aren’t interested. But what I will tell you is that if we were always winning, then people would be concerned. But at the same time, every company makes their own decisions about what is the right price to pay and how does that impact their shareholders. And so I would say different people have different answers for the exact same acquisition. So all I will tell you is that we try to be active, we try to look at everything. But for PPG, right now, we’re very comfortable where we are.
Vince Morales: The other thing I thought just to add thought, I think you know this of course, but we have a very good architectural business in Australia and a growing business there. So we are on the continent and we’re number two on the continent.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay. Can you talk about what your operating cash flow was in the quarter and are you having a very different experience in your raw material price changes in the United States versus your raw material price changes in the offshore markets? And that it seems that, propylene is pretty weak in the U.S. but the oil price has really left it in the offshore markets. So are we seeing inflation in the offshore markets and deflation in the domestic markets and again, what was your operating cash flow in the quarter?
Michael McGarry: Jeff, I’ll take the first one. Vince will jump on the second one. So our operating cash flow was a use of cash, I believe it was $66 million used, which is less than a use of cash than we had in the first quarter of last year. We’ll have our full cash flow statement released here shortly when our Q was filed.
Vince Morales: I do want – I’ve mentioned something again, we were pleased with the results in the quarter, but one of the metrics we were not pleased with was our – we had a little bit of growth in working capital. A couple of the causation factors there. We along with most other companies build a lot of inventory around Brexit and now that that’s been extended out, we’ll be able to work that down. Michael mentioned, we’re going live with the new ERP system and our refinish business in the U.S. we’ve built inventory ahead of that as a contingency and both the SEM acquisition and the recently close Whitford acquisition, we actually have stepped up that inventory as part of acquisition accounting and until that inventory flows through cost of sales and that’s a high level of inventory ahead of retail price. All that being said we got to get our working capital down to prior year levels. We have the teams in last week talking about that specifically, so we’re focused on that. So again we’re in better in our cash flow in last year, but still more room to go. With respect to raw material inflation, we don’t see any differences really at this point by geography. We think it will be more driven by supply demand as opposed to the things you mentioned. The supply demand situation is different in each of the major regions and that’s typically – especially in a light volume environment, that’s typically more of a predictor of which way the raw materials may go by region. But we haven’t seen anything to-date.
Michael McGarry: Jeff, the only thing I’d add is, Latin America south, so if you go all the way down to the southern part, that’s more U.S. dollar based, so the weakness in the currency can have impact. So but no real material, when we think about our total sales in Latin America south, that’s not a material number. So you should not assume that there’s a material difference between the regions.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay, great. Thank you so much.
Michael McGarry: Thank you, Jeff.
Operator: Our next question comes from John McNulty of BMO. Please go ahead.
John McNulty: Thanks for taking my question. Michael, you indicated, I believe not only where there are supply disruptions in Texas, but it looked like there may have been some in China. Can you articulate what products are affected? What’s necessarily disrupting that supply and also the timing on when you think it’ll be remedied?
Michael McGarry: Well, let’s start with the original issue. Going back a year ago is the Blue Skies initiative for China in 2018 led to a lot of disruption and we saw coming into 2019 that they had delegated from Beijing to the provinces, the enforcement of environmental actions. And so they were much more focused on employment and so the supply was much more readily available. But once they had the explosion in Jiangsu province, this has led that province to get much aggressive on some of the under performers. And so the impact of the things that you probably can’t see in your numbers, but think about the antibacterial products that you might buy, making sure the paint in the cans are healthy, that would be one. There are some unique epoxies that would be coming out of there. That would be another one, but overall what we see is that it’ll take a little while for them to resource themselves out, we’re paying most attention to is what the enforcement level is going to be post the next say quarter two, quarter three, whether it’s just going to be contained as a Jiangsu province or whether they’re going to – again, much more aggressive if you will and re-institute the controls out of Beijing that’s what we’re paying attention to.
John McNulty: Got it. Thanks very much for the color.
Michael McGarry: Thanks John.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Byrne of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Steven Byrne: Yes, thank you. We’ve seen PPG sales reps in the Home Depot paint aisle, I just wanted to ask you, what’s the scale of that initiative and is it getting any traction with respect to either driving more paint in Home Depot or specifically PPG brands versus their?
Michael McGarry: All major suppliers to all the major home centers have sales reps that are covering the stores. Dependent upon the agreement with the various vendors, you get X an amount of sales rep for X number of stores. So, the good news is I think the Home Depot team has a very solid approach where everybody focuses on the customer and driving conversion in the store. And that’s the metric that they hold us and our competitors are accountable for. And I think our teams have been doing a very good job in Home Depot plus a number of our retail partners as I said on my opening remarks, we had positive comps at the other large DIY change, which is good, but we’re not doing anything different than what our peers are doing.
Steven Byrne: And Vince, you mentioned the fact active acquisition pipeline kind of given your commitment in Home Depot is that pipeline that you’re looking at include any potential shelf space expansion within Home Depot to branch out into different products within the retail DIY channel?
Vince Morales: Yes, I would call it an acquisition possibility. Again, we worked with Home Depot on what products, what value we can bring to them on a product-by-product basis. So again, I wouldn’t consider that to be any type of an acquisition relationship.
Steven Byrne: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Harrison of Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.
Mike Harrison: Hi, good afternoon.
Michael McGarry: Hi Mike.
Mike Harrison: Michael. I was wondering if you could comment in a little more detail on the weakness that you saw on the Latin America architectural market during the quarter. I know you mentioned that the timing of the Easter holiday was a factor. Can you maybe talk about other factors there and whether you’ve seen those trends improve?
Michael McGarry: Yes. The only other factor that is relevant is really the fact that we have done a lot of value selling up the chain, so when we bought Comex, there’s been some additional technology brought in, so there’s a lot more premium products being sold to them. The coverage of the premium products is better than that what I would call the value products. So that leads to a little bit on a share or I wouldn’t say net share but the volume numbers being negative, but when you look at the overall impact to the EBIT, it’s very positive. So we actually even though our volume was marginally down we actually had a record quarter for the PPG Latin America team and we’re anticipating the same. Overall though the timing of Easter – there’s two major holidays in Mexico, Easter and Christmas and Christmas doesn’t move, but Easter does and that’s the impact. So we kicked off our Easter promotions a couple of weeks ago and so all that falls in the second quarter instead of the first quarter.
Mike Harrison: Got it. And then in the protective and marine business, it looks like that marine piece is growing faster than the protective piece. Wondering if you could just comment specifically on marine and the growth rates that you’re seeing in those key markets, I feel like you’ve said in the past you’ve said you have pretty good visibility on what’s going on in the marine business, so is the strength there going to be sustainable?
Michael McGarry: Yes. So we started taking up the orders in the second half of 2018. They’ll generally paint the ships 12 month to 18 months after the order comes in, but this is off a very low base. So you know the marine business is probably down 60% from its peak. So we are coming off a very low bottom, overall the business though is positive both in protective and marine that lead that double-digits, and we anticipate that a trend line continuing.
Mike Harrison: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn of Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
Dmitry Silversteyn: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my call. Quick question on the – sort of the construction market and I know you’ve sort of pushed off the question on whether and how big of an impact it had on construction, but other companies are not so shy about the siding rather than as a delaying factor in getting the construction teams in North America ramp-up. Have you seen anything improving in terms of March and first couple of weeks of April here that can give us confidence that, that market is coming back and whatever built-up demand and backlog your contracted customers and stores are experiencing, will be fulfilled over the next couple of quarters.
Vince Morales: Yes, Dimtry this is Vince. One of the issues we had with the comparison in early April is the Easter. Easter fell very late at April last year. So really the proxy is diluted in order for us to compare, you normally can get a good pickup there by now, but it’s a bit diluted. I would say we’re not displeased with what we’ve seen in April, but it’s too early to make a call and whether we’re seeing some pickup from March.
Dmitry Silversteyn: Okay. All right. That’s it. Thanks for Vince. Second question in the three acquisitions that you’ve done – that you’re carrying into 2019, what kind of revenue contribution should we be thinking about for these businesses? Are we talking about 1% to 2% incremental growth to your organic growth or is that going to be something lower than that?
John Bruno: Dmitri, this is John, I’ll take that. So annualized these three acquisitions total about $400 million of annual revenue. The majority of that’s going to be the industrial coatings, Whitford and Hemmelrath posted at the Industrial Coatings segment. In our initial guidance we provided in January, we said about $250 million benefit, this year that could be a hair higher because we have been able to complete both acquisitions maybe a little bit faster than we originally thought.
Dmitry Silversteyn: Okay. That’s helpful. And then finally on the refinish side of the business, you talked about the overall market being flat, little bit of about 1% decline or so in collision rates in Europe and U.S., your business was down volume wise, you’ve talked about low single-digits so let’s say 1% to 2%. Is that in line with sort of what the market declines you saw? Are you still kind of suffering from being the price leaders and therefore we should see that performance improve as the year unfolds and you recapture some of those business?
Michael McGarry: I think last year we were a skosh below the market 1% maybe, but overall, when I look at our customer base and when I see the market and the fact that we’re still having a number of shop wins. I feel comfortable that we’re a relatively close to the market.
Dmitry Silversteyn: Got you. Okay. Thank you very much.
Michael McGarry: Yes, Dmitry.
Operator: Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Laurence Alexander: Good afternoon. Two quick ones then, first, for the share gains above the market in the aerospace. Is your spread against the market getting wider as you look at the wins that you have in the pipeline? Or should we think of it as roughly steady state? And secondly, on raw materials. Can you give us a little bit of a longer-term kind of perspective on how you’re thinking about your raw material chain? Because several parts of the channels, suppliers appear to be talking a lot more than they use to about higher hurdle rates for reinvestment. And so are you worried about – are you seeing any though risk of capacity lag, in your raw materials lagging your expectations for demand growth over the next say three, five years?
Michael McGarry: Well, I’m not worried about them investing right now, because their incremental margins are very high. So if you look at most of our suppliers, I won’t name names, you can do it yourself. But they’ve had a very good run the last few years, so I’m not worried about them from that standpoint. I think our short-term perspective, we said it would be low single-digits on the low side of low single-digits, we still see that, we’re still holding to that. And so I think we’re in the right spot, Laurence.
Vince Morales: Yes, and then Laurence your first question I have that is again, I think what we’ve – this is an industry that values technology sort of really plays into our sweet spot. I think we’ve been able to work with our customers once they gain share, we’re gaining more than our share of new products or new entrance and the new products that are – they’re putting into the marketplace. So that’s really where we’re winning in aerospace.
Laurence Alexander: Thank you.
Michael McGarry: Our next question comes from Jim Sheehan of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.
Jim Sheehan: Thank you. Is it correct to say that the Whitford and Hemmelrath acquisitions are – those businesses are below average PPG margins? And if so, how long do you think it would take for you to expand those margins to average levels?
Vince Morales: Hey Jim, Vince. As Michael said in his prepared remarks, SEM is performing at above their segment margins that was a highly accretive acquisition for us, good array of products, very well recognized brand in the marketplace and that’s performing above segment. Whitford and Hemmelrath will come in as traditional acquisitions below segment margins and it’ll take us 12 to 18 months to scale those up as we work through the synergy capture.
Jim Sheehan: Perfect. And regarding M&A in global coatings, how would you characterize deal multiples in the sector? Do you think they’re mostly frothy or are you seeing some reasonable numbers today?
Michael McGarry: Well, Jim it really differs based on geography, based on market – end market, so it’s hard to call a singular answer to that question. There are certainly things that we looked at as we probably won’t act on or didn’t act on. And there’s other things based on synergies and post multiples that we have an interest in. So it really depends – it’s episodic by what’s out there today. And then again, I’ll just reiterate, there is a certainly activity in the marketplace.
Vince Morales: And Jim the other thing I would add is, we bought some Whitford and Hemmelrath and each one of them had a different multiple. But the way we look at is post synergy, what does that multiple look like? And they were all in the single-digits range, so you have to really parse these things into the acquisition, what’s your pain, what’s your synergies are, what’s your growth is. And so there is a lot of other factors, so you just can’t look at just the multiple.
Jim Sheehan: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Hocevar of Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.
Kevin Hocevar: Hey, good afternoon everybody. Vince you mentioned pricing, that you realize pricing a little bit quicker than you thought in the first quarter. And you also mentioned that it might not be the high watermark of the year. So does that suggested the – in the second quarter you’ll see a bit of a higher year-over-year growth rate in pricing? And then I think on last quarter’s call you mentioned about 2% of the 3% to 5% constant currency sales growth would be from price. Did do you view that as having a little bit of upside based on how the year started?
Michael McGarry: Well, two things we do expect the higher absolute dollar pricing in Q2 versus Q1. But I’ll remind you, last year we started to get price throughout the year. So again, we’re stacking on top of a harder comp. So the percentage remains to be same Kevin, but on a pure staff dollar basis, we definitely expect higher Q2 pricing than in the prior year.
Kevin Hocevar: Okay. Got you. And then on the – you mentioned in the press release, ready to take action if need be on the cost savings front. Is that just simple blocking and tackling in areas where there might be weakness or is there PPG has done $8,000 million type cost savings programs, couple of those over the last couple of years? Or is that something bigger like that?
Michael McGarry: I think those comments are primarily focused on what you would call traditional blocking and tackling. We can’t hide from the fact that the economies out there is dropping, there’s a lot of things that aren’t within our control. And we – if we see something going sideways or down even in a more draconian way, we’ll take whatever decisive actions we need to take and that could be deeper than blocking and tackling. But I think the mention we had in the prepared remarks is really around blocking and tackling.
Kevin Hocevar: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.
John Bruno: Thank you, Andrea, this is John Bruno again, I would like to thank everyone for their time and interest in PPG. If you have any further questions, please contact our investor relations department. This concludes our first quarter earnings call.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-01-17 14:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the PPG Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Andrea, and I will be your conference specialist today. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to John Bruno, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
John Bruno: Thank you, Andrea, and good afternoon, everyone. Once again, this is John Bruno, Director of Investor Relations. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG and welcome you to our Fourth Quarter 2018 Financial Results Conference Call. Joining me on the call from PPG are Michael McGarry, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vince Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our comments relate to the financial information released on Thursday, January 17, 2019. I will remind everyone that we posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on the Investor Center of our website, ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide additional support to the opening comments Michael will make shortly. Following Michael's perspective on the company's results for the quarter and the full year, and a brief update from Vince, we will move to a Q&A session.  Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company's current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent events -- subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. The presentation materials may also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC.  Now let me introduce PPG Chairman and CEO, Michael McGarry.
Michael McGarry: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial results. For the fourth quarter, our net sales were approximately $3.6 billion, and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.15. Our adjusted EPS were impacted by continuing raw material and logistics cost inflation, materially lower automotive builds in China and Europe, and significant foreign exchange translation headwinds. While our net sales and adjusted EPS results did not meet our growth expectations, we continued our momentum and operating margin recovery. Although we continue to experience additional inflation during the quarter, we made further progress in selling price realization and continued our legacy of strong cost management.  For the fourth quarter, our sales in local currencies increased about 2%, supporting the higher local currency sales or selling price increases of nearly 2.5%, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of sequential improvement. Our sales volumes were down about 1% and were flat, excluding the previously communicated customer assortment changes in our U.S. architectural coatings DIY business. Foreign currency translation was slightly unfavorable to sales as the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen during the quarter against several major currencies. Sales were unfavorably impacted by approximately USD 110 million, and pretax income was impacted by about $12 million.  Moving to some business trends in the fourth quarter. In the Performance Coatings segment, Aerospace continued to deliver outstanding results with second consecutive quarter of volume percentage growth in the low teens. We also had good sales growth contribution from protective and marine coatings. Automotive refinish sales were lower, as expected, due to continuing customer inventory destocking in the U.S. We believe the destocking has run its course, and we expect better sales trends in the first quarter of 2019.  Overall, architectural coatings sales volumes in the Americas and Asia Pacific business decreased due to lower DIY sales of about $40 million, stemming from the customer assortment change. Thanks to our company-owned sales growth in the U.S. and Canada, it continued, albeit at a lower level than the third quarter, impacted by more difficult comparisons to the prior fourth quarter when there was a spike in demand due to rebuild activity after the hurricanes of last year. We finished the year with about 900 company-owned stores, consistent with prior year. We added stores in certain targeted growth areas and closed underperforming stores. We also moved certain geographies to a delivery model.  PPG-Comex also delivered another solid quarter, capping off another great year for this business. For the year, PPG-Comex added nearly 200 new stores in 2018, bringing their total to over 4,600.  In our Industrial Coatings reporting segment, sales volumes were negatively impacted by very weak industrial production activity in China. In the quarter, automotive builds were down 16% in China for the industry with lower builds in each successive month during the quarter. Automotive demand was also soft in Europe. Overall, our automotive sales volumes were lower by mid-single-digit, which is consistent with global -- lower global industry demand. The industrial weakness in China also impacted our general industrial business this quarter, including softness in coil, appliance and extrusion subsegments. Globally, our general industrial sales volumes were up a low single-digit percentage as sales volume growth was achieved in other major regions.  Our packaging coatings sales volumes grew a low single-digit percentage, driven by higher volumes in the U.S. and Canada and Latin America. As we said after the third quarter, we expect growth to moderate with more modest level of technology conversions in the industry and a reflection of the growth we delivered in prior years.  From an earnings perspective, our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $1.15, which is $0.04 lower than the prior year. In the quarter, raw material costs increased about 4% year-over-year and have flattened on a sequential basis. This is the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year raw material inflation with a cumulative total of more than 10%.  Prices increased about 2.5% on a year-over-year basis with solid contributions from both of our reporting segments. We have secured further price increases for the first quarter and we'll continue to prioritize working with our customers on further selling price initiatives during 2019, as we are still trailing the raw material cost inflation we have incurred to date. In addition to successfully selling price increase initiatives, we continue to make progress through aggressive cost management. We were able to achieve savings from our business restructuring actions of more than $20 million in the fourth quarter 2018, and reduced our selling, general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales by 130 basis points.  We are pleased to report that we're able to increase price in both automotive OEM as well as China. These are significant milestones on our way to margin recovery, but both OEM and China are well below prior margins, and more price increases are required to offset raw material inflation.  Now I'd like to quickly comment on our full year results from continuing operations. On a full year basis, our sales from continuing operations were approximately $15.4 billion or more than 4% higher than prior year. This growth was realized despite weakening automotive OEM market conditions and the partial year unfavorable impact from customer assortment change in our U.S. architectural DIY business. Our sales growth was also aided by higher selling prices of about 2%.  For the full year 2018, adjusted earnings per diluted share was $5.92, higher than prior year despite significant raw material and logistics cost inflation incurred throughout the year. In addition, earnings per share benefited from our ongoing past deployment actions. This included the impact of our repurchase of nearly $400 million of PPG stock in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year 2018 share repurchase total to more than $1.7 billion or over nearly 16 million shares. In the quarter, average diluted shares outstanding were 6% lower than the fourth quarter of 2017.  We continue to drive operational execution. Some of our more significant actions included continued successful integration from prior and current year acquisitions. We announced 6 new acquisitions and now have completed or announced 21 acquisitions since the beginning of 2015; continuing the commercialization of new products and technologies, allowing us to deliver above-market growth in several of our businesses; delivering on our previously announced restructuring program, including achievement of our cost savings commitments, which totaled about $80 million for the full year; reducing selling, general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales by 90 basis points.  In addition to these operational items, we strengthened our relationship with key customers all over the world. As an example, we are very proud with the opportunity we've been given at The Home Depot and expect that this will deliver further benefit as we move into 2019. We also continued our strong cash generation with about $1.5 billion generated from continuing operations for the year.  In addition, consistent with our capital allocation commitments, we returned cash to our shareholders with nearly $2.2 billion in share repurchases and dividends. Regarding dividends, we are proud that 2018 marked the 119th consecutive year of annual dividend payouts and the 47th consecutive year of annual payout increases after a 7% per share increase in September 2018.  As we start 2019, while we are confident that the global economy will grow in 2019, there's a heightened level of uncertainty over the level of growth. In addition, we see short-term pressures such as the sluggish industrial activity in China and slowing demand in Europe that will negatively impact the first half of 2019. We have provided further details to our 2019 financial objectives, which Vince will cover in a few minutes.  Let me briefly cover our expectations at a regional level. We anticipate positive economic growth rates to continue in the U.S. and Canada, albeit at a lower level than experienced in 2018. Higher interest rates will likely drive slower growth in the U.S. housing market and also impact auto sales as we expect U.S. automotive builds to modestly decline in 2019.  In Latin America, we anticipate economic expansion in Mexico. And in South America, we're expecting continued improvement in addition to our 2018 growth. Growth rates in Asia are expected to be moderate with softening industrial production growth in China in the first half of 2019. Regional automotive build growth is expected to be flat to slightly up for the year, reflecting higher projected builds in the second half of 2019. Economic growth in Europe is expected to be modest and varied by subregion and country. Favorable end-use market trends are expected to continue. We expect very modest growth in automotive OEM coatings as industry build growth rates are expected to remain slightly positive.  With a more challenging economic landscape forecast for 2019, we will aggressively manage all elements of our business within our control to ensure that we remain competitive. We'll continue to execute our restructuring actions focused on reducing our overall cost structure and pursue additional growth-related initiatives. We expect raw material inflation to persist at current levels at least through the first 2 quarters. We will continue to work with our customers for additional selling price increases in 2019.  Finally, we ended the year with about $1 billion of cash and short-term investments. We continue to believe that there are many coatings acquisitions opportunities, and our acquisition pipeline remains active across geographies and end-use markets. We will continue to pursue accretive acquisitions.  As I noted in the press release earlier today, PPG remains well-positioned strategically and financially to deliver increased value to our shareholders as well as to our customers worldwide, given the company's outstanding team, differentiated industry experience, broad footprint and product innovation engine. We are looking forward to delivering on the targets we announced in 2019.  Before I ask Vince to comment on 2019 financial assumptions, I wanted to provide an update on the remediation measures we have taken to address the accounting matters that were the subject of the Board Audit Committee investigation in 2018. As I have previously mentioned, I have been personally involved in monitoring the remediation activities and can now report that as of the end of 2018, all of the remedial measures that we have previously disclosed have been implemented. This has been a top priority for me and my leadership team, and I want to thank everybody that was involved in supporting our efforts. The company continues to fully cooperate with the SEC's ongoing investigation relating to these accounting matters and is also fully cooperating into an investigation of the same accounting matters commenced by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania. As I have stated before, we take these matters very seriously and remain fully committed to actions that are consistent with our ethics and values and fully meet the expectations of both internal and external stakeholders. Since these are open investigations, we will have no further comments.  Now I'll turn it over to Vince who will cover some 2019 financial assumptions.
Vincent Morales: Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Earlier today, we published certain 2019 financial targets. Additionally, and similar to prior years, we've included in today's presentation materials various detailed financial assumptions for the first quarter and full year 2019. They're located on Slides 10 and 11. I will discuss a few of these financial assumptions, both for the quarter and the year.  Now with regard to the full year 2019 assumptions, we did provide annual sales guidance and annual EPS guidance. With respect to the sales guidance, we anticipate sales growth in local currencies of about -- of 3% to 5%. This includes the acquisitions we recently announced. It also includes the unfavorable impact from the customer assortment changes in our U.S. architectural coatings business that will be realized throughout the first half of the year.  From an EPS perspective, we expect EPS growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, of 7% to 10%. As we noted in our financial target press release, the earnings portion of our long-term management incentive compensation will be predicated on us hitting a minimum of 10% EPS growth as our earnings-related metric for the variable incentive comp. That ensures very strong alignment with shareholder value creation.  What is very important to note is that we do expect certain headwinds to carry over from 2018, and they will be impactful to the first half of 2019. Due to these carryover headwinds, we expect year-over-year EPS to be down in the first and second quarters, and EPS growth in the third and fourth quarters. We expect full year 2019 segment margins to be higher than the prior year for the full year. Naturally, we are working to offset these headwinds with increased selling pricing, aggressive discretionary cost management. However, we will not be able to fully offset these headwinds in the first half of 2019. In particular, for the first half of '19, we have carryover impact of first half 2018 raw material inflation. We experienced inflation for all of 2017. That continued well into 2018 before moderating in the latter part of 2018. On a year-over-year basis, we'll experience inflation in the first half of '19, until we anniversary the prior year commodity cost increases.  As discussed earlier by Michael, there has been a contraction in the global automotive OEM industry production rates, most prominently in China and Europe. We expect global auto production to be down a low single-digit percentage in the first half of 2019, before growth returns in the second half of 2019. In addition, and more broadly, we also experienced low to negative growth in other parts of the Chinese economy in the latter part of the year. We expect that to continue as we enter into 2019. Overall economic activity in Europe in the first half of 2018 was solid, and we hope that will continue through the remainder of the year. Unfortunately, the European economic indicators turned down in the second half of 2018, and we currently do not expect any improvement in the near term. Therefore, on a year-over-year basis, we expect overall economic demand to be lower in Europe in the first half of '19 in comparison to 2018. We are not assuming any large, unfavorable economic impacts from Brexit in our current guidance. This is obviously a fluid situation.  Specific to PPG, we will anniversary the unfavorable customer assortment change in our U.S. architectural business at mid-year. As a result of this, our first half sales will be down by a net of about $110 million, split roughly equally between the first and second quarters. We are continuing to restructure the business, including recent closure of 4 production facilities. We are targeting to be neutral on an EBIT dollar basis in that business beginning in the third quarter. Additionally, we expect our corporate cost to increase based on the expectation that we will achieve our 2019 financial targets, resulting in increased year-over-year management incentive compensation versus 2018, where incentive compensation was reduced. We're also anticipating higher interest costs, reflective of our increase in leverage stemming from the cash we deployed in 2018, along with the increase in interest rates throughout 2018. Finally, we expect our ongoing tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%, up from just below 22% for the full year 2018.  Last, although this is not included in our full year guidance, is significant unfavorable currency translation based on current exchange rates. We currently anticipate a $400 million to $500 million unfavorable translation impact to sales and a relating 5 -- $50 million to $70 million impact on earnings. Given that the U.S. dollar weakened in the first half of 2018 and strengthened in the second half of 2018, the currency translation impact is primarily a first half 2019 headwind to our sales and EPS.  We also provided EPS guidance today for the first quarter of 2019. This guidance is $1.18 to $1.23, and this does include the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Embedded in this guidance is an expected foreign currency impact for the quarter of $0.07 to $0.08 per share to aid in your reconciliation back to our full year guidance. As in the past, we will provide the full impact of foreign currency translation to both our sales and EPS and earnings each quarter.  As I mentioned, a summary of these financial assumptions is included in our presentation materials. This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG. And now, operator, would you please open the line for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ghansham Panjabi of Robert W. Baird.
Ghansham Panjabi: I guess, first off, on Europe and the higher sales volumes in 4Q in context of a macroeconomic slowdown in the region. Were there any end markets that surprised you to the upside or it came in basically where you thought at the beginning of the quarter?
Michael McGarry: No. I think it was pretty consistent, Ghansham. I think that we tried to signal in the past that we were still down on volumes because we've been aggressive in raising price. We see our competitors now getting out there and raising price, and so some of that volume is flowing back. As you saw, we had a positive volume in architectural in Europe. We expect to have a positive volume in architectural in first quarter as well. So I think things were fairly consistent in that manner.
Ghansham Panjabi: Okay. And then, I guess, my next question is on the 3% to 5% sales growth ex FX. Can you sort of break that out price versus volumes? And how should we layer in the $70 million in cost savings first half versus second half's? And also, the outlook for the back half of next year -- back half of 2019, specific to raw materials, can you share that as well?
Vincent Morales: Yes. I'll start, and Michael may chime in here as well. This is Vince. If you look at the sales guidance, again, we're expecting pricing somewhere in the same level as we received this year. We had 2% pricing in 2018. We're targeting something in that -- in a comparable range in order to recover our raw material inflation over the past couple of years. We do expect some volume growth that's tempered by what I just mentioned earlier, which is the assortment change. So net volume growth will be probably in the 1% to 1.5% range, depending on how certain end markets break. And then, we have some acquisition sales that are included in our financial metrics pages that we put in the presentation. From a perspective of restructuring savings, that's going to be pro rata throughout the year. So that's what I would assume.
Michael McGarry: And Ghansham, the only thing I would add is, right now, we're expecting Whitford to close in Q1, and Hemmelrath to close in Q2.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Roberts of UBS.
John Roberts: Is your portfolio review narrowly focused on Trian proposal to split architectural from industrial? Are you likely to find some non-core and underperforming areas separate from the Trian proposal?
Michael McGarry: Well, first of all, John, what I would say is that we always look at our portfolio. This has been, as you know, an ongoing thing since 1998. We're always looking for ways that we can improve our mix of businesses. We just wanted to be transparent that this work was underway. And I would tell you that there's always certain countries we look at, and we always say, "Is this a good use of shareholder money?" And we're not signaling one way or the other, but the intent is to take a complete look at everything that we have within PPG and make sure that we're aligned to the most shareholder value creation.
John Roberts: And then, secondly, in auto OEM in China, do you have eco-tanks that are idled? I think the inventory in those tanks is yours, I think. And so does the customer close down the tank, you take back your paint and you're going to reuse that somewhere else? Or how does that work when volumes drop this much?
Michael McGarry: No. We don't have any idled tanks. There's maybe one guy that's been shut down for an extended period of time, but they own that paint. But one plant out of hundreds in China is not even rounding there. So these guys are just running at a slower rate. They've taken a little bit more downtime. So far, in Q1, we've seen continuation of about a minus 15% build rate across the industry, both ourselves as well as the entire industry. So we expect that to get better after Chinese -- after the Chinese New Year. And so there have been some indications that there's going to be some incentives. We don't know exactly what they are yet. Obviously, they lowered the reserve rate. That frees up some capital that the banks can use. But right now, we do anticipate a better back half of Q1 than the first, let's call it, 45 days that we have strong visibility into.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank.
David Begleiter: Michael, just on pricing versus raw. Is Q3 now we will see the first positive margin comparison year-over-year rather than maybe Q2?
Michael McGarry: Well, I guess, it depends how you define it, Dave. In Q4 2018, we actually had price exceeding raws. But remember, we have to catch up all the raw material inflation from 2018. So the gap will grow bigger in Q1 2019 because inflation is still going up, moderating at a lower level. And of course, Q2, we are forecasting even less inflation but still inflation. And we are going to continue to get price. So I would say that our goal is to capture all the raw material inflation since they began late in the fourth quarter 2016. And obviously, we're trying to create shareholder value for everybody by returning to our pre-inflationary margins.
David Begleiter: Got it. And just on capital deployment. What's your target for buybacks and acquisitions in 2019?
Vincent Morales: Yes, David. We didn't give a target. If you look historically, we've given cash deployment target of the past couple of years. Part of the reason for us giving the target the past couple of years is we did lever down at the end of 2016. We tried to do an acquisition that didn't work, so we wanted to give confidence that we were going to deploy the excess cash on our balance sheet. As we sit here today, and we have a solid investment-grade balance sheet, we think that's at a premium in today's economic climate. We're going to have -- we're going to sit tight and analyze what's going on economically and we're not going to give a cash deployment target in the near term. Our preference remains acquisitions. We do have a very active pipeline I'm sure we'll talk through in the call today. That's evidenced by the 3 acquisitions we announced here in the last 90 days or so, and we still have acquisitions in the pipeline.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs.
Robert Koort: Michael, can you talk about where we stand on the penetration of BPA-free or non-BPA in the packaging markets? How much is there still in front of you to convert? Or are we going to hit a lull here?
Michael McGarry: I think, Bob, in my opening comments, I tried to give some flavor to that. The amount of new conversions are slowing. We've converted, let's call it, 70% to 80% of the food guys. And then, we probably converted like 50% of the beverage guys. So there's still more out there, but the folks that are left are being, I would say, they're being cautious in the route that they're taking. They're also challenging everybody on their other alternative besides just the products that we're offering. And so we're going to say probably the low single digits is where we would be as opposed to the mid to high single digits where we've been previously.
Robert Koort: And then, if I could follow up. In both marine and aerospace, you've had some really strong growth. Those tend to be very long lead time businesses. How far in the future do you see that? I mean, I mentioned that you'd see some maybe deceleration arrow, but how long is the confidence band in that growth rate sustaining?
Michael McGarry: Well, I would say, on aerospace, it's very high confidence level. Probably the one metric we don't talk a lot about is only 1% of the people in China have ever flown on a plane. And the amount of people -- and the amount of planes that are going to go into China, the number of new airports they're in the process of building is significant. The fuel economy of the planes are significantly better than what's flying. And so we anticipate this continuing to be strong. Of course, the military is getting stronger. So I think those are all positive signs. So with my current time horizon, I see this being a good market for quite extended period of time. TMC, we tried to convey previously that we thought 2018 was the bottom of the cycle. We do paint 18 to 24 months after we start to get orders. We took more orders through, I think it was July or August, than we took all of '17. And we're off to a pretty good start. So I think we're in the beginning of a slow recovery in the shipbuilding business. The shipyards in Korea are still hurting financially. So they're still getting support locally. But the Chinese shipyards are doing better. So I anticipate that this should be the beginning of a multiyear recovery.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Yi of RBC Capital Markets.
Alexander Yi: This is Alex Yi on for Arun. So it seems like based on your Q1 guidance, it appears to imply sequential deteriorations. I was just wondering, in the second half, based on your 2019 full year guidance, it goes back up sharply. Could you maybe just give some insight on to what's driving that?
Vincent Morales: Yes, Alex. This is Vince. As I said in, I think, in the opening -- my opening remarks, we do have a variety of headwinds in the first half and in Q1 that we anniversary mid-year. Those include the assortment change. We do expect automotive globally to get better in the back half of the year, in the first half of the year. We have currency translation impacts and several other headwinds in the first half that we have talked about throughout all of '18. And again, most of those anniversary as we approach the middle of the year. Plus, we're continuing to get pricing in place, and we have growing benefit from restructuring. So those would be the big causation factors that give us confidence that the back half will be better than the first half.
Alexander Yi: Okay. And just a follow-up would be it seems like on the strategic review, it seems like it's going to address split between the architectural and industrial coatings. Maybe is there any other further announcement that we could see on any divestitures beyond that? Any other leverage you guys expect?
Vincent Morales: No. Michael addressed it just a few questions ago. Again, we're evaluating what we put out in the press release. We've targeted a commitment to complete that evaluation by the second quarter. We always look at our portfolio business-by-business, product-by-product, region-by-region. But that evaluation strategically is the one we announced in the press release today.
Operator: Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer of Barclays.
Patrick Fischer: Question just around your goal for your 10% EPS annually. If you looked at a typical year, between organic and inorganic, what type of top line number do you get to -- or do you need to consistently drive that 10% EPS growth, do you think?
Michael McGarry: Well, Duffy, I would tell you, there's multiple factors that will drive that 10% EPS growth. First, we have the volume growth, and Vince talked about that earlier, probably 1% to 2% range. You got price. Obviously, that's going to be a positive. You got raw materials that are moderating right now. You've got -- the share count is down. You got costs, are going to be lower. And then, you have the positive impact from acquisitions. And each one of those things are going to help us build to the 10% number that's in there.
Vincent Morales: And Duffy, if you look over a longer period of time for the company, and again, this is averaging so it doesn't match in any particular year, we're typically 2/3 organic, 1/3 inorganic in terms of our ability to grow. We've done acquisitions, as Michael mentioned, over 20 in the last couple of years. We've done over 50 in the last decade-plus. So that would be the inorganic piece. Organically, whether it's price, whether it's volume growth, depending on what's going on with raw materials, that would be the 2/3.
Patrick Fischer: Okay. And then, with the deals or acquisitions that have been announced so far, assuming they feather in kind of on the timeline you project, how much is that already adding to the top line in '19?
Vincent Morales: Okay. If you look in our presentation materials, Duffy, we put in there that the announced acquisitions would add somewhere between $225 million and $275 million to the calendar year. That's assuming they close, and we expect that's obviously our expectation and got to go through the required regulatory process, which we don't control. But that would give you the top line marker.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeffrey Zekauskas of JPMorgan.
Jeffrey Zekauskas: You're contemplating split of your company into an industrial and a consumer side. How will you conduct that review? Will you hire an outside consultant? Will you work with various bankers? Can you talk about the mechanism of your decision-making process?
Michael McGarry: Yes. So Jeff, we're using both inside and outside resources. And it's important for us to look also historically. So if you go back and look at the synergies that we've created, as we've done these acquisitions plus the sales growth that we've created, the best practices, so we're taking a look at all of that. We'll also be looking externally at, obviously, other examples outside of PPG. And we'll see how those performed. And obviously, we have a super experienced Board of Directors. They have their own experiences that they'll be feathering questions to us. So I think it'll be a pretty exhaustive review.
Jeffrey Zekauskas: One of the categories that wasn't mentioned in your financial goals, there wasn't a comment on operating cash flow as a percent of sales in that. Over the past 5 years, I think PPG's operating cash flow as a percentage of sales is a little bit lower than some of your competitors. Is that an area that you think needs addressing? Or isn't it?
Vincent Morales: Yes, Jeff. This is Vince. Yes. We definitely have been targeting improvement in our working capital metrics. Unfortunately, in 2018, in the back half -- in the back part of the year, the metrics worsened a little bit. We attributed a little bit of that to we ended on a 3- or 4-day weekend. So our receivables are higher than we had hoped. We did continue our normal payment process. So we did make payments through our normal schedule. So our payables were lower on a comparative basis. But we definitely have stretched targets in 2019 for working capital, and that's definitely a focal point for both Michael and I and the senior team here as they get working capital back moving in the right direction.
Operator: Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar of Citi.
P.J. Juvekar: A question about your new store opening strategy. You mentioned that you're closing some stores, you're opening some new stores in some areas. So how many stores do you plan to open in 2019 on a net basis? And do you want to accelerate that growth in '19 and '20?
Michael McGarry: Yes. So I think, as we've talked about in the past, P.J., we do run a global architectural business. So we have probably, in the U.S., somewhere in that 10 to 25 store range. In Mexico, it will be over 200. In Europe, it'll be in the 10 to 15 range. So in Australia, we're still -- we don't have a firm number, but it's at least 3 to 5. So I think those are the kind of numbers you can be expecting.
P.J. Juvekar: Okay. And then, I want to go back to the split that you talked about, splitting PPG into architectural and industrial segments. This is the first time we're hearing about it from you. So what are the dissynergies of splitting? And do you expect the business to create different multiples, substantially different multiples if they're split?
Vincent Morales: P.J., this is Vince. We're not going to speculate on trading multiples. That's the job of the equity markets. We're going to analyze and evaluate what we said, again, in the press release. We're going to determine what the synergies or dissynergies are of that. Again, our commitment is to complete that. We're not going to do that evaluation over the phone today.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Hocevar of Northcoast Research.
Kevin Hocevar: I think you mentioned raw material inflation of low single digits in the first quarter and then mitigating a little bit in the second quarter and then maybe turning favorable in the back half. What's -- if we think about it for the full year, what's the expectation for raw materials for the full year as best as you can tell it now where current rates are at?
Michael McGarry: Yes. Just one correction, Kevin. We didn't say turning favorable in the second half. Our current expectation right now is low single-digit inflation for the year. Again, more of that in the beginning of the year. Obviously, this is a dynamic situation with -- especially with the price of oil, et cetera. But again, our expectation is low single digit -- very low single-digit inflation averaged for the full year but front-loaded.
Kevin Hocevar: Okay. Got you. And then, I know freight and logistics have been a headwind this year. I think, last quarter, you're guiding to mid-teens type inflation this quarter. So what was the overall inflation from freight this year? And what's your expectations for that in 2019?
John Bruno: Hey, Kevin. This is John. So we averaged that over -- well over 10%. There was a little bit of a benefit in Q4. Some crude oil prices started impacting certain elements of that area. But we're still having lack of transportation availability and other issues that are keeping the prices higher. So we still expect inflation in that area as we go into 2019.
Operator: Our next question comes from Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial Group.
Emily Wagner: This is Emily Wagner on for Don. Just staying with the raw material inflation in terms of how you expect gross margin recovery to roll out in 2019. I know it's back-half loaded, but could we see 100 to 200 basis points? And what's kind of the magnitude of contributions there from price and cost savings?
Vincent Morales: Well, again, we gave macro. We expect the margins to be up in 2019 for the full year. We're not going to provide it by quarter. There's too many moving pieces and parts in each quarter. But again, it'll be back-half loaded.
Emily Wagner: Okay. And then, within auto OEM, if there were to be a tax incentive for the Chinese, how long would that take to increase auto production? And how long would that take to benefit the coatings producers?
Michael McGarry: Well, we deliver in real-time. So it's a just-in-time delivery. And the Chinese market, they're probably up about 5 to 7 days of inventory. But if they were to put incentives out there, what we saw in 2016 when they did this, we saw pretty immediate improvement in operating rates and pretty immediate improvement in sales rate. So I would tell you, we'll just have to wait and see what the actual incentives are and when they're effective. But historically, that has translated very quickly into improvement in sales.
Vincent Morales: If I could, Emily, I just want to emphasize what Michael said. There isn't a significant inventory overhang in China. Inventories are up a few days, but inventory is relatively well in check. So it wouldn't take a long time for this to have a meaningful impact on production.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christopher Parkinson of Crédit Suisse.
Harris Fein: This is Harris Fein on for Chris. I was just wondering what expectations you have that are embedded into your guidance on U.S. housing? And is there anything that you're seeing either from the data that's out there or just qualitatively from being on the ground that gives you confidence that resi repaint activity can keep growing, even in an environment where we have lower housing turnover?
Michael McGarry: Yes. So we have 1.3 million builds in -- for the new one, we have about the same, 5 million and change for overall units turning over. So we don't have a big difference. Res repaint for us, I would say, we're undersized in that market. We're much more commercial and maintenance type painter in that area. So that probably will not have a significant impact on us. We're still anticipating that architectural will have a good year. There's a significant amount of backlog with our painters, and they feel very comfortable that their order book looks good.
Harris Fein: And just kind of keeping with this topic. Due to the weather that we had during October and November, did you see a lot of commercial projects get pushed out? And do you see kind of any sort of recouping any lost business kind of as we enter into the paint season in the spring and summer?
Michael McGarry: Well, we don't allow our sales team to use weather as an excuse. So we're not going to use it here. Our customers are trying to paint every single day, and it's up to us to try to make sure they're equipped to be productive. All I would tell you is that we're anticipating to be back to that mid-single-digit kind of numbers in Q1. It's way too early to tell because January is a month that's seasonally exceptionally slow. And March is, by far, the most important number in that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch of Fermium Research.
Frank Mitsch: Maybe if I ask that question a little bit differently. What -- as I look at -- if I look at the fourth quarter by month, October, November, December, can you talk about the pace of business that you saw, Michael, in each of those months? And how is January starting out?
Michael McGarry: I would tell you that there wasn't that much of a meaningful difference. You have to -- for us, I would say, it'd be more guesswork than splitting hairs on trying to figure out that impact, because you got different days, you got different regions, you got different impact of weather. So I would just tell you that we're going to -- we're pretty confident go into next year that architectural buyings in our stores is going to continue. The do-it-for-me trend is a positive, and that trend is going to continue.
Frank Mitsch: Got you. And I guess, a broader question. Europe was a bit of a surprise, positive surprise, in the quarter other than, I guess, auto OEM. And -- but you mentioned that indicators had turned down a while ago. And so you've got some concerns there. In terms of economic activity, PPG has always been one of the best ones in terms of forecasting what's going on economically. How would you guys gauge the percent chance that we enter into a recession here?
Michael McGarry: I'm not forecasting that, Frank, right now. We are forecasting a slowdown in Europe, but not a recession. The big unknown, of course, is Brexit. That could be a significant factor. But we do see significant differences by country, and that's the bigger thing. Even Germany slowed down in the fourth quarter. And that's not necessarily a good sign, but we'll wait and see how it continues.
Frank Mitsch: And if I look at Asia, do you have an expectation that China comes back post-Chinese New Year, or more of the same is how you guys are looking at that region?
Michael McGarry: Well, if you'd tell me what would happen with the tariffs, then I would have an answer for you. I think, right now, China wants to -- we see a lot of positives in certain of our businesses. Marine is a positive there. Refinish is a positive there. Aerospace is a positive there. So we see a number of good indicators, but clearly, consumer confidence is down. Appliance is down. Coil is down. OEM obviously is down. So I think it'll come back. I mean, it is too big of a market not to come back. And we know that they have plenty money over there. And so it's just a matter of getting that consumer confidence back. So we have a very positive long-term outlook on China.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley.
Vincent Andrews: Question for you on if we have raw materials has peaked and they've come down, and you've got negative auto builds and a decelerating macroeconomy, what gives you the confidence that you're still going to be able to achieve the pricing that you need to get?
Michael McGarry: Well, first of all, the pricing is catch-up, right? So we don't price just in the real-time environment of today. We have to look at how it's been the last 9 quarters. Now it's 10 quarters of inflation. So our customers understand that. They see it in their own numbers. They see it in their own freight and logistics numbers. So the question isn't a matter of if. It's a matter of how much.
Vincent Andrews: Okay. And then, if I could just ask you on the incentives. Why did the board choose EPS as the metric as opposed to net income or EBITDA or something that isn't influenced by share count?
Michael McGarry: We've always used EPS as one of our metrics. Has been for quite some period of time. And so we didn't make a change. What we wanted to do was reinforce that the executive incentives will be paid out on exceeding the upper end of the range at 10%.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research Partners.
Kevin McCarthy: Michael, I was wondering if you'd flesh out the auto OEM pricing in perhaps a bit more detail. You obviously had the press release back in October. Are you seeing better realizations in that market on a sequential basis? And has pricing turned positive at this juncture?
Michael McGarry: Yes. Kevin, I think I've tried to make that point clear on my opening remarks. We had positive price in OEM in all regions, and that was the first. So now we have all 8 business segments reporting positive price. We even had positive price in China, which was, if you remember, our 2 biggest challenges were: A, automotive; and B, China. So we had both positive. So we're going to get price in automotive. We're going to get more price in Q1, and then we'll get more price in Q2. So these guys are large, sophisticated buyers, and it's not easy. But they do understand the challenges that we have. And obviously, they very much want to have access to our technology, and in exchange for that, they're willing to pay a fair price.
Kevin McCarthy: That's helpful. And then, the second question, if I may, on raw materials. The cost of propylene has come down rather sharply since November, at least in the U.S. market, down $0.10 in November, and $0.08 on top of that in December. My question is, is that sort of volatility likely or not likely to precipitate a shift in resin systems away from acrylics, for example, into vinyl sourced styrenics?
Michael McGarry: Well, we're always looking at optimizing our resin portfolio. And we don't typically change them on a quarterly basis, what's happening with propylene and ethylene. I think, from a long-term perspective, we're still bullish that the PDH expansions will drive more consistent pricing in propylene and that there'll be more capacity out there. They've struggled getting these plants to consistently run, but there are more of them coming on. So I think, right now, you probably should not assume that we're going to be shifting systems -- resin systems.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Byrne of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Ian Bennett: This is Ian on for Steve. The strategic review, when did that kind of kickoff? And what are you hoping to learn that you don't know already?
Michael McGarry: Well, like I said earlier, we do strategic reviews of all our businesses on a continuous basis. So there was really no kickoff, if you will. What we wanted to do was let people know that we take all the feedback we get from investors seriously and that we're going to evaluate. We don't always -- we don't always have the best ideas internally, that there could be external ideas that we need to consider. But we're not going to predict what the outcome is going to be. I think we want to take a very serious look at all our businesses and all our regions and then decide what's the best path forward.
Ian Bennett: Okay. And I would echo the comments earlier about the 2019 guidance as being very helpful. And just curious about, I think, historically, you didn't offer more detail than full year 2019 guidance and what drove that change.
Michael McGarry: So Ian, we have a very choppy environment right now, right? We have currency moving all over the place. You got China. You got automotive. You got tariffs. You got raw materials. So I think those were all things that we wanted to be a little bit more transparent on. And we knew that the first half of the year and the second half of the year were going to be different, and we wanted to provide that kind of clarity so that you could put that into your models.
Operator: Our next question is from James Sheehan of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
James Sheehan: You guys targeted $2.4 billion of capital deployment in 2018, and it looks like you fell short of that by about $300 million. Is there another deal on the pipeline that will make up that shortfall relatively quickly? Or can you just provide more color on capital deployment plans?
John Bruno: Yes, Jim. This is John. We met our target. We talked about in the fourth quarter was that we were going to include any deals we announced in that $2.4 billion. So including Whitford and Hemmelrath, we're, in fact, a little bit over that target.
James Sheehan: Got it. And regarding synergies that you've got between industrial and architectural coatings, would you say that those all have been fully captured over the last 2 to 3 years? Or has something held you back?
Michael McGarry: No. We continue to capture more synergies. I mean, I'll take Comex as a perfect example, right? We closed on Comex 4 years ago. And protective sales in Mexico were up significantly. We built a new architectural business in Central America. We've grown our industrial. We've grown our architectural sales into the automotive plants down in Mexico. Our Mexican business is up significantly since the Comex acquisition, and that's just one illustration of the synergies between the industrial and automotive -- I mean, industrial and architectural businesses.
James Sheehan: Could you give us some color on the synergies you expect from the SEM acquisition?
Michael McGarry: Sure. There'd be two major ones. Of course, raw materials is one. That's an easy one. The second one would be sales synergies. So SEM, of course, has a small sales force. They're pretty much a U.S. and a little bit of a Canadian business. Very, very little international business to speak of. Also, there'll be some reverse synergies. They have the capability of packaging aerosol. So that will be something that we'll be looking at, whether that makes sense for us to move that in-house versus us currently outsourcing it. So this should be a good acquisition for us. They're a very profitable company, and they're excited to be part of the PPG team.
Operator: Your next question comes from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies.
Daniel Rizzo: This is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. Is the expectation that buybacks should accelerate if end market trends were to diminish, that is -- should we treat the EPS range more as a commitment or as a benchmark?
Vincent Morales: No. We haven't talked about cash deployment. And again, our focus right now is to maintain our balance sheet today in the economic times we're in. We do have an active pipeline, as I mentioned earlier. That would be a priority for us. The EPS range we put out there is our best guess of what we know today. We put a stake in the ground with respect to our incentive comp metrics on the top end of that range. So I'd say, certainly, that's a commitment from the management team. But again, it's based on our best guess of the economy today, and there's a bunch of moving pieces, as we talked throughout the call.
Daniel Rizzo: All right. And then, have you seen -- with order patterns, have you seen volatility increase over the past few months? I mean, I know things are obviously changing a lot. I was wondering if volatility from month-to-month has gone up in 2018.
Vincent Morales: Yes. I'd say, the only place where we've seen what I would call dramatic shifts in orders is really in the automotive market, particularly in China, but a little bit in Europe. We've seen extended downtime. Again, that's not a PPG-specific issue. That's an industry issue. Everywhere else, things get a little choppy in the winter. Things get a little choppy around year-end as there's inventory management by our customers. So there's nothing uncommon other than in automotive.
Operator: Our next question comes from John McNulty of BMO Capital Markets.
Colton Bina: This is Colton Bina on for John. On auto refinish, with it being flat for the quarter, what were some of the positive impacts you saw there offsetting the weakness in the U.S. from destocking?
Michael McGarry: Well, refinish is a global market. I mean, Europe was slightly positive. China was slightly positive. India was positive. Mexico was flat. I would say, overall, it was -- the quarter came in about where we're expecting it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Harrison of Seaport Global Securities.
Michael Harrison: I was wondering, it sounds from your commentary like you expect to continue to be pretty aggressive on the pricing front. But just wondering, as we're seeing some softening in demand in certain markets, just wondering if you're maybe rethinking your approach on pricing at all. And maybe can you talk a little bit about how aggressive you think you'll be able to be on pricing when you look at maybe three buckets, architectural, industrial and then auto OEM getting into 2019?
Michael McGarry: So we are not backing off on our price. We still have significant margin recovery that we need to capture because of 2017, and the start of it in the fourth quarter 2016. So the sales teams are focused on that. Automotive is the furthest behind, so that will continue to have significant amount of pressure. We've had good increases in our industrial businesses, and so we would expect that to continue. And then, from an architectural standpoint, we're pleased to see that all the players in the marketplace are finally serious about getting price globally, and that is helping getting more traction. So I don't anticipate any by letting a foot off the accelerator at this point, given the fact that we still have significant raw material inflation capture.
Michael Harrison: All right. And then, the Europe architectural business, it sounded to me like what you were saying is that you had been losing volume because you've been very aggressive on price. Now you've seen some competitors pushing price and that volume is starting to come back. Is that the main variable that explains what's been happening to improve your business there? Or what else may be at play in Europe?
Michael McGarry: That's not the only variable, right? I mean, we have certain key markets that are performing very well. Our Romanian business had a record year. Our Czech, Slovak businesses were good. The Benelux was solid. Surprisingly, retail -- we were a little surprised, retail in France was better than we expected. So we'll wait and see if that's a short-term anomaly or what, but that was a positive. So our big challenge still is trade France. That is still the biggest business we'd like to see click back into a positive number. We are gaining share in the U.K. and Ireland, but it's really choppy with Brexit right now. So we're not going to be drawing any conclusions at this point in time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn of Buckingham Research.
Wahid Amin: This is Wahid Amin on for Dmitry. Just a quick question on your outlook for U.S. and Canada same-store sales. Can you break that up a little bit? And on that note, do you see a much slower pace in the DIY market with the whole shift in DIFM? And do you hold a bullish outlook in that towards the latter half of 2019?
Michael McGarry: Yes. So the trend line of do-it-for-me is going to continue over DIY. So that trend line is not going to change. The same-store sales is going to be a combination of volume and price. It's going to be both. So I would anticipate that, that will continue to be a good story for PPG in 2019.
Wahid Amin: All right. And if I can ask one more. You've talked about $225 million to $275 million in added acquisition toward sales. Would you mind breaking that a little bit? Is that more towards the latter half of 2019? Do you see that more materializing towards the first or second quarter? Just any color on that.
Vincent Morales: Yes. This is Vince. That's the target for the full year based on when we expect the pending acquisitions to close. Again, we expect Whitford, as Michael mentioned, to close sometime between middle to late first quarter. We expect Hemmelrath to close in the second quarter. We don't have as much visibility on timing. Those two acquisitions, plus the Whitford acquisition, which we closed in the fourth quarter...
Michael McGarry: SEM.
Vincent Morales: I'm sorry. SEM, I apologize, that we closed in the fourth quarter. So that will grow throughout the year based on when those acquisitions close.
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel Chung of Redburn.
Tony Jones: It's Tony Jones from Redburn. I just had two quick ones left. So one was on OpEx, R&D and SG&A costs. They were down pretty significantly in Q4. Is that sustainable in the next few quarters? Or likely to trend back up?
Vincent Morales: No. If you look at SG&A costs, they were down on an absolute basis, but they were comparable to the prior quarters on a percentage of sales basis. Since we buy, make, sell local, we do have a lot of currency translation effects that run through all the P&L lines. But again, on a percentage of sales basis, we were pretty consistent throughout the year. We were down about 100 basis points in most quarters year-over-year on SG&A. And again, the anomalies by quarter are more driven by currency translation.
Tony Jones: And just one final one. Just coming back to the strategic review. Will the study also examine the potential for like a second step? So maybe synergies or other value creation from a merger with a competitor post-breakup?
Vincent Morales: Again, our focus is what we put on in the press release. We're going to study the portfolio we have today. We're not going to another derivative.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to John Bruno for any closing remarks.
John Bruno: Thank you, Andrea, and thanks, everybody, for your time and interest in PPG. If you have any further questions, please contact our Investor Relations department. This concludes our Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Earnings Call.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon and welcome to the PPG Industries Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Denise, and I will be your conference specialist today. All participants will be in listen only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to John Bruno, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
John Bruno: Thank you, Denise, and good afternoon, everyone. Once again, this is John Bruno, Director of Investor Relations. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG and welcome you to our third quarter 2018 financial results conference call. Joining me on the call from PPG are, Michael McGarry, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vince Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Before introducing Michael, I would like to remind everyone that on October 8, PPG issued an update on third quarter financial results and guidance on fourth quarter earnings. Today we are confirming the fourth quarter guidance we provided on October 8. Now, let me introduce PPG Chairman and CEO, Michael McGarry.
Michael McGarry: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported third quarter 2018 financial results. For the third quarter our net sales were approximately $3.8 billion and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.45.  As we detailed in our preannouncement, we experienced increase raw material and logistic cost inflation in the quarter, with the third quarter representing the highest level of cost inflation since the trend began two years ago.  We did not meet our elevated expectations for year-over-year performance. However we’ve made significant progress on increasing selling prices, have continued to aggressively manage our costs and have continued with capital deployment. For the third quarter our sales in local currencies increased by more than 3%. Reporting the higher local currency sales were selling price increase of more than 2% in the third quarter, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of improvement over the prior sequential quarter. Our sales volumes were flat in aggregate, but up about 2% excluding the previously communicated customer assortment changes in our U.S. architectural coatings business.  Foreign currency translation turn to a headwind, compared to third quarter 2017 as the U.S. dollar strengthened during the quarter against several key currencies. Sales were unfavorably impacted by about $80 million from currency translation and pretax income unfavorably impacted by about $15 million.  Looking at some of the business trends in the quarter, in the Performance Coating segment, aerospace coatings delivered another excellent quarter with more than 10% volume growth, led by above industry performance in the U.S. and Asia-Pacific. Architectural Coatings EMEA our organic sales increased a low single-digit in the quarter driven by higher selling prices. While overall sales volumes in Architectural Coatings Americas and Asia-Pacific decreased, we did continue to achieve high single-digit percentage organic sales growth in the U.S. and Canadian company owned stores. In addition, we continue to be pleased with the progress achieve to expand PPG’s offering at the Home Depot and we are proud to be named Supplier Partner of the Year at the Home Depot for the launch of the Olympic Stain and Timeless brands.  Volumes grew at our Mexican PPG Comex business including the benefit of opening additional 40 stores during the quarter. Protective and marine coatings volumes increased with continued strong protected coating sales in Asia. The marine business had modestly higher new build volumes, which came off of a very low base. Automotive refinish coatings organic sales decreased by low single-digit percentage year-over-year trending lower as the quarter progressed. Volumes were impacted by lower demand in the U.S. and Europe, stemming from a change in customer order patterns, as several customers had high inventory levels due to lower end use market demand.  Collision claims have fallen by 1% this year and the amount of vehicles being totaled instead of being repairs has increased by 1%, which both factors are negatively impacting overall demand. Our automotive refinish team continues to deliver outstanding products and solution to customers and has converted a net 3,000 global body shops to PPG so far in 2018. Our Industrial Coatings reporting segment delivered solid mid-single digit sales volume growth and progressed selling price investments during the quarter. Volumes in packaging coatings were up mid-single digit percentage as the adoption to our INNOVEL interior can coatings products continued. Selling prices in this business were also achieved. We anticipate growth to moderate as we’ve progressed deeper into the new technology conversion cycle and due to PPG’s strong growth in prior quarters.  Automotive OEM coatings global sales volumes were flat compared to slightly negative global industry automotive builds. This business outperformed the market in the U.S. with recent market share gains. Sales volumes in China decreased a high single-digit percentage in line with lower industry production in China during the quarter, as lower consumer spending on autos drove sharply lower retail sales. From a regional perspective volume growth continue to be the highest in the emerging regions. Sales growth in Asia Pacific region was driven by growth in our aerospace, auto refinish and protective coatings businesses. Sales in China grew, but at a lower rate than the second quarter and softened as the third quarter progressed. Sales in India and Southeast Asia, grew at high single-digit percentage. Earnings in Asia Pacific have been below 2017 levels, as the region has been impacted by some of the highest levels of raw material and logistic cost inflation that we have experienced. Sales grew at mid-single-digit percentage in Latin America, supported by continuing outperformance by businesses in the Industrial Coatings segment and solid auto refinished and architectural coatings sales volumes growth.  Sales volumes were flat in Europe. Volume growth in the Industrial Coatings segment was offset by lower sales in automotive refinish and architectural coatings EMEA. We anticipate modest volume growth in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis and lower sequentially due to normal seasonal patterns. Sales volumes were lower in the U.S. and Canada in the third quarter as strong sales in the Industrial Coatings segment were more than offset by lower volumes in both the automotive refinish and architectural coatings business. From an earnings perspective, our third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was $1.45, which was lower than the prior year. For the year-to-date through September 2018, adjusted earnings per diluted share are $4.75, which is higher than the prior year 2017 despite the cost pressures we have faced. Our earnings were impacted by elevated raw material inflation that rose by mid to high-single-digit percentage. Logistics cost increases, which includes the effect from higher costs and availability of transportation inflated nearly 20% compared to the third quarter of 2017. In the third quarter, we continue to make progress on our selling price initiatives. Price increased by more than 2% on a year-over-year basis as both of our reporting segments realized higher selling prices. We have secured further price increases for the fourth quarter and we'll continue to prioritize collaborating with our customers on further selling pricing initiatives. In addition to selling price initiatives, we are making good progress implementing our restructuring programs. Our two active programs delivered about $20 million of costs savings in the third quarter. As part of our newer restructuring program, we've already completed the closure of two factories and several distribution warehouses and are in the process of closing another factory and a couple of other warehouses in the U.S. We expect additional savings of more than $20 million in the fourth quarter. In addition, earnings per share benefitted from an ongoing cash deployment actions. Through the end of September, we have now repurchased about $1.3 billion of PPG stock in 2018. In the quarter, average diluted shares outstanding were 6% lower versus the third quarter of 2017.  Our adjusted effective tax rate was about 21% in the third quarter, lower than the 24% rate from the third quarter of 2017. The reduction is related to recognizing favorable discrete tax items in the third quarter and the tax reform legislations that was implemented at the start of 2018. We are still anticipating a full year tax rate between 23% and 24%. As we look ahead, we expect to see greater volatility in global industrial demand, primarily in emerging regions. We anticipate that the year-over-year rate of raw material inflation will moderate due to the spike in inflation rates in the prior year quarter. And logistics costs inflation is expected to remain elevated. The new tariffs are starting to add some modest cost to our raw materials. We expect currency translation to have an unfavorable impact to our sales in the fourth quarter. Based on current rates, the unfavorable impact is expected to be between $50 million and $60 million in the fourth quarter. Specific to our businesses, overall net sales are expected to be lower sequentially due to normal seasonal patterns. In the U.S., we expect the economic activity to continue at a similar pace as we have seen in the third quarter of 2018 and that automotive OEM builds will be similar to the fourth quarter of 2017. Automotive refinish sales volumes will continue to be impacted by customer inventory destocking. In Latin America, we anticipate similar economic expansion as we have experienced in the third quarter of 2018. Growth rates in Asia are expected to be less than they were in the third quarter, with heightened volatility in China. Economic growth in Europe is expected to continue into the fourth quarter at a similar rate that we saw in the third quarter. Favorable end use market trends are expected to continue driven by growth in industrial production, partially offset by subdued architectural and automotive refinish coatings demand. We will continue to invest in growth initiatives including targeting certain growth spending in the fourth quarter with plans to spend an additional $5 million. We ended the third quarter with about $1.2 billion of cash and short-term investments, which continues to provide us with financial flexibility. We plan to deploy a minimum of $1 billion of cash in the fourth quarter on acquisitions and share repurchases as part of our previously communicated target to deploy a minimum of $3.5 billion in 2017 and 2018 combined. The acquisition pipeline in the industry remains active. We just announced the agreement to acquire SEM Products, an automotive refinish products manufacturer with the history of attractive margins and will continue to participate in other opportunities in our industry’s consolidation. In addition, we plan to continue to repurchase shares in the fourth quarter. Finally, we remain well positioned in all coatings end use markets and across all major geographic regions. Our excellent positioning along with our technology advanced products provide to us with ample opportunities to continue to grow and deliver shareholder value. This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG. And now Denise, would you please open the line for Q&A.
Operator: Certainly sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Ghansham Panjabi of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. 
Ghansham Panjabi: Hi, everyone. Maybe just starting off on auto refinish, Michael, you called out decreased collision demand in the U.S. and Europe as one of the factors impacting this business, but from your heat map it looks like you're also below the industry for the third quarter. I guess first off why is that, was the customer mix that impacted the third quarter or was it due to the timeline of your price increases or anything else?
Michael McGarry: Now that -- if you look at the heat map, Ghansham, that's really reflects our sales out to our distributors. It does not reflect their sales out to their body shops. So in reality, if you look at the sellout versus sell in, we’re still doing quite well. That’s why I referenced the fact that we’ve gained 3,000 net body shops. So the difference was, if you remember 2017 in the first half of 2018, we had very strong refinish sales. And many of our refinish distributors anticipate that continued market growth. And as you’ve seen, we’ve had very few natural disasters and we didn’t get the tornadoes and the Hales and all that kind of stuff this year. We also didn’t see the accident rate miles driven, it’s only up 0.3%, so that’s moderated as well. So I think overall, what you’re looking at the heat map is the sell in and sell out is still quite good.
Ghansham Panjabi: Okay, thanks for clarifying. And then just for my second question on selling prices, which were up 2.3% during the third quarter. Was that in line with where you thought you would be heading into the third quarter and if not, what sort of held that number back? Thanks so much.
Michael McGarry: No, Ghansham, I’d say it was in line with expectations. We had sales price increases in all of our businesses and improvement in all our businesses, which even includes automotive although, I’m sure someone is going to ask later about automotive. So I would say that still more increases are on the way.
Ghansham Panjabi: Thanks so much. 
Operator: The next question will be from John Roberts of UBS. Please go ahead.
John Roberts: Thanks. Michael, you mentioned raws were up mid-to-high single-digit percent year-over-year in the third quarter. What should we expect for the fourth quarter? So the comps get a little easier, as you mentioned. And then if raws stayed flat at their current level, or oil prices stay flat at their current level and they get pass through, what would you expect for 2019 over 2018?
Michael McGarry: Well, let’s focus on your fourth quarter comment first. I think we said, low to mid-single-digits. So, kind of parse where that number might be. As far as 2019 as you know, it’s very early to start to call 2019. We still don’t know what China’s going to do as far as environmental enforcement like they did last year. We think they’re going to be a little bit more nuanced in how they handle that.  Last year, they pretty much mirrored by the same marching orders, I think this year they’re probably going to -- for those high performers they’re going to give them more lead life, for the low performers they’ll probably be more aggressive in enforcing the environment regulation. So I think that’s still to be determined, so I would definitely say though 2019 is going to have less inflation than 2018, but I think it’s too early to give you a number.
John Roberts: And then secondly, could you range the size of the deals that you might have in your pipeline, that’s there, just a number of small things that you’re working on, do you have anything large that we should think about?
Vincent Morales: Hey, John, this is Vince. Again we typically wouldn’t give details around that. I think we’ve said continuously throughout the year and as we’re saying today with our acquisitions of SEM it is a very active pipeline, some of these transactions that we talk to the potential sellers for years if not decades. So it’s active smaller mid-size deals.
John Roberts: Okay, thank you. 
Operator: The next question will be from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
David Begleiter : Thank you. Michael, when would you expect your pricing to fully catch up with raw materials, would be Q1, Q2, or somewhere in between perhaps?
Michael McGarry: I would say the gap is closing. It really depends upon the rate of inflation in the first quarter. But the real thing that we’re telling our customers is don’t forget that we probably got off the starting blocks three or four months later than normal because of some unusual factors in the industry. And so we’re going to have to continue to push increases all through 2019.
David Begleiter : Very good. And just so we finished, would you expect this inventory adjustment to be done in Q4 or could it leak into Q1 perhaps?
Michael McGarry: Well, the hard part if I answer that question is winter. How much snow are we going to get, what types of weather events. I would say we’re optimistic that the fourth quarter will begin the end of that. But it’s -- I would say it’s -- I am more confident on that than anything, but I would still put a little bit about pencil mark that there is some unknowns out there.
David Begleiter : Thank you very much. 
Operator: The next question will be from Robert Koort of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. 
Chris Evans: Hey, good afternoon everyone, this is Chris Evans on for Bob. Earlier you sited about $20 million of restructuring savings in the quarter, can you put this into context for maybe some of the stranded costs you may have incurred as a result of North American product realignments? And also can you give a little more clarity on the cadence of the Home Depot load-in and how profitability might be impacted in 2019 net of the losses at lowest?
John Bruno: Hey, Chris this is John. I’ll take a stab at your question about restructuring stranded costs. I would look at it this way, we’re looking to be margin neutral on that business that for our business next year in 2019. So working to take our cost and grow in other areas of that business. So we’re looking to be margin neutral in 2019.
Chris Evans: Okay. And then you recently put out an order OEM price increase announcement, does this represent any change in your behavior with customers in this end market or are you increasing the scale of the price announcements given how inflation is trending.
Michael McGarry: Well, definitely the scale is larger, but what we have remember that we’re further behind price increases in automotive than any other business and we know it and our customers know it. And that’s the most important thing. So we definitely are looking to get more traction on that and the same comment goes for China as well, the hardest place to get prices as we know is automotive in the next hardest is the region. So, this is an area that we’re highly focused on and the good news is we saw some early signs of traction in the third quarter and we expect to get more traction in the fourth quarter.
Chris Evans: Thank you. 
Operator: The next question will be from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Kevin McCarthy: Yes, good afternoon. Michael, you made a comment that you experienced softer sales in China as the quarter progressed, can you elaborate on the product lines where you witnessed that and how would you characterize the order books for those lines here in October?
Michael McGarry: Well, the pronounced one was automotive, so China retail sales were down 5% in July, and were down 6% in August, they were down nearly 12% in September. And the early indication so far or the read in October is slightly better, but not anything to write home about. So -- and that impacts not just our automotive business, but also a little bit of our industrial business because as you know they're painting parts and they're painting bumpers and things like that. So that is by far the one that would impact. And when you look at the rest of our China business, protective was good, marine bouncing off a very low bottom, but that was better, refinish had a good one, packaging did pretty well. And so I would tell you overall it's really can find right now to automotive.  But thing that I worry about and I try to signal this on going into third quarter before was the consumer confidence in China, with the tariffs consumer confidence has dropped. And when consumer confidence drops, then you start to see these big ticket items slow down. And so I won't be surprised if China tries to add some additional I wouldn't call it stimulus, but additional emphasis on how they can support the automotive industry because it is a very, very important industry to them. So we'll wait and see what happens, they haven't done anything yet, but it is a key industry for them.
Kevin McCarthy: Thanks for that. And then second question with regards to the U.S. architectural market in the DIY channel. Just wondered if you could comment on your inventory levels there and your current view of our customer takeaway trends.
Michael McGarry: Well, I would tell you our DIY is lower than obviously our stores that do it for me is continuing to outpace DIY. When we look at our customers' inventory in the DIY space, I would say they're not out of line. And the good news is they're enthusiastic about the products that we have. And so we should expect to see that continue to grow in that 2% to 3% to 4% range, but certainly below the store growth.
Kevin McCarthy: Thanks very much. 
Operator: The next question will be from Michael Sison of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. 
Michael Sison : Hey, guys. For the fourth quarter, can you give us a little bit of help on where you think the profitability will end up for the total company where you make some progress year-over-year in terms of margins. And maybe a little bit of color on each segment?
Vincent Morales: Hey, Mike, this is Vince. Just we said this before, we're still targeting an aggregate to get close to margin parity in total for the company. We’re working very aggressively on discretionary costs. We've accelerated some restructuring actions that we had originally planned for 2019 and 2018. So that's what we're still working toward. We do expect to see improvement in both segments from a year-over-year basis compared to the third quarter. But we're not going to year mark what each of those are. I will remind you Mike, we did have a spike last year in raw materials, precipitated by the Chinese environmental enforcement. That spike was really pronounced in our Industrial Coatings segment. So we should see -- we were up 400 basis points in margins in Q3 in industrial coatings. We should see that gap close considerably in Q4 relative to what happened last year.
Michael Sison : Got it. And then just from a macro standpoint, when you think about Industrial Coatings operating margins it probably end up somewhere around 13% or something in that range plus or minus a little bit. And then you guys peaked at 2018. So when you think about the delta, how much of that do you think you can get back overtime, how much of that’s raw materials. And what's the potential profitability for that segment longer term?
Michael McGarry: Yes, so Michael, this is Michael. I would tell you, we're going to get all that back. This is an area that is a high focus for the company. We won't get it all back immediately, we have to be successful in our price increase as we have to be successful in managing our costs, eliminating complexity and things like that. But at the end of the day, our team is very confident that overtime we will get back to those peak levels.
Vincent Morales: And if I could just add Mike, these are tremendously value add products for our customers. They bring a lot of value to the appearance of their products, were very important instrumental in their manufacturing process and those value attributes something they value and we’ll get paid for. 
Michael Sison : Right, thank you. 
Operator: The next question will from Frank Mitch of Permian Research [ph]. Please go ahead. 
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you and good afternoon gentlemen. Michael, a lot of discussion on the impact of raw materials, you also highlighted the impact of higher logistics costs last quarter and certainly this quarter and expectation for it to plague Q4. I was wondering if you could provide an order of magnitude of what the negative delta is there and is there anything short of trying to get pricing, et cetera to offset that you can do there to improve the situation.
Michael McGarry: So Frank, I think we have been clear, it’s north of 20% this is availability of trucks as well as the fuel and everything else that goes along with this. So, we do use tools to combine loads from one place to another. And so we’re actively trying to manage that, at the end of the day this is not just a U.S. issue which a lot of people think, this is a global issue, the amount of truck drivers around the world is decreasing and we see the same trend whether it’s in China or Europe or the U.S. So, I don’t think this is going to go away and we continue to work on I mean if you think about a lot of our businesses we ship full truck loads. So it’s not like it’s LTL kind of stuff now for our smaller customers it is, but for our big ones, it’s not. So…
Vincent Morales: This is part of our normal pricing discussions Frank with our customers. We talk about commodity inflation and we also talk about logistics inflation.
Michael McGarry: And they have the same thing, so they fully are aware of it. 
Unidentified Analyst: All right, terrific that’s very helpful. And then another topic regarding PPG, this has been in the news of late, is that -- is China’s involvement in the equity. Is there anything you can share with the investment community in terms of the relationship that you have there friendly, hostile what have you what sort of suggestions they maybe offering, is there anything that you could add some color too?
Michael McGarry: Well, Frank, as you can imagine, we engage with all our investors throughout the year and we always value their feedback, we find them to be helpful and -- but we also have to be respectful of those individual exchanges, right. And so right now we’re not going to share any details about any of our investors and I hope you can understand that.
Unidentified Analyst: Certainly, thanks so much. 
Michael McGarry: Thanks, Frank. 
Operator: The next question will from Christopher Parkinson of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Christopher Parkinson: Thank you. Of all the moving parts in 3Q such as pricing cadence, raw material inflation, the volume trends. Can you just compare and contrast what you believe the dialogue in these same topics just in terms of what you think is the most material will be two quarters out just. What if any do you think the major differences will be from your perspective going forward? Thanks.
Vincent Morales: This is Vince, I’ll start and Michael will chime in here. But if you think two or three quarters out again we’re getting momentum in pricing, I think that’s important so we’re getting it as Michael and John Bruno mentioned, across most of our regions and all of our businesses. So two quarters out we expect that to be further down the path in terms of pricing. We do think in 2019 we’ll see commodities trade on supply demand and only supply demand and that’s important for us. On the other side we still are uncertain about how the macro will look especially around the tariffs. So those would be the kind of the moving parts.
Michael McGarry: Yes, Chris, I would also add that oil is the one thing that has on our watch out list, so I don’t think we’re going to be talking about TiO2 down the road, but we’ll be talking about solvents and various things that are impacted by oil. 
Christopher Parkinson: That’s helpful. You’ve had a bunch of various costs cutting efforts over the past several years. In addition there is continuous improvement initiatives. Given where current volume trends are and where you think they will be over the next few years or so what else if anything, can you do from the cost side. Is there any change of thinking here or just how should we think about that over the next 12 to 24 months? Thank you.
Michael McGarry: Yes, I think we have a continuous improvement culture at PPG, we have very active lean Six Sigma initiatives. We measure ourselves on a performance basis versus prior. And so, we'd say, we want to get better every day versus the day before. And so, our teams are expected as part of the planning process to bring forward ideas on how they can improve sort of whether that's the velocity through the plant, whether that's reducing the complexity of the SKUs or the raw materials, or the formulas, those are all opportunities. Certainly, we're looking at our distribution logistics on how we can improve that. So I would tell you that, we still have a list of ideas that we're working through.
Christopher Parkinson: Thank you very much. 
Operator: The next question will be from John McNulty of BMO. Please go ahead. 
John McNulty: Yes, thanks for taking my question. On the raw material front, the hike that you saw year-over-year, I guess, I'm trying to understand how much of it was from the actual raw material basket that you're exposed to versus product that was maybe coming through inventory through your international businesses particularly -- because I know a lot of those use FIFO. So I guess how much of it was inventory work in itself through that might have gone up earlier in the year? It just seems like it's a high rate for the third quarter based on kind of some of the trends that we track?
Vincent Morales: Yes, John, this is Vincent. Very minimal of the latter, much more of the former, we did say oil move up, which pushed solvent higher than it has been in quite some time. We haven’t anniversaried some of the other increases we mentioned epoxy resins many times on the call in the last several quarters, will anniversary, the spike and epoxy resins in Q4. We still saw inflation and other cost buckets and then that was coupled with the logistics costs inflation that's been moving up all year. So we'll anniversary some of this in succeeding quarters, which will make the year-over-year comps easier. But it's still was our highest of the inflationary cycle.
Michael McGarry: I mean, I think, john, if you look at third quarter last year oil averaged about 48, this quarter averaged about 70, xylene was up 30%, propylene dependent upon in which region you are in was up anywhere from 23% to 45%. So, I think there's enough of that detail out there that might help you understand, what's the costs over quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year impact was.
John McNulty: Got it, fair enough.
Vincent Morales: I think, [inaudible] one more than, John. And I know a lot of folks look at things sequentially and we do agree sequentially things are flattening. But again on a year-over-year basis, which is our comparative picture here, we still had very stern inflation. 
John McNulty: Got it. No, fair enough. And then I guess just as a follow-up. On the U.S. auto platform, the high-single-digit growth seems to really kind of stand out as an area of some really above market type growth. I guess, is there a way to think about it in terms of number of contracts that you’ve won, or something like that? It sounds like you did display some players out there. So I guess, I’m just trying to figure out how much of it may be real, if there was a little bit of pre-buyers. How to think about that? 
Michael McGarry: No, it’s certainly not pre-buying. It’s -- some of it’s mix. So if you think about the platforms that we are targeting, we’re obviously -- there’s a big shift to the SUVs and things like that. So we’ve seen this trend coming for some period of time. So we try to be targeted on the right platforms. So that’s part of it plus we’ve done pretty well in our parts businesses. So what we’re painting there. So I think those are the two pieces.
John McNulty: Great, thanks very much for the color. 
Operator: The next question will be from P.J. Juvekar of Citi. Please go ahead.
P.J. Juvekar : Yes. Hi, good morning or good afternoon, I should say. Michael, Vince hi. It seems like company own store channel is doing well for you and for others in the industry. That store volumes have grown consistently at a better rate than big boxes. So why not get more aggressive in buying store chains? I think there are still quite a few left in North America?
Michael McGarry: Yes, P.J. as we know the best recipe for that is a willing seller. We have -- we’re a willing buyer, we’ve tried, but we haven’t always been successful. And we’ll continue to look at those opportunities where it makes sense. But we do see this trend continuing to do it for me is a trend that is not a short-term trend.
P.J. Juvekar : Thank you. And a question for Vince, Vince the cash deployment goal of $1 billion in fourth quarter on M&A and buybacks. But seems quite large, I saw your today's acquisition of SEM Products, but that seems small. So is it fair to say that the cash use is more geared towards a large buyback in 4Q?
Vincent Morales: Well again, I think as we said earlier on the call P.J. we do have several other acquisition potential targets that we hope come to us if the price is right, and hopefully we can get those done in the near-term and that would the governor of the share repo. Because of our ability to extract synergies from those acquisitions. Absent that then fly will would certainly be share repurchase. 
P.J. Juvekar : Yes, but the share repurchase still seem quite large compared to first three quarters. Is that fair?
Vincent Morales: Yes. Again, we've made a cash commitment out there. We're working up our leverage as you know, our balance sheet leverage. And we think our equity is not a bad purchase.
P.J. Juvekar : Great, thank you. 
Operator: The next question will be from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. 
Vincent Andrews: Thank you good afternoon. I’m just trying to reconcile, you have the refinish issue that you discussed a bit already. And then I think there also was a comment on aerospace and maybe volumes being a little bit softer in 4Q from an inventory management perspective. So what I am just trying to understand is that it's clear that you guys had a lot of price efforts out there and that's what you continue as you set into next year. So what's -- shouldn't there be -- is the incentive be the other way for the customers to buy more rather than less?
Michael McGarry: Well most of our customers and when they buy they put it on, except for refinish, if you think about a can coating line, I mean, they're buying and they're applying it. And if you think about an automotive guy, I mean, we deliver ours before they need it. Aerospace okay, maybe they do have a little bit of inventory, but by and large not a material kind of thing. So most of our customers are more just in time than you think. Refinish is the one major difference. So I think our customers are not going pre-buy if you will in this space. 
Vincent Andrews: Okay. And just as a follow-up, a lot of conversation in the investment community about rising interest rates and mortgage rates and slow in existing home sales. So it doesn't sound like you're seeing any meaningful slowdown either in the paint stores or in sort of your underlying DIY trends. How are you thinking about those dynamics kind of in the near to medium term?
Michael McGarry: Well, I think you have to look it on a regional basis. If you look in the U.S., those trends are going to continue. In Europe, they haven't ever really recovered from the 2008-2009 timeframe. I am encouraged a little bit that Europe is starting to see some construction moving in there. As you know, we usually are painting several quarters after the construction period. So a little bit more maybe some partial green shoots over there. Mexico is doing exceptionally well. And I don't think we have a lot of concern any other place besides Europe and Canada is a little slower than the U.S. obviously, but other than that I'd say we're pretty happy.
Vincent Morales: And Vincent I'll just come back to the U.S. If you look at trends again repair and remodel continue to be strong, commercial construction mix by U.S. region but generally solid new home as everybody in those is still growing, but at a very modest cliff. That would be the one that's probably more sensitive to what you're talking about.
Vincent Andrews: Okay, thanks very much guys. 
Operator: The next question will be from Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead. 
Don Carson : Yes, just a follow up on your company stores, you talked about high single-digit year-over-year growth. How much of that price how much was volume? And is company stores still an area where you're seeking further price initiatives you need the third company store price increase to restore margins to where they were?
Michael McGarry: So, Don, I don't want to get into this split. I will say that volume was better than price. But I would tell you we announced in October 1, price increase in our stores. And we'll have to push that through the channel. And then we'll make an independent decision at some future point in time on whether or not we need any further increases in that channel. 
Don Carson : And what was the magnitude of that price increase?
Michael McGarry: I would say it was in the 5% to 7% range. 
Don Carson : Okay, thank you. 
Operator: The next question will be from Duffy Fischer of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Mike Leithead: Hey, guys, it’s actually Mike Leithead, on for Duffy, good afternoon. Can you just talk about what you’re seeing in the protective and marine markets, obviously there was a headwind for some time, but it looks like the heat map is pretty green now for the second and third quarter in a row. So maybe just a little color on how that business is trending for you?
Michael McGarry: Yes, so the best thing to look at in that space is Clarksons. Clarksons had said that it’s going to be flat in 2018 versus 2017. And then they have projected a 20% increase in new builds in 2019, now it caution people that we paint to 12 to 24 months dependent upon the size of the ship after the starting. But that’s a good sign. The other ones, if you look at the capital projects for a number of our oil guides, their capital budgets have been increased. So that’s a positive you see Columbia their oil and gas business is getting better, U.S. onshore is getting better. So maintenance and repair for marine had held steady and in fact I would say it was probably up plus 10% the last quarter.  So I would say, as we’ve said in the prior two calls, that marine is bouncing off the bottom, we’re going to see continued improvement in that and protective we should see more investment in that space. So this should be an area of growth going forward.
Mike Leithead: Great. And then on capital deployment, you guys have typically talked about acquisitions and repurchases in two year increments. I guess when should we start thinking about new range of potential deployment targets on M&A and buybacks for 2019 and beyond?
Vincent Morales: We would typically provide more guidance about next year on the January call. 
Mike Leithead: Got it. Okay, thanks. 
Operator: The next question will come from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. In the quarter your SG&A expense was $867 million and in the previous quarter it was $941 million and if you look at it on average by quarter for 2017 it was $895 million. Now I know that you’ve cut incentive compensation, but can you give some indication of what your normal level of quarterly SG&A is, because the third quarter number seem so anomalous and low?
Michael McGarry: Well, Jeff, part of that what you’re seeing there is some of the restriction actions we talked about, we talked about $20 million of savings in Q3 alone. The combination of two programs. There is always noise in there around currency. So if you’re looking at it on an absolute basis currency is going to move it around quarter-to-quarter and our target right now and where we’re running right now, we still have more work to do with our restructuring. So I would hope this would be a high water mark given the same level of sales.
Jeff Zekauskas: All right. So then there is pricing, so one of your ten competitors announced earnings and I think its industrial prices were up 7% and maybe it's accretive prices were up 5%, which is very different from the levels that you guys have. And when you look at your gross margins through the years, they have degraded that is they began the year down 240 basis points and now they are down 340.  So -- and your absolute level of price year-over-year really hasn’t changed much from the second quarter to the third or even from the first quarter to the third. So what’s been going wrong for you in price, why hasn’t it gone up faster and why are your results different than some of your major competitors?
Michael McGarry: Okay, well first of all Jeff, what you’re referring to, the quoted price and mix? So I didn’t hear anybody ask them the question of would they separate out price from mix. I think that’s the first thing you probably ought to get an answer to.  The second thing is, if you compare our overall margins there as you would see that we still have a substantial higher level of margins than there. So, I would say it’s easier to jump over lower hurdle than a higher hurdle. And so that would be something else that you might want to look at. And then the other one would of course be mix. So I think those are all think about automotive business that we have and automotive business they don't have. So I think there is some questions in here that probably need a little bit more deeper understanding and analysis on.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay, great. Thank you so much. 
Michael McGarry: Thanks, Jeff. 
Operator: The next question will be from Kevin Hocevar of Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. 
Kevin Hocevar : Hey, good afternoon everybody. You talked about raw material inflation year-over-year inflation moderating here in the fourth quarter as comps ease a bit. But conversely on the pricing side, you are starting to gain a little traction here in the fourth quarter of last year, so comps get a little bit more difficult.  So you've been able to progress year-over-year pricing sequentially higher as the years gone on. So wondering how we should expect that pricing side of the equation to trend going forward? Do you expect that to continue the year-over-year growth rates to continue to get better or will we start to see that flatten out a bit?
Vincent Morales: Yes, Kevin I think you're right, we started to get in earnest to some pricing in Q4 of last year. So we do have a harder pricing comp we do. We are targeting more pricing across our whole portfolio. So our expectation is again, we're looking at this as a price raws gap and our expectation is to close the gap. And we do expect that to occur in Q4.  We think the comps again on raw materials are easier. And even though the pricing comps easier, we expect further pricing. We're not going to give out a specific number, but that gap will close possibly flip in here in the near future. 
Kevin Hocevar : Okay, great. And then on aerospace looked really strong, up I think you said low-teens in the press release. So wonder if you can give some color there. Is there share gains that occurred and just any color you could give there in terms of why the business is doing so well and your expectations going forward?
Vincent Morales: Well first of all if you look at the Boeing and Airbus builds, they are up year-over-year. Airbus builds were up 20% in the third quarter. Boeings were up 5%. So you have a strong base from that. Also we've been very successful in growing new transparency programs, so that's doing pretty well. And then you have the early signs of a military improvement, so that's also doing well. And then finally I would say because of our expertise in the aerospace business, many of our customers have assets to grow in managing their own raw materials we call it chemical management. And so they've asked us to help them there which has been share gain. So a number of these things you had the underlying strong industry trends, share gains as well as new product offerings.
Michael McGarry: And I neglected to answer a question from earlier about the year-over-year aerospace in Q4. We do expect more modest growth rates in Q4 in aerospace that's really on the backs of a very strong Q4 last year. So even though the growth will be more modest it stacked upon very good growth last year.
Kevin Hocevar : Great, thank you very much. 
Operator: The next question will come from Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. 
Arun Viswanathan: Great. Good afternoon, guys. Couple of questions, so I guess first off, just wanted to go back to the refinish issue. I guess what you're hearing from your customers is this that they just pre-brought a little too much and then they are destocking or is it the result of consolidation. Do you expect this to continue for couple of quarters or how long does this kind of take?
Vincent Morales: Yes, I think Michael, covered this earlier Arun. I'll try to give it a shot here just to give you a different voice. But we had a very strong 2016 and 2017 in the industry in terms of volume growth. We expected and our customers expected that to continue into 2018. First half of the year wasn’t as strong, but people bought and I hope that strong growth would materialize it hasn't. So our customers are settled with the higher inventory levels. One of them preannounced earnings alone so maybe a month ago. And so again we're seeing throughout the industry a lower growth rate than expected. This is two step distribution. So inventory buildup in the channel. And we expect that to deplete in a reasonable amount of time.
Michael McGarry: Yes, Arun, we just -- we see this as transitory, the underlying strength of our refinish business is very good. And we continue to have net market share gain. So, I have no concerns about this business long-term.
Arun Viswanathan: Okay. And just as a follow-up on the portfolio itself, you really kind of gone into several verticals over the last 10 years or so. How do you feel about the portfolio now? I know there's a lot of cross pollination of technology from auto OEM into other areas. But, do you feel like there are any other areas of the current business that maybe you're distracted from or potentially it's a lot of verticals, to manage? Any thoughts on that?
Michael McGarry: No, I mean, I think if you look at our businesses, there are a lot of things that crossover so corrosion is one, color is one, care is one. Those kind of synergies are hypercritical to being successful and it facilitates new product growth. When you look at our acquisitions, that because we're in all the verticals, we can look at acquisitions in virtually every space. So I think there's a lot of synergistic benefits from that regard. And because we do run on a business unit basis we have general managers that are hyper focused, laser focused on running their own individual businesses from the customer facing activities. And then we have a different group that manages of non-customer facing activities. So think about the IITs and finance and those kinds of things. So, we had the back office. So no, I think we are pleased with where we are and we're very optimistic going forward.
Arun Viswanathan: And just lastly, if I may, just on China, you referenced obviously slowdown in retail sales, some concerns around auto as well. Maybe you can just give us your thoughts on the evolution of the China market over the next couple quarters? Is there a hope that that would rebound and what would it take for that to happen? Thanks.
Michael McGarry: Yes. So I'm very optimistic about to China car market. If you look at the number of car park in China still very, very low compared to most developed countries. It's still an asset that is very important to up incoming middle class person in China own a car is status symbol that hasn't changed. Again it's a very important industry to the Chinese government. It's a huge employer of people as you know, employment is really important in China. So we're optimistic that this temporary slowdown we seek as a consumer confidence in the tariffs is going to moderate. And then it will get back on a growth track. So next year we're probably looking in that 2% to 3% range for China and it's the world's largest market.
Arun Viswanathan: Great, thanks.
Operator: The next question will be from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please go ahead. 
Laurence Alexander: Good afternoon. Two quick ones. I guess first when you did the pre-announcement, there was a comment about how Q4 margins would be roughly comparable with the segment margins last year in aggregate. Does comparable mean close to or near or was there another meeting intended? And then secondly, just to follow-on, on the discussions to talk us about price versus mix, to get the margins in industrial backup to 18%, the implied message I guess that you're trying to -- that you were conveying or maybe I misheard is that you plan to get there through price and innovation and value add not through bottom slicing and sacrificing parts of the volumes. Is that a fair interpretation?
Vincent Morales: I'll take the first one. And again, I think it's clear in Q3, the macro environment moved against us, and that’s reason for the pre-announcement. But with respect to Q4, I think your definition and ours is the same in terms of comparable. We certainly expect to be at or around the prior quarter, fourth quarter margin for the company in aggregate.
Michael McGarry: And Laurence, I'll take the other question. You're going to get back to peak margins sort of number of factors it's going to be innovation, it's going to be pricing, it's going to be efficiency, and it's going to be share gains because. Because we bring products that customers value more than their competitive alternatives. So I think it's a little bit of everything, but mostly focus on getting pricing through innovation.
Laurence Alexander: Perfect, thank you.
Operator: The next question will be from Mike Harrison of Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead. 
Michael Harrison : Hi, good afternoon. Wanted to go back to the architectural Americas and the company owned stores, obviously with good same-store sales growth going on there. Can you talk a little bit about the number of stores that you’re planning to add in the U.S. and Canada this year and maybe next year and then can you also talk about store growth in Latin America as well?
Michael McGarry: Yes, so store growth is regionally dependent, so in the U.S. we’re probably targeting in that 10 to 15 range, Canada would be in that 5 to 7 range, and Mexico it would be 40 plus. So, that’s -- and in Europe it would try be in the 10 to 15 range, typically what we look at. So again very regionally dependent. 
Michael Harrison : All right. And then wanted to also ask for a few details on the SEM Products acquisition that you guys announced today, maybe just a ballpark on what the sales contribution and margins and purchase price look like? And then also talk a little bit about the technology that it brings, it sounds like maybe some of those products are used for more flexible coating type applications in refinish.
Michael McGarry: Yes, so the technology is around repair of damage parts. And so it’s part of the paint, it’s what you do before you paint and so it’s highly synergistic with the paint. It’s an asset that we have thought after for a long time, we have been talking the owners, I can’t tell you how long has superior financial returns.  Just to put in perspective, the margins here are better than the Comex margins, we’ll give more details on this after it closes, but I would tell you it’s a wonderful asset, it will help continue to grow our business and because of the way our business goes through distribution and the way theirs goes we’re going to have some additional sales synergies on top of their current base. But I would say some of the numbers that people have out there on it are probably lower than what the reality is.
Michael Harrison : Thank you very much. 
Operator: The next question will be from Steve Byrne of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Stephen Byrne: Yes, thanks for squeezing me in. For two of the cost items that you provided some guidance on namely raws and freight and logistics. What fraction of COGS in the third quarter did those two buckets represent?
Michael McGarry: Freight and logistics for us is mid to high single digit percentages of sales depending on the business unit and I missed the first one Steve, what was the first, raw materials?
Stephen Byrne: The other buckets are just being raw materials since…
Michael McGarry: Steve that’s still around 75% of cost of goods sold.
Stephen Byrne: Okay. And then just to follow on to those is the primary driver of that inflation in raws, is it in particular chemistries such epoxies and urethanes over acrylics. 
Michael McGarry: Yes, you have everything, you have a proxy, you have TiO2, you have solvents, you have reactants, you have resins, MDI, TDI motions. Those are all impacting us. 
Stephen Byrne: And then just what fraction of your distribution is outsourced, and would you have any plans of changing that mix?
Vincent Morales: No, we don’t have change -- we’re not intending to change our mix of in source versus out source. 
Stephen Byrne: Thank you. 
Operator: The next question will be from James Sheehan of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.
James Sheehan: Thank you. Are you encountering any difficulties getting raw materials delivered in Europe due to the force measure in the industry caused by low water levels in the Ryan River?
Michael McGarry: No, those impact more the one step before us.
James Sheehan: Great. And then on your customer assortment issue you had a 280 basis points decline in the third quarter and that’s only about 180 basis points in the fourth quarter. Is that normal seasonality that you’re expecting and how should that trend in the next few quarters?
Vincent Morales: Yes, Jim that’s correct, the gap there in seasonality and in our next quarter call, the fourth quarter call we’ll give more guidance of what to expect in the first half of the year, we’ll take two more quarters to anniversary the loss. 
James Sheehan: Thank you. 
Operator: The next question will be from Dmitry Silversteyn of Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. 
Dmitry Silversteyn : Thank you for taking my call. Just wanted to follow up on the question on inventory correction in the automotive aftermarket business. What other businesses -- I know you've talked about some industrials, protective and marine automotive maybe not fall into that category. But outside of paints in North America and I'm assuming in other region. What are categories of your coatings go through a distribution channel or through a two-step distribution process where slowing market can lead to a similar pullback in inventories?
Michael McGarry: Well, very little guys through distribution a little bit in powder can go through distribution. Some protective coatings can go through distribution. But other than that not that much. If you think about, most of the people we're selling to were OEMs.
Vincent Morales: And most of our customers are hand of mouth Dmitry. And As Michael said earlier, hours or days is a large inventory level. 
Dmitry Silversteyn : Great. Okay, thanks Vince. And then just wanted to double check. You haven't been talk talking about the optical or specialty business within your performance materials or performance coatings business. Is that gotten folded into another operation or is it just become too small for you to even address it in the call?
Michael McGarry: Well, as you know our specialty coatings materials are a collection of four smaller businesses and they're doing quite well. And they're pretty much off the radar screen for a lot of our investors. So we don't spend a lot of time talking about it, but I'm sure John will be happy to take your call on anything particular in that area.
John Bruno: And Dmitry they’re in the Industrial Coatings segment. 
Dmitry Silversteyn : They’re in what, I'm sorry?
John Bruno: They’re in the Industrial Coatings segment. 
Dmitry Silversteyn : In the Industrial Coatings yes, okay. I'm sorry. And then final question your guidance of $1.03 to $1.13 on EPS, I mean, obviously includes a significantly higher tax rate than what you have been putting up in the first three quarters. And I'm assuming it also includes basically spending the $1 billion on share repurchase direct so a significant step down in share count as well.
Vincent Morales: Yes, if you look at the share repurchase again we haven't sized that and it's going to be governed by our acquisition capability. But even when you do share repurchases, I'm sure you're aware Dmitry from a calculation perspective you get a partial credit on your share count in the quarter you do it's modest partial credit. 
Dmitry Silversteyn : Right. No, I’m understand but I'm not sure I've already done them all it's not going to be the full amount, but I just wanted to understand if the range was the range because of the uncertainty of the timing of the share purchases or the range assume you are going to do basically the full $1 billion and then see where the operating conditions fall? That's all the questions I have.
Vincent Morales: Yes, thank you, Dmitry. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back to John Bruno for closing remarks.
John Bruno: Thank you, Denise. I'd like to thank everybody for their time and interest in PPG. If you have any further questions please contact our Investor Relations department. This now concludes our third quarter earnings call. 
Operator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen the conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. At this time, you may disconnect your lines.

Operator: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the PPG Industries Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Jamie, and I will be your conference specialist today. [Operator Instructions] Please also note today’s event is being recorded. At this time, I’d like to turn the conference call over to John Bruno, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.
John Bruno: Thank you, Jamie, and good afternoon, everyone. Once again, this is John Bruno, Director of Investor Relations. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG and welcome you to our second quarter 2018 financial results conference call. Joining me on the call from PPG are, Michael McGarry, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vince Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our comments relate to the financial information released on Thursday, July 19, 2018. I will remind everyone that we have posted detailed commentary and associated presentation slides on the Investors center of our website, ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide additional support to the opening comments Michael will make shortly. Following Michael’s perspective on the company’s results for the quarter, we will move to a Q&A session. Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements, reflecting the company’s current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG’s operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risk, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG’s filings with the SEC. Now, let me introduce PPG Chairman and CEO, Michael McGarry.
Michael McGarry: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by reminding everyone that we communicated on June 28 that PPG's Audit Committee had completed its investigation in the allegations of violations of PPG's accounting policies and procedures. We have filed restated financial statements for the fiscal years 2016 and 2017 and certain quarterly periods within those fiscal years in order to correct PPG's previously issued financial statements. The restated financial statements, additional details regarding these restatements and the findings of the investigation are contained in PPG's Form 10-KA and Form 10-Q that were filed on June 28, 2018. As you all know, PPG has been in existence for 135 years and has earned a reputation as a highly ethical and credible organization. I am disappointed that there was a need to restate our financial statements. Our Audit Committee and I are participating in the oversight of the remediation plan. As I said in our press release, we are 100% committed to take actions that are consistent with our ethics and values and fully meet the expectations of both internal and external stakeholders. Unwavering adherence to our core standards of financial integrity and honesty remains a top priority and a focus for all PPG employees. To date, we have made good progress addressing the corrective actions identified during the Audit Committee investigation. I am personally committed to ensuring that PPG will have a robust control environment and look forward to reinstating our reputation. As we have disclosed, we have proactively communicated with the SEC on this matter. It is PPG's policy not to discuss matters that are being reviewed by regulatory bodies. Finally, I want to share my appreciation with all our stakeholders for your patience as we have worked our way through this investigation. Now I will move on to our second quarter results. Today, we reported second quarter 2018 financial results. For the second quarter, our net sales were approximately $4.1 billion and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.90. This represents an adjusted EPS growth rate of nearly 6% for the quarter which included benefits from a lower tax rate year-over-year. The earnings growth we achieved was despite elevated raw material inflation and higher logistic cost during the quarter which we partially offset with selling price improvements and strong cost management. In addition, we continue to benefit from our ongoing cash deployment focused on earnings accretion. For the second quarter, our reported net sales were up almost 9%, while our sales in local currencies increased by about 6%. Supporting the higher local currency sales were volume growth of more than 3% with balanced contribution from both of our reporting segments. For the first half in aggregate volumes grew nearly 2%. Selling prices increased more than 2% in the second quarter marking the fifth consecutive quarter of improvement over the previous sequential quarter. While modest in overall magnitude in certain business units, we continue to decline some volume as we pursue higher selling prices and prioritize margin recovery. Foreign currency translation was still favorable year-over-year, but by a lower amount in comparison to the first quarter, as the U.S. dollar strengthened during the quarter against several key currencies. Sales were favorably impacted by approximately $90 million from currency translation and pretax income favorably impacted by about $15 million. We expect foreign currency translation to turn to a headwind in the third quarter based on current exchange rates. Looking at some of our business trends in the second quarter. In the Performance Coatings segment, aerospace coatings delivered an excellent quarter with slightly more than 10% volume growth led by above industry performance in the U.S. and Asia Pacific. Automotive refinish continue to grow organic sales by mid single-digit percentage supported by above market performance in all regions. Architectural coatings EMEA sales volumes were down slightly in the quarter, as consumer demands due and we are prioritizing selling price initiatives. Sales volumes in architectural coatings Americas and Asia Pacific grew at low single-digit percentage aided by continued strong organic sales growth in the U.S. and Canada Company owned stores. Volume in our DIY business in U.S. and Canada were slightly higher as sales to Lowe's continued albeit at a lower rate than the prior year. Also we benefited from a successful launch of our award winning PPG Olympic stain products at the Home Depot. Sales volumes also grew at our Mexican PPG Comex business including the benefit of opening an additional 52 stores in the second quarter. Protective and marine coatings sales volume increased with continued strong protective coatings sales in Asia. The marine business has stabilized at a low base and is expected to gain more traction in 2019. Our Industrial Coatings segment delivered solid organic sales growth of approximately 3%, which included continuing improvement in selling price from the previous quarter. Sales volume in packaging coatings were up mid single digit percentage as the adoption to our INNOVEL interior can coatings products continued. Selling price increases were also achieved. Automotive OEM coatings sales volumes increased at low single digit percentage and were similar to global industry automotive builds. This business outperformed the market in Europe and Latin America. As expected in China our sales volume increased by high single digit percentage, matching the improved industry bill rates for the quarter. We also continue to grow sales volume in general industrial business with above market growth rates in Europe and Latin American regions. In addition, our general industrial selling prices continue to gain traction in the quarter. From a regional perspective, for the company overall sales volume growth was the highest in the emerging regions. Sales in the Asia Pacific region were driven by strong growth in our aerospace, automotive refinish, and protective coatings business. Sales in both China and India grew at low teen percentage. Our China business met our expectation of a strong quarter after softer first quarter. Going forward, we anticipate sales growth in China could be more uneven as the recent uncertainties around trade policies and tariffs potentially impact economic activity in the country. Sales grew at a high single digit percentage in Latin America, supported by continuing outperformance by the businesses in Industrial Coatings segment and strong automotive refinish and architectural coatings sales volumes growth. Sales volumes were higher year-over-year in Europe. A mid single digit percentage increase in the Industrial Coatings segment was offset by slightly lower sales in architectural coatings EMEA. We anticipate that the Industrial Coatings business continue to deliver growth in third quarter as the regional industrial production remains favorable for a broader continued economic recovery. Sales volumes were also higher in the U.S. and Canada in the second quarter supported by strong sales volumes in our packaging and aerospace coatings business along with solid sales growth in automotive refinish business. From an earnings perspective, our second quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.90 was nearly 6% improvement versus the prior year quarter. Our earnings were impacted by elevated raw material and logistics cost inflation in the quarter including the impacts from elevated oil prices. In aggregate, raw material inflation was about a mid single digit percentage increase year-over-year and – cost and availability to transportation equipment were also higher the second quarter 2017. We expect both these costs to remain elevated during the third quarter. In the second quarter, we continue to make progress at our selling price initiatives. Prices increased by more than 2% on a year-over-year basis as both of our reporting segments realized higher selling prices. We have secured further price increases for the third quarter and will continue to prioritize collaborating with our customers on further selling price initiatives. In addition to selling price initiatives, we are making good progress with our efforts on raw material efficiency. As one example, we now expect to further reduce our TiO2 requirements by more than 1% this year. We also remain focused on aggressive cost management. Our December 2016 restructuring program is tracking to our targeted savings and in the second quarter we initiated a new restructuring program to help mitigate the previously-announced architectural customer assortment change and to further offset the inflation we're experiencing. This new program will result annualized savings of about $85 billion upon full implementation. In aggregate we expect these restructuring efforts to deliver between $45 million and $50 million of savings in the second half of 2018. In addition, earnings per share benefited from our ongoing cash deployment actions. This includes the impact of our repurchase of more than $450 million of PPG stock in the second quarter. In the quarter, average diluted shares outstanding were 5% lower versus the second quarter 2017. Our effective tax rate was 22% in the second quarter, which is lower than the 24% rate from the second quarter 2017. The reduction is related to recognizing certain discrete tax items in the second quarter and the tax reform legislation that was implemented at the start of 2018. We still anticipate a full year tax rate between 23% and 24%. As we look ahead, we still expect continued positive momentum and overall global economic growth. Our third quarter sales are typically lower than second quarter due to traditional seasonal trends and we anticipate normal seasonal patterns this year. The heightened uncertainty around certain recent trade policies could create uneven growth by region and industries in the second half of 2018. In particular, we are closely monitoring our business in China for any possible impacts. Currently the new tariffs are starting to add some modest cost to our raw materials. Based on the strength in the U.S. dollar in the second quarter, we expect foreign currency exchange rates to have an unfavorable impact to our sales in the third quarter. Based on current rates the unfavorable impact is expected to be between $60 million to $80 million for the third quarter. Specific to our businesses, we expect housing starts in the U.S. to continue to improve in the second half of 2018. We believe that U.S. regional automotive industry builds in the second half of 2018 should be higher than 2017 due to the natural disasters that last year impacted automotive production. In Latin America, we anticipate similar economic expansion as we experienced in the first half of 2018. Growth rates in Asia are expected to modestly decline in the second half mostly driven by uncertainties in China. We expect automotive build growth rates in China to grow in the third quarter but at lower levels than those realized in the second quarter. We expect economic expansion to continue in India after a very strong first half. Economic growth in Europe is expected to continue in the second half at a similar rate that we saw in the second quarter. Favorable in use market trends are expected to continue driven by positive growth in industrial production and automotive builds. For PPG this regional growth will be tempered by subdued architectural coatings demand. We will continue to manage all elements of our business within our control to ensure that we remain competitive regardless of economic conditions. Based on the current cost environment, we anticipate that our selling price and cost management initiatives will drive improvement in our Industrial Coatings segment margins by the fourth quarter 2018. As previously communicated our sales of PPG Olympic products into Lowe's have stopped at the end of the second quarter. As I mentioned earlier our launch of PPG Olympic stain products into The Home Depot has met our early targets and we are pleased to be working more closely with the outstanding team at Home Depot. We expect that the net impact of these customer assortment changes will result in reduced third quarter Performance Coatings segment sales of between 200 and 250 basis points and thus PPG's total sales of between 100 and 150 basis points for the remainder of 2018. With the actions we have already taken and plan to take in the coming months we fully expect to offset the margin impact of this net sales loss in the year 2019. We are continuing to invest in growth initiatives including targeting certain growth spending in the third quarter with plans to spend up to an additional $5 million similar to the second quarter. Finally, we ended the second quarter with about $1.1 billion of cash and short term investments which continues to provide us with significant financial flexibility. We remain committed to deploy a minimum of $2.4 billion of cash in 2018 on acquisitions and share repurchases as part of our previously communicated target to deploy a minimum of $3.5 billion in 2017 and 2018 combined. The acquisition pipeline in our industry remains active. We continue to be highly interested in participating in our industry's consolidation but will remain disciplined in our approach. We plan to continue to repurchase shares in the third quarter. This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again we appreciate your interest at PPG. And now Jamie would you please open the line for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Christopher Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.
Christopher Parkinson: Can you just give us a little color on the breakdown of the raw material basket and what you're currently leasing as well as your general outlook for the second half into 2019? And also just how you're assessing the potential to further raise prices in order to recover your margins? Thank you.
Michael McGarry: Well let's start with the easy one first. We have price increases announced in the second quarter and we are evaluating and will be announcing further increases as we speak. So that's the easy one. The pressure on raw materials think about propylene as a significant driver of that. So you have emulsions up. That's a significant one. Of course you got the fact relates up then you have the pressure coming from the higher oil prices that's impacting solvents. And then we have packaging cost are also up. And then my favorite of course is epoxy. So those are all ones that we're feeling pressure. The good news is for a number of these things we're taking actions. So whether it's a TiO2 or we're trying to optimize the formulas and I mentioned earlier 1% lower consumption packaging where we're looking at how do we optimize our packages, that one as well. So I would say those are the primary pinch points Christopher.
Christopher Parkinson: And then also I think we all understand why the focus remains on architectural volumes given recent developments. But can you talk about what you're seeing on a sequential basis in your general outlook for general industrial coil packaging? Just how should we should think about the growth there and also the margin contribution in the short and long term? Thank you.
Michael McGarry: Let me see if I can get all the business as you mentioned. Let's start with aerospace. Fantastic business. Terrific performance. I mentioned on the call that we're going to be up 10%, and we were up 10% in the second quarter. Strong performance across all the different platforms whether it's sealants packaging, transparencies, coatings, all of them doing well. Military is strong. Commercial is strong. And we see General Aviation coming back. So a very solid team performing at a very high level in that regard. General industrial the places that are I would say on the upper end of the range, so automotive parts are continuing to do well. Electronic Materials probably low-single digits, wood kind of flattish, coil doing well as you can imagine that's a strong commercial market, transco doing well. Appliance we started to see a little slowdown in appliance. You have the trade uncertainty the tariffs. So I think our appliance guys are going to be looking at this a little cautiously. I don't see demand change. But I do see inventory in the system working progress change. And of course, heavy duty equipment remains very, very strong. So Christopher did I catch?
Vincent Morales: And about last one is packaging. Christopher, I'll tell you this is Vince. Packaging business for us as I know you know has been a increase good performer as we introduce our BPA-NI technologies further. We continue to outperform the market up mid-single digits this quarter, market that's low-single digits. We expect that to continue. We're in the middle innings of a BPA conversion process. So we still feel there's good runway left.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.
David Begleiter: Michael on the U.S. and Canada Company owned stores, strong performance in Q2 also strong performance in Q1. What do the market grow either in Q2 or Q1 or combined? And how are you growing the market as it appears you are?
Michael McGarry: First of all, I don't know that we are growing anything, but at the market rate. I think if you look in our presentation where we have the heat chart you will see that where we color coded ourselves at market for U.S. So that would be my first comment. I think this trend of strong performance in the stores. As you know, this has been a multiyear effort to close the gap in that area. And the team has worked really hard to close that gap and we're getting price. The market is strong. And of course, the shift from DIY to do it for me is what's really driving why the trade business is outperforming the DIY business.
David Begleiter: And Michael and Vince just on the $85 million of cost. Can you break down between how much was allocated to Lowe's and how much is in this designed to offset the other cost inflation you highlighted?
Vincent Morales: David this is Vince. Walking around numbers certainly more than half close to two-thirds would have been allocated to support what I would call our not only our customer assortment change, but look at geographically our U.S. business. And the remainder would be rest of world. We won't break it any finer than that. But we are battling, as you know David, raw material inflation everywhere. So rest of world we're trying to offset that with pricing and the lever obviously is with efficiency and cost. And then again, the portion for the U.S. would be split between our architecture business and other businesses.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Roberts from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.
John Roberts: Solvents usually follow oil more closely than other raws. You mentioned propylene as well. In the industrial segment I think probably has more exposure to petroleum based raws. Is that the biggest difference of the different margin performance we have between the two segments this quarter? 
Michael McGarry: I would say that is certainly one significant factor. You got to be epoxies that are in there as well, and so when you look at the raw material basket. And of course, the other factor is, it's much more difficult to get price with our global large OEM customers. And although, we are starting to get it, it lags the other businesses. So we’re -- you can see how we in Performance Coatings side that gap has closed much quicker than the gap on the Industrial Coatings segment.
Vincent Morales: That said, John I'll just reiterate what Michael said. We're out with customer increases -- or excuse me, selling price increases to our customers in Q3. Certainly, a portion of those are pointed at our Industrial segment and the businesses within that segment. And then we're comfortable, we'll get traction with some of those certainly increases.
John Roberts: And then Michael I think you mentioned the new tariffs were having a modest impact on your Chinese raw material cost. What would be the raw material most sensitive to the tariffs that have gone in?
Michael McGarry: John for us probably the more sensitive and direct one is what we call tinplate. So you can imagine a lot of tin goes into paint cans. And so that's the one that we're watching most closely with respect to the tariffs that are announced.
Operator: And our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi from R.W. Baird. Please go ahead with your question.
Ghansham Panjabi: First off, on auto refinish and your expectation of moderating growth in North America. I think you called out lower collision claims and miles driven in the second quarter. Do you view that as part of the normal shift in the market during the course of a year? Or is there something more secular that concerns you?
Vincent Morales: Well, the miles driven is only up like 0.2%. And typically miles driven is more driven by the economy and employment. So this is a clear sign that people Ubering around and taking shared vehicles and public transportation and that as having a slightly, I would say, very modest impact on miles driven. Collision claims, I would say, is much more cyclical. So you should have less accidents during the summer than you will have during the winter. And, of course, we will start to see the impact to some of my favorite activity, which is hail, which doesn't hurt anybody but yet leads to a lot of opportunities for our refinish business. So that would be something that you'll have some offsetting that's a positive during the August/September timeframe.
Ghansham Panjabi: And then on packaging in Asia and the share loss that you experienced as part of your price increase initiatives. This business, in theory, has high switching costs. I guess, were you surprised at the share loss? Or was it sort of the coatings on the outside of the cans? Thank you.
Michael McGarry: Well, I would tell you that the - our Asian customers are willing to send messages much more frequently than our U.S. and European customers. So even though they are switching costs, sometimes they'll want to punish you. As you know, we've had five quarters in a row of price increases. So one of the reasons why our volume was up this quarter is people have stopped punishing in us. But in Asia that – some of that behavior still exists.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
Bob Koort: Maybe extending from that a bit, Michael, you had obviously very good volumes this quarter, two out of the last three. And I think you had suggested, maybe in the past, that the underlying demand was better but there was some blowback from the price hikes. It seems like your competitors now are playing ball or at least talking of the same more aggressive moves on pricing. So should we expect that we can see this in more GDP type volume growth in the future? Or it is - it's still too early to call?
Michael McGarry: Well, first, I think it's too early to call because we're going to continue to prioritize margin recovery. Second, I think, we're going to be a little bit hampered as we tried to explain in the prepared commentary that the impact of the customer assortment change at Lowe’s. But by and large, we do see more customers taking price. We see more of our – more of the market talking the same need, have margin recovery. So there should be less opportunity for people to shift volumes around to take advantage of, what I would call, salespeople who aren't paying attention.
Bob Koort: And could I ask on Europe. It seems like architectural trends there have been pretty uninspired for quite a long time. And I guess I always envision the paint market has been fairly constant, maybe low growth, but reasonably sustained growth. Why can't you guys get better volumes out of the European markets in architectural?
Michael McGarry: Well, again, I would say that's a little bit choppy. So we've done exceptionally well. If you go back the last three, four, five years in the U.K., we had a little bit of a setback in the Benelux when the people that were not maintaining the – there's a large rental market in the Benelux and they've kind of prioritize cash recovery for a while. Now they're back painting. So we do see fairly decent growth there. The Eastern Europe, I would say, is slightly better. The big challenge is, France is our biggest market by far, Bob. And retail is soft. And the one thing I would tell you is, I was just over there a month or so ago and I saw more cranes over in Paris than I've seen in a long time. Consumer sentiment is up. I've been joking with my friends over there, the French one, the World Cup, hopefully that will take them to spend a little more money. But we do have to recognize that there is some portion of our business that people have a choice at where to spend their discretionary dollars. And right now they're much more focus on experiences than they are in home improvement, unlike in the U.S. where you're getting a pretty significant return on your investment when you put your money in your house. So I don't - I haven't given up. So if your question is, have I given up? The answer is absolutely not. And the good news is we're doing pretty well earnings wise. We just need to continue to capture our fair share.
Operator: Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.
Frank Mitsch: And Michael that World Cup cuts both ways. I'd imagine that productivity was probably a little bit lighter over there over the past several weeks. I wanted to….
Michael McGarry: But I don't accept that excuse for my team.
Frank Mitsch: I certainly I could understand that it would not be applicable to a company based in Pittsburgh. I want to come at the pricing question just a little bit differently. You've got a string of positive year-over-year prices. I think it was like 0.1% 3Q, 2017, 1% in 4Q, 1.6% in 1Q, 2.2% in 2Q. Is this something that we -- and you've got pricing initiatives in place, so should we think about the order of magnitude of price is kind of accelerating here and we're going to be approaching that 3% mark? How do we think about the overall magnitude of price?
Michael McGarry: Well I do think price is accelerating. And I think that's a reasonable assumption to make. And I do think that there's more to be asked for and gotten in this marketplace. When we think about the logistics now we stack logistics cost on top of raw material cost. So our sales teams are heavily focused on that capture.
Frank Mitsch: And then also going back on looking at the lovely heat map, seems to be a fair amount more green on the screen now relative to last few quarters and a little bit less red. And I think you were saying that you're expecting end use market activity comparable to the second quarter. So understanding that seasonality takes it down from 2Q. But on a year-over-year basis, it seems like absent the issue with Lowe's that you're still calling for a pretty good volume quarter. Is that correct?
Michael McGarry: Well I certainly would like to see that. I'm confident that team recognizes the importance of getting price first. So I would say your conclusions are probably accurate.
Vincent Morales: And Frank I think our - as Michael said in our prepared remarks, we generally feel the economies around the world are pretty healthy. And we think there will be so in Q3, obviously depending upon global trade discussions. So right now, we're running at a fairly good clip in most of our end-use markets.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
Jeff Zekauskas: It looks like your cash flow from operations was down by about $250 million year-over-year for the first half. Is that roughly right? And are you going to be able to generate the same amount of cash you did last year in 2018? Or because of higher raw material costs that's too high a bar to reach?
Vincent Morales: Yes, Jeff I think your numbers are fair. The biggest cash use we have is the first six months of the year, even though our working capital as a percentage of sales is even with last year, our sales are up, so we actually have more working capital in terms of dollars. And that's by far that's the biggest use of cash year-over-year but your numbers are accurate.
Jeff Zekauskas: So, PPG use to generate much more cash than it did net income. And do your cash conversion over time this really come down where it's more or less equal to your net income. Do you have any targets or plans as to what your cash conversion should look like over a longer period of time?
Vincent Morales: As I think you're aware, Jeff the last three years we've shaved roughly 100 basis points off of our working capital as a percent of sales. And some of those years we were growing sales. So that was – the big contributor was the 100 basis point reduction. That's still our target this year. And again I think that will be a – that will allow us to grow our operating cash flow higher than our earnings to your point.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from VRP. Please go ahead with your question.
Kevin McCarthy: Your corporate line, under operating profit looks like expense decline materially in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis and that was the case in the first quarter as well. Would you comment on what's driving that and what your outlook is for future quarters there?
Vincent Morales: Yes, I'll comment on the difference and then John is probably going to comment on the outlook. So, Kevin we made a significant amount of effort over the past couple of years in some of our cost post such as pension and OPEC cost. Those have driven that corporate expense line down. In addition the past - this year and past year the incentive comp number for the corporation is also bit lower. And finally we did have in the first half of the year, positive intercompany foreign currency. This will be assets and liabilities between our foreign affiliates, obviously, our headquarter parent company when currencies move we have to take those intercompany balances and through them up $2. And in the first half the year for both quarters that was a positive. We do expect some of that to reverse as the currencies have flipped. And John do you have the forecast?
John Bruno: Yes, Kevin this is John. So for the second half of the year we'd be looking at between 75 million and 90 million for both quarters. Yeah, I think as you go into next year, I think the run rate will come down from 2016. So I think a lot of people have been looking at 2016 run rate. And through a lot of efforts but different actions whether it's benefits and pensions or through workforce reductions we have a lower base now. So I expect our run rate going forward to be lower as well.
Vincent Morales: And just for clarity the 75 million to 90 million is total for both quarters.
Kevin McCarthy: And then second question if I may relates to your new restructuring program of $85 million. What are the sources of those savings? And then I think you made a comment that you expect 45 million to 50 million in the back half of 2018 but I think that included year old program from December 2016. So maybe you can help us understand the flow through on the new 85 million and how much will be this year versus next?
John Bruno: Kevin, John again. So let's talk about the 2016 program. We have most of those actions are done. So now we're realizing the benefits. And that's working out to be a $13 million to $15 million quarter benefit. Per quarter that should sustain itself into Q1 of next year. The new program has started. We're going as fast as we can with the program. Probably be at a full run rate early 2019, but really a significant contribution as we get into Q4 on that program as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick Lambert from Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.
Patrick Lambert: Is the reception okay?
Vincent Morales: We can hear you Patrick.
John Bruno: It's just the French, Patrick.
Patrick Lambert: Yes, it's pretty far away from you guys. A few questions. The first one, I think your comments on EMEA did curve volumes but you somehow let go. If I heard correctly during the year, where do you think these volumes have gone if I may ask? First question. Maybe I'll ask the other question later following your answers.
Vincent Morales: Patrick this is Vince. As Michael said, we're prioritizing selling prices in the region over volume. There is a marginal volume that are going to folks who are not following the same philosophy as us and as you know, particular because you live in the region, that there are several much smaller players in the region than you'd find versus the U.S. market, so there are folks who are willing to take substandard profitability business.
Patrick Lambert: So mostly lower…
Vincent Morales: Correct.
Patrick Lambert: The second question regards again sorry, I could not understand completely the Lowe's impact how to model the topline of the lack of contract there in H2 '18?
John Bruno: Right, Patrick so this is John, so the 120 to 150 range represents the net impact so it would be the loss at Lowe's and the gains at Home Depot and it would be off of our expected revenue, total revenue for the company.
Patrick Lambert: And the last one, last question on industrial margin. I think it was a good 400 basis points year-on-year difference of EBIT margin. Is OEM as I heard the OEM is likely to be the largest contributor to that, but is there any big discrepancies between the other sub-segment of industrial that can explain that big gap?
John Bruno: We typically don't provide our business unit details below the reporting segment. Again as Michael alluded to, we have very large customers in that segment, global customers. They're typically good at deferring price increases. We're starting to get traction as you see in the numbers now. We expect that to continue.
Patrick Lambert: And so we expect the prices acceleration also industrial actually maybe more pronounced industrial?
Vincent Morales: We expect further pricing in both reporting segments, correct.
Operator: Our next question comes from Don Carson from Susquehanna. Please go ahead with your question.
Don Carson: Michael you mentioned that you saw industrial margins could be better year-over-year by Q4. Are you expecting gross margins for the overall company to be better year-over-year by Q4 or is part of that improvement in industrial also some of your cost cutting? 
Vincent Morales: Don I'm going to take this. For us we're looking at the reported segment margin which Michael has alluded to. That would include pricing actions but also the cost actions that John mentioned. So it will be accumulative of both of those to get us on a reported segment business on a flat year-over-year. 
Don Carson: So said another way overall you don't think you're going to get improvement in gross margin year over year until you get into calendar 2019 for the overall company? 
Vincent Morales: It's too early to call 2019 Don. We're tracking the Q4 reported segment margins flat and that would include some benefit from items below gross margin.
Don Carson: Okay.
Vincent Morales: We are totally focused on the second half of the year and getting this margin recovery. 
Don Carson: And a follow-up on U.S. architectural. Two questions. One do you need more price there given the emulsions continue to go up and solvents and packaging costs are going up as well. So you have a third price increase in the table? And then secondly you've been getting such good volume growth in your company stores is there any side to accelerate your expansion plans on the company storefront in the U.S.? 
Michael McGarry: So there's no question that there's raw material pressure in architectural U.S. And the other one is logistics cost. And that's not just from our D.C. our customers but also for our plans starting D.C. So you've got two levels of logistics cost in there. So we are actively evaluating the appropriate timing for that. We're not in a position that we can talk about that. But that is under active evaluation. As far as the store expansions we are selective in that. So we've added in the markets that we're best in. So I think about the Texas market that's an area that we've continuing to invest in. But we're selective on where we're doing that. And we will do that on an as needed basis. Obviously we're more aggressive in Canada where we're the market leader. And we're less aggressive in certain segments where we're far away from the market leader. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.
Duffy Fischer: First one just on Michael's comment on FX being negative $60 million to $80 million in Q3. Was that a sequential or a year-over-year number? 
John Bruno: Duffy this is John. That's a year-over-year number. 
Vincent Morales: That's a sales number. Sales number Duffy. 
Duffy Fischer: And then could you parse out the big buckets of raw materials. We've talked a lot around the different pieces and parts. But epoxy solvents TiO2 which do you see moderating in the back half and which do you see continued pressure operates and did get any relief in the next year in any of those buckets? 
Michael McGarry: Well I think we've talked about TiO2 moderating. So I think that one we see supply increasing in TiO2. So I think that's -- we're pretty consistent on that. The propylene one though is a bit of a concern for us. If you look at propylene in the U.S. it's up 28% year-over-year in the U.S. and 30% year over year in Asia. So there are still more pricing pressure likely to come through in anything that touches propylene.
Vincent Morales: And oil solvent derivative – the oil derivatives solvent your guess is as good as ours Duffy.
Michael McGarry: But WTI is up 40% year-over-year and Brent is up like 50% year-over-year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Byrne from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.
Stephen Byrne: Is there anything that kept you from being a little more aggressive about share repurchases in the second quarter just looking at the share price? I thought you might have been more aggressive. But perhaps it's a reflection of what you're looking at in your M&A pipeline?
Michael McGarry: Yes. I think you answered your own question. So we're always trying to keep our powder dry so that we can do acquisitions. And we're always looking at the pipeline we would prefer to do acquisitions. That's number one in our target list. But if we can't do it we're not going to let the cash sit on the balance sheet. So we're going to put it to work. So I think that's how we're looking at it.
Vincent Morales: And Steve we said all quarter the very active pipeline in the coatings space. There's certainly in our mind going to be deals done this year whether we're the one who tracks the deals are not or remains to be seen. We're going to be remain disciplined but it's an active pipeline right now.
Stephen Byrne: And on the inflationary cost pressures you've talked a fair bit about the ROS. But on the logistics side would you say that shift between those two is becoming a little more problematic on the logistics and transportation side? And does that, do you have the power to push price because of an awareness of logistics costs? Is it as challenging as it is with higher raw material cost? Or does this give you a little more support on pushing price?
Michael McGarry: Well, it's certainly not the magnitude of the raw material increases, right? But it's an adder. So if you think about high jumping let's add another foot to the high jump bar and all our customers are impacted by that. Some of them can argue, well, we don't oil we don't buy this and you should offset the raw materials. Well, I can assure there's no customer that isn't impacted by logistics increases. So that makes some of the selling argument that we have out there easier to sell because they can't deny that.
Operator: Our next question comes from John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.
John McNulty: With regard to the logistics, can you give us a rough idea of what that actual that nougat is for you in terms of percent of your either cost or sales just so we have a clue? And then how to think about how much it's up year-over-year?
Vincent Morales: Well, yes, again, a number we typically don't like to give out John. It certainly in the single-digits, call it mid-single digits as a percent of sales. We kind of give you some kind of guardrails. Right now, it's up a double-digit percent as most companies are seeing.
John McNulty: And then, I guess, if I think about the costs or the raw materials, I guess, and price, I understand it doesn't necessarily work on the margin percentages. But if I'm doing the math right on mid-single-digit cost inflation and 2% plus price, it looks like the 2 kind of net each other out. Are we thinking about that right? And then if that's the case, I guess, when you think about bucketing where some of the other headwinds are, how should we think about the bigger buckets and what the real pressures were this quarter?
Vincent Morales: If the two net it out, I think we'd be having a different dialog right now John. We're still climbing the hill to get the raw materials back with price. As you pointed out, we made good progress, good traction, but we still got more work to do. And then as Michael mentioned, we're stacking down on top of that freight. Some of that freight goes into the growth profit line so that might be another element for you to consider, but we have more work to do.
Operator: Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Please go ahead with your question.
P.J. Juvekar: So Michael, I think you mentioned that your reduced your TiO2 requirement by 1%, is that correct? And if it's true then, is that permanent? And just tell us how did you achieve that? And how much savings can you get from that?
Michael McGarry: So the first question is, it is permanent and it is how you formulate the paint. So unless you're a paint chemist, I'm not sure you fully understand the way we're doing it. But it is the spacing of the TiO2 within the formulation. So if you want more chemistry lesson I'll get you in here with our Chief Technology Officer. But the bottom line is, it is permanent and this is something that we're working on. We have a number of suppliers that supply us other raw material ingredients that are dedicated to helping us work on the TiO2 spacing, and you have the hiding as well. And so they are also working on the hiding. So these are all things that the team is working actively on.
P.J. Juvekar: I would like to talk to your scientist to understand that better. And then secondly, one of your competitors started TiO2 pass-throughs. Have you thought about doing either pass-throughs of TiO2 or any other raw material, which would reduce volatility in your business and maybe allow you to focus more on innovation?
Michael McGarry: So I guess, P.J., we have not seen that initiative. Any of these single raw material initiatives have not really been successful. What's more successful is if you tie a basket, where all the basket goes up, where all the basket goes down and then netting of that basket. And so we have a number of different pricing mechanisms with our customers. And they're all unique to the marketplace so that we try to work collaboratively with our customers to get the price. And some customers wanted in fashion A and some wanted in fashion B. and some wanted in C and D. So we try to be unique with our customers, but this single thing of like a single TiO2 doesn't typically work, whereas a freight surcharge might be something that would take some -- might be beneficial, but that's generally not the way we do it.
P.J. Juvekar: And I just have a clarification question of the comment earlier. You mentioned that you expect uneven growth in China. Is that more of a slowdown in China? And have you seen that so far? Or is that an expectation? Thank you.
Michael McGarry: No. We've not seen it and it's all going to be the tariff related. Right now through the first to whatever it is, 18 days, the sales reports that I’ve seen for China. They're having July very similar to the second quarter. And so we're just on the lookout for that. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
Vincent Andrews: So just two quick ones. Could you help quantify the extra shipping day from a volume perspective? How much did that help in the quarter?
John Bruno: Vincent it was - this is John. It was mostly related to Mexico and the U.S. And so specific to those businesses and probably total revenue 50 basis points or less.
Vincent Andrews: And just as a clarifying question, in the comment earlier was that you expect TiO2 to moderate in the second half? I just want to make sure you – are you saying that the pace of the increase is going to be less year-over-year or are you actually expecting the price to go down? Thanks.
Michael McGarry: I would say that it should be every moderate increases if at all.
Operator: Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.
Laurence Alexander: One quick clarification and one larger picture question. Can you just clarify, when you commented on the sequential trends will reflect normal seasonality, does that supposed to – is that remark about the segment trends intended to be before or after the Lowe's adjustment that you then break out. And secondly, a bigger picture question about the balance between pricing and productivity and innovation as ways to offset raw material pressure. Are there other opportunities to do a similar kind of blitz as what you've done on TiO2 at - on some of the other raw materials that you use to sort of materially change your input? And can we expect those same split between productivity and price as a way to get margin back to be sustainable over time? Or is it going to get tougher to keep finding new sources of restructuring opportunities?
Vincent Morales: So Laurence, I'll answer the first one and Mike will take the second one. The numbers we gave you with respect to the customer assortment change in seasonality, you should take the seasonality effect first and then take the map on the customer assortment change after that.
Michael McGarry: And just to make sure you're clear on that. So the second quarter, you have the big box of building inventory and independent of paint season. And now they had their inventory, they're going to go work through the inventory to see how the year goes as they’re – so they’re ordering less as the quarter goes on. In regards to the formulations, every year one of our scientists that's working on our formulations are encouraged to look at the total cost of the formulation. And so whether that's optimizing the TiO2, the solvent blend, the resin or how do they get more solid in a coating versus the alternative. All those things, packaging, how can they deliver more active ingredients in a package versus less? So there's multiple different ways to look at it. And we don't mandate only TiO2 where – looking at the total cost of the formulation.
Vincent Morales: And Laurence, just to your question on overall innovation. I think it dovetails -- the -- we have formulators who do this. That's cannibalization of an existing product. We preferred to be in certainly a much more raw material environment and we can their resources to creating new-to-world-type products. So this is cannibalizing from our ability to spend as much R&D as we would on innovation. We also have process or process innovation teams who try to allow us to produce this in a more efficient manner. So from a manufacturing perspective they work on that as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.
Arun Viswanathan: A quick question on volume. What would you say are the buckets that give you the most concern as to why you wouldn't keep this 3%-plus clip going? Would it be Europe, Asia or Latin America or -- and then maybe by business line, any areas that you're specifically worried about?
Michael McGarry: Well the first one is retail Europe will be the highest one. The next one would be Brexit. The next one would probably be, I would say the uncertainty around China. We're not seeing that yet. So it's probably a guesstimate at this point in time. But when I look at the other businesses I mean PMC is at a cyclical low. And so that's probably not going to get anything but better from this point on. Aerospace continue to perform well. Refinish continues to perform well. Surprisingly, the OEM automotive had a good first half of the year, slightly better than expectations. And we see no reason why the second half will continue. The only negative there of course is whether or not people were trying to buy ahead of the tariffs right, so we won't know that just yet. But we still see more transitions to our packaging of INNOVEL products, so there's still more gains we have there and our industrial business continues to perform well. I guess the main ones are China retail and Brexit.
Arun Viswanathan: And then I just had a question on price versus ROS. I mean, if we look back, this industry has done a pretty good job of recapturing raw material inflation and sometimes even pricing over ROS. It looks like now there was maybe an exacerbated lag maybe due to the M&A activity last year. But is there anything else that has changed structurally as to why it's either taking longer for you guys to achieve price or to offset inflation? Or is it that the volume picture is just weaker that your customers are pushing back more? Any thoughts on if there's been any larger-scale changes here?
Michael McGarry: No industry change. Clearly there's probably more people focused on cash right now. And because of that they're making certain decisions. For us, we're going to be in this business for a long, long time. And so we're prioritizing the margin recovery. I don't think there's been any change though.
Arun Viswanathan: And then lastly, on M&A. You discussed that there was likely to be activity this year. I mean, is there any heightened kind of aggressiveness on your part to be involved in that? With their private equity folks, are they dropping their return requirements and valuations? I mean, what would it take for us to see some more deals from you guys this year?
Michael McGarry: Well, private equity is really not a factor in this space. They can't match synergies that the strategics can bring to the table. So we do get outdated at times and that's a fact of life. We're going to remain disciplined. But we do know what's in our pipeline and we are certainly actively engaged with a number of people. The biggest challenge is what I talked about on the first quarter were the bid and ask had widened because of raw material inflation. So they're not getting their margins back and they want to get paid on let's call it their best 12 months in the last 36 as opposed we want to pay on the current performance. So that's what the bid and ask differential is.
Operator: And our next question comes from James Sheehan from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead with your question.
James Sheehan: On your auto OEM performance, looks like in most regions you were performing at/or above the market or in Asia Pacific you're below the market. And I'm not used to seeing that. What can you provide some more color on Asia Pacific auto OEM?
Michael McGarry: Yes there's two primary factor that drove that. One is we still having our numbers in Australia where there was still an operating plant a year ago. And then the other one is our share in Korea. As you know the Korean business is significantly impacted. And so that's it. If we drew our box around India and China we're doing very, very well and I have absolutely no concerns. So it's really those two factors that are driving that.
James Sheehan: And on the accounting investigation. You wrapped up your own Pro but then I think there's also an SEC probe. Can you talk about the expected timing of that investigation?
Michael McGarry: We have absolutely no idea what the SEC timing will be and we won't be able to share anything until it was finalized anyway. So we'll be totally transparent whenever we can be. But right now we have no insight into what they're thinking.
Operator: And at this time, I'm showing no additional questions. I'd like to turn the conference call back over to management for any closing remarks.
John Bruno: Thanks, Jamie. I'd like to thank everyone for your time and interest in PPG. If you have any further questions please contact Investor Relations. This concludes our second quarter earnings call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. We do thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

Michael McGarry: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported first quarter 2018 financial results. For the first quarter, our net sales were approximately $3.8 billion and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.39. This represents an EPS growth rate of nearly 4% for the quarter. The earnings growth we achieved was despite continuing an elevated raw material inflation during the quarter, which we partially countered with selling price improvements and strong cost management.  In addition, we continue to benefit from our ongoing cash deployment focus on earnings accretion. For the first quarter, our reported net sales were up almost 9% while our sales in local currencies increased about 3%. Supporting the higher local currency sales were increased selling prices of nearly 2%, marking the fourth straight quarter of improvement over the prior sequential quarter. Total sales volume increased modestly, but were negatively impacted by fewer shipping days in the first quarter 2017, lower European architectural coatings volumes due to harsh winter weather that caused several days of store closures during the quarter and lower U.S. architectural DIY coatings sales volumes.  In addition, we passed on some business this quarter as we pursued higher selling prices and have prioritized margin recovery. Foreign currency translation was favorable as several key currencies strengthened against the dollar, with sales favorably impacted by approximately $200 million and pretax income favorably impacted by about $25 million. We expect a slightly less favorable impact in the second quarter. Looking at some of the business trends in the first quarter, our Industrial Coatings segment delivered solid organic sales growth of about 2%, which included a 200 basis point improvement in selling price from the previous quarter. Organic sales volumes at packaging coatings were up mid-single digit percentage as the adoption of our INNOVEL interior can coatings products continued and selling prices increases were achieved.  We also continue to grow sales volume in general industrial and specialty coatings and materials, delivering our ninth consecutive quarter of above market growth rate, driven by strong sales growth in the Europe and Latin American regions. In addition, the general industrial selling prices gained notable traction in the quarter. Automotive OEM coatings sales volumes were flat consistent with the global industry automotive builds. We continueD to outperform the market in Latin America due to new business we received in prior years. In China, our sales volumes were modestly lower and in line with the overall industry, which was expected following the December expiration of the tax subsidy that was previously available in the country.  We anticipate China automotive builds growth both for the industry and PPG to improve in the second quarter. In the Performance Coatings segment, aerospace coatings had high single-digit percentage volume growth led by above-industry performance in U.S. and Asia Pacific regions. Automotive refinish grew organic sales by mid-single-digit percentage supported by above-market performance in Europe. Architectural EMEA sales volumes were down in the quarter, as I mentioned, impacted by fewer shipping days and harsh winter weather. This business has progressed their selling price initiatives working to counter raw material inflation during the quarter.  Sales grew a solid mid-single digit in Latin America with contributions from our Mexican PPG-Comex business, Brazil and Central America. During the quarter, we opened an additional 45 stores in Mexico and Central America. Sales volumes in architectural coatings Americas and Asia Pacific were flat and sales organic growth in the U.S. and Canada company-owned stores were offset by lower DIY and independent dealer network sales volumes. Our company-owned stores delivered their strongest quarterly growth in over 4 years on an adjusted day basis. Our PPG timeless products continue to be added to more Home Depot stores and had good in-consumer pull through the quarter.  Protective and marine coatings sales volumes were up -- excuse me, were flat compared to last year with solid protective coatings sales driven by Asia, offset by moderating weakness in our aggregate marine coatings sales volumes. Shipbuilding orders in Asia continue to increase, boosting the prospects of a recovery in the marine coatings in early 2019. This will begin to add 8 paint sales volumes later this year. From a regional perspective, sales volumes growth was the highest in Latin America driven by a market outperformance in the Industrial Coatings segment and strong architectural coatings sales volumes. Sales volumes were slightly lower year-over-year in Europe. A solid mid-single-digit percentage increase in the Industrial Coatings segment was offset by lower sales in the architectural coatings EMEA segment.  We anticipate that the industrial business will continue to deliver growth in the second quarter as regional industrial production continues to remain favorable for a broader, continued economic recovery. Sales volumes were flat in the U.S. and Canada in the first quarter. Strong sales volumes in our aerospace coatings business and solid organic sales growth in automotive refinish, general industrial and packaging coatings were offset by lower automotive OEM sales volumes, including the decline in regional industry automotive production.  Sales in the Asia Pacific region were flat with prior year as we experienced softer demand in China as our customers had a longer shutdown after the Chinese New Year. We expect stronger sales in China during the second quarter, led by higher automotive OEM demand. Sales volumes in India grew by low teen digit percentage with broad-based contributions across many businesses. From an earnings perspective, our first quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.39 was more than 4% improvement versus the prior year. Our earnings were impacted by elevated raw material inflation in the first quarter that while impacting most of our businesses had a heightened impact on the business on our Industrial Coatings segment.  In the first part of the quarter, epoxy resins, which is a key input for automotive OEM and packaging coatings, increased by more than 40% due to production curtailments in China. In addition, elevated oil prices impacted solid base raw materials and logistics costs. In aggregate, raw material inflation was about a mid-single-digit percentage increase in the quarter, which is on top of raw material inflation we incurred in the first quarter 2017. We expect raw material inflation to continue in the second quarter of 2018, but expect increases to current inflation levels to moderate.  During the first quarter, selling price initiatives gained momentum with our most significant sequential improvement since the current cycle of raw material inflation started a year ago. Noteworthy are the gains realized in our Industrial Coatings segment, which achieved 200 basis points of sequential improvement. We are continuing to work with our customers on further selling price initiatives focused on offsetting this persistent raw material inflation. In addition, we are making more progress in our efforts on raw material efficiency with more expected as we progress through the year. In addition to selling price initiatives, we are partially mitigating raw material inflation through continuing cost management. We reduced selling, general and administrative cost by about 140 basis points compared to last year, including good progress from our business restructuring actions. We have raised our targeted restructuring savings now to between $50 million and $55 million in 2018 from our prior guidance.  In addition, earnings per share benefited from an ongoing cash deployment actions. This includes the impact of our repurchase of $600 million of PPG stock in the first quarter. In the quarter, average diluted shares outstanding were 3% lower versus the first quarter 2017. Our effective tax rate was 23.5% in the first quarter, which is lower than the 24.9% rate from the first quarter 2017. The reduction mostly relates to the tax reform legislation that was implemented at the start of 2018. We are still anticipating a full year tax rate between 23% and 24%.  As we look ahead, we still expect continued positive momentum in overall global economic growth. We are closely monitoring and evaluating the possibility and ramification of new tariffs. Currently, we do not see a significant direct impact to our company, but any disturbance to free trade would be concerning. Specific to our business, we still expect better growth in housing starts in the U.S. during 2018. We believe the U.S. regional automotive industry builds will be relatively flat year-over-year. In Latin America, we anticipate continued economic expansion of South America, in particular for Brazil. Growth rates in Asia are expected to remain generally consistent with 2017 with continued industrial production growth in China. We expect stronger automotive build growth rates in the second quarter based on lower inventory levels and easier prior year comparisons. We expect economic expansion to continue in India after a strong first quarter. Economic growth in Europe is expected to continue, but remain varied by subregion and country. Favorable end-use market trends are expected to continue, particularly in automotive OEM coatings as industry build growth rates are expected to remain positive. We will continue to manage all elements of our business within our control to ensure that we remain competitive regardless of economic conditions. We will continue to execute on our 2016 restructuring program focused on reducing our overall cost structure. As we announced this morning, we will be launching our highly rated Olympics stain products in the Home Depot during the second quarter. Olympic has been America's most trusted stain brand since 1938. We're very excited to expand our relationship with the leading do-it-for-yourself retailer in the world. We will work closely with the Home Depot to optimize its success.  As mentioned in our earnings press release based on a change in customer assortment that we experienced in the first quarter, we are further evaluating our cost structure and will be diligent to and execute on any opportunities to reduce cost, which is what you'd expect from PPG. While we do this, we will not forgo our efforts and investments to continue our growth initiatives, including targeting certain growth spending in the second quarter with plans to spend an additional $5 million.  Finally, we remain in a position of strength as we ended the first quarter with over $1.4 billion in cash and short-term investments, which provide us with significant financial flexibility. We remain committed to deploy a minimum of $2.4 billion of cash in 2018 on acquisitions and share repurchases as part of our previously communicated target to deploy a minimum of $3.5 billion in 2017 and 2018 combined. Our acquisition pipeline remains active. We plan to continue to repurchase shares in the second quarter.  This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG. And now Jamie, would you please open the line for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question today comes from Ghansham Panjabi from R.W. Baird.
Ghansham Panjabi: I guess, first question on North American pain stores and the mid-single-digit increase during the first quarter. How does that parse out between volumes and price? And just given the ongoing weakness in independent dealer channel in the share shift in the home improvement channel, how are you thinking about your store footprint, I guess, more broadly in terms of incremental investments there?
Michael McGarry: Well, we had nice volumes and we had positive price, is the way I would describe that. We opened seven new stores in the first quarter, and that was despite, as you know, weather in the north continue to be exceptionally challenging as we closed the month of March. So I was quite pleased with our store performance.
Ghansham Panjabi: Okay. And I guess, second question as it relates to your comments on raw materials. I think you said mid-single-digit increase in the first quarter and some level of moderation as the year unfolds. But crude oil prices are up quite a bit. The curtailments in China have been in place. I guess, what's giving you confidence that you will start to see that moderation as the year unfolds on the cost side?
Michael McGarry: We still anticipate mid-single-digit increases. We will have increases in the second quarter and continuing. I think what we see, first of all, certainly, oil is up significantly year-over-year. So that's not going to change. Propylene is up in all the three regions, and that's up sequentially as well. Ethylene is the one thing that is down. So I guess, I'm trying to put it in perspective that Q4 was a very large number, Q1 was a very large number and we're going to continue to see significant numbers, but maybe not to the exact same significant increase that we saw in Q4 and Q1.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christopher Parkinson from Credit Suisse.
Christopher Parkinson: When we think about the Industrial Coatings segment specifically volumes, can you just take us for a quick walk-through to your comments on general industrial packaging versus your expectation for auto, not in the first quarter, but how you see '18 evolving and into '19? And then also just what's the best way for all of us to think about your ability to achieve price in the segment, once again, by end market versus last year?
Michael McGarry: Well, let's start with price because I think that's a really positive story. We had price in every single of our businesses without exception. We also see price coming in the second quarter as well in every single one of our businesses. So the traction has improved significantly because. As we have said, we're prioritizing price over volume. And that message is clearly received by the entire team in PPG. When you break it down into the various sub segments of industrials, so I'll take the Industrial Coatings first. Heavy-duty equipment continues to perform well. Electronic materials is a positive. Coil is a positive. Transportation is a positive. Our coating services business, because of all the wins they had in Mexico, they're doing well. So the one area of negative, of course, is wood. China is shifting from people painting in the houses to painting in the factories, and that has as a change in -- where it's happening in the marketplace as far as the channel that the product is being sold. So that's the one negative. When you look at packaging, that's been a continued success story for us.  Our new INNOVEL technology has been positively received and we're really pleased about that. OEM coatings, again, you have to break that down into regions. So the U.S., we went into the year thinking the U.S. volumes would be slightly down. As you saw, March SAAR was very strong at about $17.5 million. The one caveat would be Europe even though we see Europe being up, registration in Europe were more modestly down. Year-to-date, they're flat. But we still are very optimistic. We think it'll be up probably 3% in Europe. And Latin America will be strong, as you know, plus our share gain in Mexico. And then I was pleased when I looked at China. For March, inventories are in very good shape there. Dealer inventory and the lots are in good shape. The OEM inventories are in good shape. And March sales were actually up about 3%. So I think that's going to be good. Of course, India had an outstanding month.
Vincent Morales: And if I could add, Chris, the expectations in China for the first quarter were modest, as Michael mentioned in the prepared remarks. We were coming off a tax incentive that we believe pulled some business in the 2017. So we were again pleased with March stepping up after, again, a brief pause.
Christopher Parkinson: That's helpful. Can you also do a quick walk-through of your EMEA architectural business, specifically walk through in Europe. I'm assuming France is still weak. But what about the Benelux, U.K. and Central Eastern Europe on a sequential basis? Just any comments on growth and the competitive landscape would be helpful.
Michael McGarry: Yes, so the Benelux did pretty well. Got to remember, Benelux is a market that has a lot of exterior painting. So the fact that we had such tough weather in March is part of what dragged that down. But when you look at the underlying backlog of our customers, it's still quite good. Retail Europe is by far the biggest concern. Retail Europe is down high single digits. I'm sure you've seen some of the reports from some of the folks in that space. We did get a little cautious on the U.K. We saw some early signs of Brexit, but it's hard to parse out the Brexit versus the fact that they had snow in England, which never happened. So I think that's part of our concern. When you look at some of the Eastern European countries doing pretty, what I would -- I'd say hanging in there, they were more impacted by weather than anybody else. And then you come back to France as a country, our trade business did very well, actually, in the first quarter, but it was offset by the weakness in retail. So no recovery yet for France as a country, but we are in pretty good shape as far as the business.
Operator: Our next question comes from John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets.
John McNulty: With regard to the volumes, you had indicated there was some pressure around pricing where you were walking away when they weren't taking the pricing. I guess, could you articulate how much of the volume impact that was in the quarter?
Vincent Morales: Yes, John, this is Vince. Again, in several of our businesses, we saw marginal volume that we had, we thought we've had booked or had booked that with a lower price, went to somebody else. It's not quantifiable, but we definitely anecdotally and qualitatively saw that happen in several of our businesses.
John McNulty: Got it. And then just as a follow-up. Your corporate and legacy line. I think their original guide had been for $220 million to $240 million of kind of an expense this year. And I guess, you've revised it to a $175 million to $190 million. I guess, what are the major takeaways on that, that are -- that it's getting it as low as it is? I know you had been working on cost cutting all along. So that was -- I would imagine, that was partially in the original guide. So, I guess, what's the big change there?
Vincent Morales: The two biggest things that have lowered that number since we can provide any guidance. Number one, we did receive a revised actuarial information from our pension plan. I think, as you know, John, we've done a lot of work over the past three or four years to help immunize our pension plan and as actuarial information, which we do received periodically, but we received it after our original guidance. And it was a big factor. And also, we made some structural changes to our retiree health care, OPEB programs, that are rolling through. That's a pay-as-you-go process.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Roberts from UBS.
John Roberts: Could you talk about the range of price increases that you achieved sequentially? I'm guessing packaging coatings was up the most given the epoxy situation and perhaps the increases were minimal in weaker areas like European Deco or U.S. DIY?
Vincent Morales: John, we typically don't get into details by business. We did provide in the prepared materials the information by segment, which is our traditional reporting protocol. So I'd ask you to just refer to that.
John Roberts: And then I thought last quarter was a record quarterly repurchase rate for the company and now this quarter is 50% higher. How do we think about the pace of buyback as you complete the cash deployment targets?
Vincent Morales: Well, I think as we've said many times in the past, we don't provide our pace or type of cash deployment from quarter-to-quarter. We use a multitude of factors to determine what we're going to do with our cash, and those include our acquisition pipeline. And so we still are committed to the $2.4 billion for this year on both acquisitions and share repurchases and we'll honor that, but we won't give the cadence by quarter or type.
Operator: And our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citi.
Daniel Jester: It's Dan Jester on for P.J. So if I look at the heat map in your slide deck, it seems like there's a couple more end markets which you logged below market growth in this quarter, packaging in Asia Pacific and a couple of businesses in EMEA. So is that related to some of the business that you walked away from because of margins? Or there's something else going on those markets that we should be aware of?
Michael McGarry: No, you hit the nail right on the head. As you can imagine, epoxy prices were up significantly. And we were raising price, and we wanted to get value for the market-leading technology we provide. And if we didn't get it, we were aggressive in saying then see if you can find your coatings needs from somewhere else.
Daniel Jester: Okay. And then logistics cost is something that's come up a bit, not just for yourself, but for other players in the industry. I'm wondering, is there anything that you can do with regards to your own production plan to help optimize or limit your logistics cost? Or is that just another line item data that eventually you need to pass longer customers and get them to pay for?
Michael McGarry: Well, we are always looking at our manufacturing footprint. That's a constant item. And so we are looking how we can continue to optimize that. But as you know, especially here in the U.S. and it's not just the U.S. had problem, but there is less trucking availability and availability of trucks on a short notice is also a challenge. So if you need something short then you need to pay more or you don't get it. So that's a challenge for us. But as you know, that's not nearly as big a promise to what we have with epoxies, emulsions, TiO2 and some others.
Vincent Morales: But we are working on our customers on both of these categories with respect to selling price.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from VRP.
Kevin McCarthy: Would you comment on the timing of the rollout of Olympic stain across the 2,000 stores at Home Depot and perhaps characterize the size of that when as you work to backfill the foregone sales at Lowe's?
Michael McGarry: Yes, Kevin, I think it's up to Home Depot to tell you when it gets in their stores. What we did put in the release is that we are shipping and it will be a second quarter event. So that's a real positive. The other thing is how quickly they responded within two days of the announcement from the other big box retailer. We were in Atlanta mapping out plans jointly. And that was a brand that they valued for a long time. And jointly, we're going to work very hard to make this a success. So I think the way to think about the overall sales dollars, though, is when you think about any big box, pain is always bigger than stain and Home Depot is always bigger than Lowe's. So I'll let you kind of do that. Now what you have to remember is there was product already in Home Depot, and so they'll have to work their way through that product and work their way into ours. So there is some of that timing issue that you'll have to factor in. So our sales in 2019 will be significantly bigger than 2018.
Kevin McCarthy: And then as a second question, I wanted to come back to your price contributions. You've seen some nice acceleration there over the last couple of quarters. Michael, as you look at the balance of the year, do you think you can sustain this level of price contribution for the overall company, accelerate from here? Does it tail off at some point because you get to harder comps? How should we think about the cadence of those contributions this year?
Michael McGarry: No, the traction is getting better and we will have more to come. You have to remember, we typically like to be 6 to 9 months behind the raw materials. We're a little bit later than that now. So we have more to catch up. So we're still, even with the nice traction, we still have to do a better job in this area. And so you're going to expect to hear us talk more about price gains in the next quarter as well.
Vincent Morales: Kevin, you're right. Back half of the year of 2017, we did see some modest price traction. That went back to year-over-year numbers. But on absolute basis, we're continuing to pursue higher pricing.
Operator: Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Securities.
Frank Mitsch: Let me ask Kevin's question a different way. Where do we stand right now second quarter to date in terms of price increases that you've been able to achieve relative to Q1?
Vincent Morales: Frank, our expectation is that's going to be higher year-over-year than we saw in Q1. So we again, we saw in Q1 1.6% selling price increase. Again, everyone of our businesses where we think we'll be tracking higher in Q2, we're not going to quantify that. But again, it should be higher than we saw in Q1 on a year-over-year basis.
Frank Mitsch: All right, terrific. That's helpful. And then I did notice your net debt-to-EBITDA went up to 1.5x at the end of Q1. Where is your comfort level? Where should we be thinking about your targeted leverage ratios?
Vincent Morales: Yes, Frank, Vince again. Yes, we did borrow approximately $1 billion in Q1. We like the interest rate at the time when we borrow that all in. It's about a 3.6% interest rate. We certainly have a lot of financial flexibility and a lot of balance sheet capacity. As an industry and as a company, the coatings industry can support a much higher leverage ratio than we have today and we're not going to put a quantification of that. But if we find the opportunities, we will certainly exercise the balance sheet within reason and our only biggest criteria would be to remain investment-grade.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.
David Begleiter: Michael and Vince, when will selling price increases fully catch up to these higher raw material costs, which quarter, is it Q2, is it Q3?
Michael McGarry: I think the back half of the year, David, is probably the most likely scenario. As you know, this is not a perfect science. Every day, every sales rep in the world for PPG is talking about price and has their own deliverables on that. But I would definitely say the second half, the last half of the year is it.
David Begleiter: Very good. And Michael, just on volume after the soft numbers in Q1 for variety of reasons. Can we get back to, let's say, 2% volume growth in Q2 year-over-year do you think?
Michael McGarry: So as I told you on the fourth quarter call, the 3%, we don't want to draw a line, use the one data point. We saw the one less selling day in the first quarter, so we were trying to be a little cautious. We obviously did not predict the tough weather. April hasn't started out very well from a weather standpoint in the U.S. So that will have some moderation on it. But the customers all have strong backlogs. When we talked to our big contracting customers, they really are bullish on the year. So I would say that we should be closer to your number than our first quarter number.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs.
Christopher Evans: This is Chris Evans on for Bob. Just wanted to check in and see if you're seeing in different product categories that your peers are as committed as PPG has been to pricing. Any specific product categories or maybe you're not seeing the same disappointment that you guys are expressing.
Michael McGarry: Well, I think the only way to answer that question is our comment where we said that we'd walk away from some business. So every company has to make their own independent decisions. And so PPG has made their decisions. And you probably are better off asking our peers about their own independent decision.
Christopher Evans: Great. And then maybe just talk a little bit about the product line rearrangement that happened earlier in the year. Maybe just if you could deconstruct maybe what happened there, it seems like that came as a bit of a surprise. And then I'd be curious to hear opportunities where you might be able to shift those architectural gallons that we haven't seen yet. And then maybe lastly as part of that, do you expect the Home Depot new product launch to be EPS positive in this year? Or is there any additional costs associated with that?
Vincent Morales: Yes, Chris, Vince. I'll try to take at least the first part of that question. With respect to the customer assortment change, I'd simply classify that as a customer -- the customer made the decision that we certainly were disappointed with. But certainly, any customer's decision to select our product or somebody else's product and if you need any more information, you certainly would need to inquire with that customer. I think your last question, Michael is going to answer the middle one. I think your last question on Home Depot is certainly, our intention is for that to be accretive in Q2 and in succeeding quarters. As you know, Q4 is a light quarter, especially for stain. So that one, we'll have to see what the customer pull through is as we will in Q2 and Q3. But given the volumes in Q, we expect hopefully to achieve in Q2 and Q3, we'd expect that to be accretive.
Michael McGarry: Yes. I think as far as the volume, I think, I covered that earlier. Home Depot is 100% behind this. And you'll see when they start to put in the store the type of assortment and type of highlighting of the product. But again, that's really for them to comment on.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.
Jeffrey Zekauskas: There was $15 million other income net benefit in the quarter. What was that?
Vincent Morales: Jeff, we had about a $7 million charge last year for one of our legacy items for a plant we no longer operate and haven't operated for quite some time. And we had a -- we had an equity investment that started in Q2 of last year. It may have been early Q3 that had equity income. Those 2 items combined comprise the delta.
Jeffrey Zekauskas: Okay. Second, you've been trying to raise prices in the industrial area for roughly a year and you're now up 1% and you have rising raw material cost. They're rising much faster than 1%. Can you diagnose what happened in Industrial Coatings that's really led to the slowness and successful price realization?
Michael McGarry: Jeff, I think that really boils down to several factors. The first one is people have got to see that it's sustainable raw materials and maybe last year-end, they weren't thinking that it was quite as sustainable. So that may have affected how some people are thinking about that. The second thing I would say is we had some of our peers who had publicly stated they were going after volume. So that naturally impacts the ability to get price. And then, third, our industrial customers are very large and very sophisticated and it has historically worked this way every time. We get price in industrial after we get price in the Performance Coatings segment. The good news is we're starting to get it in every business, that includes automotive. And that also includes the very large OEM industrial customers as well. So I'm disappointed it's taking this long, but the pace of which is coming is apparent and the teams are doing a much better job.
Operator: And our next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn from Longbow Research.
Dmitry Silversteyn: Just revisiting the European situation particular with respect to paint. If you sort of exclude the impact of weather, and obviously, it's been a big problem for the region in the first quarter. How would you sort of characterize the overall market fundamentals with respect to construction spending, remodeling activity? Anything going on there that the weather elements have hit in the first quarter that should become more apparent as we get into the mid of the painting season?
Vincent Morales: Hey, Dmitry, Vince. Again, I think you classified it properly. Our visibility on a lot of that is fairly opaque given the weather situations. I think the one trend Michael called out which was visible throughout the quarter was lower -- the lower retail sales and especially in the home centers throughout the region. So that's the one item we can say we have some comfort is the trend. And we also did see just some generally lower in the U.K., not paint specific, we saw some generally lower retail overall sales, which again maybe the early or middle effects of Brexit. But beyond that, it's really hard to decipher what's going to occur throughout the paint season.
Dmitry Silversteyn: Okay. In terms of the Olympic product that you're getting into Lowe's, I mean, into Home Depot. It's good to see that you guys are able to benefit that quickly from the fill-in in the second quarter. One of the businesses that Home Depot lost obviously was interior paint -- interior stains as well. Is there a kind of -- sort of future announcements possibly coming from you in Home Depot on that? Do you have a drop-in product? Or is that something that you're working on? Can you give us some visibility or perhaps something that we can look forward to?
Michael McGarry: Well, I can't give you any visibility on that. Obviously, Home Depot is very interested in having competitive products. They were and continue to be the largest seller of interior stain and they fully expect to be, in the future, the largest seller of interior stains. So they've set that objective and how that plays out in the future when we have that clarity, we will be happy to share it with you.
Dmitry Silversteyn: Got it. And then final question, just on the overall automotive OEM market. It sounds like we're getting a little bit better results out of China and the U.S. SAAR as you mentioned, were perhaps a little bit stronger than expected. Europe is expected to grow. As you look at the business right now for the balance of the year versus how you look at it at the beginning of the year, would you say that your overall sort of impression of what the industry growth would be has gotten a little bit better? Or is it still fairly kind of low to no growth environment?
Michael McGarry: No, I would say I'm marginally more positive. But whether you're going to be able to pick that up is -- whether that's going to be material or not is not known. But I would tell you, it's put a nice, solid floor on anything that may happen. So I would say I'm marginally more positive.
Vincent Morales: And Dmitry, just as Michael mentioned earlier, we're pleased with the inventory positions in the U.S. The industry inventory positions in the U.S. and China coming into what is typically the highest selling seasons in the U.S.
Operator: Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer from Barclays.
Patrick Fischer: First one is, can you just shed a little bit of light on the accounting issue in your comfort level that kind ring-fencing it at that small $5 million level?
Michael McGarry: Okay, Duffy. So first of all, I'm so thankful that this was brought forward as we are finalizing our earnings report. As you know, at PPG, we hold ourselves to a very high standard of business and professional conduct. Our reputation for being ethical and respectful company is a competitive advantage. We believe it's our responsibility and commitment to ensure the long-term success of our company. And that benefits all our stakeholders, whether it's customers, shareholders, employees, suppliers or neighbors. We take this matter very seriously. We're conducting an investigation concerning these potential violations. The Audit Committee is comprised of independent directors of the company's Board of Directors, and they're overseeing it with the assistance of outside counsel. We're not able to predict the timing of the outcome. All I'm saying is that the investigation is ongoing. I'm sorry, I can't provide any additional information at this time.
Patrick Fischer: No, fair enough. And then second one, the Ford City judgment that hit a couple of papers yesterday. Is that meaningful? And if it is, what's kind of the timeline of how that will play out?
Michael McGarry: Well, first of all, the judge said that the other party was not responsible. So that's the first thing. So that was what the court case is about. Second, we have been working with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection on this issue for 10 plus years. We are in very good shape with them. We have a very good remediation. And we have, I would say, as far as you and as an investor were concerned, this will not be a meaningful issue.
Patrick Fischer: Okay, perfect.
Michael McGarry: And the other thing I'd say is our current actions are protected with the Human Health and Environment, just to be -- so everybody is clear.
Operator: Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.
Laurence Alexander: Two quick ones. First on the general industrial and packaging outlook comments, where you say it's similar to Q1 in terms of the year-over-year volume growth. If Q1 had the tough comparisons in Asia, what is the comparable offset that makes Q2 similar to Q1? And secondly, in terms of productivity, where do you still see areas for significant products [indiscernible] gains given how many years you've been pushing staff on that?
Vincent Morales: Yes, Laurence, I'll take the first one and I think Michael will probably take the second one. I think i heard you your question was with China -- hard comp in China in Q1. I think it was actually coming out of Q4, we expected softness because of a buy ahead, as the tax incentive expired, I would say Q2 last year was a traditional quarter. Q4 of 2017 was the one we thought there will be a buy ahead. So again, I would say the comps for Q2 in automotive China would be normal.
Michael McGarry: And Laurence, in regards to your question about cost. As you know, this is a never ending quest for PPG to get more efficient. And so we're always looking at our manufacturing footprint. As you know, we have gotten other acquisitions in the past 12 months. And so that means that there's other labs that are overlapping, other plants that are overlapping. So we'll be working hard to get those things out. So I don't think that we're ever going to stop in this area. So and plus I think we will be looking at how we reposition our architectural U.S. business with the announcement of the customer assortment change that was detailed earlier in the quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.
Vincent Andrews: Maybe you could just give us an update on what you're seeing out there in the M&A environment. I know you guys have your eyes on a variety of things over the years. Is there anything changing about those conversations with those targets? I'm going to assume based on the size of your repo in the first quarter, that you're not close on anything material. So just thoughts on where all that sits would be helpful.
Michael McGarry: Yes. So the biggest challenge we have right now, Vincent, is the fact that when you're trying to buy somebody who's earnings are going down, they want to look backwards to what they were doing 12 months ago and we want to look at either what they're doing today or what they're going to do in the next quarter. And they want to get paid on what their business used to be. And of course, we're going to be the ones that will be improving it. So I would say the conversations right now are a little bit more challenging. We have a very healthy number of people we're talking to. In fact, we had a new one flying in last week. So I would tell you that the pipeline is still there. But as you can see by our Q1 response, we're going to moderate our, I mean, our purchases of shares basis our pipeline. And we've always preferred acquisitions over share repurchases. So we're going to continue to look hard at acquisition. But if we can't do them, then we'll buy back stock.
Vincent Andrews: Okay. And just a follow-up on the logistics cost comments from earlier. I might have missed this if you commented on it before. But is trucking a part of the issue of what's going on with driver hours and things like that or is that not -- is it just fuel expense?
Michael McGarry: No, it's trucking. A, it's availability. And B, when they don't show up then sometimes you have to ship LTL to keep your customer going. Because we have so many customers that run just in time. So then that ratchets up the cost to serve that customer and during that period of time because of the lack of availability. So you have two factors going on.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Sison from KeyBanc.
Michael Sison: EPS growth was up in the first quarter, and it sounds like your general economic outlook is positive. Pricing is starting to take some place. So when you think about EPS growth going forward, does it get better in 2Q? And to what degree? And trying to gauge your confidence in generating better EPS growth this year versus last year in total.
Vincent Morales: Yes, Mike, as you know, we don't give guidance, long-standing practice of ours. And I'd tell you that the elements to look out for as we go into Q2, we try to give you some anecdotal information on which is we're still seeing raw material inflation. We hope to offset a little more of that with price. The volumes in architectural, as Michael mentioned, leased early in April are more reminiscent of March than they would be off a better weather season. And other than that, emerging region growth looks good. So I think we're hoping a higher volume number, as we said earlier, higher price number, but we're still battling with inflation.
Michael Sison: Got it. And then it sounds like that you may still have to walk away from some volume in 2Q to get some of the pricing. And is that the case? And what would the impact be on volumes if you do have to continue to do that?
Vincent Morales: Again, I'll reiterate what Michael says that our priority is margin recovery. I would say there will be no more incremental impact than we saw in Q1 in the second quarter as we continue to work with our customers on pricing. And again, I think we'll see the same situation where certain customers will move to a lower price without us.
Operator: Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets.
Arun Viswanathan: Just a question, if I could, on that same question I'll ask a little differently. Do you expect to be kind of caught up margins in industrial maybe Q3 or Q4? Or are you still going to be lagging year-over-year?
Michael McGarry: I think it'll be hard to get there in Q4, but that's currently our target.
Arun Viswanathan: Okay. And then in the past, I guess, you had mentioned that potential inflection point could be improvements in Europe, and that will be maybe the best opportunity for you guys to start growing again. Maybe you can just help us understand if that's still the case and any other kind of signpost that we should be looking for as to see an improvement or anticipated improvement in your businesses?
Michael McGarry: Well, I think when I walk around the world with some of my commentary, Mexico, even with the challenges with the election, is still going to be a good market for us. We saw Brazil getting better. That's -- so Latin America is going to continue to grow. You saw that China GDP number was 6.8%, if I remember right. It was a good, solid number. So that's a positive. I talked about India being up basically double digits. And so another positive, obviously, would be if we could get this whether behind us and look at our industrial businesses as well in Europe. I mean, we dropped 35% or 40% of any sales growth in Europe down to the bottom line. So I would say that Europe still has a very positive outlook and we're well-positioned with our customers, and the team is performing well in a difficult environment.
Vincent Morales: And I'll just append to that, Arun, that we did see -- we did continue to see in Q1, even despite again some harsh weather conditions, very solid growth in our industrial segment in Europe. And as we said many times in the past, typically, the segment that leads a region into growth. So we still remain optimistic, but that's a potential outcome in the near future.
Arun Viswanathan: Great. And then just last one, if I could. Just on the M&A side. Understanding that the businesses want to get full value for potentially depressed earnings. I mean, do you think that could change? And if not, why not get more aggressive with price on some of these deals? I mean, if M&A is the preference because it would seem that from a long-term perspective, the M&A still probably is a higher return on capital use of that than buybacks?
Vincent Morales: You're exactly right, Arun. We will be as aggressive on price as the outcome of the return dictates. We want to be prudent with our acquisitions. We are preferential on them when they have a good return and we're not preferential on them when they don't. So again, I think we're going to be prudent, but I do think you hit the nail on the head with respect to what we're looking at, which is what's the return on the potential acquisition itself, which would certainly be dictated by the purchase price.
Operator: Our next question comes from Don Carson from SIG.
Donald Carson: Question on architectural. Last year, TiO2 was your raw material that went up the most. This year, it shifted more to industrial side. But, A, do you still see TiO2 growing up of this year as much as your mid-single-digit overall raw material basket increase projection? And two, if you look at TiO2 and emulsions, is there a need for a third price increase in your U.S. company stores to keep margins growing?
Michael McGarry: So let's take the TiO2 question first. Supply and demand is what drives TiO2 pricing. And I would say that, clearly, when people report all their earnings across Europe and other place, you'll see that demand will be weak, in our opinion. And so we're going to be fighting for rollover type pricing in TiO2 because we think that's reflective of supply and demand. So we'll wait and see exactly how that all turns out because, as you know, we fight the last day on any price -- taken any price increase. But as far as emulsions, that's driven by a number of factors, propylene being the biggest one. And sequentially, we see that it's likely to be heading south in this regard, which should lead us to an opportunity to try to get some lower pricing in that regard. It's too early to speak that way, but that's certainly our expectations. As far as needing more price, I will tell you that we're aggressively capturing price within that segment now and we haven't gotten everything we want to date. So let me focus on getting that done first.
Donald Carson: Then, Vince, a housekeeping follow-up. You mentioned an accounting change the last -- on the last call that would hurt gross margins by 50 to 100 basis points. Did that turn out to be the case? And would you expect that to be recurring for the full year?
Vincent Morales: Yes, we adapted the new guidelines with respect to revenue recognition. Those numbers are still valid, Don. And again, that's adapting the new GAAP guidelines.
Operator: And our next question comes from Steve Byrne from Bank of America.
Ian Bennett: This is Ian Bennett on for Steve. Do you expect SG&A expense to decline or increase in 2018?
Vincent Morales: Well, again, our first quarter, we were down 140 basis points in SG&A. We continue to be very active in controlling our costs. As Michael alluded to earlier, we're assessing situation with the customer assortment loss and we'll react to that as well. So I think our projection would be for that to continue to be lower. I won't give you a specific number, but we're definitely working on productivity initiatives, as Mike alluded to earlier.
Ian Bennett: Okay. And just a follow-up on the gross margin. Did I hear that correctly that gross margin, the expectation is for not positive year-over-year growth until the fourth quarter or 2019?
Vincent Morales: I think the question that Michael answered was around the industrial segment margins. And those are the ones that would be challenged until certainly the latter part of the year. If you look on the gross margin basis, I think we are off around 300 basis points. Our goal is to get that up closer to neutral. As we go into the earlier part of the back half of the year, the Performance Coatings business, where we were able to achieve pricing earlier, would help prop that up faster than the Industrial Coatings segment.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Harrison from Seaport Global Securities.
Michael Harrison: You saw a really pretty good growth in company-owned stores in North America during the first quarter. Can you give a little bit of color on what's been driving that? And maybe address if company-owned stores become a little greater focus in light of the change that you've seen in the customer base with the big box retailers?
Michael McGarry: So this continued improvement in our company-owned stores is multiple factors. The biggest one, though, is the fact that they're are more do-it-for-me people. The baby boomers are aging. And therefore, they're asking people to do their work and then you have a lot of the younger folks who never learned how to do it. So they're getting it done for them. So that's the biggest trend. So the company-owned stores are winning in that space. The second one, of course, is we've done a lot of improvement in our stores. So when you think about the rebranding initiatives, the customer initiatives, those have all been a positive, our ability to deliver more timely basis. That's been a positive. So there's a lot of underlying activities in that regard, and we did open up seven new stores in the Q1. So it will continue to be a focus area for us.
Michael Harrison: And then you announced the -- a price increase for auto OEM customers in the Americas in mid-March. I was wondering if you can just give us some color on how those negotiations are progressing with customers and how you guys are seeing the competitive environment in auto OEM right now?
Michael McGarry: Well, I've never seen a time where the competitive environment in auto OEM was anything but fierce. You have super sophisticated customers and the benefit is they clearly see the inflation. There's no denying the inflation is there. We've worked ourselves through a number of gates, if you will, with these folks. And so we are getting traction. And so what I'll tell you is it's been good for us to get additional price increases out there in the marketplace and we are getting price. So you should expect to see more in the future.
Operator: And our last question today comes from James Sheehan from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
James Sheehan: Mike, could you evaluate your efforts to reaccelerate organic growth? How effective has your rebranding and other initiatives been?
Michael McGarry: Well, the rebranding has been very positive. You can see -- again, this quarter was the best quarter we've had in our stores in more than 4 years. That's been doing really well. Also, the branding that we've done overall in PPG has helped us in a number of areas. So I'm pleased with that. The clarity on which brands and which markets has helped as well. So overall, I would say I'm pleased.
James Sheehan: And on raw materials, you gave some color on several of the different raw materials. Just wondering on epoxy resins in particular, do you think those prices have peaked yet?
Michael McGarry: Well, I'd like to say the answer is yes. A lot of that will depend upon some of the plants that were forced down in China in Q1, how quickly can they get up and running, are they able to run the rest of the year or will China be diligent? I think China will continue to be diligent in their enforcement actions. And so I think we're going to have a period here where we're in pretty good shape. But then I think on, as we move into winter, you will see China again continue to very aggressively enforce the environmental regulations.
James Sheehan: Great. And what's your read on the U.S. paint season thus far?
Michael McGarry: Well, disappointing. I wish I had a magic wand that could get rid of all the snow. I mean, even in Pittsburgh, we've had 2 snow days this weekend and April 19. So -- but our customer's underlying book of business is strong. Every painter I talked to would like to have three more people painting for them. So the housing market is good, all the underlying demand is good. They want to be painting. So it should be a good year. And you can see the stores, even in spite of this weather, did quite well. So I would tell you, I'm still optimistic.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, at this time, that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference call back over to management for any closing remarks.

Michael McGarry: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results. For the fourth quarter, our net sales were $3.7 billion, and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.19. This represents an EPS growth rate of about 3% for the quarter, and we achieved an EPS growth rate of about 4% for the year. While these figures fall short of our EPS growth rate goals, both numbers were noticeably impacted by persistent and elevated raw material inflation. For the quarter, our reported net sales were up nearly 8%, while our sales in local currencies increased by more than 4%. Supporting the higher local currency sales were increased volumes of 3%. This quarter produced our highest quarterly growth rate since the fourth quarter of 2014. Our strong volume growth in the fourth quarter was balanced, with at least 2% sales volume growth contribution from each region and each operating segment. Foreign currency translation shifted from a headwind in the first half of 2017 to a tailwind in the second half of the year as certain foreign currencies strengthened against the dollar, with fourth quarter net sales favorably impacted by approximately $115 million and pretax income impacted by about $12 million. For the full year, the impact was favorable by $54 million on sales, however, unfavorable by about $7 million on pretax earnings. Looking at some business trends in the fourth quarter from an end market perspective. Our highest volume growth rate was achieved in our Industrial Coatings segment, with each business unit exceeding or matching respective industry growth rates. Sales volumes in packaging coatings were up high-single digit percentage as the adoption to our INNOVEL interior can coatings products around the world accelerated. We also continue to grow sales volumes in general industrial and specialty coatings and materials, delivering our eighth consecutive quarter of above-market growth rate, with positive year-over-year contributions from each region. Automotive OEM coatings grew sales volumes by low single-digits percentage, in line with the global industry automotive builds. In Performance Coatings, automotive refinish grew organic sales by mid-single-digit percentage, supported by above-market performance in the U.S. and Europe. Aerospace coatings finished the year strong, with solid mid-single-digit sales volume growth producing above-market performance in the U.S. and emerging regions. Architectural EMEA sales volumes were flat and in line with market rebounding from a disappointing third quarter. We saw a strong above-market growth in Northern Europe and continued softer sales volumes in France, which aligned with the market demand. Sales volumes in architectural coatings Americas and Asia Pacific posted mid-single-digit organic sales growth, as the U.S. and Canada company-owned stores continue to achieve solid mid-single-digit sales growth. Our independent dealer network and national retail accounts were relatively flat compared to last year, which is an improvement from recent quarters' unfavorable trend in these channels. As an update to our last quarter, our PPG Timeless product in the Home Depot has been added to more locations, and we continue to work with the Home Depot to expand this further. Our investments in the U.S. and Canada architectural business are starting to pay dividends, and we will target to spend another $20 million on additional growth-related activities during the full year. Sales growth in Latin America was also flat, as our Mexican PPG-Comex business was impacted modestly by lower sales in the beginning the quarter related to post-earthquake market slowdown in Mexico. We also delivered above-market growth in our Australian architectural coatings business and overall growth in our Central America and China architectural business. Albeit a smaller business, I'm happy to report that our Central America business continued to grow by mid-teen percentage. We have grown this business from scratch into a regional leader in the past several years. Protective and marine coatings sales volume were up slightly compared to last year, with solid protective coatings sales driven by Asia, offset by moderating weakness in our aggregate marine coatings sales volumes. This business has done an excellent job in aggressively managing costs during the year to neutralize the earnings impact of the expected market-based activity level declines in marine coatings. From a regional perspective, sales volume growth was supported by emerging regions. Asia demand growth was broad-based across many of our businesses and grew sales volumes against a very difficult comparison period. I'll remind you that our Asian business grew sales volumes by nearly 10% in the fourth quarter 2016. Overall volumes in Latin America were up mid-single-digits percentage, driven by strong volumes in Industrial Coatings segment, led by our outperformance in automotive OEM coatings. Volume growth also improved in Europe after a flat comparison to prior year in the third quarter 2017. Growth in this region was broad-based and in line with improving regional manufacturing and industrial production, which are typically leading indicators for broader economic recovery. Sales volumes were up a low single-digit percentage in the U.S. and Canada, with balanced growth from both the Performance and Industrial Coatings segments. The general industrial, packaging and aerospace coatings businesses led the growth in this region, offset by lower automotive OEM coatings volume, including the decline in regional industry automotive builds. Supplementing the company's volume growth in the quarter were acquisition-related gains from our Crown Group acquisition that was completed in early October. The Crown Group serves various customers, including many heavy-duty equipment customers. We are pleased to own the business as the heavy-duty equipment market is in the early stages of recovery. From an earnings perspective, our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.19 improved by 3% versus the prior quarter. Our earnings were impacted by residual factors from natural disasters that happened in the third quarter. Specifically, we experienced higher costs for various key raw materials that are in short supply. Additionally, our sales in Puerto Rico and PPG-Comex architectural business were impacted, especially during the month of October. These lingering effects from the natural disasters had a $0.05 impact on our fourth quarter EPS and a $0.10 impact on our full year 2017 EPS. Excluding the natural disasters, our adjusted earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter increased by 7%. Also important is that we experienced continued and elevated raw material inflation in the fourth quarter at about a mid-single-digit percentage increase from the prior year. Raw material costs tend to moderate seasonally -- in the seasonally low fourth quarter. However, this year, they continued to increase. The main inflation driver is the continued enforcement in environmental regulations in China, which is resulting in ongoing supplier production curtailments. We do not expect this to abate in the first quarter of 2018. Selling prices were modestly up versus the prior year third quarter, with additional pricing secured for the first quarter of 2018. We're continuing to work with our customers on further selling price initiatives, focused on further offsetting this persistent inflation. We now expect the current level of raw material inflation to last well into the first half of 2018. We are working with our suppliers to mitigate the increases and expanded our research, resources and efforts on raw material efficiency, as we have said, after the third quarter. These efforts are beginning to yield modest raw material efficiency benefits, with more expected as we progress through the first half of 2018. In addition to selling price initiatives, we are partially mitigating raw material inflation through aggressive cost management. We are able to achieve savings from our business restructuring actions of $50 million in 2017, achieving the upper end of our targeted range. We also did a variety of other self-help actions, as is our heritage at PPG. In addition, earnings per share benefited from our ongoing cash deployment actions. This includes the impact of a repurchase of $400 million of PPG stock in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year 2017 repurchase total to more than $800 million or over 7 million shares. In the quarter, average diluted shares outstanding were 3% lower versus the fourth quarter of 2016. Now I'd like to quickly comment on our full year results from continuing operations. These results do not include the divested U.S. fiberglass business results, which was sold in third quarter of 2017. On a full year basis, our sales from continuing operations were approximately $14.8 billion, more than 3% higher than prior year. Our full year sales volumes grew by more than 1%, with second half volumes growth of nearly 2%. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share was $5.87, up nearly 4% versus prior year. We were able to grow our full year earnings despite significant disruptions to the coatings industry supply chain during the year. These disruptions include a very high number of supplier force majeures in Europe, several severe natural disasters and unexpected production curtailments in China. We accomplished this with another strong year of operational execution. Our -- one more significant actions included commercialization of new products and technologies, allowing us to deliver above-market growth in several of our businesses; continued successful integration and earnings accretion from prior and current year acquisitions; delivering on previously announced restructuring program, including achievement of our savings commitments; our hallmark of improved productivity and aggressive cost management, as exemplified by our 80 basis point reduction in our selling, general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales; and finally, another reduction to our operating working capital as a percentage of sales. This year, it reduced by 50 basis points, bringing the total reduction to the past 3 years to 260 basis points. In addition to these operational items, we allocated more resources and investments toward growth-related opportunities and expect that this will continue to yield dividends in our organic growth rate going forward. Over the course of the year, we continue to execute on our strategic objective to strengthen the company. We further optimized our business portfolio with the acquisition of The Crown Group, a leading provider of coating services; DEUTEK, a Romanian architectural coatings leader; and Futian, an automotive refinish company based in Southern China. We also completed a multiyear portfolio transformation with the sale of our U.S. fiberglass business, our last remaining noncore business. We are now a 100% core paints, coatings, coating services and specialty materials focused company. We will continue to build on our strong customer relationships and develop leading-edge technology to support our customers. Our portfolio allows us to deliver strong and consistent operating cash flow, requires less capital intensity, and we expect to be more resilient to overall shifts in the economic activity. We also continued our strong cash generation with about $1.5 billion generated from continuing operations for the year. As I mentioned earlier, one of the key enablers of this cash performance was our continuing effort to be more efficient with our working capital. In addition, consistent with our capital allocation philosophy, we continued our legacy of returning cash to shareholders with nearly $1.2 billion in share repurchases and dividends. Regarding dividends, we are proud that 2017 marked the 118th consecutive year of dividend payouts and the 65th consecutive year of annual payout increases after a 13% increase in July 2006 -- I'm sorry, 46th consecutive year. As we look forward to 2018, our expectation is for more continued positive momentum and overall global economic growth, including gradually higher growth rates in developed regions, a continuing higher growth rate in Asia Pacific and improving growth in Latin America. We anticipate economic growth rates to improve in the U.S. and Canada, including modest acceleration in industrial production and GDP rates versus 2017. We believe the recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation may bring further growth in the U.S. However, there are many still -- many uncertainties, including how our end markets will be impacted. Specific to our business, we do not expect -- or we do expect, excuse me, we do expect construction markets to expand in the U.S. and Europe. We also expect better growth in housing starts over 2017. And lastly, we believe that regional automotive industry builds will be relatively flat year-over-year. In Latin America, we anticipate economic expansion in Mexico, and in South America, we expect continuing improvement to growth rate following a modest uptick in 2017. Growth rates in Asia are expected to remain generally consistent with 2017, with continued industrial production in China as well as gains in Southeast Asia and India. Automotive build growth is expected to be flat to slightly down in the region, with the greatest wildcard in China where the small engine subsidy has expired. Economic growth in Europe is expected to continue but remain varied by subregion and country. Favorable end-use market trends are expected to continue, particularly in automotive OEM coatings as industry build rates are expected to remain positive. Even with a more optimistic view for 2018 economic growth, we will aggressively manage all elements of our business within our control to ensure that we remain competitive regardless of economic conditions. We'll continue to execute on our restructuring program, focus on reducing our overall cost structure, and we will continue to support the momentum of our recent growth-related initiatives. As mentioned earlier, we expect raw material inflation to persist at current levels at least for the first 2 quarters. We will continue to work with our customers to address the inflationary environment and expect to realize additional selling price increases in 2018. Finally, we remain in a position of strength as we ended the year with over $1.5 billion in cash and short-term investments, which provides us with a significant financial flexibility going forward. We are committed to deploy a minimum of $2.4 billion of cash in 2018 on acquisitions and share repurchases as part of our previously communicated target to deploy a minimum of $3.5 billion in 2017 and 2018 combined. We continue to believe the coatings space remains a consolidating industry, and our acquisition pipeline remains active across geographies and end use markets. We plan to continue to repurchase shares in the first quarter. I will conclude by saying that 2017 was a solid year for PPG. We delivered adjusted EPS growth despite a plethora of supply disruptions in our industry, but we fell short of our EPS growth targets. However, we completed various strategic actions to continue to make the company stronger and more resilient in the future. We look forward to another successful year in 2018. And now I will turn over to Vince, who will cover some 2018 financial assumptions.
Vincent Morales: Thank you, Michael, and also, good afternoon, everybody. I'm just going to cover a few items that will assist folks in modeling PPG's 2018 financial results. Included in the presentation that was distributed for the meeting today, is a summary of some of the financial items I'm going to cover. First is the impact from acquisitions that we completed in 2017, the carryover impact as well as the full year impact from the ProCoatings acquisition that we finalized earlier this month. We expect these acquisitions to have a sales -- approximate sales of about $125 million in 2018 until they reach their anniversary date. The margin on these sales is typically lower than the segment margin until we're able to work through the synergy capture that is included in our estimates. Next, we will continue to experience the impact of favorable foreign currency as measured against the U.S. dollar. As a result, the full year estimate that we are anticipating based on current exchange rates is a sales impact of about $250 million to $300 million favorable as well as about 10% of that or $25 million to $30 million on the bottom line of pretax earnings. For the first quarter, we expect the impact to be comparable to what we experienced in the fourth quarter. Again, these figures represent our current assumptions and are based on current exchange rates. They'll obviously likely change throughout the year. As Michael referenced in his comments, we are still completing our 2016 restructuring program. We have a total full year run rate target for that program of about $125 million. We achieved about $50 million in 2017, and we anticipate another $45 million or $50 million incrementally in 2018. We expect the company's pension and post-retirement benefits will be comparable to 2017 for the calendar year 2018. And again, as Michael mentioned, we expect the company's 2018 tax rate on ongoing earnings from continuing operations to be in the range of about 23% to 24%. Again, the comparable rate for 2017 was 24.4%. The decrease relates primarily to the recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation. As noted in the press release, this is our best estimate based on what we know at the present time. That's obviously subject to updates as we receive any information with respect to updates on the legislation. As a reminder, there's a new accounting standard in place for 2018 regarding revenue recognition. And we have evaluated the new standard and do not expect any material change to our sales or net income. However, there'll be some geographic changes on certain cost elements and sales elements, and we're estimating that'll likely lower our gross profit percentage in 2018 versus 2017 by about 50 to 100 basis points. And there'll be a corresponding decrease in our selling, general and administrative expenses of a similar amount. Finally, Michael mentioned we are committed to meeting our previously announced cash deployment target. And again, that means we will deploy $2.4 billion of cash on either acquisitions and/or share repurchases in 2018. Once again, a summary of these financial estimates is included in the presentation materials. This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG. And now, Rocco, would you please open the line for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Today's first question comes from John Roberts of UBS.
John Roberts: You mentioned the new environmental regs in China affecting raw materials. Is that a broad-based issue? Or are there specific raw materials that are particularly causing you some issues?
Michael McGarry: No, it's fairly broad based, but the one that has the most amount of impact on is epoxy. As you know, we use epoxy in many of our different businesses, whether it's packaging, OEM, industrial. And those -- that will probably continue, I would say, for -- because it's winter over there, they're trying to especially get their air better. Big coal burning time for them. We don't have any insight to whether that's going to continue or not. But obviously, at these levels, there are a lot of people making a lot of money. So we wouldn't be surprised if there's some additional capacity added elsewhere. But right now, we anticipate that raw materials should start to moderate, but we're not perfect prognosticators on that, by the middle of the year.
Vincent Morales: And John, if I could add. This is Vince. We've seen this all year long in China. Again, more rigid enforcement of existing rules, and it's affected not only the epoxies that Michael mentioned, it's affected other baskets of raw materials as well. So I'd call it more of a rolling -- kind of a rolling outage or production curtailment.
John Roberts: And then if raw materials just leveled off where they are today, how much additional price have you still -- do you still have to announce to your customers versus how much is just that you have to realize on price increases you've already discussed with your customers?
Michael McGarry: Well, every business in PPG, without exception, has announced price increases. And some of them, in 2017, announced 2 and another 1 in 2018. So we'll have to look at this as we go through the year. It wouldn't surprise me that there could be additional announcements. But we don't want to get ahead of inflation at this point, and we want to work constructively with our customers. But right now, as you know, we are net negative if you take raws minus pricing.
Operator: And today's next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi of Robert W. Baird.
Ghansham Panjabi: On the 3% volume growth during the fourth quarter, how much do you think you benefited, if at all, from a rebound in growth following the impact in 3Q from both the hurricanes and also the earthquake in Mexico?
Michael McGarry: Well, I would tell you, in Mexico, October was soft. We had a little bit better November and a very good December. So for the quarter, we were actually flat. That's the first flat quarter we've ever had in Comex since we've owned it. From a sales perspective, we were up because we were able to get the price to offset the raws down there. In the U.S., I would say, it was more of a mixed bag because, as you know, it depends upon the size of the house, how quickly they can get paint on the wall once they start repairs. And so it was not a -- I would say that, probably, we didn't benefit that much yet. We still expect to see some benefits. But we have nice mid-single digits in our company-owned stores, and it was in all the regions. We didn't have any region that was weak from that perspective.
Vincent Morales: Ghansham, this is Vince. If you compare Q3 to Q4 volume growth, the biggest accelerant was Europe. So if you ask what the difference is, it's a recovery we're seeing in Europe. Michael alluded to it in the call -- on the prepared remarks, excuse me, with respect to the industrial activity we're seeing there.
Ghansham Panjabi: Okay, that's helpful. And then just for my second question, for the industrial segment specific to the fourth quarter, was there any material mix impact during the quarter? I'm just trying to reconcile the 280 basis point decline in 4Q operating margins for the segment versus 230 basis points in 3Q and whether there was any incremental impact other than just raw material costs net of pricing.
Vincent Morales: Well, if you look at that segment, Ghansham, there are seasonality pieces to that segment, including automotive. Within the automotive industry, there's seasonality by -- it's different seasonality by region. So it's hard to really compare Q3 and Q4. I understand what you're trying to do, but we didn't see anything that's material that would have changed the mix other than the regional -- the typical regional seasonal differences between the quarters.
Operator: And our next question comes from Frank Mitsch of Wells Fargo.
Frank Mitsch: I want to broaden out the question that John asked on raw materials. You mentioned that coming out of China, epoxy was the one that was concerning you. As you think about your raw materials overall, how would you rank the ones that are most problematic so we can track that? And also, Michael, I think you mentioned that you're embarking on some raw material efficiencies. Can you provide some examples there?
Michael McGarry: Okay. So the one after raw materials and epoxy, you have propylene is, obviously, a major driver for us. And propylene is up significantly U.S. year-over-year. It's up in Europe year-over-year and Asia. And then you have crude. This time last year, I think crude was about $55. Now it's $69 for Brent and it's $64 for WTI. So I think that's going to flow through into solvents. So you have to watch that. So those would be the key ones. As far as efficiency improvements, we always are trying to optimize our formulas, Frank. So if you think about some of the additives, some of the solvents that are in there, to the extent that we can shift more of our customers from solvent-based to water-based, that would be a positive. From the ability to change the formulation mix to, I would say, away from propylene and more toward ethylene, that's a positive for us. So that's how we're thinking about that.
Frank Mitsch: Okay, terrific. And you mentioned, on the share buyback, you did $400 million in Q4, which was the highest level of the year. As I think about the $2.4 billion that you have to spend over the 4 quarters of 2018, that would imply, absent acquisitions, $600 million a quarter. So how are you feeling about your ability to execute mid- to large-scale acquisitions in 2018?
Michael McGarry: Well, Frank, we've already announced two small ones so far this year. I would tell you that we're going to continue to have acquisition opportunities. I had a person in the other day that made a verbal commitment, so we'll have to work our way through it. It's a family. So it doesn't always happen at the rate I would like. But the pipeline looks good. We're going to continue to work at it. We have good visibility into these things. So when we start talking, we know whether it's going to be a 2Q close or a 3Q, so we'll be able to moderate our buybacks to make sure that we're at or above the $3.5 billion that we've committed.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research Partners.
Kevin McCarthy: Michael, how would you characterize your volume expectations for the company in the first half of 2018? I believe you have a fewer -- 1 less shipping day in the first quarter and perhaps, some puts and takes as you touched upon with regard to natural disasters. As you roll all that up, is there any reason to believe that your trajectory would be materially better or worse than the 3% in the fourth quarter?
Michael McGarry: Well, I think Easter affects different businesses different ways. So that's why we wanted to put that out there, on the 1 less shipping day for Q1. We do know that the build rate for automotive in the first quarter is not significant. It's relatively flat, so you can factor that in. But we are gaining share in a number of our other businesses. So when you think about packaging, that's a business we're gaining share in. When you think about industrial, we've had 4 years in a row where we grew share in our Industrial Coatings business. Then you think about our specialty coatings and materials, we're excited with our OLED product. That has been doing very well. And aerospace and refinish have just been very, very solid businesses. And as you know, Boeing and Airbus's backlogs are still there. I know they pushed hard to get a lot of planes out in the fourth quarter. But we still are optimistic that they're going to continue to build more planes in '18 than they built in '17. So I'm reasonably confident that it's not going to be a straight line, but we're going to have a good year.
Kevin McCarthy: If you reflect back on prior cycles for raw material inflation and selling price increases, has PPG experienced any prebuying activity across the customer base whereby your customers attempt to increase purchases ahead of announced increases? Is that meaningful or not meaningful? And does the answer vary by product line perhaps?
Michael McGarry: Well, it could vary by product line. But if you think a lot of our customers, I mean, the aerospace guys, the refinish guys, automotive, I mean, a lot of these things are just-in-time kind of delivery, so they're not into that. The only place that you could envision that is our dealer segment and our -- where you have an independent businessman who says, Okay, I'm going to get ahead of the curve. I'm going to buy a little bit more. But they would have to then be buying paint in the fourth quarter, a quarter early before the paint season. So that would be one area that you could see some of that.
Vincent Morales: Kevin, this is Vince. It's very, very scarce that, that happens, and it's not really meaningful to the company overall.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, our next question comes from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs.
Christopher Evans: It's Chris Evans on for Bob. You mentioned pricing across every product line at PPG. I was wondering if you could give us a sense for the scale on average you're targeting in '18. And then are competitors aligning with your efforts in behaving rationally to offset the raws pressures?
Vincent Morales: Yes, Chris, this is Vince. Again, every business and every region has a different target, depending on what's happening within those regions and we'll work with our customers on what those targets are independently. We're not going to broad brush that comment. It's not appropriate for us or our customers. I think the comment Michael made earlier is what we -- what you should probably think about it, is we're expecting minimal abatement of raw materials in the first half. We're behind the curve in terms of recovery, and our objective is to fully recover as we progress through 2018.
Christopher Evans: Great. And then you mentioned a little bit on some growth spending and I think, performance in the first quarter. And you had a program in the fourth quarter as well around $10 million. Did you spend that full $10 million? And do you expect -- seems like there's been a number of these programs recently. Is this going to be more sustainable or something that you'll lap as you anniversary these programs?
Michael McGarry: No, we spent the money that we said we were going to spend. The $20 million I referenced was for the full year. And so we would expect to continue to do that. I think when you look at what we're trying to accomplish with growing, getting our organic growth rate up, these are investments in our business that we're going to continue to do, and we just want to let you know when we're doing them.
Vincent Morales: And if you look, I think we're yielding results on them. So we'll continue to measure that versus the results we're yielding.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan.
Jeffrey Zekauskas: If you look at your adjusted net income and your D&A, it's about $2 billion for 2017, and your cash flow is about $1.5 billion. Can you talk about the factors that led you to not generate as much cash as you have in some years in the past?
Vincent Morales: I just want to understand the question, Jeff. So we had 2...
Jeffrey Zekauskas: So in other words, if your adjusted earnings are roughly $6 and you have 250 million shares, that's about $1.5 billion. Your D&A is about $450 million. So you add that up and you get a little bit under $2 billion. And your cash from operations was about $1.5 billion. And so what I was wondering is, was there something unusual that depressed your cash flow such that the number wasn't closer to that $2 billion number?
Vincent Morales: Well, let me try to answer your question, Jeff. So I think if you look at our numbers right off of our statement, we had just over $2 billion of income. To your point, we had another $460 million roughly of depreciation. That'd be about $2.5 billion of not exactly EBITDA but close to that term. We did include, in our appendix, I think, what we paid in cash taxes. That was just under $600 million. So that would take us down to about $1.9 billion in terms of potential cash. If you look at our operating working capital, which is on one of our schedules, even though our percentage was down, the absolute dollars were up about $70 million, because of the growth we had in sales. And then as we alluded to in a prior earnings call, we did have a gain on the sale of the fiberglass business. So we had to pay tax on that gain, and that's several hundred million dollars. And then there's always some minor things we would call like pension contributions, et cetera. So I think if you aggregate all that up, you'd get down to somewhere in the $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion range you were talking about.
Jeffrey Zekauskas: Okay. Secondly, can you talk about business conditions in Brazil? And from your point of view, was the acceleration in growth in aerospace in the fourth quarter a onetime item? Or was it more indicative of the trend going forward?
Michael McGarry: I think, aerospace, that's an easy one, it's more indicative of what -- low to mid-single digits in aerospace. The market grew, we think, 3%. We outgrew the market. We would expect to see a similar type performance in 2018. As far as Brazil, we think Brazil was on the early path of a recovery. We're fortunate that we have strong businesses in Brazil, whether it's our automotive business, our industrial, our packaging, our refinish, all folks that have done very well down there. And so we kind of outgrew a little bit faster than Brazil. I think for 2018, we should then start to match more the growth rate down there. So I think overall, I think our Latin American team did an outstanding job in 2017.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley.
Jooyoung Son: This is Grace Son on for Vincent. You mentioned the impact Chinese environmental regulation's having on raw material inflation. But on the flip side, do you get a sense that the environmental enforcement is negatively affecting the operations of your Chinese competitors? And if so, have you been able to take some of that market share?
Michael McGarry: Well, from a coatings standpoint, most of the folks that we compete with are global coatings companies. And as global coatings companies, they are, I would say, very responsible operators. And not only that, but generally, because we're #1 in all the segments there, except for architectural, I would say that a lot of those folks generally have capacity. So if they're asked to shut down for 2 days because of a Beijing event or if they're asked to shut down for 3 days in Shanghai, they're able to make that up on other days. So we have not seen any indication of that, that they have been negatively impacted, but that would be a good question for you to ask them.
Vincent Morales: And Grace, if I could just intervene. I think one of the -- long term, we're supportive of good environmental enforcement. We have a whole plethora of products that we think are advantaged versus smaller players in the marketplace. And we think, for the multinational coatings companies, once we get through this transitory inflationary trend, this is a good signal for future demand and again, for those that have the products that can support this environmental enforcement.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Christopher Parkinson of Crédit Suisse.
Christopher Parkinson: Out of the M&A pipeline you're currently evaluating, especially the larger targets, as it pertains to what you assess as the most probable, do any key themes exist? For instance, are there any -- are there more affordable opportunities in a specific region, a specific focus on complementary technologies or even broadening your end market exposure? Just any assessment on how we should view that would be very helpful.
Michael McGarry: Yes. I think, Christopher, the markets where we have been most successful are North America and Europe. Those are the more mature regions. The folks in Asia, there's many things for sale there, but the multiples are not value creating to our shareholders. So eventually, one day, that'll be in our bailiwick. So you can expect that most of these will be in the North American, European space. And then the other one, the way to think about this, is the markets that are the least consolidated are protective and marine, industrial and architectural. And so those would be the areas that would have a more of a target-rich environment, if you will.
Christopher Parkinson: That's helpful. And just as a follow-up, can you just break down any key trends you're currently seeing in the European end markets? And any potential to see some improvement in incremental margins? So anything of note on a country-by-country basis post the key elections in '17?
Michael McGarry: Well, I think you've seen in historical past that because we have additional capacity in Europe, we don't have to add any overhead or any people to produce additional volume in Europe. So we had the highest incremental margins in Europe, which tend to be 30% to 40%. So we're always very happy to see growth in Europe. What we're seeing right now is the growth in the Northern European countries continues to be pretty good. France is the one area that still has not turned the corner. We see some recovery in Southern Europe. The one watch-out is the U.K., Brexit. We see retail, especially in the U.K., as being weak, and so we're paying close attention to that.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Dmitry Silversteyn of Longbow Research.
Dmitry Silversteyn: Just a couple of questions, if I may. You've talked about the EMEA -- the European decorative paints business having a flat quarter, which is certainly better than the losses you've had the last couple of quarters in terms of volumes. Can you talk about sort of what's going on there with your pricing initiatives? I mean, are they as prevalent as they are in the U.S. and as successful? Or is there an obstacle to getting pricing up because of the more fragmented market?
Michael McGarry: I would actually say that the architectural European team has been one of our leaders as far as getting price up. We've been successful in the U.K., the Benelux, France, Italy, Denmark. So we've had good success in, what I would call, Western Europe. It's a little bit more of a challenge in Eastern Europe, where it's more fragmented. We have folks that are still focused more on volume than margin recovery. But I think, as people look at their year-end results, people are going to see the squeeze. The problem in coatings, of course, is a huge percentage of your cost of manufacturing is raw materials. So you cannot ignore this. So they might ignore it 1 or 2 quarters, but it's staring them in the face. And I think we'll see more folks get serious about closing their -- recovering their margins. So I'm actually happy with our architectural European team.
Dmitry Silversteyn: Okay, that's helpful. And then just looking at the gross margins. The delta in year-over-year margins seems to be -- seems to have expanded here versus what you saw in the first 3 quarters of the year, here in the fourth quarter. Is that just a function of kind of that's where most of your raw material hit is happening post-Harvey particularly and kind of not getting that seasonal decline? Or is it a mix issue, either geographically or business-wise, that's giving you a little bit more of a negative delta between gross margins on year-over-year basis?
Vincent Morales: No, Dmitry. It's the former. Typically, we do see some raw material price compression in Q4. As Michael said in the prepared remarks, we actually saw the opposite this quarter. That's why that delta opened up a little bit. We don't -- again, we think that's transitory. We do expect inflation in Q1, but we had inflation in Q1 of last year as well.
Dmitry Silversteyn: Right, right. Okay. And when you were talking about getting more pricing in the first quarter of the year as far as making new price announcements, that is also across the board, both industrial and consumer and Performance Coatings groups?
Michael McGarry: Every business.
Dmitry Silversteyn: Every business, all right. The magnitude, kind of similar low to mid-single digits that you've done before?
Michael McGarry: We're not going to talk about the magnitude. I don't think our customers want us talking about that. But every business is out trying to get price right now.
Operator: And our next question today comes from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank.
David Begleiter: Michael, what are your expectations for the upcoming U.S. spring paint season? And do you expect any impact, either now or later, from the recent hurricanes?
Michael McGarry: Well, I would think the hurricanes will have -- it will have a positive impact. I don't think it's going to be something that you'll necessarily be able to pick out. I mean, certainly, in the Houston stores, the Florida stores, are seeing some positive momentum. So I'm pleased to see that. But I think when you look at the overall market for architectural in the U.S., we're still predicting that to be in that 2% to 3% range, probably the high end is 4%. And more of that to the company-owned stores and less of it, of course, the dealers are the most challenged segment, and then the retailers are in the middle. So I would say that's not too different. We're not expecting a different trend line. You still have the do-it-for-me going on. That's still a significant thing. And you still have -- labor for the painters is challenged, they're -- not always have enough painters out there in the marketplace. So that is also holding back a little bit the growth rate. But overall, I would expect to see similar trends.
David Begleiter: And Michael, amongst these large big-box retailers, in particularly one, is there some potential gain, a price point given some recent consolidation amongst their suppliers?
Michael McGarry: Well, I think the way we always think about this, David, is you win some and you lose some in the big-boxes. A lot of times, they want to keep you on your toes. And as you see, we won the Timeless paint and Timeless stain. That filled a gap that they had in their offering at the Home Depot. They've been extremely pleased with that. And the number of stores we're going into in '18 will be higher than '17. But you can lose some as well. As far as any particular retailer, it would probably not be appropriate for us to comment on their plans. We obviously are always talking to all our large retailers about how we can improve their business.
Vincent Morales: David, we think the puts and takes in a given year typically offset each other, and that's what we expect in 2018 as well.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, our next question comes from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies.
Daniel Rizzo: This is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. In the past, I think it's been pointed out that sometimes auto OEMs do a little rebalancing amongst their suppliers. Is that something that's occurring now or it's something that's a concern in 2018?
Michael McGarry: Well, there was a rebalancing, but it was more on a regional basis in 2016. I think we talked about that late '15, early '16, where we preferentially wanted more share in Asia because we viewed that as a growing market and preferentially gave up share in the U.S. That has worked out very well for us. We're not aware of anything that's going to be a material change though, in 2018. Typically, when they do these things, they are apt to let them run for a few years before they make any other changes.
Daniel Rizzo: Okay. And then you mentioned a couple of times the $20 million in growth activities for architectural in the U.S is that promotional activities or rebates? Can you just give a little bit of color what that really means?
Vincent Morales: There's a variety of different programs we have going on, again, targeted at growing our overall volumes, which we've seen improve for the last 6 or 7 quarters. It's both in the home center channel as well as our store channel. So it's across the board. Again, as I mentioned earlier, we're measuring the efficiency of that spending. If we see more value in doing more, we will. If we don't feel it's returning what we'd hoped to yield off if it, we'll back off of that.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Steve Byrne of Bank of America.
Steve Byrne: You have this matrix in your slide deck that shows end market volumes by geography, and it looks decidedly greener, maybe even darker greener. And I assume that from your mark -- remarks, Michael, that you might say that trend is likely to continue. But the other thing interesting about it, it also seems like your own performance showed an improvement in the quarter, less below-market results on your own business and maybe a little more above market. Would you expect these 2 trends to be coincident?
Michael McGarry: Well, the way I think about that, Steve, and I think we've talked about this the last two earnings calls, is that we have been leading the price up. And when you lead price up, you sometimes get penalized. But we always thought we would get our share back because at the end of the day, when our competitors also go in and ask for a price, then they get penalized. And so we'll end up getting share back. So I think what you're seeing here is some of this flowing back to PPG as other people are out there also trying to recover their margins. So that's the way I would think about that. I do see us continuing to innovate very well. So if you look at the businesses that are performing above market, think about refinish, we have the best water-based products out there. And as that product grows around the world -- think about China, what's going on right now. They're going to ask for more water-based products. We are in a great position to supply that need. When you think about our INNOVEL coatings for packaging, and people want to take Bisphenol-A out of the epoxy coatings, we're in a position to deliver that. When you think about innovation in the aerospace business, whether it's the cool coatings, whether it's lightweight sealants or whether it's higher-performing transparencies, we're delivering that. So I think the volume growth is being supplemented by technology, and we're happy to see that come through.
Steve Byrne: And would you say that the stronger that end market, the more likely it might draw higher technology or a mix shift towards maybe more your sweet spot?
Michael McGarry: Well, I think I would answer it this way. The more sophisticated the market, the more likely they value the technology. So if you're in a value segment, they're not going to pay for high-priced technology. If you're in a high-performing segment, they're going to pay for technology.
Steve Byrne: Okay. And just one last one on your pipeline. Would you say -- you characterized it as being pretty steady, pretty forward. Would you characterize anything in there as being more than a bolt-on and potentially transformational?
Michael McGarry: I would say that most of the things we're looking at are bolt-ons.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Don Carson of Susquehanna.
Donald Carson: Yes. Two questions on pricing in March. And you've seen weakness in your Industrial Coatings segment for some time. Is that across the board? Or is that principally in auto OEM? And given your price initiatives and some of the comparisons in year-ago, when would you expect to see improved pricing in that segment on a year-over-year basis?
Vincent Morales: Hey Don, Vince. We're not going to get into individual businesses. These are all big customers, as you know. We work with them individually, either globally or by region. We have seen further price improvement/price traction versus prior quarters. We expect that to continue well into 2018. Most of these folks have some price delay in their minds, at least, if not in contracts. So again, I think you'll see an uptick in 2018 as -- in this particular segment as the year progresses.
Donald Carson: Okay. And as you look at gross margins and sort of adjust for this change in accounting if you're going to have an impact on that, when would you expect to see year-over-year improvement in gross margins? Is it not till the second half when raw material inflation moderates? Or given your pricing actions, do you think there's a chance for that by the time you get to the second quarter?
Vincent Morales: Don, we're comfortable we're going to continue to get price certainly in the first half of the year, if not throughout the whole year. The wild card is, as I know you're acutely aware, is what happens to raw materials when you get to April-May time period. That could be an inflection point up or down in 2017. Unfortunately, that was an inflection point upwards. So our visibility is only 60 days or so. But the answer to your question, I think, will be unfolding as we get into early to mid-second quarter.
Operator: And our next question comes from Patrick Lambert of Raymond James.
Patrick Lambert: A very simple one. I think I'd like to have your view on the outlook for both market, protective and marine in particular, in 2018, what you're seeing in terms of order books at your customers and the picture you could see evolving into 2018.
Michael McGarry: Sure, Patrick. I think the most meaningful thing is that new build deliveries in the fourth quarter are up 2%. That's the first positive new build deliveries in quite some period of time. China has been growing share at the expense of Korea. So that's another good data point for you to be aware of. But what I always remind people is that we don't put paint on a ship until 18 months after we take orders. So the fact that we're taking higher orders now won't show up in the order book for quite some period of time. The good news is our marine -- protective and marine business collectively was a net positive. So the growth in protective exceeded the growth -- or the decline in marine, and earnings were up year-over-year in that segment due to very tight cost control. So I think that's a positive.
Patrick Lambert: So marine in Q4 was still negative for you?
Michael McGarry: Yes, and we expect it to be negative in Q1 as well. So if you're looking for an inflection point, it'll be sometime in the back half of 2018. But we expect protective to be growing at a faster rate than it's declining, and that'll be a positive.
Patrick Lambert: Do you see oil and gas protective going up next year?
Michael McGarry: I think you'll see some orders placed, but it's probably a little bit early for that to be out there. You're probably a couple quarters ahead of the curve.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Jim Sheehan of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
James Sheehan: Can I get your thoughts on titanium dioxide prices? Do you expect the pricing of that raw material to settle down in 2018? And when you talk about efficiencies in your raw materials, how does that pertain to TiO2, if at all?
Michael McGarry: So we took out about 1% of our TiO2 in 2017. We expect to take out 1% to 2% in 2018. We're trying to make our formulas more efficient and still provide as good or better quality on the final corrosion protection for our customers as well as other properties. So TiO2 pricing itself, I would say, is starting to moderate. I think you know that one of the, well, in fact, the largest supplier is trying to take a different approach to the pricing, where they go to market in that regard. We'll have to wait and see how the other folks react. But we certainly have been watching this closely, and I would think there is some small increases expected in the first half of 2018.
James Sheehan: Great. And then on the 3% volume increase for the quarter, could you just describe that volume growth relative to your comments on leading on price? If you have lost some share due to leading on price, are we in a regain share mode today? Or are we still kind of behind the curve on that and maybe your normalized growth rate could be a little bit better?
Vincent Morales: Jim, this is Vince. Michael, you may not have heard the question earlier, but Michael answered a similar question earlier. We thought we were picking up some of -- regaining some of the business from early in 2017, and we were proactive on pricing.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tom Narayan of RBC.
Gautam Narayan: It's a follow-up actually on a question asked earlier on M&A. You guys had said that you're more interested in bolt-ons than a transformational acquisition. Just curious if -- is that a change in view post obviously what happened last year? Or was that opportunity something unique and specific that maybe you don't see in the horizon currently?
Vincent Morales: No, I think what we're trying to address is what's in the target zone, what's available to us. We've financial capacity to do a large deal. If one would present itself, that would be something we would certainly look at. But when we're looking at what we have today in the pipeline, Michael was trying to address that question of what's in the pipeline today.
Gautam Narayan: Okay. And then a couple of folks asked about the increased spending on, I think it was the Timeless product at Home Depot in the 4Q. I guess, the question I have on that is, the margins in the Performance Coating segment were actually higher, it looks like, year-over-year, even with the raw materials pricing headwinds. Just curious why those margins held up as well as they did in the quarter even with that increased spending.
Vincent Morales: Yes. This is Vince again. If you look, we said this many times, if we have volume, we typically have very good incremental margins on that volume. We did -- secondarily, we did secure additional pricing versus Q3 in that particular segment, and Q4. Those are 2 elements that allowed us to get above margin parity year-over-year.
Operator: And today's next question comes from Kevin Hocevar of Northcoast Research.
Kevin Hocevar: Curious, we've had a couple of -- a string here of a couple of years of pretty unseasonably warm winters, and this year seems to be, at least so far, a little bit more normal. So wondering -- and realizing we're not in the business here of forecasting weather. But assuming a more normalized winter this year, is there any businesses that you've had that have benefited from kind of warmer winters the last couple of years that could be impacted by a normal winter? What comes to mind is exterior paint. But just kind of curious if anything would be negatively impacted if we do ultimately have just kind of more of a normal winter than what we've had the last couple of years.
Michael McGarry: I don't think, Kevin, there's anything that's going to flip bad from the fact that we have a cold weather. Obviously, the -- you can see the company-owned store sales dropped in the last couple of days when Houston was 15 degrees and snow. But conversely, Houston had ice and snow on the road. That means there are a lot of refinish opportunities for us. So this is the first year that refinish might come out of the winter with a substantial backlog. So I would say it's more likely to be a positive than a negative, but it's very, very difficult to put a number on it.
Kevin Hocevar: Sure, that's interesting. And then on the -- your U.S. architectural DIY market, it looked like that was, for the first time in a while, looked like on the heat map, it was -- looked like neutral to volumes, which I think has been getting progressively better throughout the year. So wondering if you have any update there on that kind of DIY dealer channel. Are things improving there? Or is there any benefit from channel fill for the Timeless product lines? Or wondered if you could just comment on what you're seeing in that market.
Vincent Morales: Well, I think, Kevin, as you pointed out, this is the first time, in 2017, we think the market is running about flat. You'll have to wait and see what other folks, when they announce, what they come out with, so this is our assumption. But there is the concern I would -- not the concern, but the caution I would throw out there is Q4 is typically a very seasonally light quarter. So I wouldn't use that as a proxy. That -- as Michael alluded to earlier, the do-it-for-me market is certainly stronger. And so I wouldn't read anything particular or draw any trend lines from Q4. We hope it remains flat to up next year in 2018, but we'll have to get to the end of the paint season to make that a reality.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.
John Bruno: Thank you, Rocco. This is John Bruno again. I'd like to thank everyone for their time and interest in PPG. If you have any questions, please contact me. This concludes our fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings call.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Today's conference has now concluded and we thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the PPG Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please also note today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. John Bruno. Sir, please go ahead.
John Bruno: Thank you, Jamie, and good afternoon, everyone. Once again this is John Bruno, Director of Investor Relations. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG and welcome you to our third quarter 2017 financial results conference call. Joining me on the call from PPG are Michael McGarry, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Vince Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our comments relate to the financial information released today Thursday, October 19th. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, all periods present the former Glass segment as discontinued operations. About one hour ago, we posted detailed commentary and accompanied presentation slides on the Investor Center of our Web site ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call, and provide additional support to the opening comments Michael will make momentarily. Following Michael's perspective on the Company's quarterly results, we will move to a Q&A session. Both the prepared commentary and the discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements, reflecting the Company's current view of future events and the potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The Company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The Company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on our Web site, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC. Now, let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Michael McGarry.
Michael McGarry: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported third quarter and year-to-date 2017 financial results. Our net sales for the third quarter were approximately $3.8 billion, up more than 3% year-over-year and our reported earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.52. This quarter was filled with a lot of emotion and many operational challenges due to the number and severity of natural disasters that many experienced. I would first like to thank our employees for their commitment and support they provided and continue to provide. We will continue to support our impacted employees, their families and their communities as they continue to rebuild. Turning more specifically to our results in the quarter. Our sales growth of more than 3% was driven by improving sales volume and favorable currency translation. Currency translation, which has been unfavorable for quite some period of time, reverted to favorable in the third quarter and is expected to be so in the fourth quarter based on current exchange rates. Regarding our sales volumes, I'm encouraged by the pace of growth in July and August before the hurricanes and earthquakes and by order book in the first few weeks of October. Our overall year-over-year Company sales volume were up nearly 1% in the third quarter, including about $25 million of unfavorable sales volume impact from natural disasters. Industrial Coatings segment volumes improved by about 3%, while our performance coating segment volumes declined by about 1%. The performance segment realized most of the unfavorable sales impact from the natural disasters. Before the natural disasters, we were tracking about 1.5% of sales volume growth in the quarter, higher than our volume performance in the first half of 2017. Let me quickly discuss a few specific business unit performance trends, where we're tracking both above and below the market. In the third quarter, general Industrial Coatings business growth again exceeded the rate of global industrial production, continuing a multi-quarter trend. Also, volumes returned to mid single-digit percentage growth in our packaging coatings business, stemming from increased customer conversions to our new technologies. Our U.S. company-owned architectural stores once again grew same-store sales at mid single-digit despite the natural disasters, marking seven consecutive quarters of sequential volume improvement. Of note, during the quarter, we're pleased to have launched PPG Timeless, a new premium stain and new interior paint brand into the Home Depot, and we'll work to drive customer adoption of this new product. This includes some additional growth related marketing spend in the fourth quarter. That being said, demand overall U.S. DIY paint market has remained soft throughout the year. During the quarter, our sales volume in architectural coatings EMEA were below market, while certain parts of our business remained solid, such as the UK where we continue to outperform the market. Demand in certain other important countries to PPG, such as France, remains weak. Also, we turned away certain business in the region due to either low profitability or lack of customer acceptance of selling price increases. As I previously said, buying growth remains one of our key focus areas for the company. While I'm pleased with some of the measurable progress we have made, we continue to work on a variety of initiatives to accelerate our growth rate. From an earnings perspective, our reported EPS was consistent with our prior year adjusted EPS. The recent natural disasters reduced our third quarter EPS results by about $0.05. This was the result of raw material inflation, higher transitory logistics costs and impact to reduce sales volume. In the third quarter, we made initial progress to begin recover our margin. Our contribution margin compression was lower year-over-year in the third quarter than it was in the second quarter. Specifically, in the third quarter, our contribution margin was 160 basis points lower than the last year's third quarter and would have been 130 basis points lower, excluding the natural disaster impact. Higher than expected raw material cost inflation was the largest drive of margin compression. Our basket of raw materials were up mid single-digit percentage year-over-year, pacing much higher versus our expectations at the beginning of the year. The main causes continue to be various supplier force majeure issues in Europe and additional supply driven production curtailments in China. Selling prices were up modestly versus the prior year with additional pricing secured for the upcoming fourth and first quarters. We continue to work with our customers on additional selling price initiatives, focused on further offsetting the persistent inflation. We now expect the current level of raw material inflation to last through the fourth quarter and anticipate inflation to continue, but at lower rate in the early part of 2018. We are working with our suppliers to mitigate the increases and have also expanded our research, resources and efforts on another wave of raw material efficiency projects. We were able to mitigate some margin compression with overall productivity improvements through the aggressive manufacturing and overhead cost management. Through the acceleration of some of our actions from our restructuring program we announced in 2016, I now expect restructuring will benefit us by more than $45 million in 2017, which is towards the upper end of our initial target range. In the third quarter, we completed the sale of the North American fiber glass business. This is a transformation milestone for the Company, and it completes the combination of our multi-year strategic shift in our business portfolio. The gross sale proceeds were about 540 million with the net after-tax gain recorded in discontinued operations. In the third quarter, we purchased about $250 million of stock and on October 2nd, we finalized the acquisition of The Crown Group, a coating services company. Including The Crown acquisition, year-to-date we have spent about $725 million toward our multi-year target of $3.5 billion to be deployed on acquisition and share repurchases. Looking ahead, we expect to remain in a modest overall global economic growth environment. Demand in the fourth quarter is seasonally lower historically and we anticipate normal seasonal trends this year. We expect recent favorable end use market trends should continue in refinish and aerospace. Additionally, we expect our general industrial growth to continue to outperform solid global industrial production and similar results in the packaging coatings industry. Architectural coatings volumes in the U. S. are expected to remain mixed by distribution channel. Protective marine coatings volumes are expected to be positive globally aided by growth in protective coatings and very modest declines in marine volumes. Our U. S. automotive OEM coatings business is expected to return to at market performance in the fourth quarter, coupled with continued PPG outperformance in other major auto producing regions. We expect our architectural EMEA sales volumes to remain mixed, sequentially with improved quarterly results in Northern Europe adjusted for seasonal trends, but offset by continued subdued end use market condition in certain countries including France, Italy and Spain. Finally, the automotive OEM and general industrial coatings business in Asia have a difficult fourth quarter comparison as sales volumes grew at low double-digit percentage pace in 2016. One unknown entering the fourth quarter relates to the China tax subsidy on certain small engine vehicles. Last year, the subsidy was originally scheduled to expire at the end of 2016, but was extended at a lower subsidy rate. This subsidy is now slated to expire at the end of 2017. But any change in this could impact fourth quarter demand in a favorable or unfavorable fashion. As always, we have included additional segment and regional details in our presentation materials. Also, for the fourth quarter, we expect additional transitory impact stemming from natural disasters. Specifically, raw material cost inflation and modest unfavorable sales impact, mostly from anticipated lower Mexican and Puerto Rico demand. We expect these have an unfavorable impact to our fourth quarter EPS of about $0.05. Finally, we will maintain our aggressive focus on cost management, and we will have also reduced our projected capital spending target for 2017 to be approximately 2.5% of sales to reflect the subdued growth environment. To summarize our results, we delivered solid business results despite a variety of external factors, which impacted our sales, operations and supply chain. We're now beginning to deliver on margin recovery. We delivered excellent performance in many of our businesses, including continuation of an improvement in volume growth on pre-natural disaster basis. Going forward, we remain focused; first, on increasing prices in a collaborative manner with our customers to recover our margins; and second, on improving our sales volume growth trends, including continued focus on deploying technology and our technology advantaged products. We ended the third quarter with $2.3 billion in cash. Our acquisition pipeline remains healthy. And we will continue to repurchase shares in the fourth quarter. Just as a reminder, we remain committed to deploying a minimum of $3.5 billion on acquisitions and repurchases in 2017 and 2018 combined. As a result, we intend to deploy an additional $2.8 billion of cash by the end of 2018. This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, thank you for your interest in PPG. And now, Jamie, would you please open the line for questions?
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we'll begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Ghansham from Panjabi. Please go ahead with your question.
Ghansham Panjabi: Michael, you gave us some good insight into the fourth quarter in terms of term line. But as we cycle into 0'18, I guess, how are you thinking about the overall macro first off and then the related outlook for some of your major end markets?
Michael McGarry: Ghansham, I think 2018 will be somewhat of a repeat of 2017, volumes modest up in the majority of the markets. So if you start with automotive, the biggest wild card there is China, but I think China is going to grow 2% to 3%, that'll take up the global market in that 1%, 2%. I think the U.S. will be the one market that will be under pressure. Industrial production should be relatively decent. Obviously, you're going to have heavy duty equipment improving at a faster rate. So that's always good for us. And then we're going to continue to have good adoption of our packaging business. So I think that's a real positive. I think from the refinish of steady eddy, you're going to have aerospace slightly up again the Boeing and Airbus have great backlogs, I just wished I would figure out how to make a few more planes each month. And then I would say architectural. We've been pleased with the pace in architectural. We see that growing 2% or 3% next year. So that's kind of a walk around the various businesses.
Ghansham Panjabi: And then maybe a question for Vince on the fourth quarter just in terms of the operating income year-over-year. Should we expect an improvement there year-over-year, or will that be difficult just given some of the higher raw material costs and also the residual disruptions from the hurricanes and earthquake? Thanks so much.
Vince Morales: Ghansham, as you know, we typically don't give guidance. I think for us we've worked to try to close the margin gap. I think you'll see additional margin recovery in Q4 on a year-over-year basis, similar to what we in Q3 versus Q2. And the key factors there again would be additional pricing, still stubbornly persistent raw materials that probably ticking down seasonally a little bit. And then again we'll see normal seasonal trends in most of our businesses.
Operator: Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer. Please go ahead with your question.
Duffy Fischer: Michael, I guess, question for you on the raw material side. Seems like a couple of quarters in a row that we've gotten a lot more dispersion geographically in the direction that raw materials have moved. Is that something that will normalize over the next couple of quarters? Is it just opening up some of your own transportation lines to move stuff around geographically? Or should we think about that is being structural going forward?
Michael McGarry: Well, I do think there is some structural piece of that, especially in China. If you've noticed in the last couple of months in China, they have been exceptionally focused on enforcing environmental rules, which is really positive, not just for the environment but also positive for us. With our water based technologies, that's a great place for us to be. And the fact that they're cracking down on dangerous goods warehouses, they're cracking down on plants that are in non-industrial parks, are not in chemical zones we think that's a positive for us. So there will be more upward raw material inflation in China. We've had a lot of force majeures in Europe. Europe has historically been a place that operates very well. So I don't think, I think that's a more of a transitory impact. I don't view that long-term. And obviously, the hurricanes in the U.S., this is the first major hurricane that hits the U.S. in 10 years. So I'm not a weather forecast, I'm not going to predict anything. But historically, I view that also as transitory. So the only real place I see structural is China.
Duffy Fischer: And then on the back on the comment, does that mean if your raw materials are going up because some of the competitors are getting squeezed out or shutdown. Will your prices go up meaningfully more in China than they will other parts of the world, because again some of your competitors may not be able to sale products or people might have some mixed shift up to your higher quality water based products?
Michael McGarry : Well, I would describe it this way Duffy. We would always expect and we currently have margins in Asia consistent with our margins in the rest of the world. And so, if we have additional raw material inflation in China, we would have to have additional raw material recovery in China. So, I would not expect the material impact. We would -- obviously, as you know, we lag getting price, but I would not expect that to be a long-term issue. So for us, I would focus more on the fact that if they continue to enforce the rules, there will be more water based products and that technology is with the limited subset of suppliers that will be good for us.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.
David Begleiter: Michael, you've had very good success this year in the U.S. you finished. Can you remind us again what the drivers are of that success, and from whom you're taking business from?
Michael McGarry : So the main drivers in refinish first and foremost is miles driven. So year-to-date miles driven are about up 1.5%. The next is collision or think about it as accidents. And higher employment leads to more miles driven leads to more congestion, more congestion leads to more accidents. And of course the real phenomena we see now is distracted driving. So this is a market that historically with flattish but we are doing well in this area. I would just say that given our strong technology base and our strong customer base, we’re probably nibbling and getting a little bit of share from everybody. But overall, I would say, it’s more driven by technology. Our water is the best in class.
Vince Morales: And David, if I could go back, if I can just add. We think this has historically been a very modest growth market in a developed region, that’s continued. We haven’t seen any changes in pattern with our customer base. And we haven’t seen any changes in pattern in terms of the industry itself.
David Begleiter: And that was more of a next question. Michael, is there still real pricing power less than we finished? And again, no change in your view in terms of distributors exerting more pricing pressure, or MSOs is there a more pricing pressure? Thank you.
Michael McGarry: No, I doubt. I would tell you, it’s still a highly fragmented market. I mean, if you grew out this MSO consolidation over 20-year period, you might could extract something. But there is so, I would say, it’s not material in any near-term pattern. So it’s not something we’re worried about. We have positive price in refinish this year, and we would expect that positive price in the business next year as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
Bob Koort: I was going to ask around the raw material side. I guess, some of us thought the TiO2 is going to go up throughout the year, so I am guessing that hasn’t surprised you. Can you talk about which specific raw materials have seen that unexpected inflation, so that we might take a guess on what to give you some relief next year?
Michael McGarry: Yes, I would say the first one that was most unexpected was the emotions. So if you think about them has been a problem. Outside of the U.S., ethylene is down in the U.S. but everywhere else in the world, it’s up. I would say that was probably not on my radar screen, given the significant ethylene expansions in the U.S. Obviously, there is more coming-on. So hopefully, there will be some relief there. I would tell you, TiO2 is up more than we expected. I’ve cautioned some of the TiO2 suppliers, don’t forget 2011, where they -- there was demand destruction. So that has been my focus on that. The other thing that I would say is a little bit of surprise is packaging. So if you think about tin plate and steel, I think those things were probably a little bit higher than I would have expected. So we had low-single-digits in our plan and we’re in the solid mid-single-digits now. So those would be ones that I would focus on.
Bob Koort: And Michael, can I ask you on the architectural markets, looking at both the U.S. and in Europe. In the U.S., this deviation between do-it-for-me and do-it-yourself seems pretty pronounced. Is there historical president for that different direction that persists? And if not, which you think happens is do-it-for-me in your stores numbers coming or does DIY market finally get some lift? And then maybe a similar question in Europe, I generally think of paint is being a very consistent end market and yet it sounds like either the market is not doing well or maybe you’ve got some competitors that tolerate some pressured margins, which doesn’t seem sustainable. So maybe just an appraisal to markets and what you expect? I think you said volumes will be good next year, but we expect may be on the price or margin side going forward.
Michael McGarry: Well, Bob, we normally allow only two questions, and that’s like seven.
Bob Koort: It was all about architectural. That doesn’t count as one.
Michael McGarry: I’d say the big driver in the U. S. is two factors. One is unemployment, so you have low employment and so people would rather pay somebody to get it done. And the second one is baby boomers are getting older and the millennials aren’t paying as much as their parents. They are not a DIY group as much as anybody else. So I would say that’s the U. S. I think that’s going to continue. We see real strength. I mean even our October order book in architectural has been -- has started out real well. So I think that’s going to continue. I don’t see a change in the unemployment situation. So we’re all good there. I think the difference between Europe and the U. S. now is the U. S. is a very much a branded market and Europe has way too much private label. I think the European big boxes have really aired in the way they’ve gone to market. If you look at the average price of the paint in Europe versus the average price of the paint in the big boxes in U. S., it’s clear that the U. S. big boxes have a different strategy. They are executing it very well. In Europe, there’s not been a trend to branded. And that brings in significantly more competition. It also brings in, on a regional basis, a lot more folks. So I think that’s the big disconnect. I do think there are people out there still chasing volume. We’re not going to chase it at this point of cycle. We see people trying to trade down. We’ll let them trade down. We’re trying to recover margins and that’s been our focus. If you look back 2007, 2011, the last two raw material inflation cycles, we were first to get margins back. We think we’re going to be in that top quartile again. And we can’t control what other people -- how they make their own independent decisions on how to price.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christopher Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.
Christopher Parkinson: Can you just talk a little bit about pricing trends across your various industrial platforms, such as auto, general industrial packaging? And just give us any broad expectations you have regarding the time line to recapture price costs, or maybe even achieve net price real longer term, if that’s the theme? I think most of us understand that there’s probably differences in contractual nature and distribution between the various inputs. But just any broad comments would be really appreciated? Thank you.
Michael McGarry: Well, I think the broad comment is we have very sophisticated customers in automotive, as well in the large industrial segment. These guys not only are sophisticated, but they have set up what I would call choice in their distribution or paint networks. And that allows them to move people in and out in some small segments to allow them and put pressure on their suppliers. And what you need to do is have faith that your technology makes it difficult for them to do that. And I would say it takes us longer to get price in those segments. But we do recover it. We already have pricing in those segments today. It will start to pick up a little momentum in late in the fourth quarter, early in the first quarter. And I would tell you in the packaging area, probably the bigger driver on the pace of getting the packaging is that there was consolidation in the major packaging players. And so they were focused on trying to get their synergies. And so you have that trend going on at the same time as new technologies. So we were pushing the new technologies and there might have been some other folks that didn't have the new technology that we're trying to hang on to buy in using price, and that's probably the biggest differentiator in the packaging that's different than normal where historically in fact everybody was pushing the same technology. Now, you have some certain players that are very strong in the BPA nine and 10 and some of the others that maybe don't bring that same new technology to the table.
Christopher Parkinson: And just can you talk a little bit about some of your comments in EMEA architectural, specifically how you expect the volume headwinds to persist? And whether or not your price comments pertain broadly to the lack of acceptance among your customer base? Or is there more functionality of bad behavior among some of your regional competitors? Thank you.
Michael McGarry: I hate to throw our friends under the bus, so I won't do that. I think everybody makes their own independent decisions. And in this regard, we are very much focused on delivering margin recovery, and it's margin first, volume second. We have some very good markets. We're growing share in the UK. We're hanging in there in the Benelux. French retail has been a very challenging environment. We're doing well in Scandinavia, growing share up there. I would say Eastern Europe is more of a free for all and we have been actively pushing price aggressively in our African stores and our African countries. And so it provides that mix-bag, if you will. But right now, bottom line is we yield a little bit of share in order to drive profitability. I regard these as transitory. If I look back in history, we've done this in the past and once this transitory period is over, we will not have lost any share in that regard. And good strong performing products always win in the marketplace long term, and we feel good with our product portfolio.
Operator: Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead with your question.
Frank Mitsch: Michael, for the first of my seven questions, I was wondering you're clearly making progress on reducing the margin compression year-over-year. You said it was 210 bps in the second quarter, 160 bps in Q3, or would have been 130 ex the hurricane. At what point, do you believe you're going to stop talking about year-over-year margin compression and start talking about year-over-year margin expansion?
Michael McGarry: I think, Frank, if I look at history, we're probably first quarter second quarter next year. I'd like to say it's first quarter. But I don't want to set unrealistic expectations. The fact of the matter is this is top of mind. We have a very experienced coatings leadership team, deep experienced in this area. Many of our leaders have been around through multiple cycles. And I think that's what really allows me sleep well at night is the strong leadership of the Company. And I think that would be the focus area.
Frank Mitsch: So for my next six. So look, I'm not going to ask the M&A question, but you did say look I've got 220 billion of spend on M&A and share buyback over the next 15 months. But your company owned stores doing extremely well here in the U.S. certainly relative to your other channel. So I'm just curious what your plans are for growth in terms of opening up new stores? Or how should we think about that? And is that also a focus area for the M&A part of your capital allocation?
Michael McGarry: Well, it's certainly as you know the dealers, anytime they want to sale, they don't have a succession plan in place. So we were always the first choice and we're happy to do that. And we stay close to the big dealers. So we'll continue to look at that. We're not adverse spending in that area. We are adding stores in the U.S. as well. That's top of mind but we're also looking at not just in the U.S. I mean if you look in Canada, we're adding stores at a faster rate than anybody else in Canada. Of course, in Mexico, we added 53 stores alone in the third quarter in Mexico. We add stores in Europe as well. So it's not just the U.S. play for us. As far as the acquisition pipeline, the question you didn't ask that you wanted asked. Pipeline remains solid. We do continue to look at a lot of stuff. We continue to remain disciplined. So when we have something, we'll let you know. But we are actively engaged with a number of parties talking to them about what the next steps might be.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from J. P. Morgan. Please go ahead with your question.
JeffZekauskas: Over the last three years, you've averaged about $330 million annually in acquisition spending. And do you have a very large target in deploying your cash. So if you spend again at a $330 million acquisition level in order to hit your $3.5 billion number. Next year, you would have to buyback something like $1.7 billion in shares. Are you willing to do that and that historically you never seem to buyback more than $1 billion annually in shares.
VinceMorales: Again, as you know acquisitions, are episodic both in number and in size. As Michael just mentioned, we do have a fairly active pipeline that we're vetting, along with potential sellers. We certainly would hope that that's our primary use of cash for the next 15 months and beyond that. But I would tell you, we don't have certainly as you never do around acquisitions. What we are committing to is $2.8 billion of deployment effectively from this month until the end of '18. And we don't know how that's going to follow acquisition of our share repurchase. But the $2.8 billion will be spent. And so if we have to deploy all that in share repos as opposed acquisition because the targets are not willing or not at the right price, we will do so. But I think as Michael mentioned, our preference would earnings accretive acquisitions.
Jeff Zekauskas: And then for my follow-up, when you look at raw material costs inflation across the globe, which are the areas that has the most inflation and which are the areas that have least or is it mostly almost there?
Vince Morales: It’s a great question Jeff, because there are big differences in inflation by region. Michael touched on a little earlier for different reasons. The reasons have moved in different direction. Our highest inflation region is actually Europe, really predicated on all the force majeure activity that has taken place this year. And then we’re seeing inflation in Asia, primarily China. Again, because of supply curtailments that are being in force there. And then the U.S., Canada and then Mexico would be a third in terms of pace of inflation. And just to remind everybody what Michael said earlier. We’re expecting low-single-digit inflation coming into the year. We’re now solidly at mid-single-digit inflation, so inflation certainly been higher this year than our preliminary expectations.
Operator: Our next question comes from PJ Juvekar from Citi. Please go ahead with your question.
PJ Juvekar: Vince, your working capital was up by $300 million. Not a huge amount but was still up. What are the different pieces in that? Is it raw materials related or is it due to slower growth that led to higher working capital?
Vince Morales: PJ, we’re a seasonal business. So I think you’re right. Our working capital versus the end of the year was up as is typically this time a year. If you look on a year-over-year basis, our working capital as a percent of sales is actually down about 50 basis points. We’ve been targeting 100 basis points of decline, which we think we’ll achieve by the end of the year. And we’ll work through as we get through this lower season, work through some of the inventory as we typically do to achieve that goal. So I would look at our working capital versus same quarter prior year.
PJ Juvekar: And Michael, you had lower selling prices in industrial coatings. Despite what you describe as really decent volume growth. One of your competitors gave pricing concessions to automotive OEM customers. I was wondering if you’re seeing an impact from such competitive actions?
Michael McGarry: Well, everybody makes their own independent decisions. And I would tell you that we already have gained price increases in some parts of our industrial segment, and we expect to get further increases in Q1. And so from my standpoint, we have a lot of areas that are growing above the market, and we’re quite pleased with the pace of that. And I think that the price will come in that area. So I’m not worried about it. So I guess we’ll just continue to push the team to get the price up, and that’s what they’re working on.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
Vincent Andrews: You mentioned some new raw material efficiency programs. Just wondering, are you specifically talking about TiO2 or the balance of asset? And what if anything are you working on that’s new and interesting?
Michael McGarry: No, we really target the whole thing I mean even things like anti-bacterial things. Our team was briefing us on, if you think about all the various things that go into paint, it’s very aspect of it has a material cost impact. Now, TiO2 is certainly at the top of the list, resins are at top of the list, some of the other pigments that are in there are all key. We are driving simplification in some of our raw materials, which allows us to bundle a larger spin and that helps us as well. So I would say we’re focused on several different levels, not just TiO2.
Vincent Andrews: And then you also mentioned that you’re pairing that growth CapEx for this year. Are there particular projects that you’re focused on not doing? Or least just going to get pushed into ’18? Or is this stuff that just think does not make sense anymore just given the overall environment?
VinceMorales: Well, I think Vincent, as you follow us over the years, I think you’ll find that we try to be aggressive on all fronts and try to make sure what we’re doing, whether it would growth related expenses or growth related cap spending matches what’s happening in the external environment. And as Michael started the call out, we see a low growth environment. So we are not pushing on some growth projects that could be delayed or deferred to a later time. And again I think it’s just our typically management stuff.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from VRP. Please go ahead with your question.
Kevin McCarthy: Good afternoon. As you put together your business plans for 2018, what uplift if any do you anticipate from end use markets like autos and construction in the wake of the natural disasters? And put differently, if we think about the nickel drag in EPS for 4Q, how do you think that might trend into the first quarter of ‘18?
Michael McGarry: Well, first of all, I don’t think there will be any drag in the first quarter ’18, Kevin. So I think we can put that behind us. I would not anticipate it much in the fourth quarter this year, but the damage in Mexico and Puerto Rico, I mean, we went two weeks about a single store being opened in Puerto Rico. And even now we only have 50% of them open. So I think when you look at having to rebuild stores completely in Mexico, that’s going to have an impact, but not into the first quarter. So I would say as far as looking at 2018, as I said in my very first question from Duffy, I think automotive is -- we’re going to be down a little bit in the U. S., up a little bit in Europe and up a little bit in Asia, primarily driven by China. So overall, I would say the market is going to be up 1% to 2%. Industrial production, I see moderate improvement in that area. And I think housing around the world is going to be solid, but not any barn burn. And the biggest barn burn has historically been the U. S. So, housing prices are up a lot in the U. S. The amount of new permits are, I would say should be higher could be higher, but it hasn’t shown that. So we’re projecting 2% to 3% growth in the total architectural market in the U.S., higher in the do-it-for-me market than do-it-yourself market.
Kevin McCarthy: And then a second question, if I may for Vince, you’ve flexed your capital expenditures down slightly this year. Would you expect to be able to maintain the pace of 2.5% of sales next year in '18?
Vince Morales: Kevin, same as I answered the last question with, it depends on our growth outlook. If we see more robust growth environment, we'll step up GAAP spending, if we don't we're going to toe the line. We hope to start the year a little more optimistic outlook and see what happens with as the year develops. But for us, we’re fortunate because we're a capitalized industry, so 2% to 2.5% sales is -- and relative to other industry is very favorable from a shareholder perspective. But again, we're not going to spend if we don't see the growth trajectory established.
Operator: Our next question comes from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead with your question.
Don Carson: Two questions, Michael, so it seems overall you're expecting '18 to look like '17. So is that a 1% to 2% volume growth for the Company overall, and how much can you leverage that with new internal initiatives?
Michael McGarry: I would say two plus. So I don't see the one to two, because I take some of the things that we've seen this year won't repeat. So I think that would be on the area on the two plus side. And we are always driving productivity, so we're not going to walk away from productivity initiatives. I think that's at the top of the list, and we're going to continue to deploy our capital and then we're going to continue to look for ways to improve efficiencies in the plants as well. So I think we've had a historical preference to grow EPS 10%, and I don't think we're walking away from that.
Don Carson: And then a follow-up on architectural pricing. What kind of price increase you've been able to get at your company stores? Have you matched the two price increases of your competitor over the last 12 months? And are you able to get any price in the big box channels?
Michael McGarry: Well, I think the answer to the first question is we have announced two price increases. We are getting two price increases -- typically I always say that we get 50% to 75% of any increase we announced. The last one -- depending upon product, you can't just draw a line around it. It’s anywhere from 3% to 6% depending upon the product in the market. And the big box is, the answer is yes we do get it, it never as faster or as easy as we like. But they do recognize raw material inflation, they do understand that we have to be profitable and we also are very sensitive of the fact that they have a business they also need to run. So we collaborate very well in that regard.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Byrne from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.
Stephen Byrne: Michael, you were just mentioning here a minute ago about this 2% to 3% outlook for U.S. architectural business. How would you assess that in terms of where we are in the remodeling cycle in the U.S. with respect to the average household use of paint? Are we at that prior peak? Or if not, why not and nd what would it take to get there?
Michael McGarry: We're certainly not at the prior peak. As far as what it takes to get there, as you know, the least peak if you remember there was what 2 million housing starts. So we're a long way away from that. But we do have a lot more modeling going on. There is a lot of value in the houses. So there is still more upward potential in that regard. But you don't see the feeding trends on loans that you saw the last time. So I think we're in a more sustainable place now. So I think that's a positive.
VinceMorales: If you look over a long period of time and you take out the peaks and value surrounding the last financial crisis, which was again in part driven by homes. This is 2% to 3% or 4% growth market, and that's the value of the market from an equity investment perspective is a stability. And so I think we've gone back to, what I would call more stable growth rate over a longer period of time.
Stephen Byrne: And then with respect to this new brand that you're introducing in Home Depot, can that channel handle a new brand? And is it entering at a new price point or quality point?
Michael McGarry: So the PPG timeless thing is a premium stain, and it has started out very well. And I think the Home Depot associates are pleased with that. The PPG timeless paint has also in at a premium point, which is we're excited about it's the first time we've had, what I would call the premium product in the Home Depot stores. It is also started out well. I think it can certainly supported -- I think we have very sophisticated customers who make good decisions. And I think in this regard, we'll have to wait and see how it pans out, but we're pleased with it. We're going to put advertising money support behind the brand at Home Deposit, as well as externally. And so, we're obviously happy with that.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Roberts from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.
John Roberts: Mike, on your earlier response to the question on environmentally regulation driven closures in China, your answer was directed towards hydrocarbons and solvents. Does that mean you really not seeing anything more on the TiO2 side? We had a number of closures that I think suppliers there. But TiO2 prices I think in China actually went down during the quarter.
Michael McGarry: TiO2 prices went up in the quarter in China, and they did have some of the suppliers get shutdown for a mission and some were shutdown, because they were too close to where the party is doing certain activities. Like today in Beijing starting actually about a week and half ago, they shutdown all the body shops in Beijing, and they're told to be shutdown all the way through the end of October. So it's not just the hydrocarbons, but that is a much bigger portion of it. But I would say anybody who is making dangerous goods is under pressure that they're not in a chemical zone first and foremost, or if you have a bad historical record performance. Those are the two places that they're going to first to enact regulatory enforcement.
Vince Morales: John, this is Vince. Again, I think just back to what we said earlier. For the company like PPG that has compliant coatings products, we think if this trend continues longer term, it's favorable for us. We know we have some local competition there that does not currently have compliant water based product. So the continual move toward more high technology coatings I think favors the multinationals.
John Roberts: And then on the second question, the initial dilution on Crown. Is that due to temporary step-up in the inventory valuations, or are they just lower margin business because they’re more service oriented then you got to take cost out to get the margins back to your corporate average?
Michael McGarry: John, it’s definitely more the latter. We typically bring in these small acquisitions at margins below ours within -- we’re able to extract synergies and get them at or closer to our margins. And the Crown acquisition first quarter will be in this quarter or fourth quarter. So again, it’s coming in at a lower level and we’ll started working on synergies. And we already have started working on synergy capture.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn from Longbow Research. Please go ahead with your question.
Dmitry Silversteyn: Couple of follow-ups, if I may. First of all, on the protective marine business, you put up a flat volume quarter-over-quarter that’s in the first quarter here, which I think is the first time in five quarters, which you haven’t had a pretty big downturn in volumes there. How should we think about this business going forward? Is this an aberration or should we truly reach the bottom and we can look forward to maybe more benign, if not, necessarily positive comps as we get out into 2018?
Michael McGarry: So Dmitry, I think it’s actually been seven quarters, if I remember right. And that’s memory I can have John follow-up and give you the exact number. But the first answer is with the decline in marine, your protective business gets larger and the protective business is not as volatile as the marine side. So that’s the first thing. So the mix is now set that protective is really significant. Second, marine is at a bottom. If you look the first time in two years, there has been a net increase in ship orders that were placed in the third quarter. So that’s a positive. And I think that we’re going to start to see continued growth in ship orders. Don’t forget we paint typically 18 months after the orders are placed. So I think we’re at the bottom and it’s always hard to tell calling the bottom. So I won’t be 100% sure on this. But when I look at the order book, I see that -- I also see the China has picked up share. So Korea and Japan have both lost share in this enterprise downturn. And for us that’s good for us from a mix standpoint because we obviously are not winning as much in Japan as we win in China. So that’s a positive trend for us as well. So overall we’re projecting slight improvement quarter-over-quarter in the fourth quarter as well. So I would say that for the short-term we’re in our own business seeing an upturn, and I think the market will also start to mirror that shortly.
Dmitry Silversteyn : And then just to get a little bit more granular on the North American paint market. I understand that you guys talk about your own store values and you don’t really discuss much what’s happening in the DIY and independent dealer channel. But if you look at -- I’m assuming you have those numbers internally. So if you look at the pace of declines year-over-year. Is it changing? Can we talk about maybe inventory reduction that’s replaced in DIY over the last couple of years, maybe have played out any dynamics changing in terms of demand destruction in the independent dealer channel? Or really we have not seen much change from let’s say the last four to six quarters that at least the DIY business has been suffering?
VinceMorales: If you look at those two channels, independent dealer channel has a perennial modest share loss channel for multiple years the channel requires very little maintenance. It’s a very good channel for PPG and the other parties involved. It’s a modestly shrinking channel and it will be here for quite some time, but it will continue to shrink. And that has not changed in terms of its trajectory. The big box channel, as Michael alluded to earlier, we think the DIY market is being primarily affected by low unemployment. We, PPG this year, we personally have not seen much inventory destocking or restocking. That does happen from year-to-year to different products. So it’s certainly plausible in the space. If you remember Dmitry, we have some destocking last year. So, it just depends what products are selling versus which products are not. But the fact of the matter is it’s down low to mid single-digit percentages. And that has not changed again from the beginning of the year.
Dmitry Silversteyn: So basically, we can continue to see similar trends we saw over the past several quarters. Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Sison from KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question.
Michael Sison: In terms of the capital deployment, you have over 2 billion in cash today than I would imagine you would generate a good amount of free cash flow again in ‘18. Is there a potential to do even a lot more than the 2.8 as we head into ‘18?
Vincent Morales: As you follow us over the years, we’d like to put a cash deployment target out there at a minimum. We’d like to meet that target. We raised the target in July to minimum 3.5. And if there’s something that’s earnings accretive above that, we would certainly have the balance sheet firepower to do that and would be -- you should expect us act upon that.
Michael Sison: And then when you think about -- I know it’s little bit early to talk specifics on ’18, but volumes sound like they could be little bit better. You’ll recoup some margin from higher raw materials, you got capital deployments. And you certainly noted 10% is the annual goal. But given all that, whether EPS growth be -- I don’t know what the right script to be, but stronger than 10%?
Vince Morales: Well again, I think when you look across the industrial basket of the companies, 10% EPS growth in a low growth environment like we’re trying about is admirable. And it depends on a lot of factors. We do think there will be slight inflation heading into next year. We’re still going to be working on getting our pricing up. The one you didn’t mention is currency right now would be a slight tailwind. So that would be a benefit to us as well. But I do think all the levers that you talked about are ones we see as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Harrison from Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead with your question.
Mike Harrison: Michael, going back to the architectural EMEA commentary and you talked about that fragmented market with all the private label that’s out there. Does that suggest that there are additional consolidation opportunities where you could take out some of that private business potentially, or there a situation where you would need to work with those customers if you wanted to figure out a way to reduce the amount of shelf space that some of those private labels have?
Michael McGarry: Well, there's always consolidation opportunities both ways, first the customer if they want to consolidate shelf space, they know where we live. So that's the easy one. We're always going in and doing aggressive product line reviews. But probably more realistic opportunity is the fact that some of these private owned paint companies are not getting recovery on the raw materials. And even though these are good cash flow positive businesses, even in this environment, it may be an appropriate time for them to look at whether or not this is time to monetize, or whether they family situations that maybe appropriate for them to look at selling. So we try to stay close to all the large families in Europe, so that they know if they're in a position that they are ready to sell that first person to call is PPG. So we stay close to that.
Mike Harrison: And then wanted to just ask on the industrial segment, overall, that margin looks like it was -- as far as I can tell the lowest since 2013 despite some volume growth there. So I was wondering if you can just walk us through how much of that year-on-year margin pressure is coming from [indiscernible] versus raw. Is there some mix component factored in there? Obviously, the natural disasters had some impact on the logistics costs. What other factors are in there? Again, maybe a year-over-year basis makes the most sense. Just trying to understand what that margin could look like next quarter and into next year?
Vince Morales: I think the answer is very simple. We get, as Michael mentioned, we got a very large amount of sophisticated customers, take us further in terms of time to price with those customers. We're still seeing very high inflation rates on raw materials. So that's the gap because we got to continue to push pricing in order to recover the margins. All the other things you mentioned, I think are certainly a piece of the puzzle. But the bigger piece for us to get price to offset raws.
Operator: Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.
Laurence Alexander: Two questions, maybe very quick ones. First, most of the leverage we've talked about have been either end markets or consolidation. Is there anything on the technology or R&D side that you can do over the next couple of years that if you're still in a slow growth environment at the end of the decade, your growth algorithm relative to that environment changes? And secondly, I guess this summer there was some noise around the European Union debating labeling risks on TiO2 as an ingredient, and that possibly affecting packaging. Has there been any update on that? And if there has been movement, what opportunities would that create for you?
Michael McGarry: Well, if you start with the TiO2 question, there was an original push by France to label that product as a probable carcinogen, if I get my facts right. And that's been downgraded to possible. We're in complete disagreement with the science. They're looking at one old report. We have billion of man hours of safely handling TiO2 in our plants. Of course the TiO2 suppliers have the same thing. But given the fact that it's embedded in a liquid metrics, there is no concern in the paint product. We've been done testing standing cars and things like that. So there is no push to impact paint. If there were -- if we were to eventually quote unquote lose this argument with the authorities in Europe, it would lead to us, having to put more safeguarding and dispensing the TiO2 into the paint. That is not -- we already protect our employees, our employees feel very comfortable handling TiO2. But we'll do whatever is necessary to continue that. So we don't feel like that's in any way a threat to the business. But the fact of the matter is we think the science flawed. So when you try to stick a TiO2 powder into a rat, I'm not sure that replicates what happens to a human, but so be it. In regards to technology though, we are strongly focused on R&D. We spend nearly $500 million a year on this. We're spending more than any other coatings company. We've led the -- if you look at the BPA non-intent and you look at a water borne for refinish the compact process for automotive, what we've done as far as some of the advantage products that pass the fire protection in our PMC business, we have a number of success stories in that regard. And we would expect to continue to drive innovation, which should allow us to grow faster than market, which has been our historical stance. So I don't see a lot of difference going forward. I'm excited about our R&D pipeline. I have a quarterly meeting with these guys, and they really good at what they do.
Operator: Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question. 
Arun Viswanathan: I've got two questions, one on margins and one on M&A. So first on the margins, industrial was down couple of 100 basis points year-on-year, performance also down. Is there a specific target that you have on recovery of those margins? And if you do, maybe you can just help us understand how much of that you will get through price or cost reductions?
Vince Morales: We're working all levers to recover the margins. We’ve got through self help activities, obviously, that Michael talked about in the opening comments. We're pushing price with all of our different segments of customers. Our target, as Michael said, is to get margins back to flat in the first half of next year, hopefully earlier in that first half as opposed to later. And I think we're on path now to do that. We're as Michael again mentioned earlier, six or maybe seven months behind where we would like to have been, if you look at past situations. But we're comfortable we'll work back to margin parody.
Arun Viswanathan: Do you actually need raws to come down for that to happen, or is it price should get you most of the way there?
Vince Morales: No, I think with our pricing actions predominantly as well as some productivity, those will be sufficient to recover the raws inflation.
Arun Viswanathan: And just real quickly if may on M&A, Crown was in the coating services area, you've talked about doing adjacencies before adhesives and so on. Is that still an area of focus, or are you more focused on coatings producers? Thanks.
Michael McGarry: No, I would tell you that we are very comfortable in the adhesives and ceilings area. I think it was early last year when we did the acquisition of LJF in France on the sealant side. That’s been a huge win for us. We bought 60% of it. Our partner, Total, is very happy that we bought it. There are lot of more profitable at owning 40% than they were at 100%. So they have been pleased with what we brought them. So we’re very comfortable in that space. The adhesives are certainly in area. We have the specialty coatings and material business that would be another area that we would stick-in. And obviously -- coatings is our bread and butter. So those are the focus areas. Our aerospace business is a good business in a number of areas. So I think you’re going to expect us to stay in the businesses that we’re most focus on now in the near, what I call, the near adjacencies. So if it touches paint or touches the adhesive or touches the sealant that would be what the areas we’ll be focusing on.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Sheehan from SunTrust. Please go ahead with your question.
James Sheehan: On the subject of AkzoNobel, there’s been some deterioration in their results management changes. Activists are still clamoring for changes. Is this the situation you might revisit in the future when you’re able to?
Michael McGarry: Jim, I think we were very clear. We withdrew our offer June 1. We have moved on. Our shareholders expect us to continue to create value today, and we’re not paid to wait around. So we’re going to continue to do that. So we’re happy with our acquisition pipeline, and our goal is to improve our business every single day. And you saw that and these results we closed the gap on the margin deterioration. You’re going to expect this to close that gap again, the next quarter as well. And so I’m pleased. I guess, the last time and I would say is I want to thank all our employees. We had all these hurricanes and earthquakes and our employees did a phenomenal job of supporting each other and supporting the company. And I just want to thank them in that regard. So maybe that answers your question, Jim.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen that will conclude today’s question-and-answer session. At this time, I’d like to turn the conference call back over to John Bruno for any closing remarks.

Operator: Good afternoon and welcome to the PPG Industries' Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Gary and I will be your conference specialist today. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Bruno, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
John Bruno: Good afternoon. This is John Bruno, Director of Investor Relations. We appreciate your interest in PPG and welcome you to our second quarter 2017 financial results conference call. Joining me on the line from PPG are Michael McGarry, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vince Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our comments relate to the financial information released on Thursday, July 20, 2017. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, both current and prior year PPG financial figures presented today were recast to reflect our former Glass segment as discontinued operations. As a reminder, in the second half of 2016, we sold our flat glass and European fiber glass businesses, along with divesting our two Asian fiber glass joint ventures. Our North American fiber glass business is pending sales and we expect that sale to be completed in the second-half of 2017. About one hour ago, we posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on the Investor Center of our website, ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide additional support to the opening comments Michael will make momentarily. Following Michael's perspective on the company's quarterly results, we will move to a Q&A session. Both the prepared commentary and the discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements, reflecting the company's current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials which are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC. Now, let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Michael McGarry.
Michael McGarry: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported second quarter and year-to-date 2017 financial results. Our net sales for the second quarter were $3.8 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.83, up 6% year-over-year. Our overall sales were up less than 1% in the quarter, with benefits from acquisition related sales, partly offset by unfavorable currency translation. As a U.S. headquartered global company, currency translation has been a headwind on sales and earnings for more than a year. However, given the U.S. dollar weakening during the second quarter and assuming those current exchange rates hold, we expect only a modest currency translation effect in our sales and earnings in the third quarter. For the second quarter, our selling prices were only up slightly versus the prior year. However, this marks an improvement sequentially versus the past few quarters. This improvement is important, as it is the result of our initial efforts to offset significant raw material cost inflation that the coatings industry has experienced. Our overall company volumes are flat in the second quarter. Industrial Coatings volume improved by about 3%, while Performance Coatings volumes declined by about 2%. One factor impacting our second quarter volumes was the effect of our efforts to raise prices resulted in us turn away certain business. We expect to sell customers our products at fair prices that allow us to make a reasonable return on the tremendous amount of service and value we provide to these customers. We have additional pricing actions that are being initiated and implemented in all businesses in all regions in the third quarter to further offset raw material inflation and will continue to work collaboratively with our customers on an individual basis. Also modestly affecting our second quarter volume growth was a shift in the timing of the Easter Holiday. Easter was in the first quarter in 2016 and the second quarter 2017. This holiday-shift impact us more prominent in the Performance Coatings segment due to the retail and distribution nature of our business in that area. It has a much less significant effect in our Industrial Coatings segment. However, while this shift had a modest unfavorable impact in the second quarter, it aided first quarter volume comparisons and had no impact in our year-to-date volume growth, which came in about 1%, which is well below our target. We continue to work on a variety of actions to improve our organic volume growth rate and are delivering results on various initiatives. Some highlights include the Industrial Coatings segment, where volumes grew at well above industry rates, including our general Industrial Coatings business where our growth exceeded global industrial production growth by a factor of 2 to 1. We delivered this level of growth in this business several quarters in a row now. Also, our automotive OEM coatings business is once again outpacing global automotive build rates. In the second quarter, our volumes were up over 1% versus the decline of about 1% in the global industry auto-builds. A few of the key factors of our outperformance are our innovative products, the excellent technical service we deliver to our customers and the decision in investments we made a few years ago back to emphasize and shift our regional mix of businesses toward higher growth regions. Another solid growth trend for us has been our U.S. company-owned architectural stores. While we have some more work to do here, we have posted six consecutive quarters of improved same-store sales. Over the past several years, we have made significant structural improvements to the business we acquired and we have made certain targeted brand investments. We are now beginning to yield benefits from these initiatives. We're also realizing continued benefits from various innovative products and refinish in aerospace among others. However, given our overall performance year-to-date, volume growth remains a key focus for the company. And we continue to work on a variety of initiatives to address this issue and accelerate our growth rate. From an earnings perspective, while our adjusted EPS grew by 6%, we experience compression in our overall gross margin and also in the return on sales in both our reporting segments. The largest driver was significant raw material cost inflation. And we expect the second quarter to be our most difficult comparison for this cost category. We will continue to experience year-over-year raw material inflation in the third quarter. As I mentioned, we will be implementing additional selling price increases in the coming quarters. And we are entering a seasonally slower period which will decrease the overall demand for the commodities we buy. Additionally, we have expanded our research work team focus on raw material efficiency and innovation. And they are working on projects to decrease or expand the supply base for certain raw materials we purchase. Also, we were able to mitigate some margin compression with overall productivity improvements due to our aggressive manufacturing overhead cost management. In addition, we accelerated some actions from our restructuring program we announced in 2016. We will continue similar efforts in the coming quarters. Our cash deployment also provided some benefit to our earnings per share growth. This included several acquisitions we completed over the past 12 months, along with the synergies we have captured to date. Additionally, year-over-year, we have reduced our overall share count by about 4%. Looking ahead, we expect to remain in a consistent but modest overall global economic growth environment. Our highest growth rates continue to be in emerging regions, although these economies have moderated in recent quarters. However, we expect solid growth to continue in China, India and certain Latin American countries. Notable and specific to PPG is that we will reach the anniversary of the significant declines in marine new-build, which has had an unfavorable impact in our organic growth rate in Asia and specifically Korea the past two years. We have seen evidence of broadening early economic cycle activity in Europe. Although we are a few steps down the chain, the backdrop for this regional economy appears favorable. This continues to be an opportunity for PPG, as we have said many times in the past that our best incremental margins are in Europe, given the lack of a broad recovery to date coupled with the latent capacity we have there. And the U.S. and Canada growth has become more industry specific. The overall construction market remains solid, as does general industrial activity. However, automotive builds have move past mid-cycle. And we have still not evidenced a meaningful improvement in business investment or return of large-scale energy investment. As a result of the various puts and takes in the global economy, and specifically in the coatings industry, we will continue to manage our overall cost structure, including delivering on our targeted $40 million to $50 million in restructuring savings this year. Also, we ended the quarter with a very strong balance sheet, including approximately $1.6 billion of cash. We expect a higher level of earnings accretive cash deployment in the second half of 2017 versus the first half. We previously communicated an intent to deploy $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion of cash on acquisitions and share repurchases in 2017 and 2018, and are now targeting the upper end of that range at minimum. This deployment will likely include both acquisitions and share repurchases. Our acquisition pipeline remains solid. And we're resuming share repurchases in the third quarter and have approximately $1.7 billion remaining under its current share repurchase authorization. To summarize our results, we had a solid quarter against the backdrop of raw material cost inflation and modest global economic growth. We delivered excellent performance in several of our businesses. And overall, we work to successfully counter the effects of inflation. And we achieved a 6% EPS growth. Going forward, we have further work to do on organic growth and I believe we're up to the task based on the traction we have delivered to date on various initiatives. Also, we expect continued earnings accretive benefits from a higher level of cash deployment in the second half of 2017. This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, thank you for your interest in PPG. And, Gary, would you please open the line for questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Good afternoon, Mike and Vince. Mike, on the raw versus selling price increases, do you expect to catch up in Q3 or Q4? And I guess would we still expect some margin compression in Q3 year over year?
Michael McGarry: I think Q3 we're still going to have some margin compression. But we are working hard on the price increases. And I think Q4 you'll start to see a meaningful improvement in that regard.
David Begleiter: And, Mike, just on the lost business, when you tried to raise prices, and what businesses, what regions did it occur and how concerned are you about lack of discipline in the industry on pricing?
Michael McGarry: I'm not concerned at all, David. I mean historically you know, because such a large percentage of our costs is raw materials, our coatings peers will need to be managing their margins. And I think that's important. You have one of our competitors who is obviously going through significant change with the - as they were being acquired by Sherwin. So maybe there is some lack of focus there. I don't know, we will wait and see. Then you have another one that has additional challenges, where they're focused highly on growth, organic growth and volume. I specifically listened to that. So I think there is some divergence out here. But that's not going to continue. I think the coatings industry has had a history of pricing. And our customers know that this is a significant issue for us. We work collaboratively with our customers and we would expect to do so in the third and fourth quarters as well.
Vincent Morales: And, David, if you look at our history as an industry and certainly as a company, we've said for a longer time it typically takes six to nine months to offset these inflationary effects. And we're really in the three, four, five month category. So we do expect additional pricing from ourselves in the back half of the year consistent with past practice.
David Begleiter: Very good. Thank you.
Vincent Morales: Thanks, David.
Operator: The next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Ghansham Panjabi: Hey, guys, good afternoon. I guess, Michael, just given some of your macro comments in press release and based on flat volume growth during 2Q, on top of a flat volume growth quarter a year ago, how are you sort of thinking about volumes in aggregate for the second-half? I guess, do you expect volumes to grow on a year-over-year basis during the back half?
Michael McGarry: Well, I do expect volume to grow. We have had a lot of traction in a number of our businesses. I will point to one area that's been a significant drag and that's marine. We've had 18 quarters in a row of volume declines in Korea. We had a nice uptick in our order book in the second quarter. Now, don't forget we paint ships 12 to 18 months after. But we saw deliveries getting I would say at the bottom. And we expect deliveries of ships in the fourth quarter to be up, that would be the first one. So I think that's a nice one. And I also - when I think about our packaging business we reported basically zero in packaging for the second quarter. But they were comping versus a plus 9%. So I think we still have more upward project ability in that business. Miles driven continues to be a positive for refinish. Aerospace deliveries were weak and if you look what their goals for the big aerospace companies are, their second half of the year have to be stronger if they're going to meet their targets. So I think I see a number of things that are positive, so I'm optimistic.
Ghansham Panjabi: Okay. That's helpful. And I guess, on the capital allocation side, I've been assuming only a small portion - only a portion of your $3.5 billion plus of capital allocation goes towards share buybacks. That's still a very large number that can influence quarterly earnings. How should we sort of think about layering in buybacks as we work through our models, realizing you'd want to be opportunistic depending on the stock price? Thanks.
Vincent Morales: Thank you, Jim [ph]. What I would tell you is we don't give out our cadence on share repurchases. If you look at the economics, for us the acquisitions have typically been able to drive incremental value above a share repurchase just because of the synergy value of the acquisitions, [so got to get] [ph] good pricing. So if there's an opportunity to do a value creating acquisition that still remains a preference, assuming again the returns are [better than] [ph] share repo. And then if we're able to find those transactions and are able to close them, then we do share repurchases. But again historically, we've not given our cadence about what we're going to do by quarter with share repurchases.
Ghansham Panjabi: Okay. Thanks so much.
Operator: The next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Robert Koort: Thank you very much. I was wondering, Michael, if you might be able to help us figure out what the heck is going on in the paint stores versus the DIY markets, why there seems to be such a divergent trend lately?
Michael McGarry: Well, I think you have several factors going on there. First of all, the biggest trend is that do it for me. So you have the aging baby boomers, cash in the pocket, they'd rather have somebody else go out and do it. They were the big users of DIY, so that one. You have a millennials, who have not yet moved into the housing formation market, because of call it college debt or a number of factors. So I think that's another one. And I think some of the home centers have complicated their category if you will, and made it more difficult for consumers when they come in, to initiate a paint purchase. And so we've been in a lot of discussion with our DIY customers for the need to simplify their category. So that people can come in and move the decision cycle from, say, 100 days down to 60 days. And I think that's a huge one. So I think there are a number of factors, but certainly, you saw the strength in our own company stores. It's outperforming the DIY segment. But we have a huge vested interest in our customers to be successful in DIY. And so, we're trying to talk to them about that.
Robert Koort: All right. And can you talk a little bit about, maybe, Vince, the corporate segment, reporting segment, obviously there was a marked improvement there. What were the buckets that led to that improvement? What's the sustainability or run rate of that expense line?
Vincent Morales: Yes, Bob, the biggest impact on our corporate line was simply incentive-based compensation. As you can tell, we're running below or 10% EPS target. Our volume growth is below our target as well, so we're reflecting that. And our margins are compressed, so we're reflecting that. And our incentive-based comp, I would say that line item for the back-half of the year, we took two quarters' worth in this quarter. We took the first quarter and second quarter adjustments cumulatively in the second quarter. But for the back-half of the year, I would expect that corporate line to be slightly lower than last year, but not much so.
Robert Koort: Got it. Thank you very much.
Vincent Morales: Thanks, Bob.
Operator: The next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Kevin McCarthy: Yes, good afternoon. Vince, would you comment on where you think you're tracking for capital expenditures this year? And would you have any preliminary view on the trajectory for 2018 there?
Vincent Morales: Yes, Kevin. So historically, we have been somewhere between 2.5% to 3% of sales on capital spending in both 2015 and 2016, we were slightly above that number, because we were doing some cost localization projects, primarily in emerging regions. You may have saw in the quarter, we opened a new plant in Russia as well. But now we are expecting for 2017 in aggregate to be right around that 3% of sales figure. And I would say in 2018 we are going to stick right around our depreciation level maybe slightly above.
Kevin McCarthy: Okay. And then to come back to the notion that you exerted discipline on price and may have lost some volume in industrial, Michael, would you say that that effect was fully captured or evident in your 2Q financials or is there an effect or spillover into the back half? And perhaps you could provide a little color on which individual businesses within the segment felt that the most?
Michael McGarry: So in regards to the first question, our paint customers typically make a decision and then they don't flip flop people back and forth. So any share that we lost in 2Q and some of our businesses will likely continue. But as our competitors feel the same raw material inflation that we have, should they make their own independent decisions, then they may be impacted by customers. Our customers could say, okay, well, we see it coming now. So we'll make adjustments differently. That's something we can't predict, but what I will tell you is the raw material inflation is not new to the coatings business. This is - when it happens everybody needs to react. And so we'll be continuing to work in this area. I would say the areas that were impacted the most or the areas that have - I would say more ability to switch than others. And so that means they're likely to switch back as well. I'm not sure, I want to get into the individual businesses, but if you think big global guys have less flexibility, the smaller guys have more flexibility, so that maybe one way to think about it.
Kevin McCarthy: Thanks very much.
Operator: The next question comes from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Frank Mitsch: Good morning, gentlemen, and congrats, John, on your new position. Michael, you mentioned that Europe is the area where you have the highest incremental margins. As I am looking at the handy-dandy heat map by geography, I am looking at Europe a little bit sequentially worse than it was in Q1 the heat map. But, yet, Q3 of 2016, Europe was relatively week. How should we think about what's going to happen in Europe in the back half of the year?
Michael McGarry: Well, I think the positive news about Europe is if you look at, like, automotive, and you still have more latent demand in automotive. I think, Eastern Europe have had a nice recovery, and I think that's going to help. I think, maybe the order book order book in France will start to get healthier now with the change in administration, certainly UK, Ireland continues to be a strong market for us. So I think a number of things I see from that regard has positive momentum. So that's how I would think about that Frank.
Vincent Morales: Frank, we're not pleased with the volume growth, but I would tell you that one of our bigger businesses there, which is architectural was down modestly in Q2, but they had two less selling days. And their sales per selling day were actually up over 2%. So again, I think there's been some caveat there with respect to one of our bigger businesses in the Q2 period.
Frank Mitsch: All right, so more pronounced Easter effect taking place over there. And I think we also saw from some competitor that the Nordic region had some more - had poor weather, so that might recover. And then just a follow-up on a comment on the packaging side, which is obviously been a very strong part for the company. And as you mentioned very difficult comps, so growth was zero in Q2. I - from the commentary, it sounds like you expect that to continue in terms of the shift onto a BPA intent - non-intent, what inning are we in? And you've made a lot of progress there. Is there still a lot more to go, how should we think about that change in technology playing out?
Michael McGarry: We are still in the early innings, Frank. I think right now we have between 50 and 70 trials and conversions still ongoing around the world. So there's a number of activities, and part of that unfortunately is the fact that the new coatings, they're multiple coatings, so you don't use just one coating and have to roll it out everywhere we have multiple coatings and none of our packaging customers, they have different line configurations, different oven configurations, different airflow configurations. So I would say the conversions are not progressing quite as fast as anybody would like. The good news is, when we get it, they are very happy with it. And so we still have a lot more conversions to go, but good news is, when we get it right the customers are ecstatic.
Frank Mitsch: Very helpful. Thank you, gentlemen.
John Bruno: Thank you, Frank.
Operator: The next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Vincent Andrews: Thanks. I just wanted to get back to the capital allocation discussion, and the subtlety I saw was that at least the upper end of the minimum. And I just wanted to know whether that was a comment on your M&A pipeline, or what you see there, or if it was indicating a willingness to ultimately be more aggressive with the size of the buyback or both, I suppose?
Vincent Morales: Well, if you look at our balance sheet, we have a very strong balance sheet. We are committed to growing the company, we're returning the money to shareholders. We do - I think our - as evidenced in the quarter, if there's an opportunity to create value for our shareholders, we will certainly try to take advantage of it. But it's really a reflection of two things, Vincent: one, our strong cash and our strong balance sheet, and our need to - Secondly our need to be creative and value creative for our shareholders with that asset.
Michael McGarry: And Vincent, this is Michael. The other thing I would say is that it, beginning of the year we thought we'd be selling fiber glass, but we didn't have a deal. Obviously, now we have a deal and we have a sight line on when that deal is going to close. So there's more certainty on the cash flow from that. So that's a positive. And as you see today, the announcement of the Crown Coating services, we're going to continue to put our money to work and acquisitions.
Vincent Andrews: Okay. Thanks very much, guys.
Vincent Morales: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Christopher Parkinson: Perfect. Thank you. Can you just come out with anything else you could potentially do to improve the performance in the U.S.? It appears that in the context obviously of a select market that Paramount and DIAMOND have done relatively well in their respective homes. And then also, over the past two seasons you've made efforts to improve branding, quality, et cetera. But is there anything else your team is specifically targeting to do in the back half of the year or even into next season? Thank you.
Michael McGarry: Yes, Christopher, I would tell you that we continue to work proactively with our retail partners. One of them launched Home Depot to be a specific launched, PPG Timeless Stain. It has been a little bit of a difficult stain year, given the amount of rain, and so it has impacted exterior paint as well as exterior stain. And so that's a positive, we also have pitched other new ideas to our customers, and they are proactively evaluating them. We won't know until they roll it out in the store, but those are all positive for us. DIAMOND has been a significant success. Assure at Lowe's has done very well, Paramount has done well, so I think we have a number of success stories, I think our customers are comfortable with the fact that we can play at the good better best range and that's been a positive for us. But it is an evolution, when we bought the Glidden business they had under invested in the brand, they had under invested in the resources. So we have brought all that up to speed, and now we're just now starting to see that. As you can tell, we have the same thing going on in the stores with this. Our PPG-owned stores have had significant improvement in sales on a quarter-over-quarter basis.
Christopher Parkinson: And just as a follow-up. You've also - you have done well in the relative basis in global auto OEM just by moderation or just flat-out slowing in key regions. Can you just comment on your position in the Asian markets specifically, given your exposure with multinationals versus some of the domestic producers, who appear to potentially be poised to gain share, just any kind of long-term comments there? Thank you.
Michael McGarry: Yes. So we're a strong number one in OEM in Asia. And we're a strong number one in both the global OEMs as well as the domestics in China. And we're a very solid performer in India, which is also growing. So I would say, we've been happy, we significantly outpaced industry rate in Asia by multiple points in our OEM business. And specifically in China, we were well above what happened in the industry. And the industry was flat, and we were up high-single-digit. So our platform in Asia is really strong.
Christopher Parkinson: Great color. Thank you.
Vincent Morales: Chris, the basis of that outperformance really goes back a couple of years, we've made some significant investments, we talked earlier about CapEx we've done in Asia. We've made some significant bets with customers. And so it's been plan-able [ph] and executable by our team over there.
Christopher Parkinson: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey Zekauskas: Thanks very much. I'd like to go back to the capital expenditure question in that in your earnings brief you say that you expect your CapEx to be about 3.0% to sales. So if your sales roughly $8.7 billion that would be $262 million, or call it $265 million. Is that the number you expect for CapEx or that's not correct? the fear of that's not correct?
Vincent Morales: We typically, Jeff, if you look at our kind of our cadence of capital spending, because our businesses are very busy in the beginning of the year, operationally, we typically do a greater amount of capital spending in the back half of the year. And if you look at our sales on a full-year basis, I don't know what your model has, but I would use your sales on a full-year basis times around 3% to get our capital spending figure.
Jeffrey Zekauskas: Okay. Can you - just as my follow-up. Can you talk about what's going on and do-it-yourself market, and why the results in general or the volumes seem so weak. And do you think that there is a shift downward and either pricing or complexity of the paint product that's leading to a lower mix?
Vincent Morales: Well, Michael mentioned this a little earlier about some of the factors that may be affecting the different channels in architectural. I'll add to what he said earlier, you talked earlier about baby boomers and millennials, and different preferences. But in addition to that we've typically seen the do-it-for-me category go up. And when you have a low unemployment, and unemployment in the U.S., as you know, 10 years low, and we also - I would tell you we've also seen it in the repair market, bigger repairs being done. And paint is a very cost effective and small dollar repair, but we're typically seeing bigger repairs being done such as kitchens and bath don't use much paint. So those will be other - two other contributing factors to what Michael mentioned earlier.
Jeffrey Zekauskas: Okay. Got it. Thank you very much.
Vincent Morales: Thank you, Jeff.
Operator: The next question comes from PJ Juvekar with Citi. Please go ahead.
PJ Juvekar: Hey, good afternoon, Michael, Vince.
Michael McGarry: PJ.
Vincent Morales: PJ.
PJ Juvekar: The independent channel has been struggling for quite a few years. What's your strategy for that channel, do you want to be there? And then, if you compare your pricing across your three channels, can you just qualitatively talk about where you're seeing the most pressure and where you see the best pricing?
Michael McGarry: Yes. So, PJ, the dealer channel continues to be a very good channel for us. The beauty about that channel even though it's moderating, it's moderating in a very slow rate. It's highly predictable. We're able to manage our cost structure along with the moderation and demand, and so the profitability that segment remains quite good. So from our standpoint, we want to be in all three. We want to be in the company owned stores. We want to be with the dealers. And we want to be with DIY. So we want to play across them all. Probably the biggest thing that we probably haven't talked about is in the DIY segment, because Vince talked about the bigger projects being done, and if you look at some of the large retailers. They have a lot of big ticket growth. What we want to encourage them to do is make sure when somebody walks in and wants a $25 gallon of paint that we are not chasing them out, because we're trying to up sell everybody. So that's an area of focus is to make sure that we do that. But I would tell you all three segments are attractive to us, and we're going to continue to focus on all of them.
PJ Juvekar: Thank you. And if I look at your comments on pricing, you guys seem unusually aggressive on pricing. And correct me if I am wrong, but you let your customers walk away in certain channels. When I look at your raw materials, yes, I give your TiO2 is going up, but oil is down, propylene is down. So you should see some benefit on hydrocarbon side. So can you talk about this pricing strategy in an environment where hydrocarbons are lower, and the global growth is also quite slow?
Michael McGarry: Well, first of all, I would tell you, I don't think we're - pricing any differently than we have historically. So that would be my first comment. Second, I would urge you to look at propylene and ethylene on a global basis, because if you look at some of those on a global basis, you'll find that like propylene in Asia is up year over year. You'll find that ethylene in Asia is similar, you European ethylene is up year-over-year. So it's not quite the same overall, and this period last year, you had oil at about $35 or so $40, and now you have it at $50. So we are seeing oil derivatives they typically are - again two or three steps down the value chain. So you don't get the immediate decrease that you see in oil. So solvents, yes, but for some of the other key commodities, it doesn't happen overnight. So I would just tell you, we still see raw material inflation, and TiO2 is certainly going to be still marginally up in 3Q.
PJ Juvekar: And you think TiO2 continues to go up in second half in second half in a slow seasonal period? Thank you.
Michael McGarry: Well, historically, it doesn't go up in the fourth quarter. As you know, we produce the vast majority of our paint through the first seven or eight months of the year, tapers off there. A number of them have historically come to us and tried to quietly move some volume to incentivize us to make some production ahead of the next year's paint schedule. Whether or not they will do that is too early to tell, this is only July. But that is not unusual behavior, so I would tell you we should just wait and see how they respond.
PJ Juvekar: Thank you.
Vincent Morales: Thanks, PJ.
Operator: The next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Duffy Fischer: Yes, good afternoon, fellows. Just want to go to your Slide 5, it's a little hard to tease everything out, but on there, it looks like you have five category - four categories you say you're below market and 11 that you're above. So would you say globally across all your markets you're still outgrowing those markets?
Vincent Morales: Duffy, I'll take a stab, and I'll let Michael add some color here, but we're fairly confident in our industrial businesses, we're outgrowing or well outgrowing the markets on a global basis, or maybe some discrepancies below or above that comment within each of the individual regions. But we've had very good volume growth in our general industrial business in mid-single-digits. We know in automotive, so we get a report card every month. And as Michael said, even though in packaging our volumes were flat that's really a factor of the prior year comparable. We're comfortable in our performance segment with our European architectural business, and certainly in our architectural businesses in emerging regions. U.S. we're - basically, we don't have all the data, yet, to make a determination, but in refinish we're above market. So there's certainly some work we have to do. But we're not losing share in many of these key markets and in many cases well outperforming the market. Michael, do you want to add?
Michael McGarry: No. I think that's a good summary, Vince.
Duffy Fischer: Okay. And I guess that's the way I would read it, but then the corollary, and help me square this, is if you guys are growing at least a little bit above market, you're at zero volumes that would mean the market globally is kind of down. And to get to that raw material question of if volumes globally are down in coatings. It's - help me square kind of the pressure on some of the raw material cost you think actually they may be moving the other direction if volumes for you guys are down - or volumes for the industry are down year-over-year?
Michael McGarry: Well, part of the raw material challenge we're having, right now, is some of the force majeures on some of the larger items. So you did have the challenging environment in Europe where one of the TiO2 plants still down. You have the environmental issues in China, where they're trying to radically reduce the emission levels, so the TiO2 costs are going up there. And then, if you look at some of the things like epoxies, epoxies are up. Emulsions are up. So those are all having that kind of impact. So I think on balance, we're not happy. Obviously, we're paying more, but we don't think we pay anything different than our competitors. And we also think that after the fourth quarter it's going to be moderating, and on a year-over-year basis, the first quarter will probably be flat. But right now, it's maybe a little too early to tell that.
Duffy Fischer: Great. Thanks, fellows.
Vincent Morales: Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Don Carson with SIG. Please go ahead.
Don Carson: Yes, two questions on volume. Michael, you mentioned some organic initiatives to try and get volume going. You've talked about architectural. Can you talk about your other businesses and what impact you think these overall initiatives can have on volume growth? And then secondly, Vince, on the acquisition side. What's the pipeline look like? And are you seeing the multiples go up or at least people's price expectations go up, as they look at some of these big deals that have been done?
Michael McGarry: Don, on the specific businesses, I mean, we still are going to be launching a new commercial transport product in our refinish business in back half of this year. Refinish historically has been a very good business for us. We've consistently grown that business, we think that will be the next catalyst in that. If you look at our aerospace business, we just launch what we call Aerocron. It's e-coat for the aerospace business. We have commercial customers up now. This is an industry unfortunately that thinks in terms of decades, and not in terms of years. So some of our bigger customers will take several years are growing to that process. But they're all doing testing, and they're all excited about the way that that e-coat can reduce the weight of the parts in the plane, so that's another technology we're bringing to the market. If you think about in the marine protective side, we have a number of new products, vantage products that go into our pacifier protection, so that's a positive for us. And I would tell you from the general industrial, we have developed some new products for lightweighting in that area as well. So when you think about the major themes, sustainability and lightweighting and those areas that has all been a positive for us. But I would tell you a lot of our customers move at a little bit slower pace than we'd like them to.
Vincent Morales: And, Don, relative to your second question, I think the evidence was certainly out there over the past 18 months, if you look retroactively there's been a significant amount of continued consolidation in the coating space. We said at the beginning of - not this year, but last year there are very active pipeline. We're sitting in the same place today, we think there's a very active pipeline of small to mid-size deals out there. We announced one today. And I think, we're proud to say we remain disciplined with respect to multiples, and we intend to do so going forward. But there is certainly an active - series of active discussions underway with us and other potential targets in this space.
Don Carson: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Arun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks. I guess, I had a question again on the volume growth. So if I look at the two heat maps from Q1 to Q2, there were some changes, but Q4 and Q1, you saw positive volume growth across the portfolio in the 1% to 2% range. Now you went to flat. So maybe you can just characterize what happened. Did you see some weakness in some of your bigger categories? And then similarly, going forward, do you need to see those big categories really turn around? Or is there something internally you can do to drive more of your categories in the above market section?
Vincent Morales: Arun, this is Vince again. So again, I think we provide the heat map we try to be as transparent as possible. This does include by region and by end market our projections of what the market's doing. But I think we provide the most granular level detail of anybody of our expectations that we're performing for you guys. I would say, if you look at Q1 to Q2 - in Q1 versus Q2, we did see a higher level of build - auto build growth rate. Q2 build growth rate slightly negative globally and slightly positive in Q1 that is a bigger business for us. And that's probably, we talked about packaging the differences there, and we talked about architectural enough. Those are probably the three biggest differences if you look quarter-over-quarter. We do expect auto to reaccelerate, as we said in our prepared comments. We expect the business to grow globally in Q3. And as Michael said about architectural, we expect some improvement there especially in Europe.
Arun Viswanathan: Okay. And the auto OEM share loss in the U.S., when does that run its course? And again, do you think that the current initiatives you have in place will get you back to positive volume growth for the year?
Vincent Morales: We measure auto OEM on a global basis, because these are global customers and there are decisions you make that - to move around the world based on your competencies, and your technology. So we could pick on one region, but I would tell you that we're well above market in the Asian region, which is the biggest market in the world. As I said earlier that was orchestrated, and we're also well above market in Latin America, which predominantly is Mexico, which is the fastest growing region in the world, right now. So again, we've made very significant and plan-able decisions in the past that are allowing us to outperform globally, and we expect to continue to do so in the second half of the year.
Michael McGarry: And I guess, I'd add to that a little bit. The reason why we gained so much share in Asia was because of our compact process, where you put down multiple layers of paint at once. And that was easier to sell that benefit in Asia, when they were building new plants. Now that they see how well that is working, now they're going to, they're thinking about brownfield conversions. And you'll see that happen in Europe, before you'll see it in the U.S., because obviously energy costs are higher in Europe than they are in the U.S. But we're starting to see a number of our global customers thinking about this. And as this trend accelerates, obviously that's a good benefit for us, because we have the best technology in that regard.
Arun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks.
Vincent Morales: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Stephen Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Stephen Byrne: Yes. Thank you. I just wanted to drill into the higher ROS expectation, particularly TiO2 in this third quarter. You made a comment, Michael, about some research efforts, and I think you said expanding the supply base. Can you comment about whether you see more opportunities to either reformulate less into the coding or maybe blend more lower quality ingredients into the mix just to lower ROS? Do you have any more bandwidth there?
Michael McGarry: Sure. So we started on this initiative probably five years ago, and we've made a significant improvement in that regard probably depend upon the formulation anywhere from 7% to 10% less TiO2. The next generation of that was either the substitute or the total conversion of fluoride to sulfate. And now I would say it's the optimization of the formulation that we're working on now. We're also working on whether or not there's more TiO2 sulfate guys in China that can reach that level of quality that we need, and so we're going with a broader set of suppliers in Asia to bring them up to the level, and we have a number of trials ongoing in that regard. So that is still to be played out. And then, of course, we have the formula optimization that we need to do as we get more cross-fertilization across the businesses, across the world. And I think that still has many more innings to play out in that respect. So this is an ongoing area of focus for the company, we spend $500 million on R&D. And this is a portion of our R&D effort is raw material formula optimization.
Stephen Byrne: And then, just more broadly on cost given your outlook for higher ROS, your sales are kind of flattish. Are you looking at some new productivity initiatives or ways to maybe accelerate or pull forward some of your existing cost reduction efforts.
Michael McGarry: This is PPG, so productivity is a mandate. This isn't optional, no business, no matter how good they are get out of this. So they all have their productivity goals for the year, and I would say the vast majority of our businesses are delivering in that regard. Our manufacturing teams are doing a very good job of driving productivity. I think, we are ahead of the restructuring initiative that we said, I think we gave you a target of $40 million to $50 million for the year. And we've - we are well on our way to achieving that target. So I think we're on track in that regard. And I always have higher expectations for the team, and they know that. And I think, they're all focused to deliver more in the second half of the year.
Stephen Byrne: Thank you.
Vincent Morales: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.
Dmitry Silversteyn: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. A couple of follow ups if I may, a lot of my questions have been answered. Specifically on the Latin America and Mexican business for architectural paint, after some pretty good quarters, after you completed the Comex requisition, I see you that in this quarter, you identified that business is growing with the market. It's just - is that just a question of anniversarying some of the initiatives and expansions that you've undertook when you first bought the business or is the competitive dynamic in the region changing any way that's making it more difficult to grow above market?
Michael McGarry: No, Dmitry, I think it's the former. We've posted a couple of really good strong growth years there. We're confident against those, we're confident in the Comex business model and the business remains very successful.
Dmitry Silversteyn: Okay. So going forward, Vince, if I understood what you said correctly, we should kind of expect more in line with the market type of growth in that business.
Vincent Morales: It's a minimum at market. And it certainly can go above market depending on how many stores we open, et cetera.
Dmitry Silversteyn: Got you fair enough.
Michael McGarry: Dmitry, this is Michael, I would tell you that in Mexico we opened 52 stores in the second quarter. And we also opened a number of stores in Central America. Last year in Central America, I think we grew 29%. So we had to overcome that. So I would tell you that the expectation for the team is to continue to perform at least two times GDP. We're not walking away from that target.
Dmitry Silversteyn: Okay. Fair enough. On the packaging side of the business, obviously, you had zero growth against a very tough comp in the second quarter. But as you get into the back end of the year, should we expect sort of a return to low-single-digit market like growth or do you expect to outgrow the market with continuing share gains or benefits of ramp up with existing customers?
Michael McGarry: No, I think we should continue no marginally pick up share. We do though expect it to be in the low-single-digit range as opposed to prior years when it was growing high-single-digits.
Dmitry Silversteyn: Right, right. And then final question on the - in the DIY channel, I mean, in North America paint business, I understand sort of the dynamics that are driving lower performance there, versus the contracted business. But are you seeing significant difference in the cadence of revenues you get from your various channels partners in the DIY market, whether it's big box versus mass merchant or mass merchant versus like Ace or True Value kind of hardware store channel? Is there any channel that's doing reasonably better in this environment or a lot worse in this environment that we can focus on?
Michael McGarry: No, again, there is still more data to come out for the quarter, Dmitry. So it's hard for us to speak. Can we give some projections about the industry, hard for us to speak holistically. But if you look at most of our national customers, we're seeing generally similar trends. There's always a little bit of difference in delta in that. But I'd say there's not a wide disparity in the dealer channel. As Michael talked about earlier, that's a channel that has a very small incremental erosion on a year-over-year basis that we can very well manage. That's typically a very sticky channel in terms of customer relationships. So I would say, we're not seeing anything unique by the customer or different customer sets.
Dmitry Silversteyn: Okay. So there is not - it's not like mass merchant is losing share to big box or picking up share from hardware stores. It's kind of across the board and the various channels are fairly close to each other in terms of performance.
Michael McGarry: Yeah, and I think the difference between the channels, trade versus DIY has been in this - we've been in this situation for well over a year. So it's not any different than prior quarters. It's not accelerating or decelerating.
Dmitry Silversteyn: Right, okay, thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Sison with ‎KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Michael Sison: Hey, guys. Thinking about the second half of 2017, you talked about volumes returning to more positive territory, you're going to deploy more capital and maybe catch up on raw materials a little bit. So should EPS. growth in the second half be better in terms of year-over-year ex-fiberglass than the first-half?
Vincent Morales: Well, Michael said earlier, Mike, that we hope to minimize somewhat the margin compression we saw in Q2. So for that factor alone we would hope to see improved operating earnings. We do have - again, we're going to work on our cash deployment, and again, we're not going to give a cadence there. But I think you hit on all the key elements to look at for the second half of the year in terms of earnings leverage.
Michael Sison: Then in terms of M&A, is there a side, smaller bolt-on acquisitions? Is there opportunities for bigger type of transactions?
Michael McGarry: Well, we've always said that there's no transaction that we wouldn't look at. But we're always going to remain disciplined in that regard. We're going to look at it whether it's accretive to our shareholders. And I would tell you that the vast majority of the ones we're looking at are tend to be bolt-on types. And we still have an active pipeline and we're still going to manage that appropriately.
Michael Sison: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. Please go ahead.
John Roberts: Afternoon, guys.
Vincent Morales: Hi, John.
John Roberts: I don't understand the European DIY paint business as well as I should here. Is that relatively small for you? And is there a different dynamic in the European market between DIY, like we're talking about here with the U.S.?
Michael McGarry: No, it's a big segment. It's our second biggest segment after the U.S. and Canada. And we're bigger in trade in Europe than we are in the retail. And so, we're doing fairly well in most of our markets. But the retail segment over there is more challenging than it is in the U.S., because there's more private label in Europe than there is in the U.S. And they will tend to switch people out faster than they will here in the U.S. where you know you might lose a price point here, or a price point there. But there you can you see a lot more action in that regard. But overall, I would tell you, France is our biggest market. And when you look at the trade France, it's been flat to marginally down. And since that's our biggest market, it has more impact. But the good news is, in the U.K., Ireland, we've been significantly growing share and that's getting to be a bigger market. Benelux has been a very good market for us. And I would say the positive in Eastern Europe is we saw a nice little turnaround now. The key is whether it's sustainable, because we'll have to wait and see. But that's a good thing.
John Roberts: But it doesn't sound like it's underperforming the pro-applied paint market to be extent we're seeing in the U.S. The divergence doesn't sound as big at least to me in the discussion here. And then it doesn't sound like we have this issue of maybe having priced too high or having your customers priced too high in Europe like they may have done in some of the big box retail locations here in the U.S.
Michael McGarry: Yeah, I would agree with that. They don't have as much super premium paint in Europe as we do in the States, because it's more private label. And the U.S. market has done a really good job driving premium paints. So I think that is one key difference. The other thing is you don't have the full employment over there that you do have here. So the DIY segment and the do-it-for-me hasn't diverged as much as it has here.
John Roberts: Got it. Thank you.
Michael McGarry: Thank you, John.
Operator: The next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Laurence Alexander: Hello, just quickly the - on the M&A tailwind for Q3, is the acquisition announced today is that - does that offset MetoKote in size or is one noticeably different in size than the other?
Vincent Morales: I'll let Michael give the size, Laurence. But I will remind you that MetoKote, which we bought last year, did anniversary July 1, so that would not be considered acquisition related on the go-forward basis. And I'll let Michael talk about the acquisition today.
Michael McGarry: Yes, so for Crown it has sales between $125 million and $150 million. We have essentially paid $1 per $1 of sales. It's a nice acquisition. The segmentation of it is I think in the sweet spot. It has a high majority of trucks, SUVs and a nice exposure to heavy-duty equipment. As you know, the heavy-duty equipment market is recovering in a nice rate. And then for the trucks and SUVs, that's by far the strongest part of the automotive market. So I think it segmented appropriately. And now that we have more density, the big, big OEM guys and the big heavy-duty equipment guys are going to be anxious to push more share I think our way long term, because we're able to supply them over a broader portfolio of products as well as a broader portfolio of locations.
Vincent Morales: And Laurence, with respect to trading off dollar for dollar in terms of impact on our - we haven't closed the transaction yet. So until we close the transaction, we won't see any effect of the acquisition.
Laurence Alexander: Yeah, got it. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.
Mike Harrison: Hi, good afternoon. Michael, I think it was you who referenced the confusing offering at one of your key big box retailers. Can you talk a little bit about what potentially could be done to address all the different brands and price points that are available, and maybe share your view on how that plays out going forward.
Michael McGarry: Well, I could. But maybe our retail partners would not be happy, because we don't make the decisions in their aisles. But we have encouraged them to think about how they can simplify the number of price points, simplify the number of choices, make the color decision faster and easier, and provide - I would tell you, less competition in the aisle and more conversion in the aisle. I think that's the key. We don't want to make sure that everybody that goes in the store to buy paint buys somebody's paint. That's the real key, is to make sure they walk out the door with paint. And anything we can do to help them understand what's impacting their conversion is intelligence that we're sharing with them.
Mike Harrison: All right, and then I was also just curious, with respect to the Akzo deal, were you prohibited from doing share repurchases while that proposal was in place. And also, does the management change at Akzo recently, what does that mean for your interest in that asset going forward.
Michael McGarry: Well, we did not purchase shares during that period of time. Obviously, we felt like we had inside information so we were prohibited from buying shares. In regard to the management change, we will not comment on it. I think you should call them and find out. But we have put Akzo in the rearview mirror. And we're looking forward to growing our business.
Mike Harrison: Thank you very much.
Vincent Morales: Thank you, Mike.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Jim Sheehan with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
James Sheehan: Thanks. A question on TiO2, how are your relationships with your suppliers, this cycle compared to the last up-cycle in TiO2 around 2011? Do you expect the price inflation this time around to be more manageable than it was in the past?
Michael McGarry: Well, I certainly do. I think if you look at some of their own commentary, I think they've taken an approach that is appropriate. I think they recognize, the last time they chased away permanently TiO2 volume which was not in their best long term interest. As far as relationships with them, I would tell you that we always try to keep good relationships with our suppliers. It's important, because the good times will turn into bad times. And most of our product raw materials are cyclical. And so, it's important for us to work collaboratively with them the same way we work with our own customers in a collaborative manner.
James Sheehan: Great. And in architectural coatings in the U.S., did you see any seasonal effects or unusual seasonal - or unseasonable patterns as the quarter progressed? One of your competitors has mentioned sales slowing in the second half of June and maybe an acceleration in July. Are you seeing that trend in your order book as well?
Michael McGarry: Well, I would tell you that they were certainly rain that impacted. Exterior painted awfully difficult to do to begin with and then rain makes it impossible. We do have a good strong start to July for our stores. But it's also relatively consistent with what we saw in the first two quarters. As you know, we've had good company owned stores sales in Q1 and Q2. And we're pleased with the performance of the team and then we see similar patterns in July.
James Sheehan: Is your volume weakness in that business causing you any fixed absorption issues for you?
Vincent Morales: So, Jim, if you look again, our U.S. architectural business in the stores network is up 5%, so our cost absorption is actually better.
James Sheehan: Thank you.
Vincent Morales: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Vincent Morales for any closing remarks.
Vincent Morales: I just want to once again thank everybody for their time on the call today. And we will be taking investor calls. Please look at the presentation materials for the call information, to schedule a call. And again, appreciate your time and interest in PPG. Thank you.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon and welcome to the PPG Industries’ First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Denise and I will be your conference specialist today. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Scott Minder, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Scott Minder: Good afternoon. This is Scott Minder, Direct of Investor Relations. We appreciate your interest in PPG and welcome you to our first quarter 2017 financial results teleconference. Joining me in the call from PPG are Michael McGarry, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vince Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our comments related to the financial information released on Thursday April 20, 2017. I will remind everyone that we have posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on the Investor Center of our website ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide additional support to the opening comments Michael will make momentarily. Following Michael’s perspective on the Company’s quarterly results, we will move to Q&A session. In this session, we request that you focus your question of PPG’s first quarter results. We do not intend to provide any additional or new information regarding our proposals to combine with AkzoNobel at this time, other than what Michael will say in his opening comments. Both the prepared commentary and the discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements, reflecting the Company’s current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG’s operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The Company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The Company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials which are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG’s filings with the SEC. Now, let me introduce PPG’s Chairman and CEO, Michael McGarry.
Michael McGarry: Thank you, Scott and welcome. First and foremost, I still submit, it is impossible to know what is best for you stakeholders until you fully evaluate all the options. We believe AkzoNobel’s new, strategic plan will be more risky and creates more uncertainty for Akzo’s, stakeholders including employees and pensioners. Facts are that Akzo’s newly revised strategy would create two smaller unproven companies and a detailed additional restructuring. The contemplating restructuring overall and specifically the restructuring actions associated with the headquarter related stranded costs are very surprisingly inconsistent with Akzo’s previously stated comments of safeguarding job security especially in the Netherlands. Separately, Akzo is also critical to PPG’s proposal, given the combination that companies would involve an antitrust review process. However, included under Akzo’s dual-track process is a clear option articulated to sell their specialty chemicals business, which would be subject to a detailed antitrust regulatory process, including associated regulatory review timing. In addition, decreases in free cash flow from demerged companies is often underestimating, putting future and accelerated growth plans at risks. Next, Akzo management was recently critical and raised credit ratings as a concern with PPG proposal. However, Akzo detailed yesterday, they are anticipating resulting downgrade in credit ratings with their standalone strategy. In conjunction, a downgraded credit rating may also have ramifications on pension funding requirements and we noted a great deal of discussing yesterday by Akzo about potential impact of their standalone strategy on pensions and funding obligations. We find it interesting that the revised €100 million 2017 EBIT target comes so soon after Akzo’s 2017 target setting meeting on February 15th and also that nearly half of the €100 million figure occurred in the first quarter which is typically a seasonally slower quarter. It is confusing as Akzo expressed concern over R&D spending in their response to the PPG proposal. Akzo say they want to invest €1 billion in coating R&D through 2020. However, this cumulative €1 billion sounds lower than their annual R&D spending in 2016 of €363 million. Are they are still willing to commit to their overall combined R&D spending from last year? And more generally we believe equity markets react swiftly and typically appropriately to any additional news, and the market reaction reflects it in the stock prices. And lastly, at PPG, we continue to believe past performance is the best predictor of future performance. As Scott mentioned earlier, we do not intend to provide any additional information regarding our proposal to acquire AkzoNobel, in the question and answer portion of this call. Turning our attention to PPG. Today, we reported record first quarter 2017 financial results. We achieved net sales of $3.6 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $1.35. We delivered solid financial results to start 2017 including a more than 6% year-over-year increase in adjusting earnings per diluted share and a 3% improvement in local currency sales or an increase of 1% as reported. Our sales growth was driven in large part by higher aggregate coatings volumes at 2%, which is our strongest performance since the fourth quarter of 2016 and the modest benefit from recent portfolio optimization actions where acquisition-related sales exceeded the actions of sales from divested businesses. We achieved these improved results despite the ongoing, unfavorable impacts in currency translation and moderate but uneven global demand. Our EPS growth rate improved versus the prior two quarters, primarily due to the benefits of ongoing cash deployment including share repurchases of a $165 million in the first quarter. For the quarter, our average diluted shares outstanding declined by nearly 4% versus the prior year. Earnings leverage on our sales growth and continued operational cost discipline resulted in lower manufacturing overhead costs including the initial benefits from our 2016 business restructuring program. Several factors served as offset to these earnings improvements including increased raw material costs, which we partially offset with our initial pricing actions across several business regions and businesses. Unfavorable foreign currency translation of approximately $15 million and higher transitory global transportation on logistics cost to meet elevated customer demand in Asia. To address our regional production capacity issue, we’re nearing completion of expansion one of our facilities in China. This expansion is expected to be fully operational late in the second quarter and will serve to greatly reduce ultimately -- and ultimately eliminate these additional costs beginning in the third quarter. In addition to our operational improvement efforts, we actively work to strengthen our balance sheet, increasing our cash and short-term investments by more than $350 million and ending the quarter with approximately $1.4 billion on hand. This enhanced cash position provides us with increased financial flexibility to fund acquisitions of all sizes. In support of our cash balance improvements, we continued our working capital discipline, achieving a 100 basis-point year over year improvement in operating working capital as a percentage of sales. Additionally, our focus on delivering shareholder value is highlighted again in the first quarter with the acquisition of Futian Xinshi, a China-based automotive refinish coatings company and the previously mentioned share repurchases. Despite these improved quarterly results, we aspire to a higher EPS growth rate and remain committed to further improving our financial results and deploying our strong balance sheet. Now, I’d like to discuss some of our first quarter business trends. Our aggregate coatings sales volume growth was led by a continued strong performance in our technology focused industrial coatings segment where each business unit grew by mid single digit percentage versus the prior year and easily exceeding their respective industry growth comparisons. Sales volumes in automotive OEM coatings have once again began to outpace global industry growth rates, led by above market increases in the growing regions of Europe, Asia, Latin America, partially offset by below market experience in US and Canada where overall industry production volumes declined. General industrial coating sales volumes increased ahead of industrial production growth rates for the fifth consecutive quarter. Improvements were broad based across sub segments and regions, particularly in Asia Pacific. Additionally, our sales volume growth rate improved sequentially in the US and Canada. Sales volumes increased in packaging coatings building on strong growth in the prior year as customers continue their adoption of PPG’s interior can coatings products. We continue to see technology-based growth opportunities for this business. Looking ahead, global automotive industry growth is expected to continue in the second quarter and for the full year with clear differences by region. We believe that industry sales have plateaued in the US and Canada with lower year over year industry production in the second quarter and for the full year with a continuing shift in industry production between the US and Mexico. We anticipate continued full year industry production growth in Europe despite a decline in the second quarter. In Asia, we expect industry production to continue to expand in the region for both the second quarter and full year, building on the region’s robust 2016 growth rate. In China, we are closely monitoring expanding dealer inventories and the potential for slowing industry production, as a result. Finally, we see a gradual recovery of the automotive industry production levels in Brazil after likely bottoming in that country. We anticipate a continuation of current industry demand trends in industrial and packaging coatings with PPG outperformance expected to continue in the second quarter, primarily due to strong customer adoption of our new coatings technology and value-added services. Turning to performance coatings, year-over-year sales volumes were in line with prior year, including modest positive year-over-year impact from the Easter holiday shift between quarters in some of our businesses and regions. Shift in the holiday between the first and second quarter, primarily impacted our B2C businesses while it typically doesn’t impact our B2B businesses. Based on this year’s calendar, the holiday-related shift aided volumes in some of our B2C businesses are negatively impacting other businesses. We anticipate the net improvement of this timing shift to be about 1% of incremental volume in the first quarter for performance coatings segment and negligible impact on our other reporting segments. Look at particularly business unit performance in aggregate, ongoing and significant demand weakness in marine coatings offset growth in other business units. Automotive refinish coatings’ organic sales growth continue with improved customer demand in each region, led by above market gains in U.S. and Canada where we experienced record March sales results. Aerospace volumes were consistent with the prior year as low industry build growth rates continued despite significant customer backlogs. Additionally, we were negatively impacted by customer’s inventory management actions, primarily in the transparencies sub-segment, which offset the modest demand increases. In architectural coatings U.S. and Canada, we achieved a solid mid-single-digit sales volume increase in our company-owned stores, which marked our best performance to-date since the store revitalization efforts, post the AkzoNobel North American Decorative Coatings acquisitions. This growth was more than offset by lower demand in the independent dealer network and mix volume results within our national retail accounts or DIY channel, including the comparisons to prior year and new product inventory pipeline builds at multiple customers. Sales volumes improved in Latin America, Asia-Pacific and architectural coatings Europe, Middle East, and Africa, where we saw improvements in several Western European countries including UK, Ireland, Benelux countries and building on growth in the prior year. Sales volumes continued to decline in protective and marine coatings due to ongoing significant weakness in marine ship building activity focused on Asia-Pacific. These declines more than offset our broad based regional growth in protective coatings. Looking ahead, we anticipate higher segment sales sequentially in the second quarter, as we truly kick off the heart of the architectural paint season in many parts of the world. We expect the continuation of the current industry trends in aerospace and automotive refinish coatings and modest growth to remain in architectural EMEA with continued expansion in Western Europe and a slight improvement in Eastern Europe demand levels, particularly in Poland. We anticipate significant ongoing weakness in the marine sub-segment to offset growth in protective coatings, but are encouraged by the recent ship order activity in Korea. Although, this is a favorable, longer term industry sign and related increasing coatings demand will be delayed as vessels are typically paid at 12 to 18 months after orders are received. Underlying demand trends n architectural U.S. and Canada are expected to remain as we enter the peak portion of the annual paint season. We expect solid same store sales growth to continue, building on our first quarter 2017 and second half 2016 momentum, and lower demand levels to persist within the independent dealer network. In our national retail outlets or DIY channel, we’re optimistic about the sales prospects for our new products launch in 2016 and for our newest premium product PPG Timeless stain, currently launched at the Home Depot. This is the first product to prominently carry the PPG name in a major U.S. home center and is a continuation of our efforts to increase customer awareness of our corporate brand name. In our PPG Comex business, we anticipate a continuation of local currency sales growth of at least two times Mexican GDP levels. In our glass segment, volumes declined by 2%, primarily due to lower North American fiber glass customer demand in the wind energy sub segment, partially offset by an improvement in oil and gas related end user market demand. We expect these trends to continue in the second quarter. Looking at a demand from a regional prospective, sales volumes continue to expand in emerging regions of Asia Pacific and Latin America, exceeding growth rates in the developed regions. Demand growth in Asia was led by PPG outperformance in the industrials coatings segment and tempered by significant declines in the marine shipbuilding activity. Volumes expanded in Latin America across most of our businesses, led by significant increases of automotive industry production in Mexico. Volume growth accelerated modestly in Europe and was broad based across the majority of our coatings business units, reflecting the moderate economic recovery in the region. Sales volumes were flat in Europe and Canada, indicative of the uneven end-use market demand environment, which included declines in automotive industry production, which were offset by demand improvements in other end-use market segments. We have included additional segment and regional details in our presentation materials. Overall, we delivered solid business results in the first quarter, despite uneven global market demand and ongoing foreign currency headwinds. We continue to focus on improving our organic growth rate by delivering innovative new products that satisfy our customers’ needs and by further developing our consumer brands around the world. As is the hallmark of PPG, we remain disciplined in our operations and diligent of our cost and are on pace to achieve $40 million to $50 million in 2017 savings from our current restructuring program. We implemented price increases in first quarter and announced additional price actions effective in the second quarter to address our increasing raw material costs. We will continue to look for ways to beneficially deploy our cash to enhance shareholder value and remain committed to deploy at least $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion on acquisitions and share repurchases in 2017 and 2018 combined. We currently have active pipeline of bolt-on acquisitions and remain -- willing to engage with AkzoNobel to discuss the combination of our companies. This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, thank you for your interest in PPG and now, Denise, would you please open the line for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Robert Koort of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Robert Koort: Thank you. Michael, I was wondering if you could talk about something you touched on at the end there about the efforts to invigorate the organic growth. Obviously, you had a little pickup in the first quarter. Can you talk maybe about through the quarter trends? And what do you attribute the commentary about there, feeling to be a better economic tone in the U.S. but not really showing up any business activity yet?
Michael McGarry: As you know, Bob, all the surveys on economic optimism have -- continue to go up since the election. We have not seen the order book reflect anywhere near the spike that the optimism shows. We do see solid demand though, just not increasing at that rate. We saw March was a good month, and that’s always encouraging for March to be a good month as that uses the start of the paint season. And I would tell you that overall, our organic growth efforts are taking hold. As you know, we started on this about two years ago. And industrial businesses, that’s automotive, industrial packaging all really understand this and doing a really, really fine job. The refinish is also doing a good job, I think being held back a little bit in aerospace, not because we don’t know how to do it but because a couple of our customers haven’t figured out how to build planes, even though they have a huge backlog. So, I would say the most encouraging one though was our same store sales and our architecture business in the U.S. and Canada. They performed very well. And the fact that we revitalize the store network, those dividends are starting to play out. So overall, we know how to do it, the teams are getting better at it. And I think it’s starting to take hold. It’s being masked though by the significant weakness in the marine segment which is taking fair amount off the top line. But on the protective side, all good. So, thanks.
Robert Koort: And you mentioned that the stores can sustain that good growth after the investment effort. Is there something wrong with the DIY channel because it seems like that market is not as robust or is there something seasonal or temporary going on there? And I appreciate your time, thanks.
Michael McGarry: I guess, the way I would describe that is there is more money in the pockets of the consumers and there does seem to be more of a trend to do-it-for-me, if you will as opposed to do-it-yourself. And we have talked to our customers about the need to get more aggressive in the what I would call, the good category that people have come in the stores, wanting to buy the good level paint and sometimes walk out when they are trying too hard to up-sell them. So, we think that this is an opportunity for them to refocus on some of the people that haven’t bought paint in that category. So, for us, we think the continuation of same store sales look good; our April start is solid as well. So that’s why we’ve put in the commentary that we are looking forward to a good second quarter.
Operator: The next question will be from Duffy Fischer of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Mike Leithead: Hey, guys. It’s actually Mike Leithead for Duffy this afternoon. I guess first, can you just walk through the changes you are seeing in your raw material basket? I know TiO2 catches most of the headlines but we have also seen some inflation on the organic side. So, just trying to get a sense of where we are today versus maybe your expectations heading into this year?
Michael McGarry: Sure. So clearly, TiO2 has upward pressure, more that there is a combination of supply-demand, but more because of some of the outages that they have in Europe. I would also say, propylene is up significantly more. This tends to be first quarter, second quarter event every year. We certainly hope that propylene by dehydrogenation trend to help that. But this year that hasn’t been the case, so propylene is up. Certainly emulsions are up, epoxies are up in Asia. So, there is a few more. And then, when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, this time last year, oil was in the 30s; now in the low-50s. So solvents on a year-over-year basis is up. Now, sequentially, going forward, it’s not going to be up. And that’s why we think the second quarter is probably the peak for raw materials. But that’s kind of the flavor we see.
Mike Leithead: Great. And then, in Mexico, it looks like Comex growth remains pretty strong there, even if FX clouds it a bit in your reported results. Can you just update us on kind of how the PPG initiatives are progressing down there? I guess cost synergies, and I think you had a longer term revenue target; you’re also looking at there, how those programs are going?
Michael McGarry: Yes. So, overall, the PPG Comex team continues to perform at exceptionally high level. We continue to far exceed our target, which is two times GDP. The team has opened up 45 new stores in the first quarter of this year. Last year, we opened up about 212, if I remember right. So, we’re ahead of our pace, what we anticipated in Q1. Our store relocations have also been ahead of pace. We had price increases in Mexico that have been successful as well. The revenue increases that you talked about the synergies, our protective and marine team has done a good job down there in Mexico. We brought new industrial products that they’re selling down there; that’s been a benefit. And when you look at Central America; that has been a significant win. Originally we said $40 million to $50 million in new sales synergies in the years three through five. We have that $60 million to $70 million. We’re ahead of that pace right now. Sales actually in Central America last year were up nearly 40%; in the first quarter, they were up more than 20%. So, we were on top of a huge comp we were up against. So, we feel very good about our Comex team.
Vince Morales: Mike, one last comment. We have captured fully the cost synergies amounts when we did the transaction.
Operator: The next question will be from Steve Byrne of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. 
Steve Byrne: Yes. Thank you. This chart you put together that shows your outlook for -- on the first quarter, demand by market and region suggests you saw the U.S. architectural market actually contract in the first quarter slightly year-over-year. Why would that have been, what would you see is driving contraction in that market?
Michael McGarry: Well, the growth comes from the same-store sales; the contraction comes from the independent dealer network along with the big box retail DIY channel. So, that’s it. But, we are projecting 2% to 3% growth for the full year or architectural in the U.S. and Canada.
Steve Byrne: But was something that holding back the overall market in the first quarter?
Vince Morales: Steve, the colors on the chart reflect -- I think you’re looking at the yellow on the chart, reflecting are below market.
Steve Byrne: Yes. But isn’t that also suggesting….
Vince Morales: Those are our independent dealer channels, Michael mentioned.
Steve Byrne: So, you’re below market but aren’t you also saying that the overall market slowed year-over-year in the quarter?
Vince Morales: We think the market is growing at 2% to 3% a year. We do think the market expanded and I don’t have a slide in front of me. I apologize. We do think the market expanded in the first quarter.
Steve Byrne: Well, then switching gears here, while you’re pursuing this Akzo bid, should we assume other M&A should be either modest or tabled in interim for example, were you not interested in that Valspar wood coatings business?
Michael McGarry: What I would tell you is we’re not slowing down our M&A efforts, the pipeline remains actively engaged. And as far as the specific one, I will not comment on that. But, what you should generally think about is that we’d look at most everything in our space.
Operator: The next question will come from Christopher Parkinson of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Christopher Parkinson: You mentioned you expect to have consistent industry demand trends in the U.S. and Canadian architectural business in 2Q outlook. But, can you just parse out some additional trends based on the specific channels? I think you already said you’re expecting company-owned stores to continue to outperform. But more importantly, just any key puts and takes in terms of differentials, and gross spend by channel? I think you had some of that in 2016. And then also just any broad thoughts on expectations for new product lines in stains or even Glidden Diamond because I think you launched that kind of a little bit into the season last year.
Vince Morales: Chris, this is Vince, I’ll try to answer all your questions. Again, our view is that market continues to remain -- U.S. architectural market continues to remain solid. It’s led as Michael mentioned by professional -- the professional channel where we’re up mid single digits. I think that was our fifth or sixth quarter in a row where we expanded our growth rate in that channel. And Michael commented briefly on the investments we’ve made in past years, leading up to our growth rate. And we do expect that channel continue to outperform. As I just mentioned, the independent dealer channel is a modestly shrinking channel and that trend is not expected to change. The home center channel is expected to grow slightly below the overall industry. We do have some noise in Q1 and Q2 year-over-year because we do have product launches last year in both Q1 and Q2. We mentioned -- you mentioned the Glidden Diamond, which we split between Q1 and Q2 last year as a product launch. We also had our a Paramount product Menards. Again, we split that between Q1 and Q2. And we have the PPG stain Timers launch, which is a smaller category that that’s going into the Home Depot right now. But we do expect that channel as it did last year to slightly underperform the overall industry. So hopefully, I answered your questions fully.
Christopher Parkinson: One by one, great. And just a quick a follow-up on the industrials side. You indicate you’ve seen some solid trends in APAC, LatAm; it seems like the U.S. is okay in that regard but EMEA is still sluggish. On the latter, can you just comment on any key trends you are seeing, whether it’s by country or just by vertical? And whether or not you are seeing any detrimental in some of those markets in the business? And then, as it improves, let’s say later on the year or even past key elections in the region, if you expect any improvement in op leverage there? Thank you.
Michael McGarry: This is Michael and what I would tell you is that the same countries continue to have the same strength. So, UK, Ireland continues to do well, the Benelux continues to do well, Germany continues to do well, France remains sluggish; obviously they have an election coming up, so there is a not a lot of spending going on at that level right now. The recovery in southern Europe continues but I would say has moderated. The disappointment has been more in Eastern Europe that has probably been the bigger challenge in that regard. And of course, the Middle East which we report as part of Europe Middle East and Africa that has been challenged. And then Africa is significantly challenged. A number of those countries are oil based economies. And as you know, the oil based economies have been challenged. So, when you look at overall Europe, I would say western Europe doing pretty well, eastern Europe a little bit less and then the other ones are the ones that are holding back. I might add, the other one positive would be Russia. In the first quarter, Russian car sales were 4%; that’s the last time -- I can’t remember last time they were up. They were 50% down since their peak. So, that’s one positive side.
Vince Morales: And in Asia, we are seeing good, fairly good solid growth across the region. I think there was some valid concern coming into the year in China on the car incentives that was being partially repealed. But we did see good automotive sales, again a little bit tick up in inventory in Q1, but we didn’t see a significant decline that tells us there is good solid underpinnings of growth there; India is good, southeast Asia is good as well.
Operator: The next question will be from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jeff Zekauskas: I saw that you bought $165 million worth of shares in the first quarter. Was that share repurchase completed before you thought hard about buying Akzo or were you already aware that you were intending to purchase Akzo? And have you purchased any shares this quarter?
Vince Morales: So, Jeff, this is Vince again. So, Jeff, we did as you know and as we reported in January, purchased roughly $650 million of stock in the fourth quarter. We did that under a program, which we occasionally do. That program ran through our first quarter earnings call. And so, we won’t comment on what we’ve done subsequent to the end of the first quarter but that program did run through our first quarter earnings call.
Jeff Zekauskas: And then, secondly, I think your cost of goods sold was up 2.6% and your volumes were roughly up too. So, it seems that you had a very low rate of cost of goods sold inflation. Is that because you had a way of managing your inventories or was it that your raw material costs were up at a higher rate but you offset that with lowering overhead costs? Can you talk about why your cost of goods sold was so low in the context of rising raw material costs?
Vince Morales: Jeff, it’s Vince again, Jeff. It was the latter. We did see an increase in raw material costs, as Michael touched upon earlier. We did have in response to that very good cost management of our manufacturing costs. And that was supplemented by higher volumes, which allowed us to capitalize on those higher volumes and the throughput at our facilities.
Operator: The next question will come from Ghansham Panjabi of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. 
Mehul Dalia: Hi. Good afternoon. It’s actually Mehul Dalia sitting in for Ghansham. How are you doing?
Michael McGarry : Hi, Mehul.
Mehul Dalia: Hi. Going back to the question on inflation. Given your activity on the pricing side, do you think, you’ll be able to be at least price cost neutral or even positive for the full year 2017 just based on current raw material backdrop as we see it right now?
Michael McGarry: Well, our guidance earlier in the year was that we would be negative price minus raw materials for Q1, Q2 and positive Q3, Q4. In order to make that happen, we’re going to have to work harder and collaboratively with our customers to achieve our previously announced price increases. But at this point in time, we’re still positive that we’re going to have a net positive. So we haven’t given up on that, but we don’t plan on it.
Mehul Dalia: Okay, great. And then, in terms of the capital deployment of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion for 2017 and 2018, and in the context of your pending AkzoNobel offer, how should we think about layering in the proceeds towards share buybacks et cetera from the timeline standpoint for the remainder of the year?
Michael McGarry: Well, again, regard to the year, we typically don’t provide publicly any cadence or pace for share buybacks. We have conviction around the 2.5 billion to 3.5 billion over the two-year period that we typically wouldn’t pace that out for public consumption.
Operator: The next question will come from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Michael, just on margins and performance coatings, they were actually up Q1 year-over-year, but given the peak of raws in Q2, should we expect margins and performance to be down year-over-year in Q2?
Michael McGarry: I think they’ll will be down marginally. But obviously, we’re working collaboratively with our customers on price increases. It’s always difficult to forecast when you can start to hit those price increases in your pocket. But we have with relationships with our customers and we’ll continue to work with them in a very straight forward matter.
Vince Morales: And just David, if I could add. Again, as Michael said eelier, I just want to remind everybody. We do expect Q2 to be the most difficult comparable from a raw material perspective.
David Begleiter: Very good. And Michael, just on marine. When did the business bottom? And can you actually size what the impact has been from peak to trough?
Michael McGarry: Well, the bottom is probably either this quarter or next quarter is my guess. We saw a slight uptick in ship orders for the first time in a long time in Q1. So, I always say that one data point doesn’t make a trend. So, it’s too early to call that. But last quarter, the fourth quarter, Korean ship orders were off 75%, and China ship orders are off 60%. So that’s not indicative of the world market because obviously they do more of it than anybody else. But, the downturn in some of the other countries would have been less, but it’s still a very significant peak to trough number. 
Vince Morales: And David, in terms of context for size for 2016, we said it shaved about half of a turn off of our growth rate, somewhere in the neighborhood of half a term.
Operator: The next question will come from Frank Mitsch of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. 
Frank Mitsch: Hey, good afternoon and good luck to the home team at the Paint C.A.N tonight. Michael, you were talking about the Easter impact and I think you said that there was a benefit of about 1% volumes in performance coatings. So, we do expect that that’s a pull forward from a Q2 into Q1 and so therefore whatever volumes we see, so we’re going to see a decrement in Q2 is that what you’re signaling there?
Michael McGarry: Yes. So, what we had is extra ship days in Q1 and we have less ship days in Q2. And it’s not a straight forth calculation because PPG Comex, actually their two biggest selling parts of the year, Christmas and Easter, so for PPG Comex it’s obviously a benefit in the second quarter and negative in the first quarter. So, it’s not a straight forward calculation. What we’re trying to tell you is it’s somewhere in that 1% to 2% range.
Frank Mitsch: You talked before about the $100 million productivity program. And I was wondering if you could provide some color around that, where you stand there and what’s the expectations for the balance of the year?
Michael McGarry: My friend Vince will help you.
Vince Morales: Thanks, Michael. So, Frank, we gave -- as you know, we announced the restructuring last year. We’re targeting $40 million to $50 million of savings in 2017 from those restructuring actions. We captured a little less than 25, let’s call 20% of that in the first quarter. We expect that to gradually grow throughout the year and will be hopefully at the middle to upper end of that $40 million to $50 million target.
Frank Mitsch: And that’s also a partly baked into the expectation to the back half for the year to hopefully to see acceleration in EPS growth relative to what you performed in Q1, correct? 
Vince Morales: That would be correct.
Operator: The next question will come from John Roberts of UBS. Please go ahead.
John Roberts: Mike, I’ll remind you, this is Wall Street, so if you give us one data point, we will draw a line and if you give us two, we will draw curve.
Michael McGarry: Okay, John. Thanks for the adjudication.
John Roberts: You talked about more visibility for the PPG brand, are you talking about using the PPG brand to expand some shelf space and gain share, are you talking more about a super umbrella brand on top of your other brands?
Michael McGarry: Well, I don’t know that it’s right for me to lay out our brand strategy as it’s evolving but let me try to get to part of what you’re talking about. We’re going to have more shelf space at the Home Depot, okay. So, that’s a positive. We are -- if you’re in any of our retail partner stores, you will see the PPG logo on our products. And of course, we’re growing the PPG paints brand in our own store. And as you know, as Mr. Mitch just said, it’s not the Paint C.A.N but it’s PPG paints arena and we’re thrilled to be with the NHL. And now we’re the NHL partner, official paint. So, these are all our efforts to do that. What I would tell is that long-term we will have to put and we will put more branding into the PPG name to support our retail customers. So, this will be gradual and over time but it is something that we are working on and we talk continuously to our retail partners how important this is to us.
Vince Morales: Investment today -- John, I am sorry to interrupt you. These investments today we have seen hopefully gain and traction along with our PPG paint store’s growth.
John Roberts: Do you use the PPG brand in European architectural at all yet?
Michael McGarry: No, we do not use it anywhere. The only place outside the U.S. that we are using it as a PPG brand is actually New Zealand. And that’s because the way we bought business in Australia and New Zealand. And actually, it’s doing quite well down there. So, maybe it’s sort of learning to us.
Operator: The next question will come from Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Kevin McCarthy: Yes. Good afternoon. You had a number different price increase announcements in various product lines and geographies in recent months. If we look at the second quarter, how would you characterize the potential for sequential improvement in price in each of your coating segments and compared to the first quarter? Perhaps you can give us a sense of what you have achieved and what’s on account still there?
Michael McGarry: I think Kevin, naturally, we always get better traction and quicker traction in our performance coatings segment. And it’s harder but we do get it eventually in our industrial coatings segment. As you know our industrial coatings segment has a number of very large, very sophisticated customers that makes it more difficult to get it but they do understand, in all cases at about 70% of our cost of raw materials, so it’s impossible for us to sit here and absorb that kind of cost. So, we will get it, but what I would say is we get it typically quicker in the performance coatings area. And we will see -- sequentially, we will see both go up but we will see better on the performance coatings side.
Kevin McCarthy: And then, as a follow-up on industrial, Michael. You had good sales growth and I thought the commentary sounded constructive, yet your margins were down 70 basis points year-over-year, I suspect the issues what you just alluded to, I think you had minus 1 on prices, I understand that. Perhaps you could just elaborate more on whether and when you might be able to get above the water line there and get it to zero or plus one.
Michael McGarry: Kevin, I always give the guidance that it takes six to nine months for the company, so you probably should assume nine to 12 months in that segment, because it’s a little harder to get it. But we will get it. And I just think it takes a little bit longer. But it is being offset significantly by manufacturing performance and good cost control across Company. So, when you look at it that has helped us a lot.
Operator: The next question will be from Michael Sison of Keybank. Please go ahead.
Michael Sison: In terms of performance coatings, when you think about the positives you’ve seen thus far and some of the negatives, when do you think some of the growth can outweigh some of the negatives in marine and generate some volume growth this year?
Michael McGarry: Well, if you assume that marine touches bottom and starts not having any further negatives, that puts you one or two quarters out on marine. I would tell you that the rest of this segment is in pretty good shape. Aerospace will -- might be flat to slightly up, but we refinish is continuing to do well but distracted driving has helped. The miles driven has helped. Employment being up helps. All that leads to congestion of growth. So, the rest of the segment is a pretty good shape.
Michael Sison: Great. And then, for industrial coatings, you’ve had couple of quarters now of solid volume growth. And industrial production generally has been kind of sluggish and it sounds like we’re kind of seeing things pick up a little bit. Could you expect that volume growth maybe even get better in the next couple of quarters?
Michael McGarry: I’m not putting a big bull’s eye on that. Again, we can see a lot of optimism, but we haven’t seen the order book do that. Our outperformance in that segment has really been driven by technology and also because growth due to performance of the teams. So I guess, I’ll temper your optimism for now and let’s hope that you’re right.
Vince Morales: And then globally, Mike, we do -- we have as Michael mentioned in this prepared remarks some very hard comes coming up. We had mid-single-digit growth in a lot of these businesses. Now, we’re starting to lap some of that. So, again for our numbers in particular, the comps are a little bit harder, but we still feel good about where we sit technology-wise.
Operator: The next question will be from Dmitry Silversteyn of Longbow Research. Please go ahead.
Dmitry Silversteyn: Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my call. A lot of my questions have been answered, but I just like follow-up on Mike’s last question on general industrial. Can you talk a little bit more, provide a little bit more detail either by product types like oil coatings or powder coatings or regions or end markets where sort of one of the good guys, one of the bad guys. Where you see growth in market share gains and where things are still so sluggish that even with the technology driven market share gains, you’re still a little bit under water year-over-year?
Michael McGarry: So, Dmitry, the segments, the sub-segments that are doing well, automotive parts doing well, electronic materials doing well, transportation general finishes, appliances. The encouraging one for us is heavy duty equipment, it’s up. Now that’s a combination of share gain plus that’s coming off the floor. So, I think that’s all good. The segments that are kind of not doing as well, the extrusion market, the wood market, the coil market, those are the some of the segments that are not as robust. But globally, we had a really outstanding performance across all the world, I mean whether it’s Asia, Latin America, Europe, our industrial coatings segment team has been doing a outstanding job. And I want to complement them on that.
Dmitry Silversteyn: Okay. Mike, thank you. And then the second question, just sort of in the context of a strong contract to market. You guys saw very strong growth in your stores and your competitor, we had a conference call earlier this morning also mentioned very strong growth. Why is that not being reflective in the dealer channel? I mean, is the share losses for them so great that they just can’t offset even a mid-single-digit improvement in what looks a do it for me market in the first quarter?
Michael McGarry: Well, I think our friends in Cleveland and us provide more value, more locations, more service. And so, when there is a opportunity for another incremental sale, the two of us are probably getting more than our fair share in that segment, because of what we both offer to the marketplace.
Dmitry Silversteyn: Okay. So, it sounds like it’s as much execution as it is the market that’s driving these stronger sales for company owned stores you, equipment company?
Michael McGarry: Correct.
Operator: Our next question will come from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Laurence Alexander: Do you have, with the strength that you’re seeing in orders demand, the number of your markets that are now running in expansionary mode in Europe coming in above the market trends? Do you think if raw materials roll over, you will be able to retain more of that rather than pass it through to the customers?
Michael McGarry: Well, we always work collaboratively with our customers, so we don’t try to over recover; we try to be exactly what the market’s going on. But what I would tell you is that we have expectations for productivity, we’ve expectations for manufacturing efficiency, we have expectations on our sustainability initiatives where we’re less energy consumed, less wage, so there is opportunities to continue to improve the margins. But on the raw material side, typically we ask for what we’re having to absorb.
Vince Morales: And Laurence, if I could add, we’re working on reformulation as we typically do, in an inflationary environment. So, not only are we working with our customers on price and we’re trying to engineer some of this health as well, so we don’t have to go as forcefully to our customers. So, we’re working on the technology side as well.
Laurence Alexander: And can you give a bit more granularity around the strength in automotive refinish volumes in U.S., Canada and Latin America? And particularly, any sense as to whether that -- how sustainable that should be?
Michael McGarry: So, the market in the U.S. is the strongest globally; Latin America would be next followed by Europe and Asia Pacific. We do think these are sustainable trends. The expanding car parks is the reality and expanding miles driven is the reality, so some of the other thing I talked about earlier. So, I think that’s going to continue to and plus in that segment, you will also commercial transport. So, the fact that economy is trending up, you’re going to have more big trucks built, so that’s a positive for us as well.
Operator: The next question will come from PJ Juvekar of Citi. Please go ahead.
PJ Juvekar: In 2011, when TiO2 prices spiked last, I think PPG was most aggressive in sort of sourcing TiO2 from China and also reformulating your paint. Given that you’ve already done that, what can you do know as TiO2 prices begin to go up again?
Michael McGarry: Well PJ, I would tell you that that is a never-ending quest for us now. So, we’re constantly looking at how do you reformulate that how do you use other extenders, how do you work with your customer on formulations that reduce the need for TiO2. So, we are certainly not going to have -- we took out about 10% since 2011, so it’s harder but it’s not impossible.
Vince Morales: We don’t think that we are on the same -- anywhere near the same trajectory in the TiO2 market. We are seeing inflation there. That inflation, as you mentioned, was 100% inflation. Again, we are seeing inflation, we need to get priced but it’s not of that same level.
Michael McGarry: And I would tell you -- I would add PJ that the TiO2 companies I think regret what happened because that took so much demand in the marketplace and my guess is they won’t make that mistake again.
PJ Juvekar: And Michael, when you took the job, organic growth was your priority but the reality is that the economies are not growing. And I would say, your organic growth has been between 1% to 2%. Is that what’s really driving PPG towards big M&A?
Michael McGarry: No, I would not say that’s the case at all. What I would say is acquisitions have historically always made a better return than buying back shares. And so, as you know, this coatings franchise continues to throw off a lot of consistent cash flow. And we consistently integrate companies very well and we can capture those synergies very well. We have a proven track record of more than 50 acquisitions in the last 10 years. We have a play book that is well understood within the Company. And for us this just makes a perfect sense. So we are going to continue down this path.
Operator: The next question will be from James Sheehan of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.
James Sheehan: Thank you. Question on your comments on national retail accounts. You described that qualitatively as mix, but it does sound like that maybe a little bit better than your competitor did. And I am just wondering are your brand initiatives gaining traction there or are you seeing some type of inventory adjustments that would cause you to be outperforming peers in that category?
Michael McGarry: Well, I can’t comment on what my friend said because I had our annual shareholder meetings at the exact same time as they were making their comments. But what I would tell you is our commentary is pretty specific and we would just stay with that.
Vince Morales: Jim, we don’t feel there is a performance gap us versus market. Again, we recognize last year as an industry, this was a slower growing channel and this is -- first quarter was a continuation of that, albeit again at the very beginning of the paint season. We certainly hope and our working with our national customers to help and put that channel up as much as possible, hopefully at or above market. We just haven’t seen that at this point.
Michael McGarry: And maybe I’ll add to that Jim is what I said earlier was the average median income of the person walking into the big boxes let’s call it $45,000. They can’t all be sold premium paint. And every time you let somebody walk out of those big boxes without a can of paint, when you could have sold them to $20 or $25 can a paint that’s a loss. And I think that’s where we are trying to encourage all our retail partners is don’t let people walk out. Any by walks in, walks up for that chip rack, make sure they walk out with somebody’s can of paint.
James Sheehan: And then, on the aerospace sub segments, you talked about the airplane makers not get interact together. Can you talk a little bit about how you see trends shaping up there? That’s obviously not going to persist forever. Do you see any kind of modest acceleration happening in the next couple of quarters in aerospace?
Michael McGarry : No. We don’t see any change. If you look at it, Boeing’s orders or deliveries, excuse me, were actually down 7 quarter-over-quarter; Airbus’s were up 11, so a net change of 4. Backlog for both of them are in excess of seven or eight years. So, we haven’t seen that acceleration. I would tell you that the business jet market though is getting -- we got it to get near the bottom. It was the lowest -- 2016 was the lowest since 2004. So, I would say that there is probably likely recovery coming in that market. So that’s probably, and plus, we know military is definitely coming back. So, you got military, probably going to get better, you got general aviation, you got a lot of miles being flown by the major carriers. So that’s a positive. So there’s actually more positive trends than negative. It’s just hasn’t manifested itself in new planes being built.
Operator: The next question will come from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Matt Gingrich: Hey, guys. This is Matt Gingrich on for Vincent. I was wondering, if it is possible to quantify the headwind in industrial from the higher transportation and logistics costs?
Vince Morales: Just as a reminder, last year was north of -- well north of 5 -- last year for fourth quarter was well north of 5 million this year and just south to 5 million. And as Michael said in his opening comments, we expect that to dissipate in Q2, so it will be very low-single-digits in Q2.
Matt Gingrich: And then, on the margin profile, the acquisition in industrial, there is a common in your slide deck that you’re saying that they underperformed the segment average. I was wondering if you expect that going forward or this is more of a one-time dynamic?
Michael McGarry: No. Virtually every company we acquire has margins lower than the PPG margins. And virtually every company we buy within a year or two or three, we get up to PPG margins. We have a strong track record in doing that. So, this is no different. So, we bought coatings -- the MetoKote. We’re bringing their margins up. They had a very nice first quarter, but still below the Company average. We bought Univer. The 50% of Univer, we didn’t know in Italy for architectural coatings we’re bringing that up. We bought the remaining in DEUTEK architectural company, significant improvement; they have a great management team; we’re very thrilled to have them join us. In fact, they have a long runway with those folks. They’re talented people. And so, this is no different than we’ve seen anywhere else. Acquire, improve, get the Company average or exceed.
Vince Morales: So those acquisitions, if I can add, again, the management team at MetoKote remains in place. As Michael mentioned, management team at DEUTEK remains in place. So, we’re very pleased to have these people as part of our organization.
Matt Gingrich: Great. So gradual improvement, but still lagging segment average to the balance of the year likely?
Vince Morales: Certainly for the balance for this year. Yes.
Operator: The next question will come from Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead.
Don Carson: Yes, thanks. A question on your heat map on slide five. You’ve got very divergent trends in automotive and refinish, you’re growing above and expanding market in OEM, you’re growing below at declining markets. I’m just talking about sustainability of those trends and specifically what’s happening in automotive OEM. And then the refinish growth, is that sort of distribution driven that you’re getting share at MSOs instead of taking share from second tier producers or is it more product driven?
Michael McGarry: Well, in refinish, we’re definitely gaining share. There is two of it that are consistently gaining share in that market. As far as the dichotomy between growth rate, there are two different markets really. So, let’s start with automotive. In the automotive market, we say globally demand builds would be up 1% to 2%, closer to 2%, but it varies by areas. So, U.S. sales we said plateaued but builds are going to be down marginally. And then in Europe, Western Europe builds are growing that’s continuing, but in I would say in the other parts of Eastern Europe, probably not as robust. Latin America is getting better and China, people always are nervous about China. We remain constructive on China. January sales were down, February was up, March was up. We think people are going to get used to this tax not being -- tax abatement not being, it’s still the most important thing for people to -- you want to status symbol to own a car in China, so we think demand will continue to grow. India is going to grow more than 7%. So overall, it’s going to be a solid market, not as good as last year, last year grew more than 3% but overall still a good market.
Vince Morales: And Don if you summarize what’s happening our position versus the market generally and the highest growth markets, we’re outperforming the industry and the markets that are shrinking, those are ones where we are not performing; we’re performing at or below industry. So again, we positioned ourselves well in the growing markets.
Operator: The next question will be from Mike Harrison of Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.
Mike Harrison: Just to continue on the auto OEM question, you’ve discussed the reasons in past that are driving your below market growth in North America. I’m talking about some of the reallocation of resources to drive growth in other regions, in other faster growing regions. Can you talk so about when you would expect to see U.S. and Canada get to at market growth, and is there any point in the near future where you could see allocating resources to gain new wins with auto OEM customers and North America?
Michael McGarry: Sure, Mike. This is Michael. The way I would think about that is we should start to lap some of these loss of market share in the U.S. late in the third quarter early in the fourth quarter. And then, so first quarter of next year, we should start outperforming industry in the U.S. and Canada. And given the fact that we already outperformed the other three regions and globally, we outperformed, this will put us back on a very, very solid track on the automotive market globally.
Mike Harrison: And then, I wanted to also ask just on the MetoKote business, you referenced that as a business that was below average margin but starting to improve. Can you just talk about how that integration process is going? I know that that coating services business is a little bit of a step out for your guys. How is that business model working for you and for your customers?
Michael McGarry: It’s a very small business when you look at it versus all the PPG. There is sales in the first quarter up 11% year-over-year. So, I would say it’s performing well, margins were up year over year. I would tell you that they have had two significant wins, they had a nice win with somebody in the electric vehicle market. That was a very good win, and they also had some nice equipment sales. And the beauty about the equipment sales is that they were able to bring our industrial coatings team along with them and provide a total services solution to this customer. And we have another large customer in the industrial space that wants to get out of the painting parts business and they asked us if we would combine our traditional paint business with the coating services. So, I think there’s more opportunities to integrate this and become a seamless part of our product offering to our customers.
Operator: The next question will come from Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Arun Viswanathan: Great, thanks guys. So, I just had a question on general industrial. Are you guys seeing trends, you talked about heavy duty improving in some of the other markets. Are you guys seeing a noticeable uptick incrementally sequentially from Q4 to Q1, do you expect that to continue through the year and maybe just parse it out by region.
Vince Morales: So, Arun, as Michael mentioned this sector is coming really off the floor. So, we were seeing a gradual recovery. We would hope at some point if the -- we talk about lot of infrastructure, politically if there’s a benefit there that will come slowly. By region, we didn’t see the same significant drop in Asia that we did see in the US and European region, couple of years ago. So that has been a little more steady. And again, in Europe we’re mirroring the US but not in the same volatile pattern of a couple of years ago.
Arun Viswanathan: Great, thanks. And just on the M&A front. You talked about still pursuing other potential targets in your pipeline. Could you characterize how those -- how large those are and if there’s any benefits to doing small bolt-ons versus continuing to pursue a large acquisition like Akzo? Thanks.
Michael McGarry: I’ll take that. We remain interested in consolidating the space we have. We’ve had and continue to have active discussions. The pipeline I think as people realize the past 18 months remains active and we’re certainly interested and continuing dialogue with all the parties. And as we did last year with Medico DEUTEK, as Michael mentioned, et cetera, have room in our portfolio when these enhance shareholder value.
Arun Viswanathan: And just one more if I may. Would you be able to characterize like how much of your portfolio you think is market dependent improving? In the past you said that Europe recovery would be very beneficial to you guys, is that still the case. Any other comments around what you guys are looking for to really start to see your organic volume growth improve? Thanks.
Michael McGarry: I would say the European performance, any time we have new sales or higher sales in Europe, we drop 30% to 40% of that incrementally to the bottom line. That’s our best place, If we’re going to choose the a place that grows that would be it. The US would be next and then Asia, because we aren’t sold out in Asia. That’s the place that we continue to add capacity. So preferentially, we’re very strong in Europe but we’re not ashamed to take growth anywhere and the teams are expected to grow everywhere in and around the world.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen that concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Scott Minder for his closing comments.
Scott Minder: Once again, I’d like to thank everyone for their time and interest in PPG. If you have any further questions, please contact our investor relations department. This concludes our first quarter 2017 earnings call.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, the conference has concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

I will remind everyone that we have posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on our Investor Center at www.ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide additional supporting information for the opening comments Michael will make momentarily. Following Michael’s perspective on the company’s results for the quarter and full year and a brief financial assumptions update from Frank, we will move to Q&A. Both our prepared commentary and discussion and Q&A during the call may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company’s current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG’s operating and financial performance. These statements may involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. Today’s presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to the company’s filings with the SEC. Now, let me turn the call over to PPG’s Chairman and CEO, Michael McGarry.
Michael McGarry: Thank you, Vince. And before we start with my prepared remarks, I would like to take a minute to recognize the announcement today that we made that Frank Sklarsky will be retiring on March 1. Frank joined us 4 years ago and came to us with a very diverse background, serving as CFO for several companies in different industries. Frank has applied that past experience since he has arrived and has been truly a great thought leader, change agent and steady hand that has guided us through financially very strategic actions. Both internally and externally, including with our shareholders, Frank has brought a tremendous amount of skill and energy to the job. Frank, thank you for your many contributions to PPG and congratulations on your well-deserved retirement. I also want to congratulate Vince on his announcement appointing him as CFO, March 1. Vince has been an integral part of the PPG family for more than 30 years, served in a variety of internal and external facing financial roles. Over that time, he has proven to be a broad thinker, leader and valuable contributor to the executive team as we transform the company. His deep knowledge of PPG and our businesses, the coatings and chemical industries and the capital markets will serve him well in the new role. So once again, congratulations to both of you. And so now I want to talk a little bit about our fourth quarter performance. Today, we reported fourth quarter and full year 2016 results. For the fourth quarter, our net sales were $3.5 billion and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.19. This represents an EPS growth rate of 3% for the quarter and we achieved an EPS growth rate of 7% for the year. While these figures fall short of our EPS growth goals, both numbers were noticeably impacted by persistent unfavorable currency translation. For the fourth quarter, our reported net sales were down 1.5% while our sales in local currencies increased by more than 1%. Supporting the higher local currency sales were increased volumes approaching 2% in our coatings segment. This figure matched our highest quarterly growth rate in 2016. Also minimally impacting our net sales in the quarter were our portfolio optimization actions as acquisition-related sales modestly exceeded the absence of sales from the divested businesses, we are still including in our continuing operations. As I mentioned, foreign currency translation remained a significant factor affecting our financial results with fourth quarter net sales unfavorably impacted by approximately $100 million and pre-tax income impacted by about $25 million. For the full year, this impact was about $400 million on sales and about $70 million on pre-tax earnings. Looking at some business trends in the fourth quarter and from an end market perspective, our highest volume growth rates was achieved in our industrial coatings segment with each business unit matching or exceeding industry growth rates by delivering at least a mid-single-digit percentage volume growth. Sales volumes continue to expand in automotive OEM coatings and were consistent with overall mid single-digit percentage global industry build growth. Our above-market performance in the faster growing regions of Asia-Pacific, Europe and Latin America was in contrast to the lower industry and PPG volumes in the U.S. and Canada. We also continue to grow sales, volumes in general industrial coatings, delivering our fourth consecutive quarter of above market growth rates, with positive year-over-year contributions from each region. In addition, packaging coatings growth volume remains strong as customers continue to adopt our Innovel interior can coatings products around the globe. In performance coatings, automotive refinish volumes grew a low single-digit percentage as the growth returned to Europe following lower year-over-year demand in the third quarter and volumes continued to expand in Asia. Aerospace and architectural coatings EMEA sales volumes were in line with prior year as industry growth remained tepid for both businesses. Specifically in architectural coatings, sales volumes grew in Europe, with the strength in the UK, Ireland and Benelux countries, but was offset by declines in Africa where many economies are closely linked to the depressed commodity prices. Sales volumes improved in architectural coatings Americas and Asia-Pacific as gains in the U.S. and Canada company-owned stores was partially offset by lower demand in the independent dealer network and uncertain national retail accounts. Sales growth in Mexico continued despite comparison to strong prior year growth. Sales volume growth was also positive year-over-year in the smaller markets, Central America, Australia, China and Brazil. In contrast, significant low double-digit sales volume declines occurred in protective and marine coatings as further weakness in marine shipbuilding activity more than offset PPG’s specific growth in protective coatings. We are continued to aggressively manage our costs in this business to neutralize the earnings impact of these expected market-based activity level declines. Glass segment volumes declined 3% in North American fiberglass business, principally due to lower wind energy product demand. From a regional perspective, sales volume growth was led by emerging regions. Asian demand growth was broad-based across many of our businesses, but was partly offset by significant declines in regional shipbuilding as previously mentioned. Volumes in Latin America were also positive despite comparison to strong prior year growth in several businesses, including PPG Comex. Volume growth also improved in Europe after a relatively flat comparison to prior year in the third quarter 2016. Growth in this region was also broad-based, which was more comparable to the growth patterns we experienced for most of 2015 and the first half of 2016 when our volumes expanded for six consecutive quarters. From an earnings perspective, our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.19 improved by 3% versus the prior year quarter. Aiding our earnings growth were higher sales volumes and lower overall costs, which included a positive impact from our prior year restructuring program. In addition, earnings per share benefited from our ongoing cash deployment actions. This included the impact of our repurchase of $650 million of PPG stock in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year 2016 share repurchase to $1.050 billion or nearly 11 million shares. In the quarter, average diluted shares outstanding were 2.8% lower versus the fourth quarter of 2015. Now, I would like to comment quickly on our full year results from continuing operations. These results do not include the divested flat glass business financial results, which have been classified as discontinued operations. On a full year basis, our sales from continuing operations were $14.8 billion, consistent with the prior year despite an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of approximately $400 million or about 3%. Our full year sales volumes grew about 1%. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share was $5.82, up 7% versus the prior year. We were able to grow our full year earnings despite modest and uneven global economic growth for the second consecutive year. We accomplished this by another strong year of operational excellence. Our more significant actions included commercialization of new products and technologies allowing us to deliver above market growth in several of our businesses, continued successful integration and earnings accretion from prior and current year acquisitions, completion of our previously announced restructuring program including achievement of savings commitments and lastly, a hallmark of improved productivity and aggressive cost management and our manufacturing operations and within our overall administrative and business support cost structure. In addition to these operational items, we allocated more resources and investments to our growth related opportunities and expect that this will continue to yield dividends in our organic growth rate going forward. Over the course of the year, we continue to execute on our strategic objectives to strengthen the company. We further optimized our business portfolio with the acquisition of MetoKote, a global leader in coatings applications and Univer, an Italian architectural coatings company. In addition, we closed on the acquisition of Deutek, a Romanian architectural coatings leader in early January 2017. We were equally active in addressing the non-core part of our portfolio as we completed the divestitures of our flat glass business, our European fiber glass business, our ownership interest in two Asian fiber glass joint ventures as well as our minority interest in Pittsburgh Glass Works. These divestitures, which most occurred later in the year, provided us with almost $1 billion of gross proceeds. We fully intend to deploy these proceeds in an accretive manner that will create value for our shareholders. As a result of these portfolio actions, 97% of our 2016 net sales was composed from revenue from our core coatings, coating services and specialty material businesses. Our revised business portfolio has a broader geographic reach, more opportunities for enhanced customer intimacy and technology dependency. It also delivers strong and consistent operating cash flow, requires less capital intensity and we expect it to be more resilient to overall shifts in the economic activity. In addition to the portfolio moves, we continue to reduce legacy related risk by fully funding our portion of Pittsburgh Corning Asbestos Trust and by annuitizing a significant portion of our U.S. and Canadian pension obligations. We are pleased to have put some of these significant non-core obligations behind us, thus reducing volatility in future earnings and cash flow. We also continue our strong cash generation with about $1.2 billion generated from continuing operations for the year. This included a reduction associated with a net after-tax cash flow related to the full funding of Pittsburgh Corning Asbestos Trust. Excluding this impact, cash flow from operations was almost $1.9 billion for the year. One of the key enablers of this cash performance was our continuing effort to be more efficient with working capital. This year, we reduced our working capital by another 120 basis points as a percentage of revenue, including noteworthy improvements in inventory efficiency. The company has averaged more than 100 basis point annual improvement in this metric for the past 4 years. In addition, consistent with our capital allocation philosophy, we continued our legacy returning cash to shareholders with nearly $1.5 billion in share repurchases and dividends. Regarding dividends, 2016 marked the 117th consecutive year of dividend payouts and the 45th consecutive year of annual payout increases after an 11% per share increase in April 2016. As we look ahead to 2017, we are operating in an evolving macroeconomic and regulatory environment. Our expectations are for improved momentum in the overall global economic growth with – including gradually higher growth rates in developed regions and continuing but uneven growth in emerging regions. We anticipate economic growth rates to improve in the U.S. and Canada, including a modest acceleration in industrial production and GDP rates versus 2016. We expect construction markets to expand at a continued measured rate. Lastly, we believe that regional automotive industry builds will be flat or decline modestly year-over-year after several years of post-recession expansion. In Latin America, we anticipate economic expansion in Mexico. And in South America, we expect to return to flat or slightly positive year-over-year economic growth following a multi-year contraction in economic output. Growth rates in Asia are expected to remain generally consistent with 2016, with continued industrial production growth in China as well as gains in Southeast Asia and India. Automotive build growth is expected to remain positive in the region, but at a more modest growth rates in comparison to 2016. Economic growth in Europe is expected to continue but remain varied by sub-region and country. Favorable end use market trends are expected to continue, particularly in automotive OEM coatings as industry build growth rates are expected to remain positive. Despite our cautious optimism for 2017 economic growth, the timeline for this growth remains uncertain. As such, we will aggressively manage all elements of our business within our control to ensure that we remain competitive regardless of economic conditions. We recently initiated an almost $200 million business restructuring program focused on reducing our costs where business conditions remain the most uncertain and we will continue to support the momentum in our recent growth related initiatives. Additionally, we have initiated targeted selling price increases to combat recent inflationary cost pressures in several markets and regions. We will continue to closely monitor our input costs and we will work with customers in a collaborative and equitable manner. Finally, we remain in a position of strength as we ended the year with nearly $1.9 billion of cash and short-term investments and this provides us with significant financial flexibility going forward. Supported by our strong cash generation, we reached the top end of our cash deployment range for 2015 and 2016 combined by deploying over $2.5 billion on share repurchases and acquisitions. Today, we announced a new 2-year cash deployment range of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion for acquisitions and share repurchases for the years 2017 and 2018 combined, reflecting our continuing focus on shareholder value creation. We continue to believe that the coatings space remains a consolidating industry and acquisition pipeline remains active across geographies and end use markets. And of course, share repurchases will also remain an important element of our capital allocation strategy. I will conclude by saying that 2016 was a good year for PPG and we delivered record adjusted EPS despite uneven economic conditions and against a volatile currency backdrop. We have completed many strategic actions to make the company stronger and more resilient in the future. We look forward to another successful year, 2017. Now, I will turn it over to Frank, who will cover some 2017 financial assumptions.
Frank Sklarsky: Thank you, Michael. Thanks for your kind words and good afternoon, everyone. I am going to cover several items that will assist in modeling PPG’s 2017 sales and earnings. We have included in today’s presentation materials a summary of these financial assumptions on Slide #12. Before we get to the discussion of 2017, however let me briefly cover one housekeeping item and provide you with our total 2016 sales and adjusted EPS figures from continuing operations for each quarter in 2016. These figures have all been adjusted to exclude the flat glass business, which is now being presented as discontinued operations. These have previously been reported in our SEC filings or earning reports, but I quickly want to summarize them for you. For the first quarter of 2016, net sales were $3.544 billion and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.27. For the second quarter, sales were $3.921 billion, with EPS at $1.78. For Q3, net sales were $3.789 billion, with EPS at $1.56 and Q4 as you know, was $3.497 billion, with EPS at $1.19 for a total year of $14.751 billion and earnings per share of $5.82. Please note that the EPS of $5.82 for 2016 compares to $5.43 for 2015 on a comparable basis, and as Michael pointed out, that represents an increase of $0.39 or 7% year-over-year. Turning now to 2017, the first item relates to the impact from the MetoKote and Univer acquisitions that we completed in 2016 and the full year impact of the DEUTEK acquisition that we finalized in January of 2017. These acquisitions are expected to achieve full year sales of about $270 million in 2017. Since we realized about $90 million in sales in 2016, we expect an incremental $180 million in sales from these three acquisitions in 2017. This incremental revenue will be classified in the acquisition category until each acquired entity reaches its respective acquisition anniversary date, after which time their results will be included in normal organic revenue results. These acquisitions will typically achieve at or below segment average margins early on as we work to fully integrate their operations into PPG. Additionally, the company divested its European fiberglass business in October 2016. The divested business had sales during the first three quarters of 2016 of approximately $140 million that will not recur in 2017. Next, we will continue to experience the impact of foreign currency translation headwinds as measured against the U.S. dollar. As a result, for the full year, the company expects that year-over-year currency translation will unfavorably impact sales by a range of $375 million to $425 million and impact pre-tax earnings by about $70 million to $90 million. For the first quarter, we expect an impact to the top and bottom lines similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2016. These figures represent our current assumptions based on exchange rates as of early this week. Again, these impacts are for currency translation-related impacts. Given the nature of our business, we typically do not incur significant transaction-related currency impacts. We also initiated a restructuring program in December 2016, targeting $125 million in total run-rate savings annually once fully implemented. We anticipate that this program will generate $40 million to $50 million in savings during 2017. The next item relates to the company’s pension and other postretirement benefits or OPEB expenses. We are expecting these expenses to decrease by about $15 million to $20 million in 2017. This decrease stems from a U.S. postretirement medical plan design change made in the third quarter of 2016. We expect slightly higher net interest costs in 2017 of about $5 million year-over-year. Next, we anticipate that the company’s 2017 tax rate on ongoing earnings from continuing operations will be in the range of 24.5% to 25.5%. The comparable rate for 2016 was 24.5%. The increase relates primarily to a shift in our regional earnings mix. Finally, as Michael mentioned, we announced a new 2-year cash deployment range of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion for the years 2017 and 2018 combined after dividends and capital expenditures, dedicated to acquisitions and share repurchases. Once again, a summary of these financial assumptions is contained in the presentation materials provided for today’s call. This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG. And now operator would you please open the line for questions?
Operator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Today’s first question comes from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Good afternoon. Mike, just on these targeted selling price increases, can you discuss where you are getting them or targeting them, what regions, what product lines? And what portion of the portfolio you think can you capture price over the next 6 months?
Michael McGarry: So David, we have announced price increases in a number of regions. So, just Canada, U.S., Mexico, Brazil, Central America, UK, Ireland, the Benelux as well as select countries in Central America or Central Europe, excuse me. So we have been aggressive in doing that. As you know, historically, we have always told people that we work with our customers on a proactive basis. We expect that as they start to see the price increases coming through, they can expect us to come and talk to them. I think they can see it coming now and so we are in discussions with a number of our customers.
David Begleiter: And Mike, just on gross margins, how would you expect gross margins to trend throughout the year? Can you see some gross margin expansion by Q3, Q4 do you think?
Michael McGarry: Well, I think gross margins are – you could see that we went down a little bit in industrial. I’m sure somebody will ask a question about that. And then raw materials will have some pressure. If you think about where we were in the first quarter last year with oil at $35, now we are at all oil at, let’s call it, $55 to round it up. So, you can expect that even though sequentially, raw materials are going to be rather flattish from fourth quarter to first quarter on a year-over-year basis, raw materials are up. So, I would say margins are going to be challenged in the beginning, but we have our restructuring program we announced and that will certainly provide us some benefit in the second half of the year.
David Begleiter: Thank you very much.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Frank Mitsch of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Frank Mitsch: Hey, good afternoon gentlemen and Frank, congrats on your pending retirement. I will never forget your first PPG conference call when Chuck had laryngitis and you took over like a champ during that call. So certainly big shoes for Vince to fill, and of course, Vince, congrats. Looking forward to working with you in your new role. And so, Michael, I know that organic volume growth is an important metric and has become a more important metric for you and you have got two quarters now in a row of 1.5% organic volume growth. What should we be thinking you can do in the early part of ‘17 here in terms of volume and perhaps for the year as a whole?
Michael McGarry: Yes, Frank, clearly, we are still not happy with – it maybe our best quarter yet call it slightly under 2% for our coatings portfolio. So we have told people that we expect to be GDP and when we are performing at a high performance, we would be GDP plus. So you probably saw in the corporate line that corporate costs were down. That was partly driven by us not hitting our volume goals. So, you could expect to see us continue to push organic growth as a key lever for us in 2017 and I think we will continue to get better as the year goes by.
Frank Mitsch: During your commentary, you mentioned – you gave the phrase of improving momentum in terms of economic activity, so that would almost imply that we are going to start seeing that 2% plus type organic volume growth sooner rather than later. Is that not the way for us to think about that?
Vince Morales: Frank, this is Vince. If you look at our coatings volumes as Michael mentioned, they were actually higher than our total company volumes. Coatings volumes are 1.7%, 1.8%. That’s our best mark of the year, and that’s part of the reason why we feel there is some improved momentum. We did see a recovery in volumes in Europe as well. So those are pieces to the puzzle as to why we are hoping and continuing to see improvement as we go into ‘17.
Frank Mitsch: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Kevin McCarthy: Yes, good afternoon gentlemen. So, you announced a capital deployment program of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion over the next 2 years. I was wondering if you could elaborate on the thought process behind establishing the bookends of the range, and Michael, I welcome any thoughts that you might have on the mix of likely repurchases versus what you are seeing in the M&A pipeline maybe not over the next 2 years, but perhaps over the next couple of quarters? Thank you.
Frank Sklarsky: Kevin, I will start out and then turn over to Michael. So the bookends, if you look at the center point, there is $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion. You think we are at the end of the year at $1.9 billion in cash and generate over $1 billion each in 2017 and 2018. That would still leave us a reasonable amount of cash on the balance sheet at any given time through the seasonal quarters. And of course in the recent past, we have been under $1 billion in cash. So what we want to do is deploy cash as we have it either on acquisitions, which would be our preference or share repurchases. That will depend on the pipeline in any given quarter, but returning that cash toward value creating activities, but that really relates to the center point. The variation around the mean, the $2.5 billion to the $3.5 billion really will depend upon business conditions and the amount of cash we have and the timing of any acquisitions that we might have over the period. And of course, always as before, we can always adjust that range as we did in the last program, where we started at one range and ended up at the top end of a higher range that we communicated later on and that was based on the fact that we had the affordability and the net cash to do so.
Michael McGarry: So Kevin, I will take the second half of the question, which is how do we think that will – mix will be. Right now, I would describe our acquisition pipeline as similar to what we have seen in the past. So we did slightly under $400 million the last couple of years in acquisitions. Obviously, the prices of acquisitions have gone up. We have adjusted our thinking on our own whack and those returns. At the end of the day though, we do see a lot of people think we see them paying exceptionally high prices for acquisitions. So we are going to continue to be disciplined and I would expect to see a similar type relationship between acquisitions and buying back shares.
Kevin McCarthy: Thanks. I appreciate the color.
Operator: And our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi of Baird. Please go ahead.
Ghansham Panjabi: Hi guys, how are you? Congrats Vince and Frank as well. I guess first off, on industrial coatings and the significant growth in auto OEM growth, did you see any change in pricing for that particular end market, one of your peers has been pointing towards seeing some pricing givebacks with the larger auto OEM customers, curious on what you are seeing in that market, too?
Michael McGarry: Well, I think the way I would describe that Ghansham is that we have always said our large, global, sophisticated customers typically kind of ply more price pressure than our businesses that go through distribution. And you saw some price degradation across the company. So you could probably make a pretty good guess of where that would be. What I would tell you though, is we have already started talking to all our customers about raw materials. So this is the early innings of that. I would tell you that overall though, they are paying for technology. So when you think about the industry, we have been growing at a faster rate than the industry in three of the four regions. And most of that has to do with technology, where we have captured additional share due to our Compact Process as well as bringing better productivity in their own OEM shops. So I think overall, our growth has been pretty much driven by meeting or exceeding our customer requirements.
Ghansham Panjabi: Okay, that’s helpful. And then just Michael, in terms of your view on the macro trend line in Europe, the volume improvement in 4Q versus what you saw in 3Q, was that just sort of a catch-up from 3Q being sort of sub-par or do you sense any shift in the macro as you head into 2017 in that region?
Michael McGarry: Well, it’s such a choppy environment over there in Europe. We have a number of countries, I mean you take UK, Ireland, I mean they have just consistently performed at a very high level. Germany doing pretty well. The laggards – I would say Southern Europe is also improving. So five quarters out of the last six quarters, we have had positive growth in Europe. And I would anticipate that we would have positive growth, but uneven in 2017. What also is in that number that has held it back, of course has been Middle East. Middle East is an important market for us and that market has certainly been under a lot of pressure as well as Africa. So Continental Europe, I am constructive on it. I think it is improving. And of course, from the automotive builds, I would say that we are probably in the sixth or seventh inning. We have a long way to go. They only made 13 million cars in Western Europe and we can see 16 million or 17 million cars easily, so more growth there to come.
Ghansham Panjabi: Okay. Thanks so much.
Michael McGarry: By the way, I misspoke as 14 million in Europe, builds.
Operator: And our next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn of Longbow Research. Please go ahead.
Dmitry Silversteyn: Good afternoon, I should say. You mentioned a little – previously the sort of the expectations of price increases in your raw material costs and your ability to get out of them and get this pricing over the course of months or quarters, if you look at your 2017 guidance, how much of a raw material inflation have you sort of baked in and is it more weighted towards the second half of the year or do you expect inflation to happen in the first half of the year and pricing to sort of come into effect and start offsetting that in the second half of the year?
Vince Morales: Dmitry, this is Vince. If you look at our 2017 year, a little bit of history here. If you look at the coatings industry historically, we typically see inflation. The industry and PPG’s work to get price in place, there is typically a 6-month to let’s call it 9-month lag between the earnest inflation and the price being adopted. So we are right in the let’s call it the second, third month of that window. So we would expect additional pricing to come from our customers over the course of the back half of the year. We are seeing, as Frank mentioned and Michael mentioned, we are seeing a little more inflation in the beginning of the year really just because last year’s first and second quarter were lower. We saw some step up in the back half of 2016. So we are anniversarying some inflation. So a little inflation in the first half of the year, offset by pricing in the second half, we expect that to neutralize the effect. And if not, we will take additional cost actions.
Dmitry Silversteyn: Got it. And as my follow-up, you have talked about and we have seen marine being a bad guy for you for going on 3 years now, are we getting close to the bottom on that business and/or maybe anniversarying some of the more tough comps and hopefully, seeing a little bit better results in performance coatings overall, has that business stabilized, is that a 2017 or 2018 type of outlook?
Michael McGarry: Okay. So let’s think about it this way, Dmitry. We typically paint a ship 9 months to 15 months after the order is taken. This year, orders in Korea are down 85% from the peak, and across Asia they are down 60% from the peak. So there is still more downward pressure in that market, but I don’t think orders are going to get worse. So I think from an order standpoint, it’s probably nearing the bottom. Now, the good news is we are aggressively managing our costs. So we can see as the order book thins, that we are taking aggressive action in that area and that’s part of the reason why you saw the fourth quarter announcement about restructuring. That was one of the businesses that was significantly impacted by that.
Dmitry Silversteyn: Got it, okay. So it sounds like another year at least. Thank you very much.
Michael McGarry: You’re welcome.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. It looks like the after-tax costs asbestos were maybe $675 million, is that right, which I think is maybe originally you were expecting $500 million and are there additional taxes that have yet to be paid on some of the properties that you sold and if so, what is the magnitude of the tax payments?
Frank Sklarsky: Yes. As for asbestos, it’s a little bit lower than that in terms of the after-tax cost and the other number that you might have been quoting, it depends on the timing of the cash payments versus the P&L tax. But from a cash basis in 2016, it was in the low-600s. We are pretty much done with that. There are no real additional tax payments on the properties that were sold in ‘16 and there is minimal tax leakage due to some tax attributes and some tax planning that we were able to embark on. So with respect to the flat glass business and the fiber glass businesses and the JVs, we were able to really secure more than $1 billion in after-tax proceeds. Now that said, the cash taxes for 2017 will probably be closer to that adjusted tax rate than they were in 2016, where we were able to use some attributes to offset some of these gains, so that will be a dynamic going forward, but no additional taxes associated with the divestitures going forward.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay. And then for my follow-up, in the fourth quarter in both of your segments, both of your key coating segments, your operating profits were down year-over-year and you are talking about raw material inflation and lacking price increases. So, it sounds like you have a bearish point of view towards your first half and then maybe you have some growth in your second half. So in 2017, are we sort of looking for maybe a flat or a flat to up year in earnings for PPG?
Frank Sklarsky: Well, first, Jeff, just for the year, just to clarify, so each of the operating segments for full year had increases in what we call that PTPI ROS margin. Now fourth quarter...
Jeff Zekauskas: [indiscernible] fourth quarter, yes.
Frank Sklarsky: Yes, for the fourth quarter, there were a couple of impacts and most notably as Michael mentioned before, industrial coatings was the one, where you saw a little bit of a reduction. That was driven really by a couple of different factors. There are probably a couple of tenths of a point driven by some acquisitions that haven’t been fully integrated yet. There is actually about 0.3% impact from currency in Q4 industrial coatings just because the dynamics between the top and the bottom line, about 0.5% associated with some of the additional cost that Michael referenced for logistics and transportation to meet some demands in Asia, that’s really a temporary dynamic. And then, of course, from the slide, you can back into the approximately 100 basis points of price in industrial for Q4 year-over-year. Now, I think the wildcard for 2017 will be exactly what the currency impact is going to be. The cost we are addressing clearly will fully integrate the acquisition, so that won’t be a dynamic going forward. We are going to manage very carefully as Michael mentioned the targeting of prices versus input costs. So that should improve. We will get restructuring benefits. So, it’s really the currency dynamic. So overall, for the year, margins were up. Q4 a little bit of a dip in the role, but based on some unique factors but going forward, we still expect the opportunity to accrete margins in ‘17.
Michael McGarry: And Jeff, let me just add. We are – I want to disabuse you of the thought that earnings would be flat. That’s not our base case at all, not only are we going to have volume growth that’s going to be a positive. We are going to have earnings accretive cash deployment, that will be a positive and we have the self-help from our restructuring program. So, that’s also a help. So, we will see positive EPS growth year-over-year.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay, great. Thank you so much.
Michael McGarry: Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: And our next question comes from PJ Juvekar of Citigroup. Please go ahead.
PJ Juvekar: Thank you and congratulations both Frank and Vince.
Frank Sklarsky: Thanks, PJ.
PJ Juvekar: Question on architectural paints, was there any inventory adjustment at the big boxes or was there anything going on there that you saw the decline on the national level and national chains?
Michael McGarry: Yes. So PJ, it’s always hard to draw inferences from the fourth quarter. Obviously, we have line reviews going on. One of the major differences ‘15 versus ‘16 if you remember ‘15 we had a very warm October, early November. We had very good stain sales in that regard. It did not repeat in 2016. We had positive POS. So, the sell-out is better than the sell-in. That gives us some good feelings going forward. Like I said, fourth quarter and first quarter are always difficult to think about it from the standpoint that the home centers can make adjustments in their inventories. But when we look at the POS data, we’re – I would say we are still optimistic.
PJ Juvekar: Thank you. And secondly, there is significant consolidation going on in paints. Recently, we saw Nippon Paint coming into the U.S. with the acquisition of Dunn-Edwards. So where do you think the multiples are that are being paid today? And what is your comfort zone, Michael, when you deploy that capital?
Michael McGarry: Well, I don’t think I want to tell you my comfort zone, because people might know where we want to bid. But obviously, when you look at the Dunn-Edwards number, I would tell you that Nippon was aggressive, overly aggressive in our opinion. Clearly, they were wanting to get a toehold in the U.S. market. They viewed this as an opportunistic way to get in and they took advantage of that. So, I would tell you that the multiples are clearly higher, but we are just going to have to adapt to the changing environment.
Vince Morales: Thanks, PJ. If I could, as Frank mentioned earlier, we are going to keep our financial discipline and we are going to try to reward our shareholders and create value for our shareholders as part of any transaction.
PJ Juvekar: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Dan Rizzo: Hi, this is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. You mentioned that the Comex performed pretty well in the quarter. Is there opportunity for expansion of Comex into other parts of Latin America? And that’s the first part of the question. And two, I mean, is the unrest in Mexico having a clean affect, where the growth – the pace of growth is slowing?
Michael McGarry: So, let me address a couple of those questions, Dan. The first one is we have taken the Comex model into Central America. We gave guidance that it would be $60 million to $70 million in new sales. We are tracking above that growth rate. We said that would be over a 3 to 5-year period. Central America for us grew a very small business obviously, but it grew nearly 40% year-over-year. So, it was an outstanding performer from that regard. The Comex team, we have said it would grow more than 2x GDP, has exceeded that significantly, so another good year by the PPG-Comex team. The current unrest because of the raise in gasoline prices, we have lost about 300 store days, which through the first, whatever, 20, 19 days, it’s really insignificant. It’s less than 1% of our total store days being opened. I looked at the sales through the first 19 days. The sales are ahead of last year’s pace. So we are tracking pretty well in that regard. So obviously, we are not happy with the unrest. But overall, it has not impacted our business. I am more concerned about the consumer sentiment. Right now, consumer sentiment in Mexico remains solid. And so we anticipate another good year. Last year, we opened 212 stores, which is more than one store every other day. We are up to 4,213 stores. We have a plan to open almost another 200 stores this year. So overall, we expect to have another very good year in Mexico.
Dan Rizzo: Is consumer sentiment such that, I mean, it telegraphs well enough where you can see that’s changing and things like change – alter your plans or is it something you might be concerned that it happens kind of coincidentally, where consumer sentiment falls and sales falloff at the same time. I was just wondering if there is any lead time there?
Vince Morales: Typically in the paint industry in architectural consumer sentiment is real-time or close to real-time, Dan.
Dan Rizzo: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Nils Wallin of CLSA. Please go ahead.
Nils Wallin: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I was just curious in terms of the restructuring, where you have mentioned that a lot of it was in marine. What, if you would give us, where some of the big buckets are in terms of your restructuring program?
Frank Sklarsky: Sure, Nils. It’s Frank. It’s pretty broad-based. It’s covering virtually all of our functions and virtually all of our business units and targeting those areas, mainly in USCA and EMEA is where the vast majority of the actions are taking place. It’s where we have most of our operations in any case. But really I would say, the administrative functions really runs the gamut, where we move more into shared services and consolidate operations from various countries into hub-and-spoke operations. And then when you look at the various business units – virtually every business unit as participating certainly you mentioned PMC. That’s one of them. All the businesses and fiberglass had gotten ahead of the game, because we knew we were divesting the European operations, so they got a little ahead of the game, ahead of this program, but nevertheless, they have made some reductions. But we haven’t singled out any particular business or any particular region. It’s just skewed more toward USCA and EMEA because of the size of the operations in those areas.
Vince Morales: And Nils, we use USCA for U.S. Canada as abbreviation.
Frank Sklarsky: Right.
Nils Wallin: I finally figured out that one. Thanks. Just in terms of marine, does marine, the business on its own earned its cost of capital over the cycle?
Michael McGarry: I would say right now, it does. It’s certainly below the company average. But like many acquisitions, we do marine was cobbled together through various acquisitions. It starts lower. It appreciates over time. This business was pretty much at the company average prior to the downturn in the shipbuilding business and we fully expect it to be back at or above the industry or the company average, but certainly not until the industry recovers.
Frank Sklarsky: And it’s a great question, too, because we have now deployed significant new capital against some of the businesses that are having a challenging macroeconomic environment, we came in below our CapEx plan in 2016 by mid double-digits, primarily because we look at the macro environment, we try to our capital spending just in time, and we target the spending to those businesses where we think we can get the quickest return and gears much toward those areas that are growing, not just maintenance capital. So yes, the cost of capital might be less, but we are not deploying any new capital until we see the light at the end of the tunnel in terms of volume growth.
Vince Morales: And there was one more comment because the marine shipbuilding is project oriented and we are able to very easily see with very good sight projects coming and getting completed, we are able to ratchet down our cost structure as projects get completed. So there is not a heavy fixed cost load. There is a lot of project costs. So, again, it’s not – we are able to manage it towards not decremental to the earnings of the segment or the company.
Nils Wallin: Understood. Thanks very much.
Michael McGarry: Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from John Roberts of UBS. Please go ahead.
John Roberts: Thank you. Do you think the antitrust review between two of your key peers will affect the timing of the North American spring channel sell-in, that is, do you think customers might want to delay a little bit here to see how that plays out?
Michael McGarry: John, I don’t sit in either Atlanta or Charlotte or D.C. from a regulatory standpoint. So I really would be total speculation. I think I should stay away from speculating. But I think they are all looking at it and they will all make their best judgments depending upon how it all works out.
John Roberts: Maybe I will try an easier one and you may have answered this on the last call, I apologize, but will glass continue to be a reported segment through 2017 or is the objective here to just exit the rest of glass as fast as you can and it just – it disappears as the segment that way?
Michael McGarry: Well, glass will continue to be a reported segment while we have in our portfolio the North American fiber glass business will continue to be in continuing operations. We stated before that the glass businesses are not necessarily part of the core business, but the businesses did well in 2016. It’s expected to continue to improve in 2017 based on the actions that the business has taken. They have done a good job. And it will continue to be reportable segment and continuing operations until otherwise.
Frank Sklarsky: And John, if I can just add if you look at the fourth quarter results, which just include the North American fiber glass business, they had significant improvement year-over-year in earnings, up I think 600 basis points and really reflective of the good work we are doing on the cost side and some good work we are doing on the technology side.
John Roberts: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Mike Harrison of Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.
Mike Harrison: Hi, good afternoon, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your strategy in Europe and the architectural business there, you have done a couple of acquisitions. First of all, can you talk about how long you expect it to take to integrate those businesses, are there additional consolidation opportunities there and are there ways to really leverage the PPG brand across the whole continent or do you continue to view it as kind of a set of individual sub-regions or individual country markets there?
Michael McGarry: So the first question deals with the acquisition. So we owned 50% of Univer. So there is zero integration except that we have lower costs now with the former ownership and some additional layers that we are able to take out post the prior owners leaving. So zero, totally integrated, already performing at a higher level than previously. Deutek in Romania, this is a standard PPG deal, where we go in and raw materials get brought in day 1. So January 4, raw material prices went down there. And then we are going to bring in our additional products. They can sell in Romania. So that will be a positive. And then we will roll the back office into our various back office centers in Europe. So that integration we expect to go very smoothly, and there are more opportunities in Europe to acquire. This is still a very regional business. We are constantly talking to families that own coatings companies in Europe. They are always part of our pipeline. And we just can’t predict when one generation will decide to sell. In regards to a pan-European brand, we have looked at that. We have also been asked by several of our larger DIY customers in Europe about that. We are expecting that they will roll out something similar but not quite pan-European in the early 2017 with one of our products. So we will wait to see how that launches. But by and large, it is still a very regional business.
Mike Harrison: Right. And then shifting over to the architectural side in North America, it seems like we are still seeing continued sluggish architectural volumes there even though the housing fundamentals look pretty good, how do you explain the current weak patch that we are seeing in the paint industry and do you think we are setting up to normalize next year and see some better growth in 2017?
Michael McGarry: Well, I would tell you that historically, we have been fairly accurate on the paint projections. We said last year in 2016, it would be 2% to 3%. I think that was borne out. I think people still underestimate the size of the maintenance business. I mean it’s let’s call it 70% to 80% of all paint is applied in a maintenance mode and so despite how strong housing looks in the house formation as well as new home sales, that doesn’t move the needle as much as the maintenance side of the business. So I would tell you that we expect to see 2% to 3% growth again in 2017. And I might add one other item to your prior question and that is we don’t participate in a number of countries in Europe, so there are still more growth opportunities in those countries that we don’t participate in.
Mike Harrison: Alright. Thanks very much.
Frank Sklarsky: Thanks Mike.
Operator: Sorry. And our next question today comes from Christopher Parkinson of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Christopher Parkinson: Thank you. In terms of your general macro expectations, can you talk a little bit more about your growth outlooks and what you are hearing from customers in Europe and Mexico, especially across the industrial and I guess architectural parallels, you just hit on that. And just generally, do you anticipate any changes in spending behaviors over the next year or so due to recent elections or even in some cases, some modest uncertainty pertaining to upcoming elections in Western Europe, just any general thoughts on how we should think about that, that would be helpful? Thanks.
Michael McGarry: So when I think about Europe there is obviously elections in France, election later in the year in Germany. I don’t know when the elections in Italy will come because it’s a very complicated country for that. But consumer sentiment still is what I would call modest and most of our customers are kind of put that other back of their mind. They say, hey, we are going to continue to perform. We are going to continue to push our own customers to grow. And so that’s why we are thinking that Europe is going to grow 2 plus kind of percent next year for us. So I think that’s our sentiment there. For Mexico, from the supply chain standpoint, we paint cars in Mexico and we paint cars in the U.S. So whatever consternation may or may not be out there, we will paint cars wherever they are built. So for us, that is a bigger question for our customers than it is for us because they know we will be there whenever and wherever they need us.
Vince Morales: In terms of some other macros Chris, we are seeing some early signs of recovery in energy CapEx. We think that’s been a large drag on the U.S. industrial production numbers. So we think that’s favorable. And as Michael mentioned in his prepared remarks, we are seeing a flattening in Brazil from – or South America from significant negatives. So those are two other data points.
Christopher Parkinson: Great. And just quickly turning back to the raw material basket outlook, can you just give us a quick update on [indiscernible] including ability to meet specs delivery numbers? And then any expectation you have for the cadence of the production ramp over the longer term? Thank you.
Frank Sklarsky: Yes, we can’t speak about the production ramp per se. It’s their process, their business, their facility. So, we will leave it up to them, but they are working with us. We continue to get product from them. We expect product to continue to flow certainly in the same manner, if not more in 2017 and they are still going through their normal startup process. So at this point, it’s been a success for us and we continue to expect it to do so going forward.
Christopher Parkinson: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Tom Narayan of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Tom Narayan: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Really appreciate Slide 12 here, the 2017 financial guidance. When I look at this and let’s see assuming that, I guess, the GDP 2% to 3% growth kind of thing, the FX assumptions and then all the puts and takes below the EBIT line, it would appear that a lot of the EPS growth that you guys maybe seeing in 2017 could be coming from the share buyback. To what extent do you guys use EPS as a rationale behind deciding on how you allocate that the $3 billion over 2017, 2018 or do you not really look at that at all?
Frank Sklarsky: Yes, we do. When you look at the $3 billion or the $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion over the 2-year period, the first determinant is how much cash we have in the balance sheet and how much cash we expect to generate and the fact that we do not need to carry more than I will say mid to high triple-digits millions of dollars on the balance sheet at any given time to run our operation. So it’s best used to create value for the shareholders. First priority on that, of course, this is after dividends and after CapEx, first priority being accretive acquisitions. But in any quarter where we don’t necessarily have an imminent acquisition or line of sight when it’s taking place, we would return the cash to the shareholders at a reasonable pattern. So in any given year, you would expect to see a balance between acquisitions and share repurchases with the first priority being acquisitions and then repurchases. But you are right, there is some element of EPS, EPS growth that is predicated upon deploying that cash either toward acquisitions that gets you additional EBITDA and against share repurchases which obviously increases the EPS just based on the arithmetic, but it is a component of that.
Tom Narayan: Okay, thanks. And then my last question, you guys just commented on the U.S. architectural market and what’s going on despite what’s going on with housing. I get the maintenance argument, that’s very helpful. What about the share shift from DIY to pro? And could you maybe comment on what’s going on like within your own U.S. architectural business in that dynamic. Could that be playing a role perhaps?
Michael McGarry: We don’t really see a significant share shift from DIY to pro. I mean, obviously, the bigger issue is pros are full up. There is not a lot of new painters coming in the market. So, I would say there is probably a little bit of a drag if anything from the professional side, because I don’t see a lot of young painters out there.
Tom Narayan: Understood. Thanks a lot.
Frank Sklarsky: Tom, if I could add to that, our mix of business between DIY and pro matches the industry. So we have said in the past we are channel agnostic.
Tom Narayan: Understood. Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from Richard O’Reilly of Revere Associates. Please go ahead.
Richard O’Reilly: Thank you. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Just have a question about the cash from operations. I just want to understand the math. In 2016, you generated $1.25 billion and that was after the asbestos settlement of $800 million?
Frank Sklarsky: Yes, it was. The $1.25 billion was after the $800 million asbestos settlement. Keep in mind though that there was some tax benefit associated with that. So the way we like to do it in a full transparency is to say that, that $1.25 billion would have been close to $1.9 billion if you were to add back the after-tax cost of the asbestos settlement.
Richard O’Reilly: Okay, $1.9 billion. So if the dividends and CapEx or your free cash, so to speak, was about $1.1 billion?
Frank Sklarsky: It was approaching $1.1 billion.
Vince Morales: Including that adjustment.
Frank Sklarsky: Yes.
Richard O’Reilly: Okay, yes including. Okay. So for this year and next, you are at the low end of that 2 point – if we double that, you are at the 2 point – at the low end of $2.5 billion range that you want to use?
Frank Sklarsky: And again we started the year with almost $1.9 billion in cash balance, which is more than we need to have because we – I got the after-tax proceeds from the divestitures all in Q4, so we started the year and then we add another $1 billion plus in each of the year. So we really have between $2.5 billion and $3.5 billion to deploy based on what we – I would add and still have plenty left to run the business.
Richard O’Reilly: Okay. Second question, outside of North American fiber glass, there is nothing else that sticks out in your portfolio that doesn’t fit the core or whatever you want to use the word, am I right?
Michael McGarry: That’s correct, Tom [ph].
Richard O’Reilly: Okay, fine. And third question, I am surprised no one has asked you about titanium pigment pricing or your costs going into the New Year, do you have any comments on that?
Michael McGarry: So this is a little history lesson. We saw a little modest second quarter and third quarter increases in 2016. In the fourth quarter, no increases except a little bit in China. So we still believe this is a supply-demand driven business. Supply is slightly up. Demand is slightly up. So they are pretty much in balance from that standpoint. The only thing we can see is that we see some of our smaller companies that we have been looking at buy-in, some of them do price buy-in. Obviously, that’s an artificial demand. It’s not a good business practice, but they feel like they need to protect themselves because they are not like some of the larger coatings companies that can negotiate hard in this regard. So we don’t anticipate significant upward pressure. But again, it’s a supply-demand driven business and we will react accordingly.
Richard O’Reilly: Okay, good. Thank you and congratulations to Vince. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Matt Gingrich: Hey guys. This is Matt Gingrich on for Vince. On the restructuring initiative, does that include potential cost synergies associated with the recent acquisitions or will those flow-through separately. And then also how should we think about the cadence of the 2017 restructuring savings?
Frank Sklarsky: Yes. They do not include the synergies from the acquisitions. Those would be separate and over and above. In terms of the cadence, we are trying to actually accelerate these actions as best we can based on what we see out there. We said 40 to 50 for the year, it will obviously ramp up through the year. So there will be more in the back half than the first half. And we are trying to get to the execution as quickly as we can, but it will ramp up ratably throughout the year. Hopefully, we will get some of those savings booked in the first half.
Matt Gingrich: And then on packaging how much of the market at this point in North America and EMEA has now converted to non-BPA and where do you see that composition going?
Michael McGarry: I think the way I would describe that is we are in the third inning of a nine-inning ballgame. We have a number of trials still going on. We have a number of conversions that we have to get accomplished in 2017. And of course and then there is still more work to be done. They can’t take on all that work overnight and there are still a number of countries around the world that they haven’t converted. So like I said, we are in the third inning. And we have been winning more than our fair share. The brand owners really love PPG. They love the technology that we are bringing and that’s been a real positive for us.
Matt Gingrich: Is your outgrowth in Asia Pacific related to non-BPA conversions or is that a product of other factors?
Vince Morales: Our holistic growth in Asia Pacific is related to many businesses. Our packaging growth in Asia Pacific is certainly aided by the BPA-free technology.
Matt Gingrich: Great. Thanks guys.
Operator: And our next question comes from James Sheehan of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.
James Sheehan: Thank you. Can you talk about the performance of U.S. auto OEM business, you are showing it as having coming in a little bit below the market, is that because your technology is largely penetrated in that region or are there other factors to explain that?
Michael McGarry: No. James, we had covered this in previous calls. We had to make a choice on where to take business going into 2016 and we preferentially picked up business in Asia and Europe, where we saw the growth rates at a higher level. And so we have grown so much faster than the market. Our large customers wanted to make sure that we didn’t get too large in that space. So that’s what happened. We would – you should expect another one to two more quarters of negative comps versus the industry. And then we will anniversary it. Actually what I anticipate going forward is that they have not moved the Compact Process yet in the U.S. And when they decide to do some Brownfields in the U.S., we will then start to win at a very good rate. So I am optimistic going forward starting in 2000 probably – Brownfields will probably be a 2018, 2019 kind of initiative.
Vince Morales: And just if I could elaborate Jim, again our math worked out. We matched the global growth rate build for 2016. Again with our regional differences, we expect to at least match that global growth rate in 2017 and likely start to exceed it again based on the comments Michael made and the actions we took.
James Sheehan: Terrific and then could you also comment on the potential benefit you might see from any big increase in infrastructure spending from Washington and the timing of that?
Michael McGarry: Well, I would tell you that that’s highly speculative. It takes a while for policy changes to work its way through the executive and legislative branches. Infrastructure is good, so if it happens, we will be all over it. It does take a while to gear up to do some of these things. So we have not put that in our forward-looking plan for 2017.
James Sheehan: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead.
Don Carson: Thank you. Another question your heat map on Slide 5, Vince you mentioned that you are agnostic as to what architectural channel you sell-through, but you continue to have below market growth. So I am just wondering what’s driving that and specifically referring to the U.S. market, is it your product mix and your greater reliance on stain that drives that difference?
Vince Morales: No. Don, if we hearken back to a few other calls we have had this year, one of our channels that’s nice channel for us, but it does have a shrinking nature to it is the independent dealer channel and so we are that channel shrinking natively and we expect that to continue. So it’s certainly one of the reasons why we are below overall market.
Don Carson: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Vince Morales for any closing remarks.
Vince Morales: Again, I want to thank everybody for their time and participation today. We will certainly be available for calls after this call. So please reach out and we will handle any additional questions. Thank you.
Operator: And thank you, sir. Today’s conference has now concluded. And we thank you all for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Welcome to the PPG Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Scott Minder, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Scott Minder: Thanks, Gary. Good afternoon. This is Scott Minder, Director of Investor Relations. We appreciate your interest in PPG Industries and welcome you to this teleconference to review PPG's third quarter, 2016 financial results. Joining me on the call from PPG, are, Michael McGarry, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Frank Sklarsky, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Vince Morales, Vice President of Finance.  Our comments relate to the financial information released on Thursday, October 20, 2016.

The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide additional support to the opening comments Michael will make momentarily. Following Michael's perspective on the company's results for the quarter, we will move to a Q&A session.  Both the commentary and discussion during the call may contain forward-looking statements, reflecting the company's current view of future events and the potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements.  This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided, in the appendix of the presentation materials which are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC. Now, let me introduce PPG Chairman and CEO, Michael McGarry. 
Michael McGarry: Thank you, Scott. And good afternoon, everyone. I want to thank you for your continued interest in PPG. Today, we reported our third quarter 2016 financial results. We achieved third quarter net sales of $3.8 billion and adjusted earnings-per-share from continued operations of $1.56. Third quarter net sales in local currencies grew by more than 3%, including year-over-year buy-in growth of 1.6%. We achieved this growth, despite a broad-based deceleration of buy-in growth rates in Europe this quarter, in comparison to the previous several quarters. Acquisition related sales contributed about 2% in the quarter due to our MetoKote, IVC Industrial Coatings and Le Joint Francais acquisitions. Unfavorable foreign currencies reduced sales by about 2%, due to primarily, the significant year-over-year declines in the Mexican Peso and the British Pound.  The British Pound was down about 15% versus the prior-year period and the Mexican Peso was down about 12%. With respect to the Peso, as we've discussed in the past, the PPG Comex architectural coatings business is seasonally strongest in the back-half of the year. Therefore, a weakened Peso is more impactful to us at this time of the year.  From an earnings perspective, our adjusted earnings per share grew 1% versus the prior year. We had positive earnings contribution from the higher overall sales volumes, offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation and higher growth related spending. What I just discussed, were all year-over-year comparisons.  As all of you know, we provided earnings guidance during the first week of October, as our EPS was short of our expectations leaning into the third quarter. We haven't had to provide pre-guidance on earnings for quite some time, so let me quickly discuss what we experienced during the quarter. The largest shortfall that we experienced during the third quarter, was slower than expected volume growth in Europe. This region has been one of our strongest growth engines over the past year plus. Our year-over-year European volumes which have been growing by low-to-mid, single digit percentages, came in essentially flat for the quarter.  While we have experienced some regional volume growth in certain businesses, such as Automotive OEM and General Industrial Coatings. The rate of growth contracted in these businesses. In addition, we experienced a similar, several hundred basis point decline, in most of our other regional business. This broad decline was also evidenced across many countries within the region.  This lack of volume growth, coupled with the fact that Europe currently has our highest regional incremental operating margins, these incremental margins reflect the significant cost rationalization we have done over the past five years. While there were other factors in the quarter, the absence of the European volume growth and the related benefits from higher incremental margins, were the major factors in our below expectation performance.  Looking at the other regions, we basically performed as expected. The Asia-Pacific region delivered solid mid-to-high single digit percentage buy-in growth, on a year-over-year basis, including strong gains in Automotive OEM and Refinish Coatings. These increases were partially offset by continued declines in Marine Coatings, due to exceptionally weak and continuing declines in ship building activity. The Automotive OEM strength in the Asia-Pacific region, was in comparison to a weak prior year period, when regional Automotive OEM industry production was down. In the fourth quarter, we will face significantly stronger comparison period, as the industry production was up nearly 20% in the prior year. Coating sales volumes were flat in the U.S. and Canada, compared to the prior year. We experienced volume growth in our U.S. and Canadian Architectural Coatings business, versus a volume decline in the prior-year period.  Leading our growth, were higher volumes at our company-owned stores, coupled with increased sales through the DIY channel, supported by our new products and the associated higher launch related promotional spending. Also in the region, year-over-year sales volumes, continued to expand in Refinish and Packaging Coatings, but were offset by a lower Automotive OEM sales and declines in General Industrial Coatings which mirrored the weak industrial production in the region.  Latin American sales volumes expanded, primarily due to growth in the Mexican Architectural Coatings and OEM Coatings markets, while most South American markets remain challenging.  Overall, I am pleased we were able to grow sales volumes and we did deliver a modest earnings-per-share growth, versus the prior year. However, I am disappointed by our earnings progression versus the prior two quarters of 2016 and our 1% year-over-year earnings-per-share growth is well below our expectations.  Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we currently do not see any near term evidence of improvement in global demand. We now have a strong sense of our October book and as many of you know, for business seasonality reasons, the month of October is typically the largest sales month within the fourth quarter. As a result of this continued, tepid demand, we're reviewing various potential restructuring actions, to reduce our structural operating and functional costs.  With these actions, we will place increased focus on regions and end-use markets that are the weakest. We're still vetting these potential actions and will provide an update, once we're finalized. We plan on maintaining an appropriate level of investment and growth related initiatives, including research and development, sales, technical support and product branding initiatives.  Also worth mentioning, during the quarter, we continue to execute on our strategic objectives, including a continuation of our portfolio actions. On July 1, 2016, we completed the MetoKote acquisition, a coating services business, with approximately $200 million in annual revenue.  Also, in the third quarter, we announced that sale of our ownership interest in our two fiberglass joint ventures in Asia. The sale of these two joint ventures, is expected to close by year-end, 2016. Lastly, we completed the sales of our Flat Glass and European Fiberglass businesses, with both transactions closing on October 1, 2016.  In addition to these portfolio actions, we completed $250 million in share repurchases during the third quarter. Finally, we ended the third quarter with about $1 billion of cash and short term investments. This figure excludes about $1 billion of gross proceeds from two recently divested businesses and the pending sale of our ownership interest in the two Asian fiberglass joint ventures. We expect only modest tax leakage from these business divestments.  We have ample flexibility and we will continue to deploy cash in an earnings-accretive manner. While we remain price disciplined, our acquisition pipeline remains active. Additionally, our Board of Directors recently authorized an additional $2 billion repurchase program which gave us at that time of approval, about 2.5 billion, of share repurchase capacity.  We expect to deploy at least $650 million to cash in the fourth quarter, on acquisitions and share repurchases, to reach the top-end our previously-communicated cash deployment range of $2 billion - $2.5 billion, in the combined 2015-2016 calendar years. We have deployed $1.5 billion toward the target to date.  To summarize, we grew our year-over-year earnings in the third quarter, but at a rate that was below my expectations. We're working on a variety of actions to improve our earnings growth rate, including an acceleration of cash deployment and further reductions in our overall cost structure, while preserving prudent growth-related investments.  This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Chris Evans [ph] on for Bob. On the negative pricing, you guys showed -- could you breakout exactly which end markets you saw this pricing or kind of what the dynamic was across your portfolio? 
Michael McGarry: We're not going to get into the specifics by business unit, but what I will tell you is that typically in our coatings portfolio what you will find a larger sophisticated customers understand the law material environment and we always work with them in a collaborative and constructive manner whether it's an upper price environment or down raw material environment. And so the way to think about this is our largest customers might have seen a slight price reduction whereas our smaller customers that goes through distribution would be an overall flat environment or slightly up. Overall for the year we had told you that we would be in a flat pricing environment and for the full year we still expect that to be overall flat. 
Unidentified Analyst: And I guess as raw materials move, inflate, what are your expectations and how you think pricing -- your ability to get pricing next year [indiscernible] derivatives and a few others might work against you? 
Michael McGarry: So, right now, Chris, the tailwinds have certainly diminished. However, we have not really seen any real inflation yet it except for a small pickup in TiO2. Certainly, a lot of the feed stocks are up since January 1 but again we don't price in real-time, so we don't always get all the benefits on the way down and we don't always get all the prices on the way up. So, again, we will work with our customers. We typically lag on the way down and lag on the way up and I don't expect that this next cycle will be any different than what we have seen in the past. 
Vince Morales: This is Vince, I'm going to add one comment if you look at our supply chain, many of our suppliers have expanded their margins over the past couple of years. So, if we do see inflation in oil or oil derivatives we would expect first cut to come out of their pocket. 
Operator: The next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. Please go ahead.
John Roberts: Were there any significant deals that you had hoped to close in the quarter but maybe they had fallen into the fourth quarter? 
Vince Morales: John, we don't provide speculation on deals or potential deals. I think Michael said we have an active M&A pipeline, we think for the industry it's very active. Hopefully we can continue to use our cash in a constructive manner with reference to acquisitions but if not, [indiscernible] share buybacks.
John Roberts: And then we come to think of cost cutting at PPG and productivity sort of evergreen here, do you think after so many years of being so successful in your cost cutting and productivity are just so lean at this point that we're kind of reaching the end of the ability to bring additional cost cuts to the earnings bottom line? 
Frank Sklarsky: John, this is Frank. It's a good question but the way we look at it there are always opportunities for rationalization of our cost structure as we continue to move more administrative cost into shared service environments as we look at our overall supply chain footprint, as we continue to integrate both recent and legacy acquisitions and look at our total administrative cost structure. We think there's still additional opportunities for the broad-based and significant cost actions which we would like to embark on over the next year and while we don't have a specific number for you right now, we're looking at that very carefully analyzing all the details and we'll get back to you in the near future in terms of what the exact numbers are and the benefits associated with any rationalization actions but we still think there are ample opportunities for continual rationalize costs. 
Michael McGarry: As you know, having productivity initiative is a DNA of PPG and every bit is seen as expected every year to come forward with productivity initiatives so this isn't anything new but we're certainly ratcheting up the attention in this area. 
Operator: The next question comes from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Frank Mitsch: Michael you referenced that this is the first time in a long time that folks have to reannounce that it was 2008 was the last time and obviously we were in for a really big rough patch in 2009 as well and given your results in Q3 and given the outlook for 1% or 2% growth in Q4, do you have confidence in 2017 being materially better year? And if so, why? 
Michael McGarry: Frank, as you know this is something that we haven't had to do in a long time, I appreciate you actually picking up on the exact year, 2008 but I feel confident, when I look around the global economy, I don't see anything ready to fall off the table. I mean we still see some of the same weaknesses that we've seen in the past, Brazil continues to be challenged, Russia continues to be challenged, there are continued weaknesses in other economies certainly Korea remains challenged but, when I look across the big industries like automotive we're still expecting automotive next year to be marginally up certainly the U.S. is moving into the ninth inning but Europe still has room to go on that. So, no, I don't see anything like what we experienced in the back half of 2008. So, I'm confident that we will see improvement in 2017. 
Frank Sklarsky : This is the other Frank, there are three major actors at is what truly going to drive the earnings growth going forward. Is some level of organic growth and we've mention the fact that it was a very modest macro environment recently. And it may continue but to the extent we have some level of organic growth similar to what we've seen, roughly a little better is Michael mentioned, GDP at least, because cost rationalization that we just referred to as well as the accretive deployment whether that be M&A or share purchase accommodation of those, some combination of those, gives us confidence that we will continue to grow earnings at a reasonable level. 
Frank Mitsch: I think you were referring to something like a 60 million incremental additional costs for growth spending in the quarter. Something of that order of magnitude. How long do you anticipate that incrementally higher growth spending to occur? And at what point do you anticipate realizing a return on that added investment? 
Michael McGarry: So Frank, I don't think I'd be plugging 60 million into your model. These spending initiatives are directly tied to product launches. As you know, our product at Home Depot was first put out -- it was fully set in Fourth of July weekend. So, we're certainly behind that product. It started out very well. The Menards product as well being super premium price point there was percent. That is our Pittsburgh paint paramount. Those spendings are directly tied to the new product launches. So, you won't have that in the fourth quarter. We're working with our partners on the launches for 2017. And we'll be back to you if we expect to see those kind of spending going forward but we're going to continue to invest in growth related initiatives. 
Frank Mitsch: Should we factor something like $0.20 incremental benefit by the absence of those added costs something about order of magnitude?
Frank Sklarsky: Well again, Frank, that's on a full year basis and we only have this cost in Q3 so I think if you're analyzing that as Michael said this is only one quarter's worth which was probably $0.04. 
Operator: The next question comes from Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Christopher Parkinson: Just digging down a little more on what you're seeing in the global auto OEM businesses, can you just comment on your expectations for geographic growth between Mexico and the U.S. as well as any regional trends intra-Europe that you've seen ? And also given some uncertainty regarding the Chinese auto market reaction to any changes in consumer incentives can you just quickly comment on what you are seeing in small vehicle versus small SUVs in your relative exposure there? 
Michael McGarry: Chris, let's start with Mexico. As you know there are a number of new automotive plants in Mexico coming up in the next -- starting now through 2018. And those plans will obviously drive higher growth rate in Mexico then historically. That would -- that may or may not necessarily detract from the U.S. but the overall U.S. market to be relatively flat next year. We're watching closely the incidence of the automotive manufacturers are putting out there. And I think we'll just continue to watch the closely. Europe at 14 million builds still has room to run. Southern Europe continues to perform very well. So, if you look at what has gone on in Spain, it was up double digits. Italy was up double digits. Germany was still up 5%. And we're starting to see trends on the automotive side, unfortunately not in the architectural side, but the automotive side. So that's all good. I think that's going to be a positive number next year in Europe. Then, back to your question about China, rest of all, China is the reduced tax out there through the end of 2016. There's no indication on whether or not they're going to make a change on that.. From a personal perspective that China, once their -- once automotive business to be a champion, they are just now starting to export a very small amount of cars out of China. We would expect them to continue to support them. So, I'm not looking for a material change in the China automotive growth rate. In fact, I would say it's going to grow again next year and I won't be surprised if it has many, many years to run because if you look at the number of cars per person in China it's still very, very low. It's a big status symbol when you buy a car in China. So, that's going to continue. 
Christopher Parkinson: And just a very quick follow-up. You mentioned $35 million in sales at the low average segment margins in industrial. So can you very quickly comment about the cadence of your efforts pertaining to these businesses getting up towards your targets as well as any broad comments you have on how we should think about the M&A pipeline going forward in the context of margins? Thank you very much.
Vince Morales: As it's typical when we acquire especially a smaller bolt-on type transactions they're not at our segment margin levels whether it be performance or industrial coating segments. It typically takes us a minimum of a year to start to extract the full synergies from those transactions and so that's a normal cadence on a traditional transaction. With respect to the acquisition pipeline I think Michael mentioned it earlier we do have a very active pipeline in the industry. I think Michael said a quarter ago one of the most active we've seen which is I think helpful for us as we look into late 2016 early 2017 for potential confirmation. 
Operator: The next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Ghansham Panjabi: First off on auto refinish and the decline in 3Q volumes in Europe, Michael, do you sort of view this as an entry correction in the supply chain and did you see it in any particular subregion within Europe? 
Michael McGarry: I think that overall by and large seven Europe is outperforming northern Europe. Obviously Russia remains weak. Eastern Europe is not as strong as we like to see. But overall I think as I said earlier on the call that the -- this 14 million builds rate that they are at can grow significantly other people in Europe U.S. there's no reason why it can't find to a substantially higher number and they have historically been in a higher number if you go back to the 2006 and 2007 timeframe. 
Vince Morales: Just one other point on refinish related back to the China discussion we just had, we saw very nice growth and to upper digits we finish in Asia primarily China. And that goes back to the dynamic of the car park the relatively low per capita that Michael referred to and that both very well for the future growth of refinish in China as that car park continues to grow so we’re seeing nice uptick there despite some of the slight softness we saw over in the European market 
Ghansham Panjabi: As a follow-up on the protective coating I know it's a week across the board particularly in Asia but you called point improvement in North America can you expand on that 
Michael McGarry: Sure. The volume improvement is in the protective area and what's interesting is that we've seen in moderation in the decline. Now in oil and gas. We haven't seen any significant pickup but I think they've done significant amount of capital project cutting and so I think over the next couple of quarters. Turn. So, on the protective side quite good. We're also seeing people doing the dry docking -- they are going to try to make the ships last little longer so dry docking is up. 
Vince Morales: If I could add, we had based on our estimates above market growth in the U.S. and Canada and protective. This is a business two years ago we started to talking about trying to build additional growth actions on and I think you're seeing today some of those benefits from those growth actions. 
Operator: The next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Arun Viswanathan: Just had a question, I guess, on volume growth. You know, you did 1.5%, 1.6% here in Q3 on a relatively easy comp minus 0.7% last year. You're coming up on a tougher comp, here in Q4 so what's your expectation on volume growth in Q4? 
Michael McGarry: Well, Arun I think the volume growth continues to remain muted. We're not seeing any changes in the environment out there. As I mentioned on my remarks in the beginning, we've already seen most of our October order book. Fourth quarter is typically a seasonally weak quarter. So, I would tell you it's just going to be more of the same that we saw the third quarter and earlier this year. 
Arun Viswanathan: And looking into 2017 I remember last year at this point you push volume growth up to the low to mid single digits for 2016. Is there any possibility that we could get there in 2017? Despite the market -- or will it still be dependent on your individual end markets? 
Frank Sklarsky: Well, we try to grow GDP or GDP plus. We haven't done that this year which is disappointing to us. But as we look at next year we're going to need good performance execution was internally. We also need a little bit of growth uptick in the different verticals we play in. So, I think we're still operationally striving to get to what you are talking about. I will have to see how the environment plays out. 
Arun Viswanathan: Just a last quick follow-up, the OEM performance in the Americas was slightly characterized as below-market, what would you say led to that and is that unusual? Or do you see a change in that going forward? 
Michael McGarry: No Arun, I think we covered this in the prior two conference calls. At that time, if you go into 2016 we had opportunities to try to take business in certain parts of the world versus others. We preferentially wanted to gain share in Asia and obviously we gained share any significantly higher rate than the rest of the industry for the 2013 , 2014, 2015 and so the customers were getting uncomfortable so we preferentially gave up share in the U.S. where we saw that growth rate slowing and continued to grow in Asia. And so overall despite the decline in U.S. we're performing at market and then we expect to be outperforming the market starting first quarter of next year.
Operator: The next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jeff Zekauskas: When I look at your industrial business, your revenues were basically flat from the second through the third quarter. But your operating profits were down 43 million. And your margin contracted about 300 basis points. What, exactly, is going on there? Is it lower prices? Is it mix? This degree of margin change doesn't seem to be accounted for by volume.
Vince Morales: Jeff, if you go sequentially from 2Q to 2Q we have a dramatically different business mix by industrial segment such as automotive of versus general industrial. As you know a lot of auto companies take outages -- in July or August whether it is U.S. or Europe as opposed to Q2 where they are running a peak production. So, the business mix differs tremendously and we see a similar margin, erosion, each year sequentially 2Q to 3Q in that particular segment. 
Jeff Zekauskas:  I think last year the margin deterioration sequentially was about 60 basis points and that was on much lower sequential sales? Did it turn out that -- were there any management compensation changes either for the third quarter or the fourth quarter prospectively? Because you're probably not on the planet you originally were guiding toward. 
Vince Morales: Jeff, this is Vince again. We readjust our management competition each quarter based on our quarterly employee outlook. As well as stop based comp is impacted by the stock price itself. There were no significant -- in Q2 were no significant noteworthy changes on those two line items so that hopefully that answers your question if addressed it properly. 
Jeff Zekauskas: How does it benefit you in Q4, is there a meaningful change or there isn't? 
Vince Morales: Well unfortunately the stock price is down, the stock price fell along with our preannouncement. So that will affect stock-based compensation. We'll evaluate the business as we do every year at the end of the year on the various metrics that we have for each of them. 
Operator: The next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
David Begleiter: Michael, looking at M&A and consolidation coatings, is there a potential for large scale M&A still left in the coatings industry globally? 
Michael McGarry: David, definitely. I think you saw that with the fact that sure when made their announcement earlier this year. There are still a number of fair sized acquisition opportunities out there. I don't want you to walk away thinking there's anything different, I think if you parse the global data really finally will that there's been about 20 companies added or been listed in over one have billion dollars in the past three or four years so there is continued global growth in coatings companies and of course you know the Top 10 are out there, too. So there's still more opportunity, so I would encourage you to be patient. 
David Begleiter: And just on that point, in Q4, Michael, the 650 of cash deployment -- is that likely to be more buybacks or more M&A? 
Frank Sklarsky: David, this is Frank. As we've always said the preference would be to do accretive acquisitions that any quarter where there were not necessarily acquisition closed or completed we would still be short to reach our goals for cash deployment. So, I think it's premature to say except for Q4 are committed to reach the top and our previous guidance of $2 billion, $2.5 billion dollars and at least 650 is a good number whether it is share repurchase or acquisition. 
Operator: The next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Kevin McCarthy: I was wondering if you would comment on how you see your capital expenditures trending through 2017 in light of your updated macro outlook and also recognizing the glass business removing from the portfolio. 
Frank Sklarsky: We have said that in the recent past that our capital expenditures as a percent of revenue will be in the 3%-3.5% range. With the flat glass business coming out and fiberglass coming out those we typically more capital intensive businesses I'll be on a periodic basis. At this gives us confidence that the trend going forward will be more in the circa 3% range. Looking at the macro environment that you referred to, we're being very disciplined in terms of the deployment. The actual individual projects whether they be for cost savings to growth or whatever. So, the CapEx in a careful way so we do not get ahead of the market. So you might interpret that I meaning the fact that our previous outlook in terms of percent of revenue for CapEx in 2016 -- we’re hoping to come in the low end of that percentage range. And be very efficient how we deploy that just in time basis. 
Kevin McCarthy: Second question if I may. I wanted to clarify what might be going on with regard to your corporate expense. There's a fairly large sequential drop last year when that happened I think variable comp was part of that. I'm wondering if you can elaborate on what happened in the quarter you just reported and but the outlook might be for Q3 
Frank Sklarsky: That's probably a little more normalized this quarter than it was last year in Q3. You were right in saying it was unusually low last year and some of that was driven by the share price last year. We do the measurement on the stock-based compensation including the share price at the end of the quarter. So, we had an uptick in that stock-based compensation expense Q3 versus Q3 and of course we look out to Q4 that will depend upon how that particular factor plays out. The remainder of the corporate expense bucket forward would be one area along with other areas of cost looked at that will be assessing as we go forward in terms of our rationalization programs, but the goal is to structurally be as efficient as we possibly can and then the stock-based compensation and another performance based compensation will be based upon the share price as well as our financial results. 
Operator: The next question comes from Don Carson with SIG. Please go ahead.
Don Carson: A question on architectural coatings both your performance in the overall market, Q3 you had some easy comes. I'm wondering if you look at volumes that went out the door talents to customers was that actually up year over year or what impact of this inventory destocking by customer have on a year-over-year comparison. And then in your outlook you talk about architectural coatings in the U.S. and Canada. The in use demand remains modest. Coming into the year you thought there would be a demand step back because of top whether comments last year. I wonder where your latest assessment of the overall U.S. architectural market is. 
Michael McGarry: Let's just start with the assumption, we all here we've been saying that it would in the 2% to 4% range. So, I think our assessment been relatively accurate. And so this past quarter over while we were up low single digits and that was over, obviously the quarter year weaker than expected. Price was certainly the home centers did very well from that standpoint. So we had all of our retail partners had a good quarter. From that standpoint as far as paint sales were. Our trade business was up also. So, our Company owned stores to better. So we think we're closing the gap in that regard and we're seeing a modest improvement in Canada as well. So, I would tell you that the industry has been about where we expected in the 2% to 4% range and we expect to see next you're in a similar type fashion. 
Operator: The next question comes from Ivan Marcuse with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Ivan Marcuse: Real quick and the refinished if you comment as I apologize but in Europe it contracted a little bit and tend to be pretty historically, pretty consistent business was there any sort of pre-buying that maybe benefited the second quarter and [indiscernible] third quarter or is there something else going on there? 
Michael McGarry: For refinish in Europe the only thing that we really notice was that the insurance companies in the UK have been getting tighter and tighter on claim management, other than that I would say that there's nothing significant. Certainly, our waterborne product continue to take share over there and we did have a nice win that we will be talking about I'm sure in the first quarter call when it starts to add to the bottom line.
Ivan Marcuse: In terms of cash flow, a couple par question I guess what was your cash flow from operations for the first nine months? And when you look out in 2017 what do you expect your environmental, how much lower do you expect your environmental spending and pension spending outflow when you look out to 2017? 
Vince Morales: I will take the cash flow question and Frank is going to address the other two. We're going to put out our 10-Q in the next few days. The cash flow is a little bit murky simply because we have a significant amount of interrelated specials. We had some asbestos payments that are reflected as liability reductions. So, the numbers -- you only see the pieces which will be very well articulated in the Q. We're up about on an apple to apple basis excluding some of the specials we're up just below 10% year-over-year on a cash flow basis but you'll need to see the specials to fully understand that. 
Frank Sklarsky: The environmental spending, we're planning to spend about half this year always been a total environmental cash versus last year. Last year spent about $100 million and it will be about how that this year. Obviously the environmental spending and has some level of profitability any additional work that we find been an ongoing journey for a few decades generally we think that the run rate of Cass spending this year is more representative of what we see going forward and hopefully over time it will continue to modestly diminished.  And in terms of pension spending, we did say that we would have about $175 million of top up of some of the plans that resulted from annuitization that we did on both the U.S. and Canadian side. We put about 50 million of that into the plans in Q3, we have got another 125 million to do between Q4 and 2017 so that will occur over to that period of time, aside from that there is some very modest I will say high single low double digit millions of dollars that we put toward the international plans on an annual basis. 
Ivan Marcuse: Okay. And then last question in terms of -- and thanks for detailed working capital with raw materials I guess probably turning higher for [indiscernible] going into 2017, are you still going to be able to continue to work this 100 basis point type of improvement goal? 
Frank Sklarsky: I would say that working capital has been a real bright spot particularly in the elements of capital -- receivables and payables and inventory has approved and in fact we took mid-single digits in Q3 and we need to continue to make progress because we still think there's a gap our peers in that respect. That will come from a combination process and also complexity reduction and we do continue to think that there will be additional 100 basis points or so on an annual basis of improvement working capital but we've been pleased with the progress so far but more work to do.
Operator: The next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: This is [indiscernible] for Laurence. You guys mentioned before sometimes takes a year to get the synergistic gains because of lower margins of the bolt-ons that you guys are doing, I was just wondering in light of like what M&A activity, increased M&A activity and the higher valuations that we're seeing if that's getting harder and harder to do and if it's taking longer now as we -- looking to take more as we look forward.
Michael McGarry: There's been no change. We're very experienced in acquisitions -- done more than the past 10 years. We have a very dynamic playbook that we consistently apply we expect anybody that we belied our below system averaged to get them up to our system average and a relatively simple. Time. We could the raw materials quickly -- we move on to the best practices and we do the office we bring in a product so, we expect to be there. We're not at all concerned. We just did MetoKote and was always picked $1 million of those synergies in the first 90 days so we're going to be okay in that area. 
Unidentified Analyst: Then, you also indicated on another question there are a lot of -- still large number of acquisitions out there in a few hundred million dollars range. I wonder if expectations again are too high just given some of the larger purchases we've seen and what people are expecting going forward so that while the are there it's just not even, it's a non-starter in terms of what people are expecting at that level. 
Michael McGarry: Well I think it's a fair question and I would tell you that everybody starts with their own idea about what a fair price is. I would tell you that we're not paying 15 times. We're going to remain disciplined. But, I don't expect the current elevation of a couple of specific unique transactions drive the entire market. So, we didn't pay anywhere near that for MetoKote and we have others that we're working on right now that aren't in that stratosphere. Certainly, we're going to have to react to the marketplace. I don't know whether some of our competitors are thinking that the euro rate interest environment is good to be here forever. But, we certainly recognize that there are different expectations when you do an acquisition. 
Frank Sklarsky: And just following up very quickly on Michael's comment around discipline, that’s a very important point at the end of the day we benchmark against the return that we get by returning cash to shareholders and given at a risk adjusted basis, if we can have an acquisition that returns in excess of weighted average cost to capital that's really the benchmark. Not necessarily comparing it to any other reason deals. That includes any synergies that we can get either on the revenue or cost side. 
Operator: The next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.
Dmitry Silversteyn: Just a quick question. Looking at the margins of both performance and industrial coatings businesses, they were down year-over-year I think for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2014. Can you talk about -- you talk about the raw materials are still being a benefit I understand you didn't get the incremental margin on the volumes growth the you are expecting. But, still trying to understand why the margins come down on a year-over-year basis. 
Vince Morales: You look at the performance coatings business we did have additional growth related spending that crimped our margins this quarter. In that particular segment. Certainly the margin growth was contracting as you noted due to the benefit around materials. $15 million of additional growth related spending wasn't trash was impactful in that particular segment.  If you look to the industrial segment as Michael alluded to earlier we did see -- we're working with our customers in that segment on our selling prices to them. And that's the one factor I would point to in that particular segment. In both these segments there are always puts and takes outside of those particular items but those will be the two key items.
Dmitry Silversteyn: Question on the general industrial business which was very strong in this quarter I think you were up about 6% including the specialty materials. I question is, was it was the specialty materials left over from optics for your industrial is in terms of things did see the road and if it's the latter markets the geographies where you this much better than the market? 
Vince Morales: Actually, Dmitry especially coatings materials was actually the weakest before that were in there. Automotive had a very good quarter as we talked about and the industrial very good quarter. When you look at our automotive parts and accessories was up high single digits, our coil business was up high single digits, wood was up, transportation coatings were up, heavy duty equipment was up for the first time in a long time. I'd have to guess but at least two years.  So or packaging business continued year-over-year growth. We’re in the beginning of a secular growth rate for this -- so they were up high single digits. The move to BPA and A&I so really when you look at especially coatings materials had a -- they were the weakest of the four. So, it was everybody contributing though. 
Dmitry Silversteyn: The heavy duty equipment is particularly noteworthy as you point out -- it's been a while since we've saw stream in the business and the certainly nothing from the caterpillars and other equipment suppliers of the world that would lead us to believe that this is a recovery market. So, was this a share gain? Was this a one-time test was behind this? Can we look forward to this growth or at least none decline in this troubled industry continuing for you? 
Michael McGarry: Yes, it was definitely share growth in the industry. We worked hard to increase our share in that area. The customers are very comfortable with our ability to deliver more productivity in their shops, that's what they're looking for and we been able to deliver that productivity through value-added products and that's what's driving us. The industry itself, as you know, continues to be quite weak but we're very pleased with our team's performance. 
Operator: The next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Matt in for Vincent. I was hoping that you could clarify the progress on your current and ongoing cost programs as well as the Comex cost synergy targets. 
Vince Morales: The Comex cost synergy targets we’ve completed fully by the end of last year, actually. We do have some sales synergy targets for Comex that were primarily related to PPG products going into Mexico as well as the Central America. Those are on track, they are slightly above track. The other restructuring program that we announced last year again diminishing benefits as we approach the fourth quarter so very modest benefits in the fourth quarter and will be fully captured at that point. 
Operator: The next question comes from Nils Wallin with CLSA. Please go ahead. 
Nils Wallin: When you talk about the M&A pipeline a lot of opportunities in there, could you help us understand that a little bit better? Is that because there are more -- there are fewer folks competing with you? There are more assets coming to market? Or in general companies that you've been looking at over the last couple of years are getting close to the finish line? 
Michael McGarry: No, I think Nils, the way I would think about it is there are several properties out there that are coming to the market because they see the prices that are out there and so that makes more people think about whether or not the time to get out of some of their investments. I would also tell you that we have historically worked with a number of these family owned companies for many, many years and it takes a long time on the sometimes, to build that relationship to get into the point where they feel comfortable ready to pull the trigger whether it's generational change or whether it's been a dynamic where they are looking at reducing the focus on the coatings business or whatever the dynamic might be. So, we're going to continue to work with our potential acquisitions whether it is a family-owned Company or some of these private activity owned ones. So, I think the pipe line looks solid. 
Nils Wallin: And just on Europe, you've long said that you get some volume growth in Europe, you get very, very attractive incremental margins. When you have this sort of flat volume growth environment does that mean you have zero incremental margins or there might actually be detrimental? 
Michael McGarry: In general, Nils, what you said is correct. No growth it doesn't matter what your margins are if you are not growing but we do have some business mix differences in Europe so we could have pluses or minuses just around business mix but generally what you said is accurate. 
Frank Sklarsky: Just to follow up quickly you have detrimental margins at the profit contribution line but that's another reason why we're looking at our total cost structure so we can minimize any downside if the volume becomes muted in the near future and the team over there has done a very good job thus far but there are some additional opportunities we're going to be looking at in conjunction with this next set of initiatives we're talking about. 
Operator: The next question comes from Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.
Mike Harrison: Michael, you mentioned that your larger customers tend to get some of the more attractive pricing and the smaller customers would get better pricing from your standpoint. I was wondering if your comment on heavy equipment manufacturers being stronger in the quarter, could that be another component of negative mix affecting the margin performance of the industrial coatings segment? 
Michael McGarry: I would say that the very, very small factor. When you think about heavy duty equipment has reduced its size and scope overall of our industrial coatings because of their decline, so it has no real material impact. 
Mike Harrison: And then just looking at the decline of the Mexican peso and the impact on the Comex business, are all of the cost that you incur in that business peso denominated or are you seeing some transactional impact because you are paying dollars for some of your raw materials or other costs? 
Frank Sklarsky: Most of the costs are peso denominated there is some transaction exposure from price and materials outside of Mexico but we do have the ability to hedge a portion of that. We don't get a detail as to how much we do but the limited transactional exposure there is, we do have the ability to mitigate that plus there is also pricing opportunity when you see these kinds of movements on currency. So that's another mitigating factor which is the reason that this continues to perform very, very well on both topline and bottom line. 
Michael McGarry: Mike, let me add to that. From the Comex perspective they continue to outpace our original target which is two times the GDP. We've opened up 67 new stores in the quarter. We're at 168 new stores through the first three months so we're going to exceed our target. So we're getting close to 4200 stores in Mexico. So we're going to have probably 190 stores. We also opened up new stores which were not counting in low, so we have a store in-store concept down there as well. So overall even with the challenges to the peso, the PPG Comex team has been doing a phenomenal job. 
Operator: The next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: This is [indiscernible] on for Duffy. Just one quick one following up on the restructuring actions you guys talked about today. Is it too early to try to think about the size of the potential program there? I mean as we start thinking about our 2017 forecast, should we bake in kind of more than negligible amount of restructuring benefit or how should we think about that? 
Michael McGarry: We don't want to go into the specifics right now and the exact amount because we're still assessing all of the potential actions we're looking at, what we can say is it's going to be broad-based and significant and we will address all elements of the cost structure and when we have the things nailed down as part of our planning process we'll update the market at appropriate time. 
Vince Morales: As we have said in the past generally you take a couple of quarters to phase it in and then you start to get more benefits at the back half.
Unidentified Analyst: And if I could squeeze one more in on packaging, could you talk about the technology you guys have their and the transition to non-BPA coating and just kind of what inning we’re are in that phase? 
Michael McGarry: I think we're in inning three. So, BPA non-intent coatings really started in France. They have factored their way over to U.S. and some of the food applications. Now California, in fact their [indiscernible] and the way they are going to force to people talk about it kicked in actually October 18. So, that will be more pressure in the marketplace to shift to the BPA [indiscernible] coatings and of course once that starts to happen I always use tunafish as an example -- you pack cans in Thailand, those cans show up in Europe, they show up in the U.S. and they are not going to run into two and three different formulations for some of those tunafish. So you are going to certain markets following later just because of where they export to. So we are in the early innings and we’re really pleased with the acceptance of our new technology.
Vince Morales: If I could add, this is one of the businesses again we’re stacking year-on-year growth rates at very high levels, so we were up mid-single digits this quarter that’s on a very good comp last year so that stacking effect is very helpful for us.
Operator: We have time for just one more question and that will come from Jim Sheehan with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.
Jim Sheehan: Michael, of your nine core raw material about how many are rising? How many are still falling at this point?
Michael McGarry: Well, we only have one that's falling and seven are flat, and I talked about TiO2 being up. So it's right now, it's relatively benign environment going into the fourth quarter and we have to see -- have to wait to see how it looks with the first quarter but that’s how we stack them up. 
Vince Morales: We do think a, Jim, we do have a benign global economy here so the push for raw material inflation shouldn’t -- there's not a demand supported push for that. 
Jim Sheehan: Can you tell us what is your base of earnings per share from continuing operations in the fourth quarter last year adjusted for the European fiber glass business?
Michael McGarry: Jim, we put out a 8K in mid-September that provided by quarter the last several years of our EPS from continuing excluding flat glass in mid-September. I think for the fourth quarter that was $1.16 ,that European fiberglass business will remain and continuing, it wasn’t a sale of entire business so based on GAAP guidance it remains and continuing. 
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Scott Minder for any closing remarks.
Scott Minder : Once again I would like to thank everyone for their time and interest in PPG. If you have any further questions, please contact investor relations. This concludes our third quarter earnings call.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon and welcome to the PPG Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Andrea and I will be your conference specialist today. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Scott Minder, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Scott Minder: Good afternoon. This is Scott Minder, Director of Investor Relations. We appreciate your interest in PPG Industries and welcome you to this teleconference to review PPG's second quarter 2016 financial results. Joining me on the call from PPG are Michael McGarry, President and Chief Executive Officer; Frank Sklarsky, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Vince Morales, Vice President of Finance. Our comments relate to the financial information released on Thursday, July 21, 2016. I will remind everyone that we posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on the Investor Center of our website, ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide additional support to the opening comments Michael will make momentarily. Following Michael's perspective on the Company results for the quarter, we will move to a Q&A session. Both the prepared commentary and the discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the Company's current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The Company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The Company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on our website reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC. Now let me introduce PPG President and CEO, Michael McGarry.
Michael McGarry: Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to thank you for your continued interest in PPG. Today, we reported our second quarter 2016 financial results. We achieved first [ph] quarter net sales of $4.1 billion and achieved adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.85. Overall, we continue to deliver strong financial results as evidenced by 11% growth in our adjusted earnings per diluted share versus the prior year. This marks our 14th consecutive quarter of double-digit percentage increases in adjusted earnings per diluted share. This level of sustained financial growth despite uneven global economic conditions demonstrates PPG's ability to consistently and successfully commercialize new and innovative products as recently discussed during our Innovation Deep Dive event, acquire and integrate new businesses, maintain strict discipline of cost structure and successfully deploy cash to continually create shareholder value. Our adjusted earnings per share growth in the second quarter benefited from earnings leverage on solid regional buying growth in Europe and Asia. In addition, we benefited from acquisition-related income driven by the IVC Industrial Coatings and Le Joint François now called Sealants Europe and Cuming Microwave acquisitions completed in 2015 and lower total costs including increasing our cost structure improvement from business restructuring related to the program we announced in the second quarter of 2015. Also we continue to execute on our strategic initiatives. These include the sale of flat glass business that we announced today, the sale of our European fiber class business that was announced during the second quarter, the completion of the sale of our minority interest in Pittsburgh Glass Works and the acquisition of MetoKote Corporation, a global leader in coating services with locations on three continents and over $200 million in annual revenues. The MetoKote acquisition closed July 1 and we expect the business divestitures to be completed by year-end. In addition to these portfolio enhancements, we continue to work on other important actions. During the quarter, we fully funded our Pittsburgh Corning Asbestos Trust obligations including the prepayment of all future obligations for about $270 million at 5.5% discount rate. This payment finalizes our long-term settlement efforts and concludes our involvement with all Pittsburgh Corning related asbestos litigation. Also we announced the annuitization of a sizeable portion of our US pension obligation allowing us to reduce volatility of future earnings and mitigate financial risk associated with these pension plans. We continue to have excellent financial flexibility with cash and short-term investments of $1.7 billion at the end of the quarter. As part of a multi-year goal to reduce working capital, we improved our operating working capital levels by 180 basis points in the second quarter on top of prior-year improvements. Operating working capital results improved year-over-year in all three business segments. In 2015 and 2016 combined, we have deployed $1.6 billion for acquisitions and share repurchases including the recent purchase of MetoKote. The Company did not repurchase shares in the second quarter as we fully funded our portion of the Asbestos Trust. We plan to accelerate our pace of cash deployment in the second half of 2016 targeting the upper end of the previously announced cash deployment range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion for the years 2015 and 2016 combined. Now I will discuss some specific business trends for the second quarter. Second quarter sales increased by more than 1% in local currency versus prior year. Reported net sales were down less than 1%, acquisition-related sales were up more than 1% year over year. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted the second quarter reducing sales by $95 million or more than 2%, including a 15% decrease in the Mexican peso versus the US dollar as well as the declines in the Chinese yuan, Canadian dollar, British pound and others. In the second quarter, the euro reversed a multi-quarter trend of year-over-year weakness versus the US dollar improving by almost 2%. As a result, the currency movement, our 2016 year-to-date negative impact from foreign currency is approximately $235 million on sales and about $30 million on pre-tax income. Based on the current exchange rates, we expect full-year 2016 unfavorable foreign currency translation to lower net sales by $320 million to $350 million and pretax income by $50 million to $60 million. In aggregate, our sales volumes were consistent with prior year reflecting the modest growth rate at many major economies worldwide. Volume has expanded in Europe for the sixth consecutive quarter reflecting a continued broad-based recovery by country and end-use market. Sales volume accelerated in the Asia Pacific sequentially versus the first quarter of 2016 with continued growth in China and India, partially offset by weakness in Korea primarily due to a slowdown in marine newbuild activity. Sales volumes declined in US and Canada but were mixed by end-use markets. While our overall volumes were flat, we grew at or above market rates at many of our regional businesses around the world. We've included in our prepared materials for this quarterly call a heat map that provides our volume performance versus estimated industry growth rates for each of our business by region. Illustrated in the heat map, our investments in technology and global expansion are paying dividend given out above market performance in various coatings end-use market. We have and will continue to put significant efforts into driving additional organic growth in the areas where we are performing at or below markets. Near term we anticipate an acceleration of our volume growth in the third quarter reflecting various actions and growth investments of past year or so that will begin providing tangible benefits. By segment, for the second quarter, industrial coatings led our volume results increasing by 3% year-over-year led by above market gains in general industrial and packaging coatings. General industrial coatings volumes benefited from above market growth in Europe and Asia. Packaging coatings continues to benefit at an above market rate from industry conversions to new PPG can coating technologies around the world. This is being driven by increase in environmental regulations, including recent propositions by the State of California in growing action by global food and beverage companies to eliminate BPA, or bisphenol A, containing materials. Volumes in the automotive OEM coatings were consistent with industry growth rate with higher PPG performance in Asia and Europe, two regions where we expect higher industry growth in 2016 and 2017 as well. Volumes declined by 2% in the performance coatings segment with varied results by business. Automotive refinished coatings continue to outperform the market with mid-single digit organic sales growth led by continued conversions to PPG's market leading waterborne products and favorable industry trends including increased vehicle miles driven in the US and Canada and total fleet expansion in China. Aerospace coatings returned to volume growth following the prior two quarter where we experienced volume decline related to customer inventory management. Volumes in protective and marine coatings declined primarily due to continued and significant weakness in global marine newbuild demand along with sluggish protective coatings demand in the oil and gas sector. After improving for three consecutive quarters, volumes declined very modestly in the architectural EMEA, primarily due to unfavorable weather patterns and flooding across portions of Western Europe during the second quarter. Architectural coatings declined by more than 20% in both Brazil and China reflecting slowing end-use market conditions in those countries. Countering these declines was above market architectural coatings growth in Mexico and Australia. Sales volumes also declined in architectural US and Canada in aggregate with varied results by channel. Company-owned stores increased volumes by low single digit percentage as we begin to see initial benefits from prior investments to improve our store networks and expanded penetration into certain end-use submarkets. Volumes selling on the independent dealer network consistent with prior quarters due to overall modest but continued structural decline within the channel. Despite the volume decline, this channel continues to create shareholder value for PPG as we are able to effectively manage our cost and maintain good returns. Volumes were lower in the national retail accounts or DIY channel, this was due in part to comparison to solid volume growth in last year's second quarter coupled with current year customer initiatives to structurally lower their inventory levels. However, our product sales to the DIY end-customers also known as point-of-sale or out the door sales were higher year-over-year benefiting from sales of some of our new and recently launched products. Local currency architectural coating sales increased in Mexico at more than the expected rate of double Mexican GDP as we have further market penetration and the addition of over 100 new store locations year-to-date in 2016. Architectural volumes continue to expand rapidly in Central America, particularly in Panama and Costa Rica due to the Company's efforts to establish the presence in the region leveraging our prior year acquisitions of Comex and Consorcio Latinoamericano. Overall sales were up modestly in the glass segment as higher average selling prices offset unfavorable foreign currency translation and flat volumes. Volumes declined modestly in our black glass segment primarily due to the negative impact stemming from reduced manufacturing capability early in the quarter when our Fresno, California, facility were restarting after a planned maintenance outage in the first quarter of 2016. Underlying flat glass end-use market demand remained solid. Fiber glass volumes increased slightly in the second quarter. Looking ahead, we continue to expect varied business conditions globally due to the uneven pace of regional economic growth. We expect an acceleration of our volume growth in the third quarter as we can continue to deliver above market growth in many of our businesses. We expect this growth will be supplemented by benefits from several growth initiatives in our regional businesses. This includes our architectural US and Canada business with continued improvement in our company-owned store network following our rebranding and salesforce investments in the past year and growing demand for recently launched new products with many of our DIY customers. In addition, protective coatings volumes are expected to improve driven by continued customer adoption of leading protective products and additional acquisition-related sales synergies including higher adoption of our legacy PPG products in Latin America. Lastly, as we have said on prior calls, in the second half of 2016 we will begin to anniversary the prior-year decline in global commodity prices and anticipate general stability in this cost bucket as we approach the seasonal end of the bulk of the paint production season. I'd like to take a moment to comment on the historic Brexit vote that recently occurred in the UK. PPG has a successful and growing business in both the UK and continental Europe. While the businesses share non-customer facing resources, coatings by and large is a local business. Therefore we buy, make and sell our products within a small radius and do not anticipate any material change or impact to our production cost or fixed costs stemming from the vote and subsequent financial market impacts. It is too early to tell the long-term regional economic impact of the vote, if any, but we haven't seen any notable short-term impacts and don't expect any material impacts to our business in the second half of the year. We continue to believe that the ongoing broad-based recovery in Europe is sustainable supported by underlying modest but continued improvement to customer demand across the region. We believe that mid-term that regional growth from business investments could be marginally reduced without a clear path and timeline of the UK exit. We believe the respective leaders are fully aware of this and we will be working to minimize or avoid this impact. We also believe that if there is a slowdown in regional economic activity, it will be accompanied by reduction in regional commodity costs. Naturally, as you come to expect from PPG, we will remain proactive in preserving our level of earnings and cash generation in the region. Let me reiterate that our base case assumption has a little to no impact in the coming quarters from the Brexit vote. Now let me summarize our second quarter. Our business continue to perform well, we increased earnings by double-digit percentage for the 14th consecutive quarter. We took tangible actions to further achieve our strategic portfolio objectives and would continue to generate and deploy cash benefit our shareholders including the acquisition of MetoKote Corporation and the payment of our dividend which increased by 11% year over year. Looking ahead, we are strengthening our commitment to returning cash to shareholders via acquisitions and share repurchases. We've already successfully taken actions to aggressively manage our business for growth and earnings in an uneven global economy and expect to continue these efforts in the third quarter as we anticipate an acceleration in the level of volume growth. This concludes our prepared remarks, once again we appreciate your interest in PPG and now Andrea would you please open the line for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.
David Begleiter: Michael just on US architectural in terms of national retail accounts, is inventory reduction done and why do they wait until now to do this, wasn’t it something they should have been doing overall over longer period of time?
Michael McGarry: So David, first of all I would say the vast majority was done by one national major retailer who put in a new system. The new system has different settings, they are trying to drive down their inventory, they’re trying to take an additional 30 days out, is what they’ve told us as a goal. So, we think it's done but obviously we’re not in control of that. So our anticipation is that we’re more focus on the POS and the point-of-sales going out of the door right now are positive, so in that aspect I'm pleased with what I'm seeing.
David Begleiter: Understood and just last thing on the cash deployment in the back half of the year. I guess up to $900 million, talk about how the M&A pipeline is and how might the balance be between M&A and buyback of that $900 million?
Michael McGarry: Sure David, our pipeline remains solid. We are always going to look at everything in our space, but we’re going to remain disciplined that's the key, you expect that at PPG. Our preference continues to be acquisitions over share buybacks and we are going to continue to look and right now I think our pipeline is consistent with what we've seen in prior years.
Operator: Our next call comes from Christopher Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Go ahead.
Christopher Parkinson: Can you comment a little on your initiatives across the DIY channel specifically new price points as well as with the rebranding and reformulation efforts? I imagine it will take some time to close the performance gap, but anything on a preliminary basis would be appreciated. And also you seem a little more constructive on 3Q is that mostly comp related or is there a consideration for any of these initiatives gaining a little momentum on a sequential basis? Thank you.
Michael McGarry: Well let's start with the 3Q question, we are constructive for both, we see momentum plus we are going to be coming off of a slightly easier comp, so both of those are positives. When you look at the DIY space, if you've been in a Home Depot store they have recently launched two new Glidden products, Glidden Diamond and Glidden Essentials, both of those products are performing quite well. In Walmart they also have a Glidden Complete that’s going. And then if you look at Menards, we have a super-premium price point, Paramount and that has been performing as well. So I think as these new products get deeper footholds in the minds of our DIY customers, we expect that to continue to be a positive for the business. So, in overall I would tell you that we are coming off of a good spot in the second quarter and we’re looking forward.
Frank Sklarsky: And Chris, if I could just add one point, some of those products as Michael mentioned were just being set during the second quarter and so we are exiting the quarter with good momentum on those particular products.
Christopher Parkinson: That's helpful, thank you. And just very quickly, you mentioned you expect some uneven regional growth trends in auto OEM as we head into the back of the year. Can you just parse out a few of those trends, may be some geographical expectations particularly in the US and China please? Thank you.
Michael McGarry: I'd be happy to do that. So, what we said in the prepared remarks is that we had outperformed in Europe and outperformed in Asia. Those trends will continue, we underperformed in the US, we had preferential, obviously when you go into the bid season, if you're going to lose a piece of business and gain a piece of business, we wanted to gain it in the higher growth regions and so we underperformed in the US, we do think that's a short-term phenomenon, but that’s two quarters in a row where we've underperformed. In Latin America, we are at market in Latin America of course that's a smaller market. But overall, we outperformed in the automotive market probably for four years in a row. So this is just a short-term bump. When you look forward to the third quarter if you remember in China, last year they had some pretty significant build reductions especially in August and the government came out with a reduction in the tax on the small 1.6 liter engines. So that obviously won't happen again, China’s build rate continue to be robust, we expect them to continue to be robust. There is a lot of new automotive plants coming on in the second half of the year, we won more than our fair share on those new plants, so we actually expect some nice momentum in China.
Frank Sklarsky: The only thing I'd add to that, Christopher, it’s Frank, is that in Europe, as Michael said we are continue to seek good growth rates but we are also represented and some automakers there that are doing particularly well. So our mix of customers in Europe is also helping us. We expect to outperform there in the third quarter versus market.
Michael McGarry: And registrations in Europe were up 6%, so I mean, registrations continue to outpace builds.
Operator: Our next question is from Ghansham Panjabi from Robert W. Baird & Co. Go ahead.
Mehul Dalia: Good afternoon, this is actually Mehul Dalia sitting in for Ghansham, how are you guys doing?
Michael McGarry: Good.
Mehul Dalia: Great. Pricing overall was flat during the first half of ‘16, should we expect something similar for the remainder of the year?
Michael McGarry: This is exactly what we forecasted coming into the year and I don't think you should anticipate anything different in the second half of the year.
Mehul Dalia: In aerospace, what’s your outlook for the second half, are you still expecting growth in that business?
Michael McGarry: We are indeed, the things that are helping us in aerospace is that the adoption of our base coat clearcoat for our coatings business, so we are winning share there. Our technology in our ceilings business, we have very lightweight ceilings that are gaining share, so that's also a positive. The transparency segment is down a little bit obviously general aviation remains weak, if you think about the rotorcraft or the helicopter market for the oil and gas business remains difficult. So when you put it all together we were up in the second quarter, we expect to be up in the third quarter. F-35 build rate is coming up, so that's going to be a positive. And if you look at Boeing and Airbus, they have only delivered two more planes in the second quarter versus what they deliver last year. And they’re only up, actually they’re down, excuse me, six planes each from their build rates in the first half of the year versus last half. So they have a very full backlog, so ideally you would expect them to continue to work hard to build up their sales rate in the second half of the year. So we are actually anticipating good aerospace performance in the second half of the year.
Mehul Dalia: And one last one, with your auto finish outperformance in EMEA and Asia Pac, is this due to continued waterborne technology shift, what's driving that outperformance?
Michael McGarry: There are two reasons, one is the waterborne continuous adoption of that plus we are also picking up share in what we call the commercial transport area and light industrial coatings. So these are very smaller pieces of that refinish business but overall those markets continue to do well and our customers value the productivity that we bring to their shops when we bring in our products.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Go ahead.
Jeff Zekauskas: You are in the process of selling your glass businesses and are big pieces of it, and order of magnitude I think it will be about $0.25 a share dilutive next year that is, if you don't do anything extraordinary either in acquisitions or in share repurchase. So do you have a plan to address the dilution or do you just shoulder it?
Frank Sklarsky: Jeff, this is Frank. So in terms of the amount of the dilution, if you take the gross proceeds from the flat glass business we said, we disclosed this morning, it was 750, if you take adjustments and since that’s a US business you have a full federal and state tax rate on the gain, which is significant, the basis was not that significant that combined with adjustments. And then add that to the net proceeds of the European fiber glass business which is relatively modest double-digit net returns after taxes and adjustments. You can say the dilution is in the range of what you're talking about but you own calculation but please keep in mind that the flat glass business had a more than the glass average margins. So, when computing a potential dilution you have to take that into effect. And of course both those businesses will be in discounts for Q3. But in terms of what we do about that dilution, we have continued to demonstrate that we will take excess cash and given the back half of the year is our cash generating half, we will have proceeds from these businesses, we will continue as Michael said continue to deploy that in a manner that generates value for the shareholders. And so we have ample liquidity, we have cash on the balance sheet, we will continue to generate cash, we will get cash from these divestitures, so we are fully committed to that upper end of the previously communicated range by the end of this year.
Jeff Zekauskas: But the upper end of the previously communicated range doesn't help you with your dilution for next year that is you have to take steps over and above that if you mean to offset now?
Frank Sklarsky: And we have ample opportunity to continue to go back to our board to obtain additional authorizations for share repurchase as appropriate and they’ve been supportive in the past. We continue to have a robust acquisition pipeline as Michael pointed out, so we will continue to take the kinds of action we need to, including actions on our cost structure to make sure we eliminate stranded cost situations so that we eliminate the dilution.
Vince Morales: I agree with you, Jeff. It’s something we have a void going into next year due to the sale of these businesses. It’s not dissimilar to the void we had when we sold commodity chemicals and we feel in a constructive manner. Same void we had when we sold the Transitions Optical business and then again in the short period of time we were able to fill that. So we are aware of it and I think your numbers are reasonable and we’re working in it in a fashion to fill the void.
Jeff Zekauskas: And then just lastly, what's the timing of the tax benefits you get from paying down your asbestos liabilities? Do you get that this year or do you get it next year?
Michael McGarry: That's going to come over a few different quarters, what I would say is if you take a look at what we paid in cash taxes in 2015. So it would be about $480 million we played last year that included an amount that was applied from the previous year's tax return, we actually wrote a check for about $380 million and we had some credit supplied from the previous year, so about $480 million total cash due last year. Our cash taxes this year all in will be less than that or high double-digit amount will be less than that for all of 2016 assuming we get the closing of the flat glass sale by the end of the fourth quarter. So, in very good shape in terms of tax benefits even though we had some tax charges associated as a special item this quarter that you saw associated with moving money around and funding the asbestos liability on a net basis including all taxes paid on gains, our cash taxes will be less this year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Go ahead.
Duffy Fischer: Question on the heat map, if you go and again most of them are positive but to one of the areas that’s below market, the architectural in the US and Canada. How much of that is because of your channel skew how much of that is your actually below market in the channels if you look at it on the equal weighted basis?
Michael McGarry: Duffy, this is Michael. What I would tell you first of all is that you have, you know, our share of the dealer market, so we are probably a little overweighted in that area and that continue to be a decline. Then don't forget we bought a broken Akzo business and we are radically fixing that at a good clip. That's been a good acquisition. It's returned a lot of value. We’ve outperformed in the synergies and now our goal is to get that growth rate up to match the industry average or better. And then finally with the DIY segment and as I mentioned earlier on the call, we have worked with our channel partners to bring out some additional products in that regard. So I think we have a multipronged approach to improve in this area but clearly we’re not satisfied and this is an area of high focus for just me but the leadership team all across the Company.
Duffy Fischer: And with the structural disadvantage of being outsized in the independent channel, is it possible that you guys can grow with the market in this or is this just something structural that even if you do better you’ll still be below market?
Michael McGarry: Well, I’d say we’ll be a little bit below market just because of that. I mean, if you take some of our competitors where they might have zero in the independent dealer market they will be hard to match that.
Duffy Fischer: Fair point.
Vince Morales: And then Duffy, just let me reiterate what Michael said in his prepared remarks, we know the pace of decline in the independent dealer channel. We’re able to match that or actually exceed that with cost outs. So this remains a good return channel for us, the shareholder value creation channel, it’s going to be a long time before that channel evaporate. So we are pleased with the cash flow, it’s a low investment channel and again a channel we’re not displeased to part of.
Duffy Fischer: Fair point. And then Frank, one for you on the asbestos, is it fair to say going forward kind of Q3 on we should not see any asbestos impact in either the P&L or the cash flow statement?
Frank Sklarsky: That's correct, as it relates to Pittsburgh Corning, the specific entities that the trust addresses there will be no further impact or exposure for PPG either on the P&L or the cash side, the whole liability was discharged. There will be a reference you'll seen in the Q next week as you’ve seen in the past where there are other potential cases that could arise, we have reserves for those which we believe are adequate at the present time up, as it relates to Pittsburgh Corning no further exposure.
Operator: Our next question is from Dmitry Silversteyn from Longbow Research. Go ahead.
Dmitry Silversteyn: Good afternoon, guys and thank you for taking my question. Just to clarify, after you sell the fiber glass business in Europe and the flat glass business, what's going to be left in the glass division, just a little bit of fiber glass in the US or there are some other pieces.
Michael McGarry: It's fiber class in the US, Dmitry.
Dmitry Silversteyn: And roughly, what would be the size of that business?
Michael McGarry: We don't normally disclose that, but if you take our commentary previously, we said glass was more than the average. We said that fiber glass Europe was $150 million. So you ought to be able to come up with a relatively close answer.
Dmitry Silversteyn: Got it. Thank you. Thanks for that. Secondly, looking at your performance of your painting business in Europe, it was down a little bit after I think you put together two or three quarters of positive growth. You cited weather and some flooding, how has that changed if at all as you head into the third quarter. I understand you only have a couple of weeks in, but any particular religion, whether it’s Poland or UK or France that are doing better or worse versus what you saw in the second quarter from those considerations, sort of weather considerations?
Michael McGarry: Sure. The easiest one to look at was the UK. We had about four days right after the vote, where it seems like people were glued to their TVs instead of putting a paintbrush in their hand, but I’m pleased to say that in the first 20 days, because I have data through yesterday, our sales rate is in July better than our sales rate in June 2016, so the prior month and it’s better than July 2015 for the same 20-day period. France, I looked at France this morning and it’ on a relatively similar trend line. We’re always a little bit hesitant on France if we didn't call out the periodic strikes that they have over there because it seems like an everyday occurrence, but I would say that we should do better in the third quarter than we did in the second, and we continue to have good momentum in our other businesses in Europe. So when you take Portland and Czech and Slovak and Hungary, those are all doing fairly well.
Dmitry Silversteyn: Okay. Thanks. Staying on paint for one more question, you had a 20% decline or more than that in China and Brazil, Brazil, I sort of understand their construction industry is really, really suffering right now, but what was the decline of that magnitude in China attributed to?
Michael McGarry: Two reasons. One, obviously the slowdown in the construction market in China. Two, because of the slowdown, we’ve been very tight on credit and obviously as you tighten up credit with your customers, they look for other places to place their orders and that compounds the situation. What's interesting is that we really play in three segments over there and our premium product was up in our second quarter. So it's a smaller piece of the pie. So it really like I said, you got to be close on your customers, what they are doing, what part of the market they’re in and so the fact that we’re managing credit tightly had some impact there.
Dmitry Silversteyn: Got it. And then final question on protective and marine, marine new builds have been bad since really the 2008/2009 recession and they continued to be down year-over-year, it seems like every quarter. At some point, does it start to see like it's a bottom or whenever it seems like a bottom, it turns out not to be a bottom, sort of how would we be thinking about new builds and how long can this industry sort of underinvest if you will in new holes?
Michael McGarry: Well, Dimitri, new builds were down 40% in 2015, they’re down an additional 30% in 2016, the big three in Korea haven't taken very many orders this year. There is a lag of course between an order to a paint. So call it, 18 to 24 months, but Korea has recently rolled out a $17 billion stimulus package aimed at getting their shipping business back on its feet, it’s a big segment for Korea, employs a lot of people, names that you know, Hyundai Heavy Industries, Samsung Heavy Industries, Daewoo. So these are all people that are closely tied to the government and they can't continue to go backwards forever, but I’m not smart enough to tell you when it’s going to turn, but it is something that we are going to spend a lot of time looking at.
Vince Morales: Dmitry, it’s Vince. We’ve been able to, in most quarters, compensate for the marine decline with protective growth around the world as we roll out different products. We weren't able to match that exactly this quarter for the first quarter quite some time, but we do think in Q3, we will go back to at least matching the decline in Marine with growth in protective.
Dmitry Silversteyn: Okay. So that was actually sort of preempt to my second question on the protective side of the business, it sounded like that was scaring the water a little bit for you in that segment, and now that’s doubled in the second quarter, you talked about oil and gas being an impact here, sort of a similar question there, but perhaps a little bit nearer term and people can't continue to underinvest in oil and gas for very much longer, so are we sort of - was this a one-off or are we bottoming out there as well, how would we think about that?
Michael McGarry: Well, I think that our protective business continues to gain share. So that’s the first thing what I would say. We had a very positive growth number in protective segment and we are rolling out new technologies that are winning share, especially in our fire protective region that has been a real winner for us. So I’m anticipating that protective will continue to overcome the weakness in Marine. I view this as maybe a one-off. Obviously, time will tell. But our protective, the marine team continue to perform well and I would tell you we’re aggressively managing costs in that, so when you look at just the earnings side of that business, that's part of the reason why earnings continue to go up overall is because we’re managing that very tightly.
Operator: Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Securities. Go ahead.
Frank Mitsch: Good afternoon, gentlemen, and congratulations Michael on the pending chairmanship and Chuck if you're listening, congrats on your pending retirement. Hey, Michael, I noticed that obviously margins up again nicely over 100 bps per segment. How should we think about that in the back half of the year and on the topic of margins, can you talk about what you are seeing on the raw materials side and if you want to offer a comment or two regarding your TiO2 pricing in Q2 and expectations in Q3?
Michael McGarry: I'm sorry Frank. We have a two question limit, you’ll have to. Let's start with margins.
Frank Mitsch: That's going to cost you five strokes, Michael.
Michael McGarry: So margins were up 180 basis points. That was driven by four primary factors, maybe five if I’m generous. Volume improvement in Europe, that is significantly leveraged. So anytime we drop any volume in Europe, that comes 30 to 40% margin. The benefits of restructuring, we are going to continue to focus on that, the acquisition related synergies that continues to do well. We certainly had some modest raw material benefits and then as you know, when you look at it from a currency standpoint, the fact that the dollar is so much stronger, you actually get absolute lower COGS and lower overhead numbers. So that all contributed to the margin. Now, the pace, I think I mentioned in my opening comments, the pace of raw material deflation is slowing. When you go back and look at what oil was in the second quarter last year and the second quarter this year and you look at it third quarter versus third quarter, that is slowing, but we’re not letting our purchasing and global supply management team off the hook here, right. When I parse our raw materials, we put them in about nine buckets. So whether it’s epoxies or solvents or additives, you name it, I would say at least five of those still have downward pressure, the rest of them flat and we do have one that had some upward pressure. I don't regard that TiO2 price increase in the second quarter as a trend line, one point doesn't make a trend line. When you look at overall volumes across the globe in coatings, it is a modest number. More importantly, when you look at their input costs, their input costs or volumes are down. So when I couple their input costs and our view of what's going on the coating segment, we're still having discussions, not to mention we still have billions out there, we have favorable pricing with billions, we used three times as much billions in the first quarter than we did fourth quarter last year. We increased that again in the second quarter and we sequentially expect to increase the amount of product used by billions in the third quarter from the core plan and their performance continues to improve. So I would tell you overall, we are pretty, we are going to have to continue to fight hard for what we have, but raw material deflation is slowing but not over.
Frank Mitsch: Okay. That's helpful. And then lastly, just following up on the volume side of things, obviously, you were expressing disappointment with Q1 only having 1% volume growth, Q2 slowed down to 0% volume and obviously, you explained a lot of the reasons why, but also offered that it would reaccelerate in the back half of the year, Q3, are we looking at a 2% type of volume growth, what sort of volume growth do you have in your mind that this portfolio can generate in either Q3 or the back half of the year?
Frank Sklarsky: Well, Frank, I don't think I want to give you a number just yet. What I will tell you is that this is the primary focus. Organic growth is not easy as you know, but our focus on technology is key. Our global footprint able to ship these new technologies around the businesses, around the world is key. Leveraging Comex and bringing the Revocoat new products out, that’s helped. We put together that heat map to try to give you an idea how we are doing in this regard. We’re growing in most of our businesses, but not all of them, but we certainly expect that our efforts will bear fruit going forward, and if you talk to anybody in our leadership team, they can describe the heat map in intricate detail. Everybody is totally focused on it.
Frank Mitsch: Well, I just find the heat map extremely helpful, especially since it contained a lot more jet screen than it did, steel or yellow, but thanks for that. Much appreciated.
Operator: Our next question is from P.J. Juvekar from Citigroup. Go ahead.
P.J. Juvekar: Yeah. Hi, good afternoon. Michael, if you look at the coatings sector, the multiples of publicly traded companies have gone up over the last couple of years, I would imagine that that's also reflected in the private M&A market. So what kind of multiples are being paid and can you talk about your recent acquisition of MetoKote in that context?
Michael McGarry: Sure. If you look at our last six acquisitions, they’ve all, we have paid less than 10 times EBITDA for all of them. The only one that's been above that has actually been Comex, where we paid, if I remember, 11.2 or something in that, pre-synergy. So clearly, the most two large ones in our space that were done at a significantly higher level, I regard those as unique properties at unique times in the cycle. Everybody I talk to that I want to buy, they point to those two and I am sure they would like to have that, but it’s not realistic for the sellers to do that. And obviously when we bought MetoKote, those numbers or at least one of those numbers was in the space and we are negotiating with others right now. So I would tell you we’re going to continue to remain disciplined and we are going to do the best that we can to make sure we increase value for our shareholders.
Frank Sklarsky: P.J., the only thing I would add to that, I want to pick something that Vince said too is that there is pre-synergy and there is post-synergy multiple and as Michael said, there is a very disciplined process here, but when we evaluate each acquisition on its own merit, there is the headline price, but then there is a lot of sensitivity analysis that goes around the revenue CAGR as well as the synergies and I think one of the reasons that PPG has been kind of most successful than the average Fortune company in integrating acquisitions is the diligence around revenue and cost synergies. And if you look at the properties that we've acquired in the last few years, they've had an element of either a unique technology, unique customer base, but all have some kind of additional levers that we can get either by expanding the customer base globally or putting the technology as part of our overall portfolio. So it’s not just the initial multiple, we look at the whole resultant set of factors, including synergies and the multiple pre-and post.
P.J. Juvekar: Thank you for that. And just I want to go back to the volume question, in one of your charts, you show volumes over the last two years, and it's kind of slowed down over the two years, is now close to 0. So given that, what pieces do you need to fall in place to continue double-digit EPS growth?
Vince Morales: So P.J., first of all, as Michael mentioned, we've got to get the organic volumes up, which we intend to do to. So in Q3, that, we have a lot of laden capacity as we've talked about in terms of the ability to leverage our cost structure, I think, Frank has given you the number in the past of 30% to 40% in Europe, 20% to 25% incremental margins elsewhere in the world. We continue to work on self-help activities. That's been a hallmark of ours and we have more coming in the back half of the year based on our previous restructuring and as we talked several times on the call today, we’re going to redeploy or deploy cash and then accelerate our deployment of cash in the back half of the year. So those are the three pillars that I would tell you you're going to rely on to maintain good growth in our EPS.
Operator: Our next question is from Jim Sheehan from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Go ahead.
Jim Sheehan: On the glass segment, could you talk about approximately what are the stranded costs associated with the few divestitures and how do you plan to address those and also with respect to the remaining fiber glass business in the US, are you in any active discussions to dispose of that as well?
Frank Sklarsky: I just think that the first section on the stranded costs. The stranded costs are relatively modest, because the business obviously separate from the coatings part of the portfolio, ran pretty much on its own. Of course, there were certain allocations that come out of the corporate group, but we've been obviously cognizant of this for some time and we have plans and we plan to execute plans so that the stranded costs do not become an overhang for the company. As Vince alluded to, as we get into 2017, it won't happen immediately because we go through the next several quarters, we have active plans we’ll be putting in place and specific initiatives to eliminate that what I’ll call it as a relatively modest stranded cost situations.
Michael McGarry: And then in regards to your question about fiber glass, we always evaluate all our businesses, and in this regard, fiber glass non-core business and should anybody come to us and make us an offer that's worth more than we think it’s worth, then we have a shareholder responsibility. We are not in any active engagement right now though.
Jim Sheehan: Thanks. And in your coatings business, your architectural coatings business in EMEA, you talked about weather impacts and flooding and strikes. I was wondering if you could just talk about what you think second quarter volume growth would have been excluding those factors?
Frank Sklarsky: Jim, if you look prior quarters, we were up 1% to 2% fairly consistently. I do have to remind folks we had in Europe last year, so second quarter 2015 extremely favorable weather and this year we had the exact opposite. So if you said, what's the base growth rate for our business there, it would be low single digits. And we expect it to return there in the back half of the year. The only thing I would say to in organic growth and Michael mentioned this before is, it’s okay, it is fair to focus on things, we’re doing the architectural portfolio because we would have liked the topline to be a little more robust in the quarter, but there was significant momentum generated in the industrial and packaging business as well as really nice momentum in refinished aerospace and automotive OEM doing well in the vast majority of the globe. So - and that momentum should continue. If you look at the heat map, there are a few selected parts of the portfolio where, whether it’s a macro issue where we get a little bit of help and obviously a little bit of help from the weather in Europe going forward as well as some activities we’ve got going out on architectural Alaska. With those turning, you have the vast majority of portfolio on a pretty good path. And that's what we have confidence for the back half of the year and into ‘17 that we’ll get improvement in the organic growth rate overall.
Operator: Our next question is from Arun Viswanathan from RBC. Go ahead.
Arun Viswanathan: Thanks, guys. I'll just make this quick, so just to ask that slightly differently, volume growth at kind of flat here. Hopefully growing in the back of the year, maybe you can just give us a range, how much of your volume growth do you think is dependent on market and how much is dependent on internal initiatives and then maybe if there is any other factors that or another bucket that you would put any other kind of volume growth then?
Michael McGarry: Let me take this by business, right. So, automotive, vast majority of that growth is coming from technology and market, right. So the market is growing between 3% and 4%, we are outperforming that so that’s all due to our new compact process. If you take our industrial business, our industrial business grew mid-single digits in the quarter. That is really a variety of - some of it is automotive and some of it is coil, our coil business had a good one, our electronic materials had a pretty good quarter. So all good from that standpoint. When you look at packaging, that’s all technology, I mean we’re just - our new technology is helping us grow, it grew high single digits, one of our regions grew low double digits. We’re just taking share in that regard. When you bring it over to architectural, there is not as much technology in the architectural and we are not getting that - the markets basically think it’s growing about 3%, 4% max and then you shift on over to protect the marine and that's a declining market with a huge overhang in the marine. We are taking share due to the technology, so that's another area. Refinished is all driven by the waterborne, so good performance there and aerospace driven by technology. So I would say in those segments where technologies are real key, it spoke the market and our ability to drive share gains through technology.
Operator: Our next question is from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Go ahead.
Vincent Andrews: Thanks. Just wanted to follow up on the big box, or the de-stocking, first, is it uniform across all of your SKUs and price points or are certain things being favored versus the other in terms of the inventory de-load. And then secondly, I believe you said it was principally one of the large big boxes and so my question would then be, does the other one already have the same software system or should we have to be concerned that one will follow the other and it will be another de-stocking coming in the future?
Michael McGarry: These are proprietary systems. So I wouldn't be able to answer the question about whether or not the other ones have a similar type plan. But it is across all SKUs, so it is a uniform initiative on that part.
Operator: Our next question is from Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs. Go ahead.
Chris Evans: Thanks for the question. This is Chris Evans on for Bob. Can we talk a little bit more about the independent dealer channel and the secular decline going on? Can you just kind of describe what your expectations are for that moving forward and what's being done specifically to offset?
Michael McGarry: I think, Chris, we’ve been consistent in saying that it’s in a slow secular decline, low single digits as the big boxes as well as the company-owned store network takes share in that regard. I do not envision that that trend line is going to change, and so the other issue you have is that for some of these independent dealers, they have no succession plans. And so sometimes as I get older, they decide to either sell out or they decide to close their doors. So it’s something that we are managing very closely, like Vince mentioned that we are able to adjust our cost structure to match this decline rate. It’s a very profitable segment for us, so we’re very happy to have these customers, but it is a drag if you will on the overall growth rate of the business.
Chris Evans: Got you. And I think you described sort of the sell-in was challenged into the big box, but how was the sell-through?
Frank Sklarsky: I think Michael said in his prepared remarks, the point of sale sales were positive for our DIY customers.
Chris Evans: Got you. Thanks. And just the last one real quick is you mentioned the AXO acquisition particularly is struggling under the market, just what about this current environment causes it to struggle or underperform specifically?
Vince Morales: Well, we bought the business. If you remember, we bought the business at a very favorable purchase price in reflection of the state of the business. We have made significant improvements, we have reversed the negative trend - growth trend, we now have a positive growth trend in our business. The positive growth trend is not at market, but it’s closing the gap slowly as Michael mentioned, we’ve got a lot of time and attention put into that and we continue to make strides and we expect to fully close that gap overtime, but the purchase we did with the synergies we've been able to capture has been very accretive to our shareholders. So optically while the growth rate is not there, it's certainly been a shareholder enhancing transaction.
Michael McGarry: And we had to rebrand all the stores, we had to take the Glidden product out of their stores, put the PPG products in. So it’s not something that transforms itself overnight. So it's not like a light switch, but it has gotten better every quarter sequentially.
Frank Sklarsky: Am I think it’s a great point Michael is just making in terms of the capital deployment that was required to get things in the shape we wanted to be in is behind us. And so the incremental profitability on the incremental investment is going to be very attractive.
Operator: Our next question is from John Roberts from UBS. Go ahead.
John Roberts: Thank you. Will the glass business, after the end of this year, after the divestment is completed, be small enough that you might discontinue the segment just moving the remaining activities into corporate?
Frank Sklarsky: Yes, John, we haven't made that decision yet, that is one of the scenarios we would certainly look at.
John Roberts: And then in the European heat map down at the bottom there, packaging actually grew less than general and industrial, packaging was stronger than other areas in other parts of the world. Why in Europe were they flipped, I would have thought general industrial would be weaker than packaging?
Frank Sklarsky: Year-over-year, that’s a comment on year-over-year, John, and we had exceptional growth last year in packaging Europe. So we’re starting to anniversary that growth. So we still have very good growth rates, but we're coming up against some harder comps. If you remember, Europe is the first region that converted to the newer technology. And some of that is actually good news and the fact that we’ve got some really good momentum in the industrial, but this is going to be and it looks very, very good in comparison, particularly as compared to last year's comps.
Operator: Our next question is from Mike Harrison of Seaport Global Securities. Go ahead.
Mike Harrison: Hi, good afternoon. Michael, it looks like you're still seeing some nice leverage on the Comex acquisition into Central America, can you just talk about how much runway you still have in both Mexico and Central America and what the acquisition pipeline looks like, the bolt-on, any additional Central American architectural business there?
Michael McGarry: So if you start with Central America, I would say we are in inning two. We’re very early, we just rolled out our own Glidden products into the PPG brand. Previously was a licensee, we started that about 15 months ago. The momentum is very significant. So we’re very pleased with that. Clearly, as we gain more momentum, we've gotten phone calls from people down there. We anticipate continuing to get phone calls. Obviously, we’re making our phone call. So, there is a potential for that. It's too early to talk about what that might shake out to be, but clearly the model that we have in Comex, the concessionaire network model plays very well into Central America, where you have entrepreneurial people that are looking to put extra TVs in their house, go out and buy a car. This model works very well down there and we are exporting the Comex model into Central America. So that’s a real positive for us. We’re bringing the PPG products into Comex. That has continued the acceleration that Comex sales, that's why we’re more than two times GDP. The Comex team continues to perform at a very high level. We've been pleased, we’ve added over 100 stores in the first half of the year, so we're adding this store every other day, basically, we anticipate having over 170 stores by the end of the year. So we continue to get more geographic diversity. If you remember when we bought it, we said that we had higher share than normal in the central part and we are underrepresented in the north and the south. We’re taking care of that and so we’re growing additional share and presence in both the North and the South. So overall, I couldn't be more pleased with our Comex team.
Mike Harrison: Thanks. And then I think I was surprised to see the general industrial strength this quarter and if you look at the heat map, green in all regions there, but yet you guided to continued mixed performance, even as you acknowledge that we should be seeing some easier comps there, so can you give us just maybe a little more color on that general industrial business and the volume growth expectations, is there any and then, I guess also, is there any chance we see some pricing increase in pockets of general industrial where demand is actually firming?
Michael McGarry: At this point in the cycle, I don't anticipate much pricing, except for the new products. So anytime, we roll out a new product, so we’ve said that we’re going to have flat pricing across PPG and that would also pertain to general industrial. The reason we are not accelerating that is, we still don't see any recovery in heavy duty equipment. Heavy duty equipment remains a large part of that portfolio. It would also, it's a little bit challenged, but I would tell you that the momentum in our industrial business is quite good, and then if you term out the industrial segment, I would say overall, all three businesses, packaging, industrial and automotive, you saw a good growth in those businesses and strong performance.
Operator: Our next question is from Nils Wallin from CLSA. Go ahead.
Nils Wallin: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. One on M&A, it seems like most of the targets you guys have acquired in the last two or three years haven't been pure play coatings companies other than obviously Comex and AXA, they’ve been sort of in the adjacent space, is there anything structural about that in terms of what's available, what people are looking for and then does that - are those businesses, the adjacent coatings and coating services business have a structurally different margin than your pure play coatings?
Michael McGarry: Well, first of all, I would bring to your attention that we did buy IVC. This is a powder and liquid coatings mostly U.S.-based, although they also had operations in Asia. So we have done others besides Comex and Consórcio Latinoamericano and in regards to your original question for the other ones, [indiscernible] has better than a company average return. I would tell you that when we bought Revocoat, it had less than the company average, but it is probably close at least 50% of the gap and we continue to work on - our customers are really excited and the fact that we have Revocoat that provides another opportunity to have more content in the paint shop in our automotive customers and they really like that. So that's been a nice win for us as well.
Nils Wallin: Great. And then just to follow up also on M&A, some of your larger competitors or folks that could be potential competitors in M&A are in geographies that certainly have a much different or lower debt cost. Are you seeing any type of incremental or increased competition from competitors when it comes to bids on M&A that might be motivated by better debt costs?
Michael McGarry: Well, I guess I would answer your question this way. There have only been two acquisitions in the past five years from a European competitor of any substance. And so I would not necessarily say anything that the current advantage interest rate environment in Europe is going to have any impact, we are going to continue to drive the consolidation in the coating space. Clearly, one of our major competitors is actively engaged and so their activity levels in acquisitions might be reduced. So I would tell you we’re going to still be the leader in driving consolidation.
Frank Sklarsky: The other thing I would add to Nils is that, while it may be true that certain competitors are domiciled in jurisdictions that have very attractive debt rates, we have access to capital worldwide as evidenced by the fact we raised EUR1.2 billion last year at an average interest rate of 1.1%. So we have amplified our power, we have got a good credit rating, we have a solid balance sheet, access to all kinds of capital worldwide. Our primary consideration is getting a good return, good long-term return for our shareholders with high quality assets and both pre-and post-synergies. So that will be our primary consideration and criteria for when we do acquisitions. We don't want to just look at it, what might be opportunistic short-term, although we will look at any asset in our space along with the close adjacencies, but it’s that longer-term value creation that we are going to remain disciplined about.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Scott Minder for any closing remarks.

Operator: Good afternoon and welcome to the PPG First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Andrew and I will be your conference specialist today. All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Scott Minder, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Scott Minder - Director-Investor Relations: Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon. This is Scott Minder, Director of Investor Relations.

Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to thank you for your continued interest in PPG. Today, we reported first quarter 2016 financial results. We achieved first quarter net sales of $3.7 billion and record adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.31. Overall, we continue to deliver strong financial results as evidenced by our adjusted earnings per diluted share growth in the quarter, which increased 11% versus the record established in the prior year. We achieved these results despite ongoing unfavorable foreign currency translation and continued uneven global economic and market conditions. Several factors contributed to the record first quarter results, including earnings leverage on our organic sales volume growth, our continued heritage of cost management, and acquisition-related sales and income. Additionally, we've continued to utilize our strong balance sheet, deliver shareholder value, including first quarter 2016 share repurchases, totaling $150 million. For the quarter, our average diluted shares outstanding, declined by 2% year-over-year. Our strong quarterly results, were aided by our own operational and strategic actions, including aggressive efforts to drive higher organic growth, despite a mixed economic environment. We continue to accelerate our work on developing and commercializing new customer-driven technologies. Basically, packaging coatings' ongoing customer adoption of our new can coating technologies, along with certain key technology adoptions in our protective coatings business. In addition, we are continuing the rollout of our enhanced customer branding initiatives. As you would expect from PPG, we continue to maintain our discipline over costs, including finalizing the remaining actions from our previously announced business restructuring program. Now, I will discuss some specific business trends for the first quarter. Our net sales in local currencies increased about 4%, while reported net sales were consistent with the prior year. Local currency net sales growth was driven by acquisition-related sales of about 3% and sales volume growth of 1%. These gains were offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of 4% or about $140 million, in the first quarter. Our first quarter sales volumes increased 1% consistent with the prior year's growth rate, reflecting a continuation of modest global economic trends, led by broadening European demand growth. Sales volumes grew in emerging regions by 1%. Continued growth in Asia Pacific, including China, was partially offset by persistent market weakness in South America. Most of our business units, experienced higher sales volumes in Asia, led by increased market demand for PPG's new technologies in our packaging and automotive refinish coatings businesses, along with growth in protective coatings. Automotive, OEM sales volumes in Asia, were tempered primarily, due to a strong prior-year comparable period, where PPG experienced above market double-digit percentage volume increases. We expect second quarter emerging regions sales volumes growth rates to improve supported by increases in most businesses in Asia and modest overall improvements in Latin America. Volumes in the U.S. and Canada region were slightly higher versus prior year and represented sequential improvements compared to the prior two quarters. Regional demand trends continue to be mixed by business in country, with ongoing demand softness in certain markets within Canada. In the region, sales volumes grew in our packaging and automotive refinish coatings business along modest growth in our architectural coatings business. Aerospace sales volumes declined primarily due to lower commercial demand and continued customer inventory management actions. Looking ahead, we anticipate further incremental improvements in regional growth rates in the second quarter, building upon the month of March which had the strongest sales volume growth within the quarter. Regionally, our highest first quarter sales volume growth rate was in Europe, Middle East and Africa, which delivered over 3% growth. We continue to experience a broadening improvement in Europe demand with our fifth consecutive quarter of improving growth rates. PPG's volume growth rates were positive across Western Europe with most countries improving year-over-year. Despite overall growth, this quarter, regional demand levels remain uneven. Improved performance in our architectural coatings EMEA business added to continued strong performance in our packaging and automotive OEM coatings business in the region, primarily due to continued customer adoption of PPG's market-leading technologies and related world-class product, service and support. Architectural growth was led by gains in the UK and Benelux countries with the year-over-year growth trends. We remain optimistic for future economic driven demand expansion in the EMEA region. Despite recent improvements, regional demand remains well below pre-recession levels and we continue to see signs of ongoing modest improvements in various economic subsector. During the past several years, we've completed significant actions to reduce our overall regional cost structure. Similar to our experience to past several quarters, we expect strong income leverage on any incremental sales volume growth. I would like to provide a quick update on foreign currency translation. As I mentioned earlier, during the quarter, unfavorable foreign currency translation, lowered sales by approximately $140 million and pre-tax income by about $50 million. This was primarily related to the Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar, but included other currencies as well such as the euro. Based on current exchange rates, we anticipate full-year unfavorable foreign currency translation to lower net sales by $200 million to $260 million and income by $30 million to $40 million. This is a decrease from the figures that we provided during our fourth quarter 2015 earnings call in January. This change reflects the strengthening of several foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar during the first quarter. Shifting to earnings, year-over-year adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 11% to a new first quarter record of $1.31 including unfavorable foreign currency translation. This marks the 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit percentage earnings for diluted share growth, and was achieved despite record performance in the first quarter of 2015. This trend has strong increases in quarterly earnings per diluted share, as a reflection on the success of our business portfolio transformation actions taken over the past several years, including the successful integration and synergy achievement at several major acquisitions. For the quarter, performance coatings segment sales declined by 1% and segment income was up more than 6%. Contributing to the results were higher acquisition-related sales and income, primarily from Le Joint Français and Cuming Microwave, strong income leverage on higher sales volumes, and benefits from business restructuring, partly offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation. Segment income included approximately $15 million of incremental growth-related spending in architectural U.S. and Canada. I am pleased to report that we are currently launching several new products within many of our domestic, national account partner store networks. These launches include new premium products at some national accounts, as well as improved product formulation and differentiated product label. Industrial Coatings segment sales were up 2%, and segment earnings increased 9%. Earnings leverage from organic sales volume growth, acquisition-related sales and income, along with disciplined cost management were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation. Acquisition-related growth was primarily from the REVOCOAT and IVC Industrial businesses acquired in 2015. These businesses are continuing to deliver strong financial results. They provide an excellent platform for future global business growth. Glass segment sales declined 2%, and earnings declined by 7% versus the prior year. Higher selling prices and cost management actions were offset by lower sales volumes, $8 million in repair-related expenses due to a planned facility outage and lower equity earnings. Despite the lower sales volumes, underlying flat glass demand remained solid. Additional segments and regional details can be found in the presentation materials. Overall, our business performed well in the first quarter as we continue to manage against a mixed global economic backdrop. We continue to focus on our efforts on improving organic growth rates through enhanced product innovation, customer branding strategies. We remain diligent over our costs and are in pace to achieve the previously announced savings from our ongoing business restructuring program. Finally, our balance sheet remained strong and we are committed to deploying between $2 billion and $2.5 billion of cash in the years 2015 and 2016 combined on acquisitions and share repurchase. In the first quarter, we repurchased $150 million of our stock bringing the total to $900 million for the two-year period to-date. Coupled with the approximately $400 million paid for acquisitions in 2015, PPG has deployed about $1.3 billion on earnings accretive actions against this target to-date. We have a strong global pipeline of acquisition candidates from various end-user markets. In addition to share repurchases and acquisitions, PPG remains committed to sustainable dividend increases as part of our capital allocation strategy. Today, our board of directors approved a dividend increase of $0.04 per share, bringing the quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share. This represents an 11% increase versus the prior quarterly dividend. Our last quarterly dividend increase was 7% in the second quarter of 2015. As you can see by our actions and continued strong financial results, we remain focused on driving additional growth, aimed at creating shareholder value. This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG. And now, Andrew, would you please open the line for questions?
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Frank Mitsch of Wells Fargo. Please, go ahead.
Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hey. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Michael, I was intrigued by your comment about March being the best volume month of the three in Q1. Can you give us an idea as to, where that was and what does that suggest for Q2 and beyond? Are we looking at PPG getting higher than a 1% of volume growth in 2016?
Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, Frank, let's start with the obvious question. We're certainly not happy with the 1% growth, but we are in the very early stages of our growth programs, so the BPA-NI for packaging coatings – sure, we'll get questions on that, but that's progressing well. The OEM compact process continues to do well, refinish, waterborne. So I'd say that's the first commentary. The second one, which is March. March, we had a nice start to the paint season. Clearly, we're anticipating that this is going to be a better paint season than we had last year. So that was a manifestation of that. Also, you had the uneven and uncertain return from the Chinese New Year, people were worried about that. So we were – and we tried to tell you that we had a good order book coming into the Chinese New Year at our last call. We did see that coming out of Chinese New Year, so we did see good growth there. And I think the other one is the broadening of the growth rate in Europe, that was a nice win there as well. So altogether, I would say that we were closer to 2% to 3% growth in March versus the 1% that we reported in the overall quarter.
Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. All right. And as I look at slide nine, in the auto forecast now, obviously we've been spoiled in expecting PPG to outpace the overall industry and in Q1, I guess partly due to a difficult comp, the company matched the overall industry other than exceeded the overall industry. But as I look at that chart, it looks like Q2 China, you are going to see a material ramp up in activity, am I reading this correctly?
Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer: I think the way I would think about this Frank is, we've always said that, we were not always going to outperform the industry at some point, we would have some reversion (17:13). If you remember last year, first quarter of 2015, we were up 9% and Asia was up much higher than that. So when I look at our automotive performance, we had two regions that outperformed, one region that underperformed and one region was at parity. So we were essentially at the 1.7% growth rate for the industry. So I would say, when I think back about the four years of consecutive outperformance, if our team took a one quarter pause, not happy but obviously in the grand scheme of things, we will continue to perform very well in the automotive business and I would expect that we're going to continue to see growth. In Europe, registrations were up 5%. So I would expect European builds to continue. Asia builds, India is really doing well. I'm not going to call the bottom in Brazil, because I don't where that is. But certainly, I think overall, we're pleased with the performance.
Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: All right, that's very helpful. Thank you.
Scott Minder - Director-Investor Relations: Thank you, Frank.
Operator: The next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi, good afternoon. It's actually Mehul Dalia sitting in for Ghansham. How are you doing?
Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good. How are you?
Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Good. Can you talk about pricing in auto OEM market globally? Are you seeing any price concessions, given a decline in raws and the bargaining power of customers in that business? And then just more broadly, how should we think about pricing for the company as a whole in 2016?
Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, let's talk about pricing in general. At the end of the day, we have consistently been able to price in this environment. Last year, we had marginally positive price in an obviously very challenging environment. We have forecasted marginally – flat to marginally up again this year. The automotive segment, it's not really a fair thing to look at it, on a piece-by-piece basis, because most of what we have is new product technologies, so it's hard to compare the new technology versus the old. So overall, we have very sophisticated automotive customers, they expect fair pricing. We have new technology, we expect to be paid appropriately for our new technology and I would say both parties are very happy with the price and value and performance of the new products in the marketplace.
Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. And then, for my next question, can you parse out growth in the various channels in North America piece during the quarter, so I guess company-owned stores, national account, independents in Canada? And how is kind of your performance compared to the market?
Scott Minder - Director-Investor Relations: Just we were having little difficulty hearing you, let me repeat the question. I think you asked if we could parse out the different volume growth by U.S. architectural channel, is that correct?
Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yes, exactly.
Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. So U.S. architectural channel. So overall, we had the low- to mid-single digits in that channel, it depends by region. So obviously the one that continues to go backwards and no surprise is that dealer, independent dealers channel, that's an area where that is a shrinking environment, you have the small owners of hardware stores and paint shops over time losing share to the big boxes and to the company-owned stores. So no change in that environment. I don't want to comment per se on how our retail customers are doing. I think it's up to them to comment on how the retail customers are doing. What I will tell you is that we had new product launches with Diamond in the Glidden brand in Home Depot. The early signs – it's just now getting into market. The early signs are very positive. We have a super premium price point. Our Paramount in Menards also off to a good start, Glidden Complete at Walmart. So I think when we look at it from our perspective and I certainly have to let our customers talk about it from their perspective, but we're pleased with what we're seeing. The company-owned stores varies by region and varies – whether it's U.S. and Canada, but clearly there is an opportunity for us to continue to deliver more growth going forward.
Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. And just one last one. Can you give us some more details on the weakness in aerospace, is it just small plains, large plains or both, and kind of what gives you confidence on an improvement in 2Q?
Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer: Sure. So when you think about the aerospace business, you have to – there are several things to think about. So one of them is, year ago, customers were having significant launch programs, and as they ramped up, the last thing they want to do is stop their line with lack of products and so they intended to over-inventory. Now they are more at a steady state rate and so there, it allows them to have more confidence in their build rate and their usage rate. So that's a short-term hurdle. You do have some underlying softness though, if you take the oil and gas market, they fly a lot of helicopters, so obviously, they're flying less helicopters in this kind of environment, so you have less aftermarket sales and you have less new helicopters builds, so that would be one. And then, generally the Asian, there is a lot of churn in the water as you can sell with one of our customers in Canada. So there is some things going on up there. So I think overall, we're on a short-term one quarter, two quarter bump in the road, but I anticipate the second half of the year for aerospace to be much better. I would point out that the acquisitions that we made, the two aerospace acquisitions we made are performing very well and their growth rate is above the growth rate of the overall business so the outlook, I would say, is solid.
Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Thank you very much.
Scott Minder - Director-Investor Relations: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Christopher Parkinson of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Perfect. Thank you very much. Can you just walk through a little more detail on what you're seeing in the Mexican market in Comex. And potentially just parse out architectural and stores versus industrial, energy, government spending and just overall just what assumptions are going into your double Mexican GDP growth assumption? Thank you.
Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer: Sure. We'll start with first quarter of last year, we were up 10%-plus in Mexico and this year, we were up – our sales were up 5% in Mexico, the GDP in Mexico is 2.2%. Our growth is being driven by several factors. The first one is the new store growth rate. Last year, we added 170 stores in Mexico, we're over 4,000 stores. We're now today as we speak, over 4,100 stores, and we will add another 170 stores there. So we've been gaining a lot of share in Mexico. The Comex team, when we bought them, had a very large concentration of their market share in what I would call, Central Mexico. They were underrepresented in Southern Mexico and underrepresented in Northern Mexico. But we have a U.S. retail partner that has stores in Mexico. So we recently introduced a store-in-store concept down there, that's allowing them to gain share as well. So from the store side, it's about service and product availability, and that's doing very well. Certainly, government spending has softened and a lot of that is related to projects. The government is trying to reduce spending, given the price of oil. But there are elections coming up, so I would tell you that we're going to wait and see how it plays out. But historically, in Mexico, when they have elections, the local politicians try to spruce things up to make things look a little bit better. And obviously, if they do that, we'd be very happy to participate as we have a very significant share in Mexico.
Vincent J. Morales - Vice President-Investor Relations and Treasurer: If I could add one time item, Chris this is Vince. One of the synergies we've earmarked when we did the acquisition was revenue synergy, that's what we added subsequent to the acquisition. And we are doing very well on our protective coating sales into Mexico, which was one of the synergies we targeted, so that is another adder to the growth rate.
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): That's very helpful. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up. You obviously already had a few shipments from Billions. Can you just give us a quick update on the agreement, ramp-up outlook, et cetera going forward, and just generally how do you feel about its prospects versus let's say maybe a year ago. Thank you.
Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I would tell you that we have tripled our purchases from Billions in Q1 versus 4Q, but we're not satisfied with the build rate, if you will. We think they can deliver more. Obviously they are successful in selling other places besides PPG. But overall, the product quality continues to get better to consistency, it's better and we are using it. We recently started to bring it into other regions besides U.S. and Central America and Latin America. So the usage broadens obviously; we started in Asia. But I would tell you, overall, we've been pleased but we've certainly challenged the Henan Billions group to continue to work harder to bring the – its production rate up to a higher level.
Vincent J. Morales - Vice President-Investor Relations and Treasurer: Their production rate has ramped significantly over the last six months. They are running very good yields and they just need to ramp-up their pace a bit more.
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): That's helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question comes from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Hey, Mike. How do you expect the recent rise in oil prices to impact PPG? And when will begin to impact PPG?
Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer: David, I would first start by saying, as you know, we always tell you that we pull raw materials six to nine months in Texas, six to nine months and pull it through. So we're still pulling through the lower prices that we saw in 3Q, 4Q. So that's, you know, if you're looking for that positive. Second thing is, you know oil bounced. If you think about where it started Q1 and where it finished Q1, it kind of bounced down, it came back a little bit. But I'd say overall, it's too early to see where that's going. I mean there is a lot of uncertainty in the markets. Obviously, we're not oil traders, but you can read the same thing if we read as far as oil. So we're not displeased with where we are and pulling through the raw materials savings (28:28).
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And, Mike, overall, do you think your margins are near peak or can they go higher with operating leverage offsetting maybe a little bit about – a little bit of cost inflation here?
Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, we're certainly not at peak. Don't forget, we still have the savings for Europe, we said for the full year. I think it was $70 million that we're going to pull through in Europe. So that's one. Two, you have significant earnings leverage. When we get volume recovery in Europe, obviously you saw the margins expansion in this quarter, that was driven by several things and leverage from Europe, restructuring savings, acquisition synergies, some modest raw material benefits. But overall, I still think, we can do better and certainly our team thinks, we can do better.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you.
Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, David.
Operator: The next question comes from Robert Koort of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Michael, how do you discern if the aerospace customers' inventory adjustments versus demand adjustments.
Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well one thing we do is we have a significant insight, because of our share with some of these customers, so we are able to – I don't want to call it vendor managed inventory, but we have significant insight into what they're stocking. The growth rate for the large, if you take Boeing and Airbus and obviously, they have big backlogs, but their build rate is flat to marginally down. And that is obviously, when you think about their inability to get production rates up, it's frustrating for us. I can't imagine, how frustrating it must be internally for them. But that's the two ways, we look at that, Bob.
Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And can you talk about variation in price across the portfolio? I assume there are puts are takes, but are there any particular areas outside of non-BPA, the BPA-NI, where there has been price improvement?
Vincent J. Morales - Vice President-Investor Relations and Treasurer: Bob, we have pluses and minuses as you noted throughout the portfolio, but there is no outliers on either side.
Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And last one very quickly, can we assume the same target level of acquisitions in 2016 that you completed last year? Thanks.
Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer: I think that's a reasonable expectation. As we've always said, it's impossible to predict large ones. We have a pipeline that looks very similar to the pipeline we had last year. We had seven deals that had about $400 million in sales. I would expect to see a similar level of activity this year. And I think, you'll have – you'll see that as we go through the year. Bob? Andrew?
Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: All set. Thank you.
Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thanks. The next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi, good afternoon.
Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Jeff.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. What are the net cash outflows from asbestos this year? And do you still think you'll settle your asbestos liabilities?
Frank S. Sklarsky - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. This is Frank, Jeff. We do expect we're going to settle up in the first half of the year, before the end of the first half of the year. And consistent with what we've said in the past and what you'll see when we file our Q or when we lay that out, we've got about $0.5 billion of cash going out initially, plus the option to payout an additional amount of cash, which represents the present value of the future obligations, discounted at 5.5%, will obviously evaluate economic conditions at that time to determine whether we take advantage of that discount that could potentially be attractive for us to do so. So the growth being something over $800 million, but then almost immediately, we will start on a quarterly basis via adjusting our estimated taxes and we'll over the ensuing few quarters achieve a benefit that will bring the net cash outflow in total for about $0.5 billion. That would assume, if you were to assume that we took advantage of the discounted annuity. So that would be the way we'd look at it. And of course we also have the donating of the PPG stock to the trust in addition to that.
Vincent J. Morales - Vice President-Investor Relations and Treasurer: And Jeff, we have that stock hedged at about $22
Frank S. Sklarsky - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: That's right.
Vincent J. Morales - Vice President-Investor Relations and Treasurer: So if you do the math, it's about 2.8 million shares, so you're looking at somewhere in $50 million range. That stock is in our share count already, it will remain in our share count going forward.
Frank S. Sklarsky - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: But that $50 million is included in the amounts that I gave you.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Great. And for my follow-up, your gross margin last year expanded a 110 basis points and this quarter, it expanded 160 basis points, even though you had no sales growth. But last year, your currency effects were negative 7% each quarter and this quarter, maybe it was a little less than negative 4%. Is there a link between the smaller currency pressure and the widening of the gross margin or are they not linked? And if they are not linked, why did your gross margin qualitatively advance versus what you were achieving last year?
Frank S. Sklarsky - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. This is a good observation. Despite the fact that we still – even though the currency headwind was a little bit lower than we expected, it was still a headwind in Q1 versus prior year. I think there is a combination of factors. One, we did get some benefit, additional benefit this year from restructuring that would not have taken place in the last year's first quarter, because the restructuring program was really just getting underway at that point in the first half of the year. So there is that piece of it. We had some manufacturing productivity. We've moved more aggressively, obviously, particularly, in Europe and are rationalizing and moving against a more shared service environment from the administrative side. Acquisitions with a nice pass-through of the margins from those acquisitions was also an uplift, as those acquisitions provided us a margin, a little bit above the corporate average. So the combination of factors, plus, admittedly as we had said before, a modest amount of raw materials savings in the first half of this year, continuing what we saw in the back half of last year, all that contributed to the 110 basis points.
Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer: 160 basis points.
Frank S. Sklarsky - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: 160 basis points year-over-year.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Right. But did the change, did the smaller currency headwind benefit your gross margin?
Frank S. Sklarsky - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I would tell you, on a relative base value, it was still a headwind. And so from an absolute standpoint, I guess, the answer would be no. And even when you go back to last year's first quarter, that the headwind wasn't materially different than it was in this year's first quarter, even though this year's first quarter was a little less than we might have expected.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, great. Thank you so much.
Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Jeff.
Operator: The next question comes from Duffy Fischer of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, good afternoon, fellows.
Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Duffy.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: The question is just around Europe. I'm seeing some recovery there. Could you kind of tease out where you're seeing that recovery? And then in architectural in Europe, are you growing with the market or faster than the market over there?
Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, let's take it by country, Duffy, just to add a little more color to it. So starting with the UK, Ireland, it is growing faster than the company average and taking share clearly. Then, you take France, growing lower than the company average but taking share, then you take Central Europe, I would say slightly below the company average maintaining share. Okay, that's kind of the architectural landscape, if you will. But then, when you get into our other businesses, we have a broadening recovery. So Southern Europe, Spain, Italy, for example, significantly accelerating growth quarter-over-quarter at all our businesses, and that's a benefit. We don't have architectural – we do have a little bit in Spain, but very little. We have a little bit in Italy, but grand scheme of things pretty small. So overall Spain, and Southern Italy and Southern Europe is doing very well, and that's a net positive for us. The offset to that of course is Russia. Although I will tell you that we're outperforming in Russia, especially in our industrial business. They've done a really good job. There they're trying to get more localization and so that has benefited us. On the Middle East, the Middle East I would say slightly better than the company average and that encompasses all our business. And I'd say, our protective business is probably one of the ones that are doing pretty well in the Middle East.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great.
Vincent J. Morales - Vice President-Investor Relations and Treasurer: Duffy, there is a slide in our presentation deck, that shows the region. It's a heat map that shows the region by country year-over-year.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, fair enough. And then just on BPA, you've been taking some nice market share there. How long should we think about that trend lasting? Is that something that's got another four quarters or five quarters, or might it have another eight quarters to ten quarters?
Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I would look at it just like I look at automotive. We had four years of automotive outperformance. This is the technology that we're leading in. There has been two plants converted in France. We have the vast majority of that business. Now with the Proposition 65 in California, there have been six plants converted in the U.S. and I would call our share at five-plus out of those six. And so you still have the whole wave with the rest of the U.S. to come. The food guys just starting to convert probably the third quarter of last year, so you still have that coming on. So I think net-net, this is a long-term structural gain. I mean, we use to have only 3% share inside the can. You would think over time, we would approach 25% or 30% share at a minimum. I'd certainly have challenged the team to be better than that, but I would tell you this is a secular change. These guys take – they don't change for 30 years and then when they do change, it happens over time and we should expect to see this ramp up over the next several years.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks, fellows.
Scott Minder - Director-Investor Relations: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Wanted to revisit the M&A conversation. And I guess my thought is that there obviously was a large transaction announced between two of your larger peers and the byproduct of that is that they are no longer competing with you for any M&A assets that there might be out there. So I'm just wondering if a dialog between yourself and those on that target list of yours is accelerating or changing in any way. And has there been any impact on the discussions from the transaction multiple that was recently put up on the board?
Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think you have to evaluate these independently. The transaction multiple that was announced in the first quarter was a unique property and came with a unique price and we certainly – if anybody tried to argue for that price for PPG to pay, that will be a very short discussion. So we'll start there. The second thing I would say is, perhaps they could be out of the market for some period of time, but you know what, they have cash that is easy to get and we're not going to assume that this is an open runway for us. We're going to look at what our competition is. We have multiple people that are competing with these properties. And so we will continue to evaluate that. But the bottom-line is we have not seen any increase in the number of people coming to us. I would tell you that overall, our mantra remains the same, that we are very disciplined buyers, and that business teams have to make a justification, and the synergies have to be there. And that's the focus anytime we look at any acquisition.
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Very clear. Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question comes from Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead.
Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Yes, thank you. Just a question on your architectural growth in the U.S. and Canada. So you talked about low- to mid-single digit growth. Do you think you're underperforming the market there? How would you characterize the overall market growth? And what kind of a sort of snapback you see this quarter and into third quarter based on the weather?
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, Don. This is Vince. Little bit of an early read to paint these and then we don't enough data points yet to determine, by channel, how we're performing versus some of the other folks and March is a little bit of a – typically a murky month. We feel that, in the – as Michael mentioned, we've had new products in some of the major home centers and we feel those products are good new products, with good new branding. The independent dealer channel is a shrinking channel. We certainly feel we're holding around there. And as Michael mentioned at the beginning, we've got to do better in our U.S. company-owned stores. And in Canada, we think we're at parity at minimum. So – but a little too early to paint these and to call it one way or the other.
Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. And then, just to follow-up on your channel strategy, you've talked about investing in branding. Is this designed more for your company-owned stores? And what kind of investments should we expect in your company-owned stores going forward? Are you looking to open a certain number every year, to sort of get that mix up above 50% of your overall architectural sales volume in U.S. and Canada?
Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. So when you think about the $15 million investment that we made, that is – was a first quarter investment, that's a non-recurring investment. We do have enhanced brand strategies that we're rolling out, but that's incorporated where we might be replacing dollar one with – or category A with category B, so there is no real step change there. We do open up, we expect to open up, we typically say 25 stores, 50 stores in the U.S. and Canada, but we will be opening up 200 stores in Mexico – 170 stores to 200 stores. We will be opening up stores in Europe as well, so that will also be in that 20 stores to 25 stores range. And so we continued to evaluate opportunities to grow this business, but I'd say overall, I'm pleased with the performance there.
Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from P.J. Juvekar of Citi. Please go ahead.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yes. Michael, I want to go back to the refinish business. What kind of growth are you seeing there? And can you break it down between price and volume? And then, are MSOs getting bigger and bigger volume discounts?
Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer: Let's start with the easy one, the MSOs, it's been relatively constant. They'd like to have bigger, but everybody, every customer we have wants a bigger discount, but it's been relatively flat. When we think about our refinish business, it's not just the U.S., it's where – when we look at China, that is especially a good market for us, so they are shifting from solvents to water, there is a big tax in China on solid-based products. So that's a positive for us. Historically, we do have positive price in our refinish business. You would expect that this year we have a positive price as well. Interestingly enough, volume in the U.S. is actually up. That has – miles driven is up 2%. Not only do you have miles driven up, but you have distracted driving up immensely. I'd see it about everyday on my way home. So that's a positive. The other thing is, when you look at what's happening with technology, our water-based product is outperforming in every region in the world. So even in Argentina, right now, our business is growing in Argentina. We're – one of our competitors vacated Brazil, we picked up a huge chuck of that business. One of our other competitors vacated Europe. We picked up the vast majority of that business. So we continue to perform in that regard. So when I think about one of the shining stars in PPG, refinish is at the top of the list.
Frank S. Sklarsky - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And P.J., just add to what Michael said. This is Frank. Remember we sold it in the past. With our strong position over in Asia, particularly in China and the move from premium to the mid-line offerings, we have an opportunity to really grow that business over the long-term, because there is production, over 20 million units, goes mostly still to that market. That car park continues to grow, whereas in the developed regions, where we also have solid positions. The car park is relatively steady, so you are depending upon miles driven, distracted driving and things like that, but China has the additional benefit of adding a lot of units to the car park and so those growth rates, over the long-term, bode well for the business overall.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thank you. And secondly, did the introduction of HGTV at Lowe's, have any impact on our sales at Lowe's? Thank you.
Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think, the way to think about that P.J. is, which price points do we compete in and so, I think the way we looked at it is, our total sales through our retail partner were up year-over-year 2015 versus 2014. And I'm not unhappy with the first quarter performance and our relationship is very strong and so, I would tell you, that is obviously a retail decision on how they split their brands and how they position them. But overall, we're happy with that relationship with Lowe's.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from John Roberts of UBS. Please go ahead.
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: Afternoon.
Scott Minder - Director-Investor Relations: Hello, John.
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: With a coming consolidation in the number of suppliers into the DIY retail channel, you think we should expect some rebalancing among customers, some churn to see share go up and down more than we have in the past, for example? And if there is a divestment, let's say, out of the Sherwin-Williams Valspar business, do you think we might end up with a new competitor in this space here that you might have to worry about?
Vincent J. Morales - Vice President-Investor Relations and Treasurer: Well, John, we don't speak for our customers, as Michael said earlier, their sourcing decisions are typically theirs. I think we've got, as exhibited by the new products we're placing into the channel, and you're talking about the share, we always have good relationship with those customers, but we're not at liberty to make sourcing decisions for them. With respect to the acquisition of Sherwin and Valspar, we're not sure what the outcome of that will be, so that's not within our jurisdiction or our decision tree, so we'll leave it to the parties to be.
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from James Sheehan of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.
James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk about your expectations per TiO2 prices? Looks like they maybe going up a little bit here in the short-term, what's your outlook for the rest of the year on TiO2?
Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer: James, TiO2, we've always said is a supply/demand-driven environment. When I think about what's going on in the overall global supply/demand environment, you have additional capacity in China, you're soon to have additional capacity in Mexico. So from that regard that's obviously more supply. Demand, if you look at Europe, European TiO2 consumption is down about 15% from its peak. So net-net, even though Europe volumes are recovering a little bit, they're still substantially down from where they were. Then, of course, you had the material weakness in Brazil, the material weakness in all of Latin – most of Latin America, Russia. And so from a supply/demand standpoint, I think – we still see it as a balanced market. And I know they are out there running around with price increases announced, but if you remember, they've had price increase announcements for several quarters out of the past two or three years and that's just because they announced doesn't mean that we're paying. So, overall, – our goal as you know, we've taken out of PPG 10% of our TiO2 consumption is down, because of substitution strategy, replacement of alternative products, and also with the bringing in Henan Billions. So I know there is a lot of noise out there, but when we talk to our suppliers, we're trying to get them focused on supply and demand, and that's where we're going to steady on that topic. I know they are looking at – they're not making any new money, but they didn't write us a check, the last time when they were at the top of the cycle.
James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. And can you also comment on demand trends that you're seeing in various end-markets in China?
Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer: Sure. So obviously automotive was up, everybody see those numbers, so good performance there. Industrial is a mixed bag; depends upon which segment, so anything to do with commodities, is down heavy duty equipment down. Packaging, we're a little disappointed, the packaging output is relatively flat. You know with the consumer-driven economy, we would have thought that would've been up a little bit more. But we are gaining share there with our BPA non-intent product. So we could be doing better. If you look at refinish, refinish what Frank explained earlier, the car park is growing, when they made the nice move to the premium market we gained. We're now, we're introducing some mid-tier products, so that should be a net positive. It hasn't happened yet. But there is COMAC, which expects to build an airplane at some point in time. They rolled it out the hanger, but they rolled it back in the hanger. So (52:36) saw it they didn't fly. So I don't know when that will start, but obviously we have a lot of content on that plane. So if it does get into production, we will be a net beneficiary of that. On the protective side, we are doing very well in protective in China. Marine, not bad but, you really have to balance out with the fact that the Korean Marine is just falling off a cliff, in fact two of the three largest Korean shipbuilders did not even get a major order in Q1. So you have to balance what you see in China with the fact that Korea, which is where the big market is, is off. So I guess that would be my kind of around the segment approach there.
Frank S. Sklarsky - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I just want to reemphasize James that, Michael talked earlier about India. We are seeing very good growth in India across all the markets, in which we participate in. It's a smaller market for us, but an important market, so it is a very good growth trend right now.
James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question comes from Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey guys, good afternoon. Yeah, I was just – maybe digging on the volume side a little bit more, the 1% volume growth that you posted across the portfolio, I know you guys weren't satisfied by that. And, maybe, can you help us understand what kind of visibility you have, maybe on a couple of the larger businesses, OEM, refinish, aero and architectural, why that would accelerate as we through the year? And are their specific projects or something else specific to you guys? Thanks.
Frank S. Sklarsky - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure, I'll take a shot at that Arun. If you look at our different businesses, we have a best visibility in both marine new-build and aerospace where we have a very long order cycle, we have fairly concrete order patterns by our customers. In the middle, you would have some industrial customers, automotive customers, where we're seeing, with confidence, will call it a month's worth of orders with fairly good confidence. And then on the other side of the equation would be architectural, including company-owned stores and independent dealers where people are walking in on a daily basis and the order pattern certainly has a cadence to it, but it's not as predictable. So there we have, let's call it a few days worth of visibility. If you aggregate all that, 50%, 60% of our business, we can see out probably several weeks if not a month or longer, and so that's what gives us our ability to forecast for you of what we think.
Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay, thanks. And then also as a follow-up. Just curious, are we still kind of expecting that overall volume growth could approach mid-single digits for the year? And I guess, where would you see the greatest amount of volume growth?
Frank S. Sklarsky - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, we definitely expect improvement as we go throughout the year. Again, I think in Q1 of this year, we had some very difficult comps in some large businesses. Michael mentioned almost 10% comp we had in automotive in Q1 year-over-year. That starts to wane as we go throughout the year. And again, we had – as Michael mentioned earlier, we had some easier weather comps in some of our businesses in the U.S. as we come up on Q2 and Q3. So our expectation certainly is to move the needle more positively than we did in Q1.
Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay, and then lastly, if I may, the FX side, I know that you had said that there was still a negative impact in Q1. Would that also wane as we go through the year? And do you expect ultimately to potentially even get a benefit if we stay where we are on the euro?
Frank S. Sklarsky - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, Arun, it's a – it should. If we stay at current rates across the board, it will definitely wane as we go through the year, so Q2 impact will still be a headwind, but a bit less than Q1, I think stay where they are and will continue to dwindle down as you go through the year. Positive and negative at some point in time, well, it depends on the mix, because for us last – the last few quarters, the biggest headwind was the euro with a little bit stronger euro than anticipated, but a little bit weaker peso for instance, because of some of the oil-based factors there as well, some weakness in the Latin America. So that mix has changed. So could one of the currencies turn positive at some point in time? Sure, but overall, if you look at the whole basket, yes, the $140 million on the top-line and $15 million you saw on the bottom-line in the first quarter, that will be a little bit less than the numbers that Michael gave for the year that $200 million and $260 million on the top-line and the $30 million to $40 million at the bottom-line dictate that at current rates things will automatically come down. We will see how that plays out (58:07) throughout the year.
Vincent J. Morales - Vice President-Investor Relations and Treasurer: And I'll remind everybody, the guidance we gave in January was close to $600 million top-line and $15 million – I'm sorry $70 million, $80 million bottom-line. So there is a significant improvement versus three months ago.
Frank S. Sklarsky - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Right.
Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Right. Okay, thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Mike Harrison of Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for sneaking me in.
Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer: How are you doing?
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Doing well. I was wondering if you could give us an update on exactly where you are with some of the display resets you're doing at Lowe's, how much of that is complete. And do you have any metrics that you can share with us in terms of the customer response, either at Lowe's or what you're seeing from the actual DIY customers that are going through?
Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I won't talk about specifically Lowe's. I'll talk about the industry in general, when you look at the home centers. The typical way they do the resets is they start in the southern and western states and then work their way north. So you think about that, we're probably less than one-third of the way through it. Typically, they're all done by the end of May. So that's kind of the cadence that we would be working on. Again, we don't want to talk for our customers, but the early indications that we saw, we were very pleased with the early turnover in the stores. But again, it's a small data set in Q1, because if you think about it, most of that started to getting set mid-March. They only had two weeks in Q1 and then you'll have – probably half of a quarter – half to two-thirds of the quarter in the second quarter.
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC: And the $15 million worth of expense was partially related to that. That spending is complete at this point, correct?
Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer: That is complete and it was a one-time spend.
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Got it. And then the last question I had is just on the auto refinish business in Latin America. I know that you had been seeing some weakness there, has that started to show any signs of improving or still pretty weak?
Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think, you have to look at it by country, right? So Mexico is still doing well in Mexico. Colombia, I would say more flat-lined. Argentina is getting better, so that was the one positive. And even though Brazil is going down, we're actually going up, because one of our competitors pulled out of Brazil. So that's been a positive from a refinish side.
Frank S. Sklarsky - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: It's still...
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC: All right.
Frank S. Sklarsky - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: ...significantly negative overall in Latin America for Q1.
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC: All right. Thanks very much.
Operator: The next question comes from Nils Wallin of CLSA. Please go ahead.
Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC: Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Michael, with the respect to the long-term outlook in the BPA non-intent your four-year, five-year cycle, curious to know how much is sort of beverage can penetration is baked into that. And where you see the bottlers and the can producers, currently in terms of their BPA usage within the can?
Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer: I would say this is inning bottom of the first, top of the second inning. So there is a lot of work to be done in this regard. You tend to have one customer on the beverage side as a leader and then most of the other guys tend to be followers. So we're out in front with the leader in that area. And you have a couple of food guys that are more aggressive, so they've moved at a faster rate than the beverage guys have. And then, I would say that the – on the beer side, it's even on a slower ramp. So there has been a lot of pack test done, there has been a lot of a taste test done, there has been a lot of work in that area, but as far as actual production, it is way, way early in the game for those guys.
Frank S. Sklarsky - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And then, Nils, just to piggyback on Michael was saying before too, keep in mind that in businesses where we've typically outperformed in the recent past, we were already starting with a solid market share position, and those businesses were already are kind at a mature level. This has two advantages – this sector, not only at its infancy in terms of adoption, we're also starting at a point in time, where as Michael said, very low share inside the can, so everything is incremental share across early points of adoption. That's what gives us the confidence that this is a multi-year trend and has a lot of legs to it for some time to come.
Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC: Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks. And then just as a follow-up. The independent network in North American architectural, obviously has been down. Do you have a sense, what, first of all, over the last couple of years, the average rate of decline has been? And do you think it's accelerating/decelerating? And where does it, sort of bottom-out, or does it just completely disappear?
Frank S. Sklarsky - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: First, Nils, let me say that this channel has been in a contraction mode for a quite some time. If you look over a longer period time, call it five years or seven years, the contraction has been more modest in the industry as expected. I'd definitely say the last couple of years, that's accelerated somewhat but it's lumpy, so there is not a linear path here. And right now, I think we are probably contracting somewhere between, let's call 1% to 2% per year, over the last couple of years, to the market.
Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC: I mean, where do you expect it to actually to bottom-out? Is it percent of the total market?
Michael H. McGarry - President and Chief Executive Officer: It's a long, long-term play. I mean, obviously as our retail partners get bigger, as the company-owned store networks get bigger, it's more challenge as these people that own these stores, as their children do not want to be in the hardware business or don't want to be in the paint store business, they tend to sell. So, over time, this is just the demographic play that will continue to play out. But you're talking about 30 years, 40 years, 50 years, this isn't something that's going to be gone in three weeks or three years.
Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC: Understood. Thanks very much.
Scott Minder - Director-Investor Relations: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC: Good afternoon. Two related questions. First, as you look at your comments around the operating leverage to the recovery in Europe and also opportunities to improve your supply chain and productivity, is there any structural reason why your conversion of sales to free cash flow shouldn't improve on a two-year to three-year kind of base growth (01:05:39)?
Frank S. Sklarsky - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I think it's very good point, Laurence. Not only will we get the operating leverage, but we're also – have a multi-year for going out and improvement in working capital and that also will help us improve the conversion, cash flow conversion. So we still have the opportunity to improve inventory levels, we're working on a complexity, which will improve days of inventory, still have some room to improve our past due receivables that will help conversion. The other factor is that we have said in the recent past that our capital spending is more in a peak level now and will decline over the next five years, that will also improve our cash conversion as a percent of net income and as a percent of depreciation. So all those factors considered actually bode well for our cash conversion percentage over the next three years to five years.
Vincent J. Morales - Vice President-Investor Relations and Treasurer: And Laurence, we're still down volume wise in Europe, let's call it mid-teens.
Frank S. Sklarsky - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Right.
Vincent J. Morales - Vice President-Investor Relations and Treasurer: So there is still a lot of recovery left and I think we'll get back all that as a region, but there is still a lot of recovery left in the region.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC: And then when you look at industrial coatings, the value proposition to the customer, the mix that you have in your – between the what you call, the protecting surfaces as opposed to decorating them or beautifying them. Do you have the right balance or is that balance going to shift over time and does that shift, if there is one, have any implication for either margins or sales growth?
Frank S. Sklarsky - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I think, Laurence, we do both. I think the coatings industry not only PPG, but we protect and beautify. So it's a dual purpose that the coating provides, so I don't think there is a mixed differential. On an automobile, it protects the surface and beautify the vehicle itself. So most of our coatings do both.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And the last question today, due to time constraints, will come from Ivan Marcuse of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Just a couple of quick questions. The first one was onto Laurence's question. What is your goal for working capital as a percentage of sales, it continues to improve. What do you think you could get to (01:07:53)?
Frank S. Sklarsky - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, it's going to vary by business. The businesses some of which are largely transactional and require very, very quick response to customers are actually going to carry something in more than high-single digits. If you run the numbers based on our inventories right now, you can say we're around 80 days of inventory, if you run it off the financial statements. We think that there was a good five to seven days – five of 10 days of inventory opportunity there. We picked up five days last year. There are still several more days hit (01:08:21) to our benchmark. We're looking at a 100 basis points a year, generally to improve working capital. Combination of payables remain a lot of progress recently, inventories, past due receivables, so. And keep in mind, that every day of inventory and payables is worth $25 million, everyday of receivables is worth $43 million. There is a lot of leverage on cash flow by improving it just a little bit.
Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. And then my last question is, you mentioned that March is your strongest month with 2% to 3% type of volume growth. Did Easter have a sort of impact on March, I know that from April to March or is that sort of a negligible type of a event for your business?
Frank S. Sklarsky - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: For most of our businesses, Ivan, our B2B businesses specifically, it has a negligible or no impact. Most of our B2B businesses run 24x7. Easter did move into Q1 this year, it was in Q2 last year. It might have had a small crimp impact on some of our B2C businesses, again not, what I would call noticeable in the numbers.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Scott Minder, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Scott Minder: Good afternoon. This is Scott Minder, Director of Investor Relations. We appreciate your interest in PPG Industries and welcome you to this teleconference to review PPG’s fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial results. Joining me on the call from PPG are Michael McGarry, President and Chief Executive Officer, Frank Sklarsky, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Vince Morales, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Our comments relates to the financial information released on Thursday, January 21, 2015. I will remind everybody that we posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on the investor center of our Web site ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide additional support to the opening comments Michael will make momentarily. Following Michael’s perspective on the Company’s results for the quarter and for the full year, a brief financial update from Frank we will move to a Q&A session. Both the prepared commentary and discussions during this call may contain forward-looking statements, reflecting the Company’s current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG’s operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The Company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The Company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available in our Web site, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG’s filings with the SEC. Now, let me introduce PPG’s President and CEO, Michael McGarry.
Michael McGarry: Thank you, Scott and good afternoon everyone. Today we reported fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial results. For the fourth quarter, our net sales were 3.7 billion and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.23. While our net sales were flat with prior year, our sales in local currencies increased about 7% with higher sales volumes year-over-year and continued benefit from acquisition-related sales. These sales increases were offset by persistent unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts. For the quarter, the unfavorable currency translation impact totaled about $250 million of sales and approximately $25 million on pretax income. Our sales volume growth in the quarter of nearly 2% represented our highest growth rate of the year. This solid volume growth stemmed from our ability to gain larger share of our customers’ wallets through their adoption of new or leading PPG technologies. In addition, we benefited from broadening improvement in European demand as our volumes in this region steadily improved in each quarter of 2015. We grew coatings volume to 1% a year from the first quarter and steadily improved to 3% in the fourth quarter. We also return to solid mid single-digit percentage growth rate in Asia, as demand in that region improved remarkably in comparison with a weaker third quarter. Volume trends in the Americas were mixed with countries, but consistent with the prior levels. We achieved organic growth in the U.S. and Mexico that was offset with lower year-over-year sales volumes in Canada and several South American countries. Our sales volume growth was broad-based across our business portfolio led by Industrial Coating segment, which grew by mid single-digit percentage. We delivered sales volume gains in all our business units within the segments, including in our general industrial business where we reversed the negative sales volume trend experienced in the second and third quarters. Also, the automotive OEM industry growth rate improved sequentially and year-over-year and our automotive OEM Coatings business continue to grow at a rate above the industry average. Brand analysis segment our Packaging Coatings business continues to benefit from industry move to new interior can coatings. Customer adoption of Innovel our new interior can coating technology remain strong, supporting our mid single-digit percentage growth in that business. In the Performance Coatings segment, automotive refinish, protective and marine coatings and architectural coatings EMEA grew sales volumes. Growth in architectural coatings in Mexico and the U.S. was offset by weaker demand in Canada, Brazil and China. Aerospace Coatings sales volume declined in relation to a strong growth in the prior year and due to year-over-year differences and certain customer order balance. This was the first decline in aerospace volumes in quite some time, and we expect the business to return to growth in 2016. Finally, Glass segment sales volumes grew slightly, principally due to higher flat glass demand, supplementing the Company’s volume growth in the quarter for acquisition-related sales gains of about 5% coming primarily from the Comex acquisition, which we completed in November 2014. For the fourth quarter we generally experience normal, seasonal sales trends in all our businesses and regions. Lastly, overall selling prices were flat which was consistent with our expectations communicated at the beginning of the year. From an earnings perspective, our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.23 improved 17% versus the prior year. We accomplished this despite the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. We delivered higher year-over-year income in each reporting segment due to our improving sales volumes and an unwavering focus on cost, supplemented by earnings accretive acquisitions. With respect to costs and addressing to achieving our acquisition-related cost synergies, we also realized initial benefits from our previously announced business restructuring. We will continue to recognize additional restructuring related savings in 2016 as we implement these actions. In addition to cash deployed on acquisitions, we also repurchased $250 million of PPG’s stock in the first quarter. This brings our full share repurchase total to $750 million or about 7 million shares. In the quarter, our average diluted shares outstanding were 2.3% lower versus the previous year’s fourth quarter. Now let me comment quickly on our full year results. On a full year basis, our sales were 15.3 billion consistent with the prior year despite 1.1 billion of negative foreign currency headwinds. Our full year sales volumes grew about 1% led by a modest but broadening growth throughout the region or throughout the year in Europe. Our adjusted earning per diluted shares was a record $5.69, up 17% versus our prior records and consistent with the adjusted EPS growth rates we achieved each quarter this year. For the quarter and full year, we’ve pleased with our strong financial performance and overall operational execution and which was a modest year from a global economic growth perspective. Over the year, we continue to execute on our strategic objectives. First and foremost was the successful integration of Comex acquisition. Now that we have lapped the acquisition’s one year anniversary, let me say that Comex performance has been excellent on virtually every measure. Specifically, the business grew organically by high single-digit percentage in the first year of acquisition. We were successful during the year in capturing our targeted cost synergies. In addition during 2015, we added revenue synergy targets and began to work toward achievement of those increased objectives. These additions include the sale of PPG legacy products through the Comex concessionary network, but incremental sale synergies in Central America. Lastly, Comex has maintained a space of opening up a new concessionary store location, about every two days. They have added almost 190 locations in total for the year and I am proud to note that we recently reached a milestone of 4,000 store locations in Mexico. While this was a great accomplishment, we had still considerable organic growth opportunities ahead of us. In addition to the Comex results, we also completed six smaller acquisitions throughout 2015 with the purchase price of over 400 million. During the year, we continued our legacy of strong cash generation with about 1.8 billion of cash generated from continuing operations. We also maintained our heritage of returning cash to our shareholders, delivering about 60% of the cash generated for the year or about 1.1 billion through dividends and share repurchases. I will remind everyone that we have paid a dividend for 116 consecutive years and have raised our annual per share dividend payout for 44 consecutive years, including a 7% per share dividend increase in April 2015, again a very strong full year performance for our Company. As we enter 2016, we anticipate global economic growth will continue, but at a varied pace and mixed by major economies. In the Asia-Pacific region, growth will most likely remain varied throughout the year, but solid on a full year basis. Some of this 2016 year-over-year variation will be due to uneven 2015 regional volume patterns. A primary driver for growth in Asia is increased consumer spending, which is beneficial to PPG as this effects the majority of our products sold in the region. With strong growth in Asia and our quarter book for the first month of 2016 looks solid. Economic expansion in North America is likely to continue at a modest pace, comparable to 2015, supported by multiple sectors. We anticipate continued improvement in construction markets in the U.S. and for Canada to stabilize a lower activity level realized in the second half of 2015. Overall, industrial activity is expected to remain modest, but positive in comparison to the lower than anticipated 2015 level. We continue to expect solid organic growth in Mexico, supplemented by revenue related acquisition synergies. One item specific to PPG in 2016 is that we will continue with our multi-year U.S. architectural coatings branding initiatives. During 2016, we will be working with our major national retail or DIY customers on various modified branding initiatives. As a reminder in 2015 we’ve rebranded our U.S. Company-owned store network to PGG Penns. Moving to South America where our business is relatively small at about 3% of total sales. Demand in that region is expected to remain erratic and subdued. In Europe, we expect the economy to build on the broadening growth rates achieved in 2015, which would be beneficial to PPG at nearly 30% of our total sales are in that region. Favorable end-use market trends are expected to continue in 2016 particularly in automotive OEM coatings and industry build growth rates in Europe and in aggregate globally are expected to be positive for the year. Given that, we have substantially reduced our cost structure in Europe. We expect incremental margins in that region to be in the 35% to 40% range. From an overall PPG perspective, we remain focused on delivering higher organic growth including continued commercialization of our innovative industry leading coatings technologies. Over the past several years, we have deployed many new or leading technologies for our end-used markets. These include our compact process technology and automotive OEM coatings, which has been widely adopted by customers as it reduces their facility, construction cost and ongoing operating cost. Our water based automotive refinished coatings, which is now the leading water based product in the industry. We’ve converted more auto body repair shops at waterborne coatings than the rest of the entire coatings industry combined. Our new Innovel interior can coatings realized growing customer adoption over the past year. This allowed us to deliver mid single-digit percentage growth, which is well above the packaging coatings industry growth rates, but more to come in 2016. And several new products in our Aerospace business and end-used market that is driven by new technologies that fit our technical strengths and capabilities, this is the primary reason why we have a leading position globally. In addition to organic growth, we will continue to be aggressive on cost and productivity initiatives. As those of you who know us and followed us over the years, this is a never-ending quest for PPG. We are always looking for better ways to improve our cost structure. Finally, our balance sheet remains strong, as we ended the year with cash and short-term investments of $1.5 billion. We intend to continue creating shareholders value through earnings accretive cash deployment. We remain on-pace with our prior commitments to deploy between $2 billion and $2.5 billion of cash in the years 2015 and 2016 combined, including the $1.15 billion we deployed in 2015. We expect coatings industry consolidation to continue in 2016. Our pipeline remains strong as we continue to vest potential acquisitions around the world. Share repurchases as well remain an integral part of our capital allocation strategy. Let me conclude by saying that 2015 was an excellent year for PPG. We delivered 17% adjusted earnings per share growth despite fit currency headwinds and uneven regional economic growth. We are looking forward to another successful year in 2016. And now, I’d like to turn it over to Frank to review a few 2016 financial assumptions.
Frank Sklarsky: Thank you, Michael and good afternoon everyone. I am going to cover several items that will assist in modeling PPG’s 2016 sales and earnings. We have included in today’s presentation materials a summary of these financial assumptions on Slide Number 12. First is the carryover impact from the six acquisitions we completed throughout 2015. As we’ve discussed in the past, these acquisitions are expected to achieve full year sales of about $400 million in 2016. We realized about $150 million of sales in 2015 for these acquisitions and expect an incremental 250 million in 2016. This incremental revenue will be classified in the acquisition category until each acquired entity reaches its respective acquisition anniversary day. After which time the energy’s performance will be include in normal operating organic results. These acquisitions will typically achieve at or below the segment average margins and may be comfortably integrated into PPG. Next, we will continue to experience the impact of foreign currency translation headwinds that is measures against the U.S. dollar. As a result, the Company expects that year-over-year currency translation will unfavorably impact sales by $550 million to $600 million and approximately two-thirds of this impact will be in the first half of the year. Pretax earnings will be impacted by about $70 million to $80 million with similar phasing for the year. These figures represent our current assumptions based on current exchange rates as of this week. Again these impacts are currency translation related given the nature of our business we typically do not incur significant transaction-related currency impacts. The next item relates to the Company’s pension and other post-retirement benefits or OPEB expenses. Following an increase in 2015, we are expecting these expenses to decrease by about $20 million to $25 million in 2016. This decrease stems from our adoption of a spilt discount rate methodology for measurement of pension cost components. Probably offset by slightly lower expecting return on assets. We expect slightly higher interest cost in 2016, including impact of our placement of long-term debt at the end of the first quarter of 2015, along with the changes in the cash balances. As a result, we expect a total of about $20 million of higher net interest expense year-over-year and we provided our quarterly net interest estimates on the presentation slide. Next, we anticipate that the Company’s 2016 tax rate on ongoing earnings from continuing operations would be in the range of 24.5% to 25.5%, the comparable rate for 2015 was 24.5%. This increase relates primarily to our regional earnings mix. Finally, as Michael mentioned the Company still anticipates cash deployment of 2 billion to 2.5 billion for the year’s 2015 and 2016 combined for acquisitions and share repurchases. Once again, a summary of these financial assumptions is contained in the presentation materials provided for today’s call. This now concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG. And now operator would you please open the line for questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instruction] The first question comes from John Roberts of UBS. Please go ahead.
John Roberts: Mike, normally M&A multiples decline when high yield debt market rates rise that private buyers kind of get back out of the market, are you seeing anything yet in your -- because you indicated you are still engaged with a number of potential acquisition targets, are you seeing any drop in evaluation multiples finally?
Michael McGarry: John I think the way I would answer that is we don’t see as much competition from the private equity side. But we haven’t seen any reduction in interest level from the strategics. So at this point in time, I think it’s a little early. Now we’d be happy if it moves that direction as you know, but right now we’d just wait and see.
John Roberts: And then just very little commentary here on raw materials, given the massive drop that we have had in the base petroleum raw materials for your suppliers?
Michael McGarry: Yes John, consistent what we have said previously. We saw modest benefits in 3Q and 4Q. We’ve not lapped those benefits yet. We have always said it takes six to nine months for us to pull through any savings. And yes before you ask, we expect our selling prices be flat for 2016 similar to 2015. So we work with our suppliers on a regular basis, we expect to be priced fairly and we have a whole purchasing team down there that knows that’s top of my mind.
Operator: The next question comes from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Bob Koort: Michael you have mentioned some rebranding though the DIY channels, is that going to be at both your major partners and what are you going to do exactly there and is there -- you mentioned that you had already rebranded the store base, is there some savings that offsets that 15 million in incremental spend?
Michael McGarry: Well, Bob as you know we started the rebranding of our stores in 2015 that was very successful. That work has been completed so there is no carryover cost if you will from, for that. We do have agreement with our retail partners to begin some newer brandings. I don’t want to get in the specifics because you have to wait until you see it on the shelves, but we also have some new wins for 2016 that will require replacing some products on the shelves. So all those costs are front loaded into Q1 prior to the paint season and so it makes sense, it’s a onetime cost we wanted to make sure you were aware of.
Bob Koort: And if I follow-up I know you’ve talked about reinvigorating organic growth of the Company following a lot of M&A work. Can you give us any updates on what you’re doing or some specifics, maybe some anecdotes of successes and what’s on the horizon?
Michael McGarry: Well I think you started to see some of this, this is work that’s been underway for quite some period of time. We have a lot of leading technologies that we were focused on, but maybe there are some additional regional opportunities for us in emerging regions, that’s one. You’ve seen the significant adoption pickup rates in our Packaging business. That’s been a good one, you have seen in our Refinish business, more water-based sales there and of course in our Automotive business you’ve seen the most recent acquisitions that we’ve done in REVOCOAT where those products are applied in the paint shop they had limited customers, a limited geographic scope and we’re going to take that out globally and get some shares there as well, so we’ve worked hard on trying to commercialize all this faster and I think that’s where the focus has been. We also had some new wins that we’ll be rolling out later in 2016 in commercial transport, so that’s all good as well. So altogether I would say probably the most recent one that you probably haven’t seen in the past that are popping up would be our Protected segment, in protected we had significant wins in dry-docking, significant wins in the LNG sector, significant wins in what we call our advantage products, tank lines and things like that. So those are ones that we’re rolling out globally as well. So I say all positive.
Operator: The next question comes from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
David Begleiter: Mike your Performance Coatings volumes fell 1% in 2015, I know you’re expecting growth this year, but what would you expect volume growth to be in Performance Coatings in 2016?
Michael McGarry: In Performance Coatings, I would say that we should break that down into the various segments, right, so the Aerospace we would say that would be low single-digits, so that is a reasonable number. If you look into PNC given our last quarter, I would say that it should continue to be low single-digits, so obviously the marine side is a problem. The order book for the big guys in Korea were 50% of what their expectations were, so marine new builds will continue to be the challenge, but the protective side should be really solid. If you look at our refinished business miles driven, continue to go up, gas prices are down, distracted driving is up, insurance claims are up so refinish has done quite well, so I would just call that historically that would be a zero business, but I’d say that’s going to be a low single-digit kind of year. And that leaves architectural and I think again that’s going to vary considerably by the region. We were pleased with the UK, Ireland, Benelux, Scandinavia all had good three plus kind of numbers that was good for us. France actually stabilized and so we saw a couple of months in the fourth quarter that were marginally up. It’s a little too early to tell yet what we expect there, but I would say France I am more optimistic now than I’ve been the last say nine to 15 months. So that’s all good. The Eastern European countries are -- they have had a lot of promotional challenges, but I would say overall it should come back around when you look at the U.S., we’ve obviously had some good growth in the U.S. except for the dealer market, the dealer market continues to be challenged. Canada I think is probably going to stabilize, so I don’t expect a lot in there. Mexico we’ve had tremendous growth there we’re going to continue to expect to grow two times GDP, the one negative in Mexico is the fact that government spending has started to slowdown with the price of oil dropping. I think Brazil’s going to be a challenge, I think China’s going to be a challenge, Australia should be good at least mid, I would low to mid single-digits in Australia. So that’s a good market for us, so all-in-all I would say we should be at or above GDP for the Performance Coatings segment.
David Begleiter: Very good Mike, same off the Performance Coatings, would you expect margins to be up in 2016 versus ‘15 given where it was and if so would 6 basis points be a low bar somewhere?
Michael McGarry: David I think it’s a little early to answer that question. In my opening commentary you saw that we said pricing would be flat. We expect this to continue to see modest raw material deflation, so I think putting a number on it is way too early.
Vince Morales: This is Vince. The one thing we do have is restructuring benefit, we -- it is not the restructuring plan for everybody’s recollection in April 2015, we saw very modest benefits, but targeted for all of ‘15 and we expect incremental benefits in 2016.
Michael McGarry: Yes, that would be partially offset by changes in the corporate cost, which should effect the historical levels, but overall our goal would be to gradually accrete with return on sales percentage overall for the Company.
Operator: The next question comes from Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Duffy Fischer: First question just there has been a lot kind of about and written with the MROs in the refinish side of things and how they’re rolling that up. As you look back at ‘15, how’s that played out for you guys and what would you look at going forward whether it would be a lot more on that consolidation and does that favor you, would this favor you, how would you talk about that?
Michael McGarry: Duffy, this is Michael. I think you’re referring to the MSOs Multi Shop Operators, that trend line is for the big guys that continue to buy the little guys it is obviously a positive for us. Some of these smaller shops lack the same productivity that the bigger shops too, that’s where we bring tremendous amount of value to our multi-shop operators, we are there to improve their business instead of getting nine cars out of the shop, they can get 10 cars out in a day. So, that’s been a positive for us. So, I’d tell you that our share in the U.S. continues to increase. I don’t know how much more the MSOs will aggregate this year because when I think about it from a dead market, I’m not sure how aggressive they’re going to be in trying to raise more debt given this environment, but regardless we are totally supportive and it’s been a good trend for PPG.
Duffy Fischer: And then, it is a little bit nitpicky but it might be $20 million or so, last year currency hedged you 250 million on revenue, 25 million on income which was about a 10% margin, this year at the midpoint you have kind of moved that up to a 13% or 14% margin, what’s the difference in how the currency is impacting earnings relative to sales this year versus last year?
Frank Sklarsky: Duffy, this is Frank here. It really has to do with some of the mix of where the currency translation impacts ours so for instance, so we have much larger component of Comex this year and given the margin structures and given that relative portion of that business to the total PPG that’s really where the difference is and so the last year the largest impact for instance was the euro, it is a little bit more balanced in terms of the currency impacts this year with maybe, with a higher proportion of Latin America so that would really be the difference.
Operator: The next question comes from Rory Blake of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Frank Mitsch: This is Frank Mitsch, setting in for Rory. Michael, in early September we met with you and you were talking about how you were concerned about 10% or just under 10% of the PPG portfolio mentioning Brazil, Russia heavy-duty equipment, et cetera. As we sit here today late mid to late January, what percent of the portfolio would you say you’d put in that concerning category?
Michael McGarry: Well, I think Frank it probably hasn’t changed too much. Russia, we still see that as a challenging market, Brazil is probably more challenged today than it used to be, heavy-duty equipment though is I’d say stabilized at a lower level, but it is a down, but the negativeness of those numbers have significantly reduced. Besides that I’d tell you that the rest of our businesses are pretty good. So, I don’t know that I would -- change what you got as a concerned level.
Frank Mitsch: That’s very interesting, obviously you see the broader market melting down expecting that the global economy is going to tank here, but based on the guidance that you have put forth it doesn’t appear that that was the case and I’ll take your response so you reiterate that that’s terrific, if I could follow-up and some granularity to the productivity progress , I think you had talked about or could you talk about realizing about $70 million of benefits in 2016 and exiting the year at a run rate of $100 million, is that still a target or is it higher lower? How can you help us there?
Michael McGarry: Now Frank that’s still above right, I know we said that was on the program, we would get a between $15 million and $20 million if you remember by the end of 2015 and that was accurate and the incremental 50 to 70 for 2016, bringing us a total of just under 100 million by the end of 2016 and then a little bit of trailing into ‘17 and those assumptions are still good and nevertheless we continue based on macro environment. We’re always looking for additional rationalization opportunities and that will be a very strong focus for us.
Frank Mitsch: Frank you mentioned though that corporate expenses are expected to tick higher in ‘16, is that correct?
Frank Sklarsky: I’d say that because of the fact that Q4 number was a little bit lower based on stock-based compensation based on stock-based compensation, it will probably revert back to something closer to what we’ve seen historically in prior years as you get back into Q1 and for the remainder of the year.
Frank Mitsch: So, it’s based on stock-based compensation, that’s the delta?
Frank Sklarsky: That was one of the primary drivers really going down form the Q4 the prior year, yes.
Operator: The next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Jeff Zekauskas: I think your pension funding this year was about $300 million. What you expect your pension funding for the next year?
Frank Sklarsky: Yes, the numbers will come down substantially. The number for this year really includes that large $250 million that we put in the first quarter to really shore up the funding of the U.S. plans. Those numbers will come down into the I would say the low double-digits in terms of cash funding for 2016. We have very little in terms of mandatory funding for the year. And that was really related to some of the international plans. So that cash funding will not be what I would call material way. We may have some wind ups that we do in various parts of the world and we’ll be very transparent about those when those happen, but on a trend basis that 250 was probably an anomaly.
Jeff Zekauskas: In thinking about your overall volume growth for 2015, the geographic area that you had your difficulties in was North America, that is Europe and Asia grew 2% or 3% and the U.S. and Canada was down 1%. Can you diagnose what went wrong in the U.S. and Canada in 2015? And how you expect it to be different than 2016?
Michael McGarry: Let’s start with Canada first. I mean, clearly, the oil business has the first material impact on that and that was a challenge for us. I would say that the slowing Canadian economy was also a challenge for us. When you shipped into the U.S., clearly we told you that the biggest challenge we had in the third quarter was the destocking that we saw due to the weather challenges we had in May and June. We have a very large stain [ph] business, if you will, in our architectural business. So that was one. Then, you had heavy duty equipment and industrial was the challenge. So those were all the negatives. We also had the slowing in the industrial production. So, when you factor that in and look at what we’re looking at for 2016, I am not nearly as pessimistic, I think industrial production will be more steady. You certainly see the housing market continuing to progress. I would say that our rebranding initiatives in our architectural business is a positive, the line reviews that we had with the major retail DIY chains were also positive. So, I am coming in the year feeling better about the U.S. So that would be my explanation.
Operator: The next question comes from P.J. Juvekar of Citi. Please go ahead.
P.J. Juvekar: Mike, I want to go back to some of your broader comments that you made. You talked about broadening out of the recovery in Europe, which is not something we have heard a lot about. You talked about auto sales growing from the mid $17 million -- or mid-17 million unit level. Do you think that’s sustainable given some cautious commentary from auto companies and auto parts companies so far?
Michael McGarry: Well, one of the leading indicators we look at of course is registrations and the various countries. And if you look at registrations, they have been ahead of builds and sales in the fourth quarter were substantially ahead of builds. So, inventory wise, even though Europe historically doesn’t keep much inventory, we still think that’s a positive. If you look in the southern countries, in Europe, they all had very high growth rates, albeit coming off an extremely low base. But that was our positive. So, I’d say unlike in the U.S. where we’re in the late innings in the U.S. for automotive, I’d say in Europe we’re more like the middle innings there. So, I think that’s just our viewpoint. Obviously, we could be wrong P.J., but I think that’s our take on it.
P.J. Juvekar: And my second question is on TiO2. Can you just give us an update on where does the Henan Billions plan stand on chloride TiO2? And would you be willing to license that technology to other companies in China?
Michael McGarry: So P.J., you probably saw our press release. We qualified the material, let’s call it in October. We had shipments on the water. We started commercially using the material in early December. More product is on the water going to other locations outside the U.S. So, it’s going to get qualified in Mexico; it’s getting qualified in Europe. The bottom line is they are making good products, their consistency is getting better. And we are pleased with what we are seeing. We have most favored nations with them, so that’s the positive for us as well. As far as licensing, no one else has approached us. But clearly, as we have demonstrated and people I think were a little bit concerned about but we have demonstrated that we are able to support them with our technology, and it’s running well. And the biggest thing we are working with them on now is consistency and so far so good. And we are open. So, if you know somebody we should be talking to let us know, but right now Henan Billions is our partner.
Operator: The next question comes from Arun Viswanathan of RBC. Please go ahead.
Arun Viswanathan: I just had a question on the volume trends. It looks like Q4 you’ve got 2% growth and most of the ‘15 was about 1%. And just look at the slide commentary, looks like most of the commentary is for continued improvement in Q1 outside of seasonality. So, I mean would you characterize what you are seeing right is any kind of positive inflection point? Then maybe you can talk about by end market, especially automotive OEM and architectural.
Michael McGarry: Well, so far in Q1 our order book looks very similar to what we saw fairly in Q4. As we told people in Q4, everybody thought that world was falling down in China, we tried to reassure people that we did not see that. I think people saw that car builds in China were up substantially in 4Q. We have good visibility all the way through Chinese New Year, so we see the Chinese auto builds continue to be up low single digits. Overall we see the U.S. car market being up low single digits as well. But as we described in the earlier comment, we see that in a later innings of ball game. So, those are our commentary as far as the other markets, industrial has been an up and down market for us. We talked about heavy duty equipment; the automotive parts business is being good; we had positive trends in coil in the fourth quarter, general finishes was up. Our electronic materials business was also up. That is not really due to electronic materials growth as much as the new product reductions we have. And electronic materials were pretty significant and our customers are adopting this new technology. So, it’s more like a win in the marketplace. And I think I have covered architectural quite substantially but there is a market I missed, I’d be happy to cover it Arun. 
Arun Viswanathan: It’s fair enough.
Frank Sklarsky: Arun, just to add to what Michael said, referring to his comments before too, we’ve seen some good wins on the protective side, that should continue specialty coatings materials and packaging; that also applies to the packaging and industrial businesses in Europe where we continue to see recovery and then see some nice wins there. So that’s also going to add to the organic growth as we go forward.
Arun Viswanathan: Great. And just as a follow-up, I mean have you seen any change in behavior amongst your customers? As you said, a lot of us -- lot of investors and maybe observers are just kind of skittish on what’s going on in first half -- couple of weeks of the year. But is there have been any changes amongst yours customers and is that to be expected or your business is much longer cycle and we shouldn’t expect that?
Michael McGarry: Well, we haven’t got anybody calling us up all nervous. I would tell you the one packaging comment I’d throw out [ph] that Frank didn’t mention was that in California with Proposition 65 concerns, we see more of our customers actually converting to the newer technologies faster and sooner than we originally expected. So that’s the positive for us. I think we read more about the nervousness than we see about the nervousness. But maybe people would turn off the TVs that might be a little better.
Operator: The next question comes from Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead.
Don Carson: Michael, I want to go back to architectural, just both U.S. and Canada and that North American outlook, last year in the U.S. obviously growth was below trend due to weather. Do you see that snapping back this year or do you see that being offset by weakness in some of the energy related states? And more importantly, what was your growth in U.S. architectural last year versus the market, and how would you expect it compared to the market this year? Then just any general comments on Canada and Mexico market growth outlook?
Michael McGarry: So Don, let me start with the U.S. We saw the market at between 2% and 3%; that’s been consistent. You’ve seen that with retailers as well. I would say that we were a tick below that. So from that standpoint, we were disappointed with our performance but I would tell you that given what we have seen moving forward that the will be a better year this. We opened 25, essentially 25 new stores between U.S. and Canada, we opened a 190 new store locations in Mexico, we’ve opened new locations in France as well. So, I would say overall, our global store network will be bigger and better in 2016 than 2015. So that’s kind of my summation of that.
Vince Morales: We said earlier -- I don’t if you caught it, this is Vince that we expected the Canadian market to remain soft in the first part of the year, but then we’d lap that softness in the back half of the year so that -- I think you had question on Canada as well.
Michael McGarry: On the protective side, I guess you also made a commentary about that. Protective, [audio gap] we’re winning share both in the U.S. and Canada, so we had built into our plans continued growth in 2016.
Don Carson: And then just to follow up on raws, not so much coatings raws, but just hydrocarbons, just Vince, you can run how much gas you’re consuming in your glass business? And I would imagine just things like diesel fuel coming down given how substantial your truck fleet hours [ph] have to be a benefit as well. So, what kind of hydrocarbon benefit do you see going into ‘16 versus ‘15?
Vince Morales: Hey Don, as you know once you divested the commodity chemical business, our gas consumption dropped materially. A dollar change in natural gas for us is $15 million to $20 million a year. On the cost side, we do have some customer price indexing that mutes that whether it be up or down. So, really gas price changes are not material impact for us in any individual quarter. We don’t buy a lot of hydrocarbon materials for coatings production. We do have logistics cost, so diesel cost is important to us in our distribution businesses. We do see some benefit there as oil moves down. It takes a lot of pass-through. We are seeing some inflation in trucker salaries. So right now those probably are moving equal and opposite directions.
Operator: The next question comes from Mike Harrison of Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.
Mike Harrison: Michael, I was wondering if you could talk about competitive dynamics you’re seeing in the auto refinish business. As you look to expand share, what does that mean in terms of what’s going on with pricing? 
Michael McGarry: The refinish business is a beautiful model from the standpoint that we have thousands and thousands and thousands of little customers. And what that means is that all -- we always have a price up opportunity, this year -- in 2015, we had a price increase in August. We would expect to have another price increase sometime in the third quarter of 2016. This has been an industry trend for quite some period of time. I don’t know that I can ever remember the time that refinished business hasn’t had a price increase. So that’s a positive but it’s not just PPG; I mean that’s an industry event as well.
Frank Sklarsky: And you’ve got to number too that pricing is just only one element in terms of winning a new business. PPG is known obviously for the color matching and the service capabilities, the things that we do really well. And it’s the technologies change and go more to waterborne and so on, that plays to PPG’s advantages.
Mike Harrison: And then looking over to the packaging coating side, you noted last quarter that you were going to be lapping the introduction of interior can coatings in that business. But it sounds like you saw straight despite what sounded like was going to be a challenging comp in that business. Can you talk about the uptick that you are seeing in the non-intent BPA coatings? How much additional runway does that have and are you capturing any additional exterior coating business as a result of the interior product?
Vince Morales: Hey Mike, this is Vince. We did see difficult comparable in Europe in the fourth quarter this year, as they were prepping last year in the fourth quarter for the legislative change in France. So that was actually our lowest growth region this year, due to the tough comp, it still grew year over year. But we had mid single digit or higher in the other regions as customers continue to roll this out around the world. And we still see very good runway; we’re still in the infancy of this product introduction and this has no impact on the outside of the can. So that’s still being competed based on the similar metrics it was in the past, similar customer metrics it was in the past.
Operator: The next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Vincent Andrews: Just a question on pricing, you said for ‘15 you expected to be flat, it looks like you’re up 25 basis points. But if I’m remembering the trend, through the year it seemed to decelerate a bit in the second, third and fourth quarter and you’re anticipating being flat again next year. So, if you could give us a sense of maybe on an end market basis or if you’re having to pass through some costs, just sort of what the dynamics are that sort of caused the deceleration through the year and then how we should be thinking about the cadence in ‘16 as well?
Frank Sklarsky: Vincent, if you look at -- you described the situation accurately. We did have call it, less than 1% in Q1 and we ended the year just very modestly over zero. We do re-price with new product introductions. We do have some customers where we talk about price annually. And again our situation as we look at it today is base case of flat price all in for the year. There are certain markets where we do get price as Michael mentioned. There are other markets that are more competitive. So, we’re expecting flat price. We won’t go into individual customers, individual businesses. That’s been our customary pattern not to talk about this.
Vincent Andrews: And then just a quick one on -- there was a comment on challenges in the independent dealer channel in the U.S. Could you just speak to those a little bit more? And what’s you’re doing to change that?
Michael McGarry: Sure Vincent, this is Michael again. Independent dealers channel has been a declining channel for quite some period of time. These are small -- a lot of them are small business owners; as they retire, they would rather sell out to the large paint companies. Plus, as you know, large retail partners continue to win share from that segment. So, it has been under pressure for a long time. We do not expect that trend to change. And so, I think you can expect to be that going forward.
Vincent Andrews: So, there was nothing incrementally different about what you saw in the quarter versus the test? Okay. Thanks very much.
Michael McGarry: Very similar and the contraction rate remains minor but continues.
Operator: The next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi of Baird. Please go ahead.
Ghansham Panjabi: First off on Comex. Michael, you gave us a nice update on the integration. What about market conditions in Mexico and Central America as a whole? Has there been any deviation in the trend line there?
Michael McGarry: Let’s start with Mexico, the one slowing trend has been the government spending. The spending from the consumer has been very solid. We saw good gains all across our network, whether it’s in the north or the south. We added 190 stores. It was a very good year for the Comex team, up high single digits for the year. So that was really job well done by them. In Central America, we’re in seven small countries there. Those seven, all seven had positive year-over-year growth. And two of them, we had particularly high growth rates, but that was the introduction of our new Glidden product down there and that was specifically Panama and Costa Rica. We would expect to grow faster in those two particular countries than we would the others. The others should be at a GDP kind of run rate. But overall, I would say, both Mexico and Central America continue to be good markets for us overall.
Ghansham Panjabi: And then on U.S. architectural and I am sorry if I missed this. But can you give us a sense as to how that business performed in the big box channel and also retail stores? Also any benefit from the warmer weather in the country during the fourth quarter? And also how would you characterize the pricing environment by channel at current? Thanks so much.
Michael McGarry: I think we covered a lot of this originally, but the combined U.S.-Canada stores network was slightly flat. It was obviously held back by Canada. So, that was our challenge there. We’ve had positive growth with our DIY partners in the quarter. There was probably some material improvement due to weather but not as much as you would think because obviously they’re destocking at that period of time, so they probably took that opportunity to continue to move down. But all in all, we do think weather was a positive in the fourth quarter. And then, we talked about the dealers just recently. So, I think overall, we’ve been performing slightly under the markets; if you say the market was 2% to 3%, we were 1 tick below that.
Operator: The next question comes from Nils Wallin of CLSA. Please go ahead.
Nils Wallin: First, would you remind us where you are in achieving all those various Comex cost revenue and Central America synergies?
Michael McGarry: The cost synergies we laid out were $45 million to $50 million, and we are on our pace to beat that number, so that’s good. On the sales synergies in the Mexican market, we said that number was going to be $40 million to $50 million; those are PPG products, through the Comex concessionaire network. We are solidly on pace to achieve those numbers. And then the Central America number was $60 million to $70 and basis the most recent quarter, I am very comfortable with that number that we put out there. It’s obviously early; we just closed on that acquisition in July, but the fourth quarter is a busy season down there and we had a very good fourth quarter in the Central American market.
Nils Wallin: And then just in terms of the cash deployment guidance, obviously last quarter you’ve moved it up at the bottom end and then reiterated it this quarter. I am curious as to how you’re thinking about next in ‘16; what would be the factors that would allow it or cause it to be below what you’ve done in ‘15, or above what you’ve done in ‘15? And then what you think the mix will be; is it likely to be more repurchases or more repurchases than M&A or is the likely to change?
Frank Sklarsky: So, if you look at what we did in ‘15 and we basically came in at half of what the midpoint of the range we reiterated, so 1.15 as compared with 2 to 2.5 for the three year period. And as always, the mix between the share repurchases and the acquisitions will depend on what we have in the pipeline and the timing of any -- closing of any particular acquisition. We’ve continually said, we have a really nice robust pipeline of things that we continue to look at around the various regions and the various businesses from an acquisition standpoint, and that would be our preference do accretive acquisitions. But as always, at any given quarter that mix will change. And I think it’s safe to assume that while we like to focus on the acquisitions that share repurchases will continue to be an integral part of our capital deployment strategy and no reason believe that will not continue including this quarter.
Nils Wallin: And just also what would -- would it just be the acquisition timing that would cause it to be above or below that midpoint or is there something else?
Frank Sklarsky: We look at the whole landscape between what we have available and acquisition pipeline and also in the deployment. And really it starts with what our cash from operations that we generate is going to be. And what we said as we came up with that range because we know how much cash we’ll have to deploy and we fully intend to be midpoint in that range and the only thing would change the mix is the timing of acquisitions. But the absolute dollars we intend to bring in within that $2 billion and $2.5 billion range. 
Operator: The next question comes from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please go ahead. 
Dan Rizzo: Hi. This is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. Just one question, so some of your competitors have talked about going from sole sourcing to dual sourcing as a means to reduce raw materials cost. Is that something you guys are looking into or would it be suitable for you; I mean how much of your raw materials are currently sole sourced?
Michael McGarry: Well I wouldn’t want to get into the percentage that’s either one of those, but I’d tell you that we’re consistently working with our suppliers to have maximum flexibility on how we formulate and how we work with our suppliers. So, I’d tell you we’re very comfortable with where we are.
Dan Rizzo: And then one more quick one. I think you just indicated that you opened 190 new stores in Mexico through Comex in 2015. Is that going to be the pace going forward, is that going to moderated at all or are those accelerating, some color?
Michael McGarry: We’re expecting to open up 150 to 170 stores in 2016. So, we’d originally thought we’d do 170 this year, we actually did a 190. So, we might have pulled forward one or two but I’d still think we’re going to be in the similar type of a range.
Operator: And the next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn of Longbow Research. Please go ahead.
Dmitry Silversteyn: A lot of my questions have been answered but I’d like to follow-up on a couple of points. First of all, in fourth quarter, aerospace weakness that you mentioned, was that related to new builds or was that on the rebate part of the business? I know they are usually 50-50 for you. But I was just wondering where the weakness in the quarter came from.
Michael McGarry: The weakness was really one part of it. I divided it into two parts. One part of it was because in the fourth quarter 2014 we had a government annuity double order whether they tried to use up all their budget or not, we’re not that -- we’re not able to predict but we do know they double ordered. And then the other half of the slowdown was due to our sealants business. We have a customer that had a large new plane that they were working on and they’ve gotten more consistent in ordering and their work practices have gotten slightly better. So, their waste has declined marginally. So, now that that’s more stable, we see that returning back to a year-over-year growth. The only thing about aerospace is the general aviation market is very strong for the big planes and slightly weak for the little planes.
Dmitry Silversteyn: So, it sounds like it was more a new builds rather than sort of maintenance. So, it would imply that the overall industry is still in pretty good shape.
Michael McGarry: Yes, Boeing is expected -- I think you probably listen their commentary, both guys are trying to increase the production rate. So, they both had eight-year backlogs. So, it’s not like they don’t have a business.
Vince Morales: Yes, we do expect aerospace return to growth, as Michael mentioned earlier. And again just to give you the Q4 ‘14 comp, we were up high single digits in aerospace last year; that’s a comp Michael is comparing against.
Dmitry Silversteyn: On the Comex store openings, are these being opened by existing concessionaries, are you signing new concessionaries or are these company-owned stores I guess for lack of better word, and just trying to understand where the source of growth is and how it’s being supported by corporate versus concessionaries?
Michael McGarry: There are no company-owned stores in Mexico. We have a dedicated concessionaire network. We do not ever plan to be in the company store business in Mexico. It is a combination of both, some of our long term concessionaire partners as well as some new ones. So, we have a lot of people that would like to have a store. And so we are very, very selective of our about finding those entrepreneurs that are going to live, eat, sleep selling Comex paint. And that’s our desire and we make sure we find the right people and it is the combination of both existing and new.
Dmitry Silversteyn: So, it sounds like sort of the hopper is being filled by people on the ground in Mexico and then it’s sort of up to you to figure out who gets it and who doesn’t; is that how the business model works?
Michael McGarry: This is definitely owned by Marcos Achar and his leadership team. All I do is bless it.
Dmitry Silversteyn: Okay.
Michael McGarry: They are way better at this than anybody else.
Dmitry Silversteyn: And then speaking of packaging and the shares that you picked up there inside of a can, I’m assuming you talked about sort of gaining shares in Europe last year and I guess in 2015 it was more the turn of the U.S., if I understand your commentary correctly. So, I know that back a couple of years ago when you had your special day on packaging, you talked about zero percentage inside the can market share in the U.S. What is your market share in the U.S. currently with this 9 and 10 BPA transition taking place?
Michael McGarry: Well, what we told you was that we had a 3% global market share. I don’t know that I want to get into what our market share is now. But I would call 3%, not the material; and what we have now is defiantly material but it is a substantial double digit kind of increase. And our customers are excited about what we bring to the table from a technology standpoint. More importantly, they are excited about our ability to launch flawlessly these new products. And that gives them a lot of comfort in giving us the business.
Dmitry Silversteyn: On the performance coatings and fourth quarter margins, they were a little bit lighter than I would have expected, and the year-over-year improvement wasn’t what you saw in the previous three quarters. Was that just a matter of mix and the aerospace business being not as strong in performance coatings or was there something else going on with margins there?
Frank Sklarsky: Dmitry, the sole factor there was the fact that we lapped Comex. So, for the other three quarters this Comex, which comes in at above segment margin was a true adder. We only have one month of that benefit in Q4 because we closed the Comex acquisition in November last year’s.
Dmitry Silversteyn: Okay, so that was entirely Comex related, fine. And on the glass side of the business, I’m assuming it’s the lower energy costs that are driving these mid teens margins that you haven’t seen as far as my model goes to 2001?
Michael McGarry: No, the energy -- most of the energy in glass is on an index. And so, this is coming from true pricing in the marketplace. As you know supply and demand is relatively tight. One of our competitors closed the furnace in California. We sold our facility in the Midwest. And so with the reduction in industry capacity, pricing has been attractive in that segment.
Dmitry Silversteyn: And then finally, as a sort of a longer-term as I think about your cash flow, your working capital as a percentage of sales really has come down meaningfully over the last five years; I think it’s almost half of what it used to be as a percentage of sales, at just over 6% here in 2015. Do you have a longer term goal or is this the level that you are happy with or is there an expectation that maybe given all the growth you have that working capital will go up as a percentage of sales in future years?
Frank Sklarsky: Well, our goal is still to bring working capital down as a percent of sales. And you are correct, over last two years we brought it down by about $300 million; about half of it was payables including supplier financing programs and about half was inventory where we took out about five days of operational inventories this year and we’ve also improved the quality of the receivables by working down the percentage of past-dues. So, we are pleased with that and we still have a several days to go, we can get out of inventories and keep working on past-due receivables. So, the goal would be continue to bring down working capital by kind of on average of 100 basis points a year for the next couple of years. And then we think we will be kind in line with the peer group.
Dmitry Silversteyn: And what would your CapEx guidance be for 2016? One final question.
Frank Sklarsky: We couldn’t hear you, Dmitry. Could you repeat?
Dmitry Silversteyn: What would the CapEx guidance be for 2016, what you expect to spend on capital expenditures?
Frank Sklarsky: As we put in our presentation 3% to 3.5% of sales would be our…
Dmitry Silversteyn: 3% to 3.5%, okay. Okay, fair enough. Thank you guys.
Operator: As we are out of time, I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Scott Minder for any closing remarks.

Michael McGarry: Thank you, Vince and good afternoon everyone. I want to thank you for your continued interest in PPG. Today, we have reported our third quarter 2015 financial results. Our results included third quarter net sales of $3.8 billion and third quarter record adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $1.61. Our adjusted earnings per share in the third quarter were up $0.20 or 14% versus the prior record quarter. Our continued strong performance was achieved despite unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts, which were larger than originally anticipated due to further weakening of emerging region currencies during the quarter. We more than offset the currency headwind with continued benefits from our acquisitions, including consistently strong performance of Comex, ongoing and aggressive actions that further reduce our overall cost, and continued cash deployment. Overall, we performed well this quarter against a more dynamic and uneven economic backdrop. We have continued to deliver solid compounded adjusted EPS growth as a company, including over 20% in the last 3 years. This consistent performance is a tangible measurement of our global coatings business platform, our ability to innovate and commercialize customer-driven products and technologies and our continued aggressive cost management. Additionally, we continue to benefit from disciplined earnings accretive cash deployment. Our third quarter sales volume declined by less than 1% year-over-year, down slightly versus our second quarter performance. The lower results reflect overall moderation of global economic growth during the quarter and transitory customer inventory management. Our Industrial Coatings segment grew volumes supported by continued automotive OEM volume growth in all major regions. We delivered higher volumes in Asia despite lower industry production in China. Also, growth continued in Europe and North America, supported by growing demand in these regions. Additionally, we continue to benefit from initial industry adoption of our new can coating technologies and our packaging coatings business. We are in early stages of an industry-wide technology conversion and we have demonstrated excellent progress in securing an initial leadership position during this once in a multi-decade industry conversion. Within the industrial segment, growth was partially offset by slight volume declines in our industrial coatings and specialty coatings and materials businesses. A result similar to prior sequential quarter as overall general industrial demand remains tepid in all major regions. Performance coating sales declined – volumes declined due to lower architectural coatings demand stemming from a weaker Canadian economy, coupled with inventory management by most of our U.S. and Canadian national retail customers approaching the tail end of a modest painting season. Overall, architectural coatings industry demand was modest in the third quarter following a weaker than anticipated second quarter due to poor painting weather conditions. So essentially, we do not experience a large-scale snapback in the quarter. This left most of our large national retail customers and independent distributors with high inventories as we began to wind down the paint season. So, their late third quarter order patterns were reduced commensurately. Volumes in our other performance coatings businesses were up slightly. Regionally, for the company, higher volumes were achieved in Europe, with growth trends slightly ahead of the previous quarter as we continue to see broader, but still modestly incremental improvement in the region. Year-over-year volumes grew in Asia as well. China volumes were soft early in the quarter, including customer inventory management, but stabilized with demand improvement later in the quarter. Volumes in the U.S. and Canadian markets were lower year-over-year, primarily due to architectural coatings customer inventory management. Mexican volumes, excluding acquisition-related benefits, remain very solid while South American demand weakened in comparison to previous sequential quarter and year-over-year. As I mentioned, we incurred notable unfavorable currency translation impacts to sales and earnings stemming from weakened foreign currencies. These currencies, primarily the euro, unfavorably impacted our sales by about $310 million or about 8% and reduced our pre-tax earnings by about $45 million or $0.12 per share. Absent the foreign currency impacts, our adjusted earnings per share would have been up over 20% year-over-year. Based on current foreign currency exchange rates, we expect the unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts to moderate somewhat in the fourth quarter as foreign currencies began to weaken in the second half of 2014 and do the seasonality of our businesses. Given these factors, we now expect currency translation to reduce our full year sales by about $1.1 billion and pre-tax earnings by about $120 million to $130 million. This range is slightly unfavorable to the forecast that we provided during our second quarter earnings conference call, with most of the change already recognized in our third quarter results. As you would expect from PPG, we have maintained our aggressive operational and cost focus as we achieve lower manufacturing and SG&A cost in comparison to last year. Our year-over-year SG&A cost as a percentage of sales were down about 100 basis points during the third quarter. We continue to execute on our previously announced restructuring plan and anticipate full year savings from this program of $100 million to $105 million when fully implemented in 2017, with $15 million to $20 million of these savings expected in 2015. Cash deployment was also a significant factor of segment income growth in the third quarter. This included sales and earnings from our recent acquisitions, including Comex and several smaller companies. Since the end of the second quarter, we closed on Cuming Microwave, Chemfil Canada, IVC Industrial Coatings and Le Joint Francais, our abbreviated, LJF. We will benefit from these transactions in the fourth quarter. In addition to acquisition spending, we deployed $150 million of cash in the quarter for the purchase of 1.5 million shares of PPG stock. And our repurchase pace year-to-date is ahead of last year. We remain committed to accretive – earnings accretive cash deployment. And year-to-date we have spent $900 million in this regard. Including six business acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price of over $400 million coupled with $500 million of stock repurchases. We had previously announced a cash deployment target of $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion focused on acquisitions and share repurchases for the combined calendar year 2015 and 2016. We have now narrowed the range and are targeting at least $2 billion to $2.5 billion over that time period. Looking ahead we anticipate a resumption of PPG volume growth in the fourth quarter supported by global economic growth, the absence of customer inventory management and the benefit of including Comex in our organic figures following the acquisition anniversary in November. Lastly, we continue to have a variety of PPG specific earnings drivers that are not directly tied to the pace of the economy most of which I have already spoken about. In summary, these include the benefits of completing our restructuring actions, attainment of remaining synergies from the ongoing integration of our acquisitions, the ongoing effects of continued cash deployment and our proactive cost management. Before we conclude our prepared remarks I want to provide some context around the few key initiatives I will be working on in my new role as CEO. These initiatives are summarized on the slide titled PPG Path Forward in the presentation material supporting today’s teleconference. First and foremost we are committed to maintaining an unwavering focus on our customers. To do so we will continue to invest in customer driven innovation and technology. Technology development has been the backbone of PPG for many, many years and we have been to gain valuable share of our customers’ wallet as technology in our industry has continued to shift and support the changing customer and environment demand. Recent examples include our compact process and automotive OEM, a new array of coatings and sealant technologies that we serve – we develop to serve today’s composite aerospace market, our industry leading water based refinished coatings and new coatings for the inside of food and beverage cans just to name a few. We aim to use these technology shifts to expand our innovation leadership in markets in which we participate. Also we intend to maximize the transfer of these technologies across all of PPG’s business as faster. Additionally we need to increase our customer intimacy and service capabilities so that we are able to deliver higher organic growth. This requires us to make it easier for customers to do business with PPG. This includes from the time they or we develop a potential concept involving either coatings technology or application all the way through the purchase order to our final product shipment and providing technical support to service our customers to launch the new technology in their facilities flawlessly. This is an end to end customer approach that has focused on building long lasting mutual beneficial relationships and is aimed to drive in a higher organic growth rate. PPG has been very good operationally as the 34 year veteran of the company this is one of the disciplines that was instilled in me and continues to be in part with all associates from day one on the job and it remains with us today. No stone goes unturned and looking for way to reduce costs and we will maintain this aggressive cost managing approach. In addition we will make it even more dynamic so that we will continue rapidly adjust our cost structure to constantly match regional and end use market demand by further verbalizing our cost structuring. This will include more shared service cost centers of excellence that were centralized costs allowing us to take advantage of efficiencies and technologies and is possible due to our global scale. This will improve our cost structure in the various regions and field locations around the world. Strategically we have made significant strides in transforming our portfolio in the past several years. We are now in a position to optimize and extract the full scale advantages of our global coatings platforms. This includes improvements in nearly every facet of our business including further distribution and supply chain advantages due to our breadth and depth of products and services we buy, make and sell. Naturally given all the effort we have put into transforming our business portfolio, we will maintain our rigor on our business portfolio to ensure continued shareholder value creation. Also we remain fiscally prudent and shareholder friendly to other trades that have long been embedded in PPG’s DNA. From a balance sheet perspective we want to remain investment grade and maintain adequate financial flexibility which has served us so well over the years. We will certainly invest organically to keep our existing businesses healthy and keep our discipline with respect to acquisition evaluation. Additionally we intend to reward our shareholders and we recommend sustainable dividend increases to our Board of Directors. We intend to be efficient with all our assets including cash and we will return excess cash to shareholders. Lastly, I am honored and excited to be CEO and I look forward over the coming weeks and months for spending more time with our shareholders and continuing this dialogue on the path forward. Thank you for your time and once again we appreciate your interest in PPG. Now Jasmine would you please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Michael you highlighted in the release moderating global economic growth, can you talk to what regions and what end markets you are seeing that moderating growth?
Michael McGarry: Sure. We can start with automotive as you know you saw that in China. The good news is in September you saw a little bit of an improvement there and the order book for August continues to look modestly better. You would also see some heavy-duty equipment being another area that continues to be a little bit weak. From a regional perspective, we see some – a little bit of uptick in Europe. And obviously the Latin America, particularly Brazil seems to be getting weaker instead of better. So overall, I think those would be some of our initial comments, David.
David Begleiter: Very good. Michael just on raws in your gross margin nice expansion in Q3, where do we stand on the realization of some of the lower raw material costs through your COGS?
Michael McGarry: David, we have been very consistent. We have told you throughout the year that about a third of our raw materials are tied to oil. We get savings quicker on items closer to the oil well like solvents. We get those in 30 to 60 days, transportation typically 60 to 90 days. We typically work with our suppliers of both through the propylene and ethylene derivatives savings. And there is lag a little bit more in six months to nine months. We see more raw material deflation in 3Q than in 2Q. And we will continue to work with our suppliers to get further savings in 4Q and going forward.
David Begleiter: Thank you very much.
Frank Sklarsky: Thanks, David.
Michael McGarry: Thank you, David.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Chris Evans: This is Chris Evans on for Bob. I was hoping you could provide some additional granularity on the North American architectural volume decline, are you guys seeing any trends outside of the destocking there?
Michael McGarry: Chris, what I would tell you is that we had a wet June and people were anticipating a stronger paint season. We have been very consistent in saying that we expected the paint season to be in that low single-digit range. I think our assessment has been relatively on target. So we saw the major retail folks both in the U.S. and Canada start to destock late in the third quarter. The good news is I will tell you that we think it’s transitory because as I look at our sales through the first 14 days of October, the sales are very consistent with what we saw in the fourth quarter of last year. So that leaves me to believe that this is transitory effect.
Chris Evans: Thank you, guys.
Frank Sklarsky: Thank you, Chris.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Please proceed.
Duffy Fischer: Yes, good afternoon folks. Question, just if you would take a step back on your volumes, the chart that you provided optically obviously doesn’t look good. The whole industry is struggling a little bit. But when you look across your businesses, would you say you are gaining or losing market share in – so the question is, are your volumes kind of worse than the market or in line with the market, would you guess?
Michael McGarry: Well, I guess, Duffy, I would first say that it’s a difficult question to answer given that there is not a lot of industry data that you can rely on. So, I would say it’s conceivable that in the U.S. stores business, we might have ticked down a fraction. But certainly, I don’t feel that way in Canada. And we are gaining share in other places like Mexico. We are gaining share in Europe. We are gaining share – so I would tell you that since we run a global architectural business overall, net-net, we are doing pretty well.
Frank Sklarsky: Duffy, if you go to some other markets outside of architectural, you will see auto is up versus the industry, packaging, we believe is up versus the industry, and we think our protective business is up versus the industry although the other side of that coin is marine. And marine for the industry is down and we are managing the declines with the industry.
Duffy Fischer: Okay. And then one area that it looks like you have an exciting new product, you call it compact. I think the industry will call it wet on wet. But it seems like you have gotten two big wins in that space recently. One, how big does that market become over the next 2 or 3 years and then is it conceivable that this could be like eco where you would get a strong majority of the wins going forward?
Michael McGarry: Yes, Duffy, I would tell you that this has been a recent trend. We have been outperforming the industry for quite some period of time now. So, the industry was up 1% in Q3, we were up 5% in Q3. So again, we have significantly outpaced. We have told people that it’s not probable that we would outpace the industry for an extended period of time. At some point, you have to revert to the means, but our technology, we think is the best. Our technical service has certainly been outstanding. And we have been winning more than our fair share of new plants. So that’s good. And then ultimately, when they start to refurbish some of these older facilities and they want to save money and reduce the footprint size, this compact process will also be another winner. So, we think this is a long-term sustainable win for us going forward. Thanks to the outstanding work of our R&D team.
Duffy Fischer: Great. Thanks, guys.
Frank Sklarsky: Thank you, Duffy.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed.
John Roberts: Good afternoon. Was Comex up high single-digits in the quarter? I know it was up high singles for the first half. So, I am just wondering whether it slowed down and still maintained high single for the nine months, but was decelerating in the quarter may be?
Frank Sklarsky: No, John, Comex has performed very well all year, very consistent at the at market sales. What we do see with Comex is the peso devalued 20% plus and so that’s been taking away some of the top line. We have made up for that with growth in both at market as well as new concessionaire store openings.
John Roberts: Okay. And could you comment a little bit about the M&A pipeline and whether valuation expectations have come down with the multiples on the publicly traded paint companies?
Michael McGarry: Yes, John, the way I would answer that is its too early for the multiples to come down to the last 30 or 60 days where you saw the stock market come down. Our pipeline still continues to look very good. We are active looking at a number of properties. And I see no difference in that regard versus what we have had in the past.
John Roberts: Okay, thank you.
Michael McGarry: Thank you, John.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed.
P.J. Juvekar: Yes. Hi, Michael. I have a question on this inventory management by retailers. You saw that in third quarter, what’s your confidence level that you think it’s behind us? You said first couple of weeks, it is good. And then secondly on that, was it a particular retailer or was it across the board for everyone that destocking took place? Was there any impact on pricing because of that?
Frank Sklarsky: P.J., we had a little hard time hearing you. Let me try to repeat the question. You asked I think what’s our confidence about Q4 no carryover into Q4 to destock, and how broad was the destocking. Is that correct, P.J.?
P.J. Juvekar: Yes, that’s correct. And if there was any impact on pricing of paint because it is destocking?
Frank Sklarsky: The third part will be okay.
Michael McGarry: Alright. So, we will take the pricing one first. As you know, we have been telling you consistently that pricing, our model shows pricing flat for the year. We still see that happening. And if you are thinking about next year, we’ll see pricing flat pretty much into next year as well. As far as why we think it’s a transitory effect on inventory, not only have we looked at our own inventories, but we have also obviously talked to our customers. And they are also of that same opinion. So, I think that’s a way to think about it besides just the fact that we are looking at our order book and it was broad. I won’t say all, but I will say it was very broad.
Frank Sklarsky: And P.J., you may have missed earlier, but Michael mentioned that the first two weeks of October, our order patterns are consistent with that same time period last year.
P.J. Juvekar: Okay, thank you. And then just on Canada, you mentioned that volumes were down. Can you just give some order of magnitude? How much were volumes down in Canada? Thank you.
Frank Sklarsky: So for us, just to frame this for everybody, we purchased – when we purchased the AkzoNobel North American business in 2013, we acquired the number one position in the country of Canada. At that time, we said the business was roughly $500 million and a very concentrated paint season just from a weather perspective. And that business was down similar to what you are seeing the total segment – total architectural business be down, so high-single, low double-digit range. And that’s more structural, P.J., we do see weakening in the Canadian economy.
Michael McGarry: Yes. We have had two quarters in a row of GDP down in Canada.
Frank Sklarsky: You there, P.J.?
P.J. Juvekar: Thank you.
Michael McGarry: Thanks.
Frank Sklarsky: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. In your commentary, you said that your cost-cutting program is lowering cost annually by about $20 million. So, let’s call it $5 million a quarter. But your SG&A and R&D costs in the quarter were down $52 million. And so I assume that I don’t know $47 million of that is currency. But your overall current – that is you had a $47 million currency benefit in SG&A. But you said that your currency net hit was $40 million. So, does that mean that the gross margin was penalized by about $87 million or $90 million in the quarter due to currencies?
Frank Sklarsky: Yes. First of all, let’s take the various categories. And if you look at corporate cost, it’s correct to say corporate costs went down by about $20 million. And the majority of that was stock-based compensation obviously reflecting the equity markets. And that will – it includes both the Q3 effect and the catch-up from the first half. That won’t really repeat in the fourth quarter. And I would suspect that, that corporate cost line will be back up in the $50 million to $55 million range versus the low $35 million that you saw in the quarter. What you are correct in saying that there is a currency benefit to our cost structure in total that applies to both COGS and SG&A around the world. So, what we said was while currency impacted the top line by $310 million in the quarter and impacted the bottom line by about – the operating income line by about $45 million in the quarter, we expect that overall currency impact in the fourth quarter will be less than that, but at today’s rates, about $250 million in the top line and about 10% of that on the operating income line. But in terms of we can’t really give you detail right now on the specific currency impact on every portion of the income statement, but that’s how I would frame it for Q3 and what we expect for Q4 as well as the corporate details.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay. And then secondly, many companies when they report earnings provide a full balance sheet and a full funds plus statement. Are there reasons why you in the gathering of your information that it’s difficult for you to put that together? And what was operating cash flow for the quarter?
Frank Sklarsky: So Jeff, as you know, we are a very early reporter. We do think that provides very quick transparency to our shareholders. We do file our Q within a week or so. And we have all those details. So I think the reason why just we would like to get the EBIT information, sales and EBIT information out as quick as possible.
Michael McGarry: And all I will add to that is the fact that if you look at where we started the quarter and we ended the quarter, we obviously picked up a couple of $100 million, over $200 million in cash balance and that’s a combination of the earnings and then take off of that obviously, CapEx, our acquisition spending, but also a good performance on working capital as we continued to work on collecting past due receivables as well as some initiatives we have around bringing inventories down. So still very diligent over managing the cash flow and as a result, we have a pretty decent Q3 in that respect.
Jeff Zekauskas: So what was the operating cash flow number in the quarter?
Frank Sklarsky: You will see that when we file our Q very shortly, you will see all the details around that would rather wait until you get the whole statement before we dissect that.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Michael McGarry: Thank you, Jeff.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
Frank Mitsch: Hi, good afternoon gentlemen and congrats on another record quarter.
Michael McGarry: Thanks Frank.
Frank Mitsch: But I think – I was thinking maybe I should wait until I see the Q to get super excited, but I will take your word for it. Michael, I think you mentioned that North American order patterns or maybe Vince for the first couple of weeks of October were similar to what you were seeing last year, so that gives you confidence that we are not seeing the destocking. Obviously, Asia was a big concern for folks and you said that it started out soft in Q3 but then it got better, can you talk about the pace of business so far in October in that part of the world?
Michael McGarry: Yes. So Frank, let me give you a couple of things as I go about here. And I will start with the automotive side because there seems to be a lot of concern about the automotive piece. As you know, they have reduced the tax on small engines in China and they announced that tax rate in September. And that took effect October 1. And so it was not being inconceivable that people deferred purchases of small cars because you know that the tax rate was going to drop from 10% to 5% on October 1. So we saw September sales in China were actually up about, I think 3% if I remember right. And in October, we have a pretty good view of what’s happening with our customers. Our order book looked pretty much just in time delivery. And we are seeing moderately improved deliveries to our customers. Of course, we are performing better than the industry. So we are still expecting automotive sales in China to be up modestly in that 1% to 3% kind of range. If you look at our other businesses, there was some initial destocking after the Tianjin “explosion”. Most of that has worked its way through the system now because what happened is people were concerned about holding inventory for things like marine coatings, refinished coatings, all that has been moderated. And we see those order books continuing to get better. So I would tell you that starting mid-September, we started to see that improvement and it’s continued in early part of October.
Frank Sklarsky: Alright, that’s very helpful. And I do appreciate the raising of the amount that you are going to spend on other M&A or share buyback. You raised the lower end there and I think in response to Mr. Robert’s question, you said that you are not really seeing the multiples come down on the M&A front, so would that suggest that we might preferentially go towards the share buyback route. And having said that and asking the question, obviously the stock is materially below the 52-week high or even though the last yearly average, how are your thoughts about splitting between those two uses of cash?
Michael McGarry: Frank, let me clarify. I said yet. The acquisitions hadn’t yet reflected that. So let’s be clear on that. Secondly, we have always said that acquisitions are always preferred. They are more accretive than buying back our stock. So that’s always our first preference. But we are going to protect the shareholders value. And if we don’t see the acquisitions coming through, then we will take that money and buyback the stock. So we want to continue to do both and our first preference is always acquisitions.
Frank Sklarsky: Frank and I think it’s safe to assume that as we go through the fourth quarter, you can expect that we will continue to deploy cash in the quarter to either one or both of those initiatives as we did $900 million through the third quarter. So we are already on pace to exceed, have to midpoint by the end of this year, so all the more reason to raise that range. But we will continue to deploy cash in the quarter.
Frank Mitsch: Thank you very much.
Michael McGarry: Thanks Frank.
Frank Sklarsky: Thank you, Frank.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Arun Viswanathan: Yes. Thanks guys. So I guess I just wanted ask you your confidence level on a couple of things. So going forward Q4 and 2016, you have a lot of organic growth initiatives, do you expect that, that would potentially drive a positive kind of volume growth picture in general industrial or auto OEM or are those kind of more dependent on market development?
Michael McGarry: Arun, I would tell you that we are expecting continued organic growth. Let me give you some reasons why we believe that. First of all, as you know we sold our one glass facility and that was in – in the end of the third quarter last year. So you will start to see that as a positive. Comex will then flip from an acquisition to organic growth in the fourth quarter. We close on that in November. We continue to see positive growth in our automotive business. Packaging continues to do well. Our refinished business with the water-based technology continues to grow and that’s a slower growth given the fact that that’s volume challenged market with the new technology out there. But we are continuing to grow in that regard. And the one area that I would say is still a question mark is where we are in the cycle is heavy-duty equipment, it’s been down. I would expect that to at some point reach the bottom. And then that would start to turn. And we talked about packaging being very good as well. So I think overall, you are going to see a return to more organic growth.
Frank Sklarsky: And the other thing going in our favor quite honestly is the fact that inventories in the system are at very reasonable levels, whether it’s the U.S. automotive business of 160 days at current sales rates. Packaging, as Michael said we will continue to pick up new business from our technology based offerings there. And then I mean in China, because of the recent production rates have been below recent sales rates, those inventories are coming back in line in the field too. So we don’t really have to go through anymore rationalization of inventories if things stayed reasonably healthy in the end markets that includes U.S. architectural.
Arun Viswanathan: Okay, great. And just looking at the slides, it looks like obviously North America was challenged in Q4, a lot of destocking there. But you sounded slightly more positive on Europe, can you just help us understand a little bit more detail on what you are seeing in Europe?
Michael McGarry: Yes. So we will start first of all with the automotive business. As you know, sales have been better than builds. And that’s obviously a good thing going forward. We are also seeing a pickup in a number of countries. Southern Europe is obviously coming off a very low base. But it’s getting better as well. And then we saw a pickup in our architectural business in the Benelux. And of course, we have always seeing good growth in Germany as well as the UK. And although the Eastern European region has been a little choppy mostly up, that’s been good. The only one that’s really down of course is Russia. Russia continues to be down nearly 30% in a number of segments. So that economy is clearly challenge. And then we have been gaining share in the protective market in Europe as well. So that’s been a positive force all along. And then the last thing I would say is that our – we are building a new silica plant in Europe and that facility will be starting up. And we have a very good demand for the new products, industry leading new technology coming out of that facility.
Frank Sklarsky: And Arun, the one area we haven’t talked about previously in the call is South America. For us, it’s about 3% of our sales. We do see challenges in South America as Michael alluded to in his prepared remarks. We don’t see that returning to growth certainly in the near-term.
Arun Viswanathan: Okay. And just to clarify, you said in the past recently that around 10% or so of your businesses are the ones that are kind of in that challenged area. Is that still a fair characterization or is there any kind of sensitivity around that?
Vince Morales: Again, I would say South America, about 3% of our sales. We have framed architectural Canada for you at about $500 million. Those will be the two very sensitive. If you combine Russia, Ukraine, Africa, you may be get another 2% or 3% max.
Frank Sklarsky: And of course, the Comex business is doing extremely well and then it will be translated to organic growth. For 2016, they continue to open stores at a very healthy pace. So that will also help us out in the organic growth rate.
Michael McGarry: And I guess, Arun, this is Michael. The one thing I would add at the end is France. France is still a challenge market for us. But at some point, we do feel confident that’s going to have to turn around. And so I would tell you that’s probably why we are more optimistic when you put all these things together.
Arun Viswanathan: Okay, thanks.
Michael McGarry: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA. Please proceed.
Nils Wallin: Good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. Back on North American architectural, you didn’t mention performance at the stores, so what did volume do in your company-owned stores?
Michael McGarry: Yes. Same-store sales were modestly negative. We have come off of a, I don’t know, 7 or 8 positive comps in a row, including Q1, Q2 of this year. Most of that was Canada. We have talked about the modest paint season. And then I would remind you that our PMC, most of our PMC in North America runs through our stores. As you know, the oil business has been certainly under a lot of pressure. And so that’s the way I would characterize that.
Frank Sklarsky: And PMC, just for everybody is protected on marine coatings.
Nils Wallin: So if we remove the store numbers from the other channels in North American architectural, does that mean that those other channels were actually down more than high single-digits?
Frank Sklarsky: Slightly more, because the stores were just slightly negative.
Nils Wallin: Okay, thanks. And then just on Canada, I mean, obviously, we understand GDP issues there, but housing still continues to be strong. So, what – is it some other channel that’s affecting the demand for architectural paint?
Vince Morales: No, Nils. I mean, we have said for many, many years that architectural typically tracks closer to GDP than anything. And there is a house build market and a house repaint market. The repaint market is typically 5 times to 6 times larger than the house build market. So, the repaint market is not trapped I guess in new home sales. And that’s the one that drives the volume at the end of the day.
Michael McGarry: We would say that paint in Canada is 80% repaint.
Nils Wallin: Understood. That’s helpful. And then just finally, Michael, you did speak about leveraging your asset base. Obviously, you have got some pretty significant size in your assets across the globe and doing that through distribution and supply chain? What does that – what would that translate in terms of margin accretion over a three or five-year period?
Michael McGarry: I think that’s a little early to answer that question. I think the way to think about it is we have major shared service facilities in Europe and Asia. Now with the Comex one, we will be able to add additional one in Latin America. We are starting up. We have put in a new resin facility in Brazil. We have a new facility that we expanded actually in China. So, that will drive lower cost in our automotive and industrial businesses there. And then we are also moving more of our production in Europe from West to East. So that will add additional benefits. So, I think that’s the way I would get you to kind of frame your question.
Nils Wallin: Thanks very much.
Frank Sklarsky: Thank you, Nils.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed.
Ghansham Panjabi: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Michael, I know it’s early, but looking out to 2016, can you just give us some of the various puts and takes related to some of the bigger businesses in your portfolio just from a fundamental standpoint maybe starting with the North American architectural and then also auto OEM?
Michael McGarry: Okay. North American architectural, I would say that we are going to probably have the same opinion we had this year, which is low single-digits growth for that business. So, we are going to continue to stay there. Automotive, it continues to be a very strong market for us. That’s been a good one. Our refinish business in North America, we are gaining share with our water-based technology. That’s a positive. Aerospace has been moderating growth, but continues – we continue to get new content on the planes and with the acquisitions that we have added that Cuming Microwave would be one. That would be another positive. When you move to Europe, I would tell you that again I would say that it’s probably going to be modest in that low single-digits kind of range. We continue to do well in our automotive space there. Our packaging space continues to pick up business. So, that’s good for us. When you look at some of the other businesses, probably the bright spot is our protective business. We have a new industry leading technology on fire protection that has really done very well. On the negative side, obviously, you have – you are still going to have the challenges in Russia. We don’t see that going away moving to South America. As Vince mentioned earlier, we see that probably bottoming out. So, we don’t – we are not really excited about what we see down in Brazil, but we are aggressively taking cost out in Brazil. So, it’s not going to be a negative from that kind of standpoint. And then moving over to Asia, Southeast Asia has performed okay. India has been really solid. I would say they are in that 6%. So, if you ask what has the highest growth in Asia right now? It’s India. And then we still remain – because our business in China is predominantly for consumer-oriented stuff stays and what we make in China stays in China, it’s not for the export market. So, we are optimistic that China will continue to resume its growth. We know the Chinese government is very interested in the economy growing. They are taking a lot of right moves to have the economy growth. And we have benefited that it’s been one of our best markets and we expect that to continue to do well going forward.
Frank Sklarsky: Don’t forget the…
Ghansham Panjabi: Great, that’s helpful. And then specific to packaging, can you just sort of parse out the strong growth that you are seeing there geographically? I mean, it seems like you have seen a fair amount of success with the BPA non-intent. Is that spreading globally? And did that start to materialize in 3Q?
Michael McGarry: Well, the BPA non-intent win started in Europe. They have continued into the U.S. As you know or you may know, California has this proposition 65 out there. They have not taken a firm position yet. But our guess is that our folks in the U.S. will be much more interested in the BPA non-intent coatings going forward. So, that trend will accelerate. And as you know, we only had 3% market share inside the can. And so since this is a once in a generation or multi-generation for some of these things opportunity, we are going to be at a higher presence inside the can than we have ever been in the past. So, that would be a positive for us overall.
Ghansham Panjabi: Okay. And then just one final one for Frank if I could, just on working capital, Frank, for ‘15, just given how dynamic the raw material environment has been, how should we think about that for 2015? Thanks so much.
Frank Sklarsky: Yes. Our goal on working capital obviously is to bring that down by 100 basis points a year. We have seen a little bit of slow pay recently, but we will get that back down by the end of the year. And we do have some relatively aggressive inventory goals for the teams. We are making great progress on that. But that would be our overall goal is to keep bringing that down by about 100 basis points. And it’s probably the largest opportunity in inventory by keep working on the receivables. Payables are in pretty decent shape. I was just going to add one more thing to what Michael was saying on the growth prospect for 2016. Remember, a lot of the acquisitions that we have done this year at $400 million worth of cash deployed in acquisitions, the revenue associated with that is only a small portion of what the full year impact is or will be for 2016, so in between $400 million and $500 million of revenue associated with acquisitions, excluding the base Comex business. That’s over and above the base Comex business. We will hit in full stride next year. And you can make any assumptions you like in terms of the profitability of those businesses, but that’s also going to be accretive to our top line along with the EBITDA that goes with that.
Ghansham Panjabi: Okay, perfect. Thanks so much.
Frank Sklarsky: Thanks.
Michael McGarry: Thank you, Ghansham.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Matt Gingrich: Hi guys. This is Matt Gingrich on for Vincent. I was wondering if you could speak to the phasing of sell-through in U.S. quarter on a month-by-month basis?
Michael McGarry: On a month-by month basis I would tell you that we started to see the destocking start in August and by the middle to the end of September it was over. So that's the way I would think about that.
Matt Gingrich: Okay, great. And then in terms of how sales trended in your dedicated paint stores, what did you see there?
Michael McGarry: Actually, in the dedicated paint stores, it was pretty, I would say consistent through the quarter. Although near the end of September, our comps were marginally better than what they were earlier in the quarter. And then they have started to be in October as I mentioned, virtually identical to what we had in the 4Q of last year.
Matt Gingrich: Would that be mid single-digits?
Michael McGarry: Yes – no, it’s low single-digits positive.
Matt Gingrich: Okay. Thanks guys.
Frank Sklarsky: Thank you, Matt.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna. Please proceed.
Don Carson: I guess a question going into next year, what kind of gross margin momentum you think you have from raws, because obviously in the first half of the year, you are going to have some relatively easy comps. You are still expecting some good gross margin expansion in the first half of the year?
Michael McGarry: Don, I would tell you that we are going to continue to work with our suppliers to pull through the savings. And so I would say it’s going to be modest. Our goal here is to continue to pull those through. We still see weakness in the TiO2 market. We still think it’s oversupplied. And then clearly, we haven’t talked about Henan Billions. Yet surprisingly, we have made it 55 minutes in the call and not one question about it. So I will go ahead and since everybody is interested and tell you that the first set of samples we got from the particle size was too large. The second set of samples we got from them were too small, so now they are dialing it in. We expect to be buying commercial quantities of TiO2 from Henan Billions sometime late in the fourth quarter. So overall, I would tell you we are still feeling like there is more savings to come. Plus, as you know we will have incremental restructuring savings in predominantly Europe but also Brazil and Australia from our restructuring program. That incrementally, throughout the year, will add up to about $60 million to $75 million. Obviously, it accelerates as it goes throughout the year 2016. But that will be another positive.
Don Carson: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, Don. And our next question comes from the line of Jim Sheehan with SunTrust. Please proceed.
Jim Sheehan: Thank you. Could you talk about your exposure to commercial construction and what you are seeing in both your coatings and your glass businesses in that market?
Michael McGarry: Yes. Commercial construction is obviously more important to our glass business than it is to our coatings business. Commercial construction has been slightly better. What the challenge there is actually the fabricators who make fabricate glass window units are, I would call them full. They are – their backlog on fabricated units continues to be 6, 8, 10 weeks. So that’s been a challenge for the market. I would tell you that our glass business, as you can see has done pretty well. We have gotten price. We already had two price increases in that business this year. So that’s been a positive. And we continue to expect improvement again next year.
Jim Sheehan: And in EMEA, you had some positive volumes there. I think auto OEM was particularly strong, could you just comment on what your volume growth was in architectural coatings in Europe?
Michael McGarry: Architectural coatings were flat in Europe. And of course that varied. And also up in the UK, up in the Benelux, down in France, mostly up in Eastern Europe but not every Eastern European country was up, so net-net flat because France is our largest architectural coatings market.
Jim Sheehan: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Hocevar with North Coast Research. Please proceed.
Kevin Hocevar: Hi, good afternoon everybody. A question on the – going back to the cash deployment bumped up to the low end of the range and $2 billion to $2.5 billion and you say at least $2 billion to $2.5 billion, so implying it could go above that. I guess what would it take for you to go above that range would necessitate M&A or if the stock price was attractive enough, would you consider repurchasing above that level?
Frank Sklarsky: As Michael said, the pace of share repurchase, obviously depends upon the not only the pipeline of M&A, but also the timing of which you actually deploy and close the deals. I guess what we are saying is we are confident enough in the cash generating capability of the business and we are very comfortable upping the midpoint of that range so that we are now at $2 billion to $2.5 billion. And the fact that we have already kind of exceeded the pace of the prior range by the end of the third quarter and expect to continue to deploy cash in the fourth quarter. But as we lookout in 2016, we got a good pipeline of M&A. So the chances are we will be doing more deals next year and be supplementing it with share repurchases because we are starting of the year – we ended the third quarter with $1.4 billion of cash. Q4 is generally a good quarter for cash generation. And so we have the confidence that we will continue to deploy and we would earn value for the shareholders. And we will just continue that into next year and see where it goes. But we could do more share repurchase. Our preference is to do M&A. That will be the first priority. But you will see both of that as we go through the fourth quarter and more primarily, M&A in the 2016 timeframe.
Kevin Hocevar: Okay, great. And just also, you mentioned an expectation to resume organic growth in the fourth quarter and FX impacts to mitigate a little bit. And also you closed LJF after the end of the second quarter. So do you think that the top line decline that we saw in the third quarter is kind of it will stop there and will resume top line growth in the fourth quarter?
Michael McGarry: Yes. Kevin, I do believe that’s going to happen. We closed LJF on October 1. We had four acquisitions that basically closed in the third quarter plus we will have Comex that flips into the organic side. So I think that’s all positive.
Kevin Hocevar: Okay, good. Thanks guys.
Frank Sklarsky: Thank you, Kevin.
Operator: And our final question comes from the line of Dmitry Silverstein with Longbow Research. Please proceed.
Dmitry Silverstein: Good afternoon. Thanks for fitting me in here. A couple of questions, a lot of them have already been addressed. But I just want to understand on the China impact from the automotive, how – like how long do you typically read the sales number in China. In other words, we are seeing sales decline in the Chinese auto, I am assuming production is declining this quarter to adjust for that. So the fact that you didn’t see much of a decline in the third quarter, is that just a delay and you will see some of it in the fourth or are you more real time with the sales number at the retail level?
Michael McGarry: Well, Dmitry the sales to the customer decline in June, July, August and then turned back positive in December. They were up 3%. Builds inventories were coming down in that same period. Right now, inventory is basically at the same level it was last year. So they are in very good shape from that standpoint. We think they are about a little bit over 40 days, which is typical for them. And then right now, as I mentioned earlier on the call the October sales are trending up. We basically supply in real time. We get orders, let’s call them 28 days in advance of what I would call a pre-look and then they are firmed up 14 days in advance. So right now, we have a pretty good feel for how October is going to turn out. And I think overall, we would tell you that it should be marginally up.
Dmitry Silverstein: Got it. So would you describe in terms of your sales cadence in June, July, August and September was pretty much what we saw at a retail level in China. So is that just coincidence or are you – or is there is no lag between demand for your coating products for automotive and the sale of automotive to a retailer?
Frank Sklarsky: No, Dmitry. We are very closely aligned because they did take inventory down. Have they not taken inventory down I think we would see that lag effect, but the industry took inventory down, commensurate with the sales decline in real time.
Dmitry Silverstein: Got it. Okay. So that’s good to know. Second question on the – excuse me, on the raw material benefit, you talked about taking six months to nine months to get some of these propylene, ethylene derivatives, which I am assuming you are mainly talking about resins here down in price, it’s been about that long since oil really started to selloff and since propylene and ethylene pricing started to tumble. So are you starting to see lower prices in resins on a year-over-year basis that’s going to help you with the declines in TiO2 to really drive your margins certainly into the first half of next year?
Michael McGarry: Well, as we said, we expected modest benefit with the benefit to grow throughout the year. We are seeing that in our numbers. As we said in the past, the benefit is muted in non-U.S. region simply because oil is traded in dollars around the world. So, when you go to Europe or you go to some of these emerging markets, the currency deltas have eaten into most of the raw material impact. So again, we are pulling this through our value chain. We feel we are doing a good job at it. We do have another quarter here to go and we are certainly talking to our suppliers on a daily basis.
Frank Sklarsky: So, as Vince is saying here, as you see the raw material benefits come through, the pace of that may not change significantly going from Q3 to Q4 to Q1, but it will be more evident to the bottom line, because there will not be so much offset from a currency headwind as that mitigates starting in Q4 versus what we have seen is very high levels recently.
Dmitry Silverstein: Right. So you say you are not so much looking at acceleration of benefits as the diminishment of the headwinds that will make those benefits more apparent?
Michael McGarry: The other thing we would mention though is that where you do see a bit of a headwind on raw materials because of the exchange rate is places like Brazil, really the small percentage of our revenue in Canada, because the exchange does cause some of those U.S. dollar based inputs to be a little bit higher.
Dmitry Silverstein: Okay. And then one final question on pricing, architectural market in North America you talked about pricing being essentially flat and the similar expectations for 2016, which makes sense. In terms of the coatings side of the business as opposed to the architectural side of the business both in North America and globally, which tends to be dealing with customers that are looking for some pass-through of raw material prices. What’s the pricing environment like in some of the general industrial coatings and perhaps some of the automotive aftermarket and some of those areas, let’s say, outside of high-value proposition like automotive OEM coatings? Are you starting to see either lower prices or more customer insistence on price pass-through or are they still happy with getting the product from you at the price they got it last year?
Michael McGarry: Dmitry, I really don’t want to get into parsing each of the different businesses, because we roll out new products and we have older products. What we have been consistent in saying is that the pricing environment is flat and we expect that to continue.
Dmitry Silverstein: Not just in paints, but in coatings as well?
Michael McGarry: Correct.
Dmitry Silverstein: Thank you very much.
Frank Sklarsky: Thanks, Dmitry.
Operator: That concludes questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Vince Morales for closing remarks.
Vince Morales: I just want to once again thank everybody for their time and interest in PPG. Both Scott Minder and myself will be available to take questions after the call. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today’s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. So, you all have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q2 2015 PPG Industries earnings conference call. My name is Chris, and I will be your conference moderator for today. [Operator Instructions] And at this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Vince Morales. Sir, you may proceed.
Vincent Morales: Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. Again, this is Vince Morales, PPG's Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG Industries, and welcome you to our second quarter 2015 financial results teleconference. Joining me on the call from PPG today is Chuck Bunch, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Michael McGarry, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Frank Sklarsky, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our comments relate to financial information released Thursday, July 16, 2015. I will remind everyone that we posted detailed commentary and relating presentation slides on the Investor center of our website at www.ppg.com. These slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide supplemental support to the opening comments Chuck will make shortly. Following Chuck's perspective on the company's results for the quarter, we will move to a extended Q&A session. Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company's current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. Today's presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix materials of the presentation, which are again available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC. And now, let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch.
Charles Bunch: Thank you, Vince, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to thank you for your continued interest in PPG. Today, we reported record second quarter 2015 financial results. This included record second quarter net sales of $4.1 billion and all-time record adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $1.67. Our adjusted earnings per share in the second quarter were up $0.25 or 18% versus the prior-year record. Year-to-date our compounded adjusted EPS is up 20% over prior year, which is on top our compounded EPS growth rate in the past three years of about 25%. This consistent and continued performance reflects the benefits of our portfolio transformation, the tangible customer benefits from our leading products and technologies, our continued diligence on aggressive cost structure management and the measurable benefits from our ongoing cash deployment. Overall, I am pleased with our consistently strong financial performance, as we continue to manage through inconsistent economic conditions in major global regions and in various end-use markets we supply. In the second quarter, our aggregate company sales volumes grew 1% year-over-year, similar to the first quarter, reflecting modest global economic growth. Regionally, in comparison with last quarter, our growth rates improved in Europe and the U.S., moderated in Asia and remained unfavorable in South America. From a segment perspective, we achieved all-time record segment income in both coating segments and our glass segment delivered the largest year-over-year earnings improvement. This record business performance was despite significant currency translation impacts, the sales and earnings stemming from weakened foreign currencies. These currencies, principally the euro as well as others in the Americas and in emerging regions, unfavorably impacted our sales by about $320 million or more than 7%, and reduced our pre-tax earnings by $40 million or about $0.11 per share. Absent the foreign currency impacts, our adjusted EPS would have been up 25% year-over-year. Based on current foreign currency exchange rates, we expect the unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts to moderate beginning in the third quarter, as foreign currencies begin to weaken in the second half of 2014 and due to the seasonality of our businesses. Given these factors, we now expect currency translation to reduce our full year sales by $1 billion and pre-tax earnings by $100 million. These ranges are slightly more favorable than our prior forecast as we lower the projected unfavorable currency translation impact on sales by about $100 million and on pre-tax earnings by about $10 million, contributing to our record coating segment income in the quarter with volume growth in several of our businesses including automotive OEM, packaging and automotive refinish coatings. We grew at or above industry growth rates in these businesses driven by customer adoption of our leading technology. In addition, we have maintained our aggressive operational and cost focus as we achieved lower manufacturing and SG&A cost year-over-year. To that end, we initiated an additional proactive restructuring plan targeting further system-wide productivity and cost reduction actions. We anticipate full year savings from this program of $100 million to $105 million when fully implemented in 2017 with $15 million to $20 million of these savings expected in 2015. Cash deployment was also a significant driver of segment income growth in the second quarter. This includes sales and earnings from our recent acquisitions of Comex and several smaller companies. Let me comment quickly on Comex. We remain very excited about this acquisition. The performance of the acquired business over the first eight months has been excellent. Businesses sales grew organically by a high-single digit percentage in the quarter versus the prior-year pre-acquisition quarter and we remain on track for full year high-single digit percentage organic sales growth. During the quarter, we increased our initial Comex cost synergy targets and now expect to achieve $45 million to $50 million in annual run rate savings by the end of 2016. In addition, we announced new acquisition related revenue synergy targets, which include capitalizing on the extensive Comex Mexican distribution platform for legacy PPG Industrial and Performance Coatings products and further leveraging the Comex and PPG participation in Central America, simply stated both strategically and commercially Comex remains well ahead of our original expectation. We also announced or closed several other acquisitions during the quarter. In addition to acquisition spending, we deployed $150 million of cash in the quarter for the repurchase of 1.3 million shares of PPG stock. We remain committed to and on track with our previously announced earnings-accretive cash deployment targets. Year-to-date we have closed or announced business acquisition with an aggregate purchase price of about $400 million and we repurchased $350 million of PPG stock. Looking ahead, we anticipate global economic growth to continue, but to remain uneven. We are working to continue to capitalize on the modest growth aided by our global footprint and participation across each of the major coatings product categories. Additionally, we anticipate increased financial benefits from a lower cost structure and higher earnings leverage on incremental volume growth. In summary, we once again delivered record financial performance in the quarter. This performance was broad-based across segments and regions as customers continue to adopt our leading products and our strategy execution and cash deployment are yielding benefit. We remain focused on operational execution and aggressive on cost management. Finally, we expect disciplined earnings-accretive cash deployment to continue. This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG. And now, operator, would you please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
David Begleiter: Chuck, just on the gross margin in the quarter, can you talk about the year-over-year growth maybe, I had a little bit higher assumption, I know a lot of things go into it. But talking about the benefit you see from raw materials, and should we see a bigger gross margin expansion in Q3 versus Q2?
Charles Bunch: Well, as we stated, David, volume growth has still been muted. We are still seeing positive growth across the regions and businesses, but as we've talked we have some uneven performance across both regions and businesses. So volume growth has not been as high as a full economic expansion would deliver. The raw material cost, as we've stated, are modestly lower than the previous year. So we're talking about low-to-mid single-digit decreases, depending on regions. And combined with other cost inflation and modest volume growth, we're seeing accretion in margins across all our segments. So we're pleased with the performance, but again we're looking for a little more consistent economic performance and currency stabilization to deliver higher volume growth as we go through the year.
David Begleiter: And Chuck, just on, there has been some discussion over China auto decline rate that that market is slowing. Discuss your exposure both in China as well as via exports to the China auto OEM coatings market?
Charles Bunch: Well, China, it's the largest automotive OEM market in the world. The builds are still expected to be over 20 million this year and have growth. We've seen over -- certainly the first quarter we were talking about 7%-plus kind of growth rates for the full year, and we saw that in the first quarter. We saw those growth rates moderate a little bit here, as we went through the second quarter. So now, as we look at some of the forecast for the full year, we're still looking for solid volume growth in builds in China, but more in the area of 3% to 5%, maybe not at that 7% level that we came into the year with. We continued, as you know, to outperform in terms of volume growth, and we're still optimistic globally on the automotive OEM market. We've seen a very solid performance here in North America, continued strength. And we are also seeing, especially in Western Europe as part of our EMEA region, we've seen a return to growth here in the first half. And we expect that trend to continue in the second half of this year. So we remain optimistic and quite positive on the global OEM automotive market, even if we have pockets out there like Brazil or Russia, where we've seen lower builds here in 2015.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities.
Frank Mitsch: Good afternoon, gentlemen, and I guess congratulations are in order. Congratulations, Michael, on the move up; and congratulations Chuck on the pending retirement, and obviously a hell of a decade run as CEO; and of course, Vince, congratulations on your recent promotion; and Frank, congratulations on these results. I think I pretty much covered everything there. One of the things in looking through the release that I didn't see was any mention of weather impacts on your North American architectural coatings business. Did you notice any material impact due to the above-normal wet weather? And what impact may that have come Q3, Q4?
Michael McGarry: First of all, appreciated. Second, Chuck is not going anywhere. So don't be so quick about that comment. I would tell you that overall the performance in architectural, you saw our comments about low-single digits. We do have some impact from weather, it would be highly speculative for us to try and tell you how much that was. We were pleased. Our DIY business did have a good quarter. And I would tell you that, at this point, hopefully things from a weather standpoint will get better. But we do run a global architectural business, and I tell our team, whether you might have challenges in one area, you probably have opportunities in the other. So all-in-all, I'm pleased.
Frank Mitsch: And also staying with the North America, you mentioned packaging was a fast grower, auto OEM was among the faster growers. But auto refinish was also mentioned as getting strong growth. Can you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing there? What's driving that and where do we go from here?
Charles Bunch: Well, Frank, I'll take that, and I think one of the key indicators for growth in the automotive refinish business is miles driven. And so we had I think with these lower gasoline prices here and around the world, especially in North America, you are getting higher miles driven and that is helping this business. We also had some of this weather that, if we talk about it in the first quarter, we had severe winter; the second quarter some of this rainy weather, it will drive additional economic growth. And our business has continued to perform very well across all of the different distribution channels and collision shops. Our team, especially with the water-based technologies and those continuing conversion rates, where we feel that we have industry-leading technology, that continue to drive our growth in the business and help us maintain a leading position.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.
Bob Koort: Chuck, I wanted to ask a little more, and you have a chart in there that Vince and team put together, showing the volume changes sequentially you saw for the last year-and-a-half and maybe the Latin American piece in particular is really quite jarring. Do you think this is a one-off issue? Are there particular end-markets that maybe went to the stinker here? And what's the outlook as you look forward for volume in those emerging markets?
Charles Bunch: Well, we have, I would say, in this chart, if you look at the deceleration of some of the growth, I have mentioned a couple of the markets that were unfavorable. So all of South America, including Brazil, was unfavorable in terms of volume and several other emerging markets. And I gave the example of Russia, as an example, where we saw a contraction here in the first half of the year. I would say that our volumes in China and India continue to be positive. Although, we have seen with this discussion on automotive OEM and a few of the other industrial markets, we've seen positive volumes in China, but certainly not at the level that we had last year. So I would attribute this more to the negative growth in a couple of emerging regions, but China was also lower overall, especially on the industrial and construction related side.
Bob Koort: And you had mentioned some changes in raw materials. I was wondering if you could talk about what's gone in pricing. Are there any extremes in your pricing or is generally flat, pretty accurate across the entire portfolio?
Charles Bunch: This is pricing of the raw materials we buy or the pricing on our end-use markets?
Bob Koort: Yes, I guess, I'm more curious about your big, tough, mean procurement guys on the customer side, seeing what's happened in deflation and maybe asking for their pound of flesh?
Charles Bunch: Well, as we've talked, we're trying to make sure that we're getting the benefit of any raw material declines here in our coatings raw material space. As I mentioned, cost overall have come down in raw material cost. And we continue to have these dialogs, because as we went through the second quarter, what was happening is we had oil prices coming back up, as we started the second quarter and moved through. But recently over the last few weeks to a month, we've seen now those trends reversing. So we continue in active discussion with our raw material suppliers. We expect them to share that throughout their value or customer chain. So we're looking for benefits to continue and potentially get a little stronger, as we go into the second half of the year.
Michael McGarry: And Bob, our selling prices to our customers, as you saw in our presentation materials, we've had flat selling prices, which was our base case coming into the year. There wasn't much on the way, either side of that for any big customer group or any big business differential. So flat pricing is what we predicted, and it's pretty holistic through our portfolio.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.
Mehul Dalia: It's actually Mehul Dalia sitting in for Ghansham. In packaging, would you say growth momentum has accelerated for you? And do you have any customer feedback that you can share on your non-BPA offering as it relates to Europe?
Michael McGarry: Our packaging business continues to accelerate with wins both in the U.S. as well as Europe. And it's being driven by our new technologies or our BPA-free technologies. And the customers are quite pleased with the new technology as we roll it out.
Mehul Dalia: And what do you estimate the market growth was in Mexico year-to-date? And can you split your Comex sales growth between comparable stores versus maybe new stores by concessionaires year-to-date?
Charles Bunch: Sure. Let me just tackle Mexico. So the GDP in Mexico has decline moderately. It's closer to 2% range versus where they originally had it closer to 3%. Our business, as you saw in the commentary, growing high-single digits. We've opened up 80 new concessionaire locations already. For the first six months, we have a target to open up a 170 locations. So we are certainly growing quicker than the market. We've also launched some new products that we think will also be very favorably received in the marketplace. And then in Central America, we've launched Glidden in a number of locations in Central America that has also been favorably received. So we're happy with what we see there.
Mehul Dalia: And just one last one, in the release you called out early 2Q weakness in Industrial Coatings. What do you think was behind that? And how are volumes in Industrial Coatings as a whole trending in 3Q thus far?
Charles Bunch: So the biggest challenge in Industrial is the heavy-duty equipment market. I think we called out that it's a down low-double digit, so that's a challenge. I would say the rest of the business is doing relatively well, but that's an area that we're paying close attention to.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of PJ Juvekar with Citi.
PJ Juvekar: A question on your Lowe's business. As HGTV paint was introduced by Sherwin, has that had an impact on your sales at Lowe's?
Michael McGarry: PJ, as you know, it's difficult for us to comment about a specific customer like that. We did call out that we had positive low-single digit comps in DIY segment. We have very strong relationships with all our DIY customers, and I would say there were no surprises in the second quarter.
PJ Juvekar: And then Henan Billions is producing chloride TiO2 that's based on your technology, but I guess there are some reports that people are saying that maybe that technology is not working as well as people thought, and the plant is not running at full rates. I was just wondering if you could give us some color on that.
Michael McGarry: I'm not sure where that's originating. I'll just tell what we know. The plant is mechanically complete. All phases of the plant have been operational. We have samples from the plant, and both in China as well as in the U.S. We are fully working with them. We think the plant will be producing regular commercial grades sometime late in the second half of the year, and I would tell you we're on target with everything we've projected so far.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan.
Arun Viswanathan: I wanted to I guess delve into the North American architectural business a little bit more. You cited low-single digits, but weakness in the dealer channel. So was your stores business up mid-single digits? And are you starting to see some benefits of the overhaul and restructuring over the last couple of years and potentially some share gains?
Michael McGarry: Arun, I would tell you that our stores were in the low-single digits. The dealers in the first quarter were up and in the second quarter were slightly down. So through the first six months, the dealers are actually positive. We're doing slightly better than that in Canada. And I would just say that we certainly don't want to spend a lot of time talking about the weather, but it certainly was not helpful at all.
Charles Bunch: Arun, the dealer channel is our smallest channel, so on a averaging affect it has the smallest impact on the total business.
Arun Viswanathan: And what about the share gains, any thoughts on, if that could continue, or if you could saw any of that, or how do you look at the contractor channel? I mean, are you guys getting any uplift there?
Charles Bunch: I don't think there's many meaningful shares change in that regard.
Arun Viswanathan: And then final follow-up, I guess, in Europe you had some comments that you did see some slightly better sequential improvement in architectural. Maybe you can just help us understand what's going on there, and then also in your Industrial businesses in Europe?
Michael McGarry: So starting with architectural, France is our largest market, so our retail business in France has now positive comps. However, our larger trade business has negative comps, but much less, so it's getting back almost near flat now. Strong performance in the U.K. and Ireland, and although the Benelux was flat in Q2, we did see a noticeable pickups earning in late May. So I would say that's good. Central Europe was also had solid growth. As far as the industrial businesses, we've already talked about automotive doing better than the builds. So that was the positive comp force.
Arun Viswanathan: And anything else on general industrial in Europe?
Charles Bunch: General industrial I would call that relatively flat to no significant positives or negatives that I would call out.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nils Wallin.
Nils Wallin: You noted strength in protective and marine globally, but obviously also you saw some gains too in the U.S., so it's kind of a two-part question. Since you didn't break out it between protective and marine, is it right to assume that it's mainly coming from the protective side? And then the second part, unfortunately a weather question is how is it doing so well in North America, given the weather impact that probably had some negative comps for you?
Michael McGarry: On the protective side, yes, there is more wins on the protective side than the marine side, but our China business did very well on the marine side, so a nice win there. Overall, in the U.S. and Canada, good strong wins on the protective side. Also, I would tell you we have launched a number of new, what we call advantage products, and fire protection, as well as we did the Hi-Temp Coatings acquisition earlier this year, that has also driven some growth. We've been able to leverage that globally as well. And so overall, even though the oil business is down, net-net we are up in that segment, so we're pleased with how we're performing in that regard.
Frank Sklarsky: And Nils, the only thing I would add to that is Europe also had a decent performance. There is some additional dry-dock work taking place in some of the ports in Europe, so that had some sequential and year-over-year improvement too.
Nils Wallin: And just more, I guess, a question for Frank. It sounds like this year you've already done around $750 million or so in the cash deployment. Does that mean that $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion, you're halfway there, or is this $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion you're talking about incremental to the $750 million you've already done so far?
Frank Sklarsky: We still want to maintain that guidance of $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion for 2015 and 2016 combined. I guess, what we would say is we've closed or announced $400 million in acquisition so far, there's still additional pipeline there, so I anticipate more activity over the next 18 months. I've done $350 million of share repurchase, so as you say, kind of closed, announced or repurchased $750 million, the guidance we would give is, the overall guidance is still in place, what we would have expected that at a minimum to achieve at least that midpoint of that guidance for the two-year period, so we're very comfortable with where we are. Continued good pipeline in the M&A space and also that share of purchase will continue to be part of our capital cash allocation strategy, so we're pretty comfortable with the guidance and off to a good start on that.
Nils Wallin: And just, sorry if I may, is the pipeline levered or exposed to any particular market more than any other?
Frank Sklarsky: There are variety of opportunities across the regions and across our portfolios as you can see with some of the things we did, the closed or announced so far this year, it runs the gamut between our various businesses and its taken place in a couple of different region, so we have a pipeline that really spans the globe and spans the different segments.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.
Jeff Zekauskas: I'm sort of surprised that your gross margins aren't higher, in that your cost of goods sold is down about 1% for the year in the quarter. And you would think that with your raw materials down low-to-mid-single digits, you would be doing better than that. And if you compare your results to your Cleveland competitor, I think their gross margin expanded 250 basis points. And even if you make some adjustments for acquisitions, and you go back a year, you still see a much larger gross margin progression. Is that the right way to look at it? Are there advantages to being in North America? And if you are more global you have some impediments? Are you satisfied with your gross margin?
Charles Bunch: I think from our perspective, we're trying to drive continuous improvement in all of our financial metrics. This year, unlike most years, we have a lot of puts and takes in our numbers. We have a very large acquisition. We have a lot of currency, differences on both sales, as well as cost of sales. You alluded to some changes in raw materials. So we've got a lot of puts and takes, so I don't know that in comparison year-over-year gets really difficult without each of those buckets. And we're not displeased with our performance. We'd certainly like to be as profitable as possible, but we do feel that we're executing very well operationally as well commercially on the sales front.
Frank Sklarsky: And I think if you look at the, what we call, our EBIT margins, EBITDA margin as we all refer to it for the business overall, we'd like to focus on that ROS, that business operating ROS. And if you look at it that way, we're over 150 basis points better Q2 over Q2. It's really a combination of a number of factors, whether it'd be all the inputs and the cost of goods sold, some favorable, and of course, we do have some annual modest improvements in salary and in wages across the globe. So good manufacturing, productivity improvement, G&A improvements, some benefits from the acquisitions that we've done, as well as some currency headwinds that Vince referred to. But overall, when you look at the overall ROS for the business, a nice improvement, and there are some puts and takes between COGS and SG&A, but on balance pretty pleased with the improvement.
Jeff Zekauskas: And then secondly, last year in the first half your North American business was maybe up in order of magnitude 5%, and this year it's roughly flat. What is it about North America this year that's so much weaker than North America last year in the first half?
Frank Sklarsky: I think, Jeff, you have a continued improvement of automotive OEM, but not at the same acceleration. It continues to be positive. So that is one of the businesses continued growing, but not at overall 5% level.
Charles Bunch: The other, as we talked in the release, Jeff, general industrial was much more benign this year than it was last year. And we did as we, this is a Q1 comp math, so we did have some architectural pipeline fills last year for new product wins last year that we're maintaining this year. But the pipeline fills or stocking for our customers did not recur.
Jeff Zekauskas: So do you think this is a 1% volume year for PPG or do you think that you can do -- are business conditions improving, or are they sort of steady-state?
Charles Bunch: I would say, the businesses are steady-state. There is still positive economic growth here. We have talked about some of the weakness in the overall market in architectural due to some weather events here in actually the first half, not just the rain in the second quarter, whereas most of the underlying economic indicators are still positives. So we have maintained a positive outlook for the second half of the year, and I think you'll see continued volume growth from last year in the U.S. and Canadian region.
Frank Sklarsky: Remember, Jeff, there is one other minor factor too, and it's in the Glass business, which is impacting that 1% of that effectively, sold our Mt. Zion facility, whereas you can see that the mix is greatly improving our business. So even though the volume and the topline is lower in that business, the profitability is greatly improved. So yes, that was not a huge factor, but a factor contributing to that year-over-year change in the growth rate.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS.
John Roberts: Frank, you just mentioned the Glass business. And again, the volume was down due to the plant closing, but it didn't seem to be affected much by weather. And given that's a U.S. OEM construction business I would've thought it would be one of the most affected businesses by weather?
Frank Sklarsky: Well, again, we're running at decent utilization levels, so profitability greatly improved; one plant coming out of the system, mix is improved, and as with commercial construction still not at back to levels pre-financial crisis. So very optimistic about the way that this looks for the rest of the year and looking forward, if we can get continued improvement on the commercial side that business will continue to perform well. Not as sensitive -- 
Charles Bunch: Not as sensitive, John, to whether its paint is, you'd still put up glass in like all inclement weather.
John Roberts: Actually, could you give us a little granularity on the auto OEM paint strengths either, is it largely more new wins, or is it better sell-through of previous wins? Or any regional color that you can give us on the outperformance now?
Charles Bunch: Well, we've continued to do well in our regions here and in the greater Europe as well as Asia. I would say that either it is more overall market growth, which has continued. In Europe, especially in Western Europe, you've seen growth of what we would call some of our customer base, especially among a broader base of the European manufacturers than we have been seeing over the last few years, and we have a good exposure across all of the manufacturers in Europe. So we're seeing some improvement in some of those European based manufacturers, the French and Italian manufacturers in particular they've had a better performance. And in China, I would say, there we continue to win more than our share of new plant startups in China especially, and so that's where we've continued to outperform the market. And that is more technology driven. The new compact processes that we've talked about over the last few years. The Chinese market both the domestic manufacturers and the global manufacturers in China are starting new plans with the most modern technologies of today. And this is where we are best positioned.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of James Sheehan with SunTrust Robinson and Humphrey.
James Sheehan: I was just wondering about the slowdown that's occurring in emerging markets. Do you expect this to impact growth in aerospace in the near and medium term?
Michael McGarry: I don't think that's going to have a material impact. Certainly, the general aviation market isn't help by the challenges in Russia or China; two markets that we're starting to emerge to buy general aviation planes. But overall, the aviation industry is doing quite well. In fact, they're returning their cost to capital. Right now, their profitability is up and people are traveling. So I would say that it's not going to be a material impact.
Charles Bunch: We also did see a decent growth in Asia-Pacific region aerospace in the second quarter. In addition to that, one of the things that's up-up, continued to drive outperform are some of the new technologies that we are deploying out to some of the major aircraft manufacturers.
Michael McGarry: And I would add for a final comment that we do another acquisition that closed July 1, Cuming Microwave. It's a business does classified defense products for radar-evading for both airplanes and as well as land vehicles. And that would be a contributor to the business in the third quarter as well.
James Sheehan: You noted some positive impact from working capital in the second quarter. Can you just comment on where you see working capital in the second half?
Charles Bunch: We continue to focus in on a couple of key areas. One, past-due receivables, we're making some good progress there, but more importantly in the area of supply chain efficiency and inventories. However, we saw several days improvement on the Performance Coatings space in the first half. And we have some additional improvements that we have targeted for the back half of the year. So I think it's safe to assume that we'll continue progress that we've made I think in the back half of the year. And expect that to continue, to improve, because we still know there's a little bit more in terms of number of days in the cash conversion cycle that we can improve on as compared to peer group. Jim, we've had consecutive years of 100 basis point improvement in our operating working capital. And that's our target again this year. We're made some improvement, but we're not where we want to be by yearend.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.
Vincent Andrews: Just one question for me, would you mind breaking out the FX impact to gross margins in the quarter?
Charles Bunch: Well, we have -- from an FX perspective we had $40 million of negative EBIT in the quarter, pre-tax EBIT. And most of that's going to be in the COGS line. There's some offset in the G&A line within the regions, but since we make most of the product where we deliver it, the vast majority of that impact, that $40 million to the bottomline is going to be in the COGS.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Don Carson.
Don Carson: Just going back to FX and sort of the interplay with ROS, so FX is about $0.25 year-to-date, if I add up the first two quarters, are you still thinking it's going to slow down in the second quarter and maybe be $0.35, $0.40? And from a ROS standpoint, you had mentioned in first quarter you didn't see much ROS benefit as you worked down high cost inventories. What benefit did you see in the second quarter? And as that accelerates in the second half, what sort of multiple would you expect that to be of the FX hit?
Charles Bunch: So Don, just sticking with the currency translation, we had our biggest impact we believe in Q2 for multiple reasons. One, it's our highest quarter seasonally, especially in architectural Europe. And secondarily, the currency rates began to weaken last year, the euro began to weaken last year, dollar currencies in Q3, so if you will, the comps currency-wise are bit easier in Q3. Seasonality is the bigger factor there. So we do expect moderation from the second quarter level in the back half of the year, and in Q4 the euro was markedly down versus Q3 last year. So again, weakening euro and other currencies last year give us reason for moderation going into the back half of this year. Frank, I don't know if you wanted that or comment on that as well?
Frank Sklarsky: I mean, that's under the assumptions that the rate stay where they were at the end of Q2. They weakened a little bit this morning based on some of the news out of Europe. But under the assumption that they stay where they are, we expect sequentially an improvement both in Q3 and Q4.
Michael McGarry: And on your raw material question, I think Chuck mentioned earlier that we saw some benefit in Q1. That benefit expanded a little bit in Q2, and we expect a modestly improved benefit in Q3 and Q4.
Don Carson: Then just a follow-up on acquisitions. What sort of in the average EBITDA that you've been paying? And how has that changed over the last year, are you seeing more competition for these properties and thus higher purchase multiples?
Charles Bunch: Well, I would say that the purchase multiples for our deals, they do vary depending on growth rates, region, performance of the business. I would say that on average, this year we have not paid at the same level as we paid last year. As an example, we did pay as you know the announced multiple of around 11 for Comex pre-synergies. And these are smaller deals in various regions. So I would say the multiples are around the same over the last 18 moths or so. I think it's again somewhat dependent on where we finished, I mean, the types of deals and what are the quality and the size of the businesses.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Eugene Fedotoff with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Eugene Fedotoff: Your European volumes were up 2% year-over-year. And in the past you sort of commented on incremental profits or incremental margins for Europe, given that you took some cost out there in the past couple of years. I was wondering if you can provide similar color for this quarter.
Frank Sklarsky: We're still holding to the general guideline that incrementals on European volume in the 30% to 40% range. That's really because of plenty of headroom in terms of the manufacturing capacity, and not only steady, but generally reduced SG&A as we complete our restructuring program around the globe. So that 30%, 40% is still a pretty good rule of thumb.
Eugene Fedotoff: And then just a follow-up on the protective coatings in North America. I don't know what your exposure is, like if it's significant, probably not to the, I guess, oilfield market or are you seeing any decline in the served markets due to the lower oil prices in North America and globally?
Michael McGarry: Yes, certainly, the oil market is softer, but the beauty is that we've been able to capture share in that segment, and that has been a positive for us overall. We do see oil weakness in Columbia, Mexico, Russia, some other places as well, but net-net this has been a good market for us.
Eugene Fedotoff: And just a last follow-up on Comex sales growth, high-single digit in the quarter and year-to-date. So it sounds like you should be or is that the right expectation, you should be towards the higher end of your mid-to-high single-digit sales growth guidance?
Michael McGarry: I'm sorry. Could you repeat the question? I'm sorry.
Eugene Fedotoff: Sure. Given high-single digits and Comex sales so far, I believe you said you expected sales to grow mid-to-high single-digits for 2015. So is it fair to assume that it's likely going to be at the high-end of that guidance?
Michael McGarry: I would tell you that historically what we told, we will grow 1.5x and 2x GDP. We are outperforming that right now. I'm comfortable that the team will continue to perform at the upper end of that guidance.
Charles Bunch: And just as a reminder for everybody, the seasonality of the Comex business, architectural Comex business, is a little different than the seasonality of our U.S. and Canadian businesses. For us, what we said is, Comex is about 20% in Q1, 25% in Q2 Q3 and 30% in Q4 in terms of their sales phasing. And that again is different than U.S./Canada business and Western European business we have.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Perrella with Bloomberg.
Christopher Perrella: A question on the China business. With Asian or Asian volumes mixed, but up, were there any end-markets where you saw declining volumes in the quarter over in Asia?
Charles Bunch: Could you repeat the question?
Christopher Perrella: Were volumes down in any particular coatings end-markets in Asia in the quarter?
Charles Bunch: Coatings end-markets, heavy-duty equipment in our industrial business was down, as we alluded to. Electronics, again, in our general industrial business was flattish. Those would be two markets that were on kind of the weaker side of the spectrum.
Christopher Perrella: And what was packaging demand in Asia for you guys in the quarter? Was it up in line with the market or below market growth?
Michael McGarry: Every one of our businesses was up in mid-to-high single digits. Every one of them feed into packaging in the market.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Reitzes with Broad Arch Capital.
Robert Reitzes: Just trying to piece everything together. I want to ask a question. It sounds to me like Europe is going to be better in the third quarter, U.S. should be at least where it is or maybe a little better and Asia will be better, but at a less of a growth rate. Is that what I heard you guys say? That's the first part of my question.
Michael McGarry: I think that's a fair characterization.
Robert Reitzes: And the second part is that currency will not hurt you as much in the third and fourth quarters as it did in the past. So maybe you got a little bit of a tailwind, even though currency was still hard, but you get maybe a little bit of a tailwind from currency moderation, is that fair?
Michael McGarry: It will still be a headwind in absolute terms on a year-over-year basis, but less so than it was in Q2. So Q2 is the peak headwind, Q3 a less so, and Q4 will be less so, just based on the sequential year-over-year comparisons based on the euro. And of course, that also depends on the fact that currency stay by where they were or they are now. If it continues too weaken significantly, it will be more of a headwind. But we still think that overall Q2 will be a peak quarter and it will improve sequentially after that.
Robert Reitzes: So when you take a look at the one other business that people have been nervous about, and it sounds to me like Chuck was more optimistic, is that people have been a little bit more nervous about auto sales in China or auto builds. It sounds to me, even though you're looking for less growth, you're still looking for 3 to 5 instead of 7 in China in the back half of the year, is that also fair?
Charles Bunch: I think for the full year we're looking at mid-single digit, so certainly down from 7 right now. 3 to 5 for the year we think is good. And we've seen a few blips in Chinese market over the last few years, but we think it will still be positive for this year.
Robert Reitzes: And one last question, just putting the whole thing together. Do you think if where you are today versus where you were in the beginning of the year, is Europe where you thought it was, better or worse?
Michael McGarry: Just making sure, we understood the question, Bob. You said Europe?
Robert Reitzes: At the beginning of the year when you were looking at your forecast for Europe or what you thought the tone of business was, you had a view then. Right now is your view that business is better than what you thought in the beginning of the year, worse or about as you thought at the beginning of the year?
Charles Bunch: Well, I would say, on balance it's slightly better. It is better in automotive OEM and actually there was some improvement in automotive refinish. It's the construction markets, especially the big one we have in France have really not started to move. So I guess maybe that's meeting our expectations. But net-net I would say the automotive business is a little bit better. And as we've seen here in the recovery in North America since the great recession, it was really led by the automotive business. So now I'm a little more positive, as they have a weaker currency, lower oil prices, a lot of quantitative easing. So we're net-net more optimistic about Europe. But the businesses we're seeing the most tangible improvement are the automotive.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of the Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research.
Dmitry Silversteyn: A lot of my questions have been answered already. But I'd just like to follow-up on a couple of points, if I may. First of all, getting back to the raw material pricing and the discussion that you've offered in the answer to the previous question about [technical difficulty] coming back, and maybe asking you to share in some of the bounty that you're seeing on the raw materials side. It didn't sound like that was something we should expect in the second half of the year. If we assume that raw materials sort of stay at these levels and oil prices stay at these levels, is it likely that pressure from customers is going to get more intense in the industrial markets in 2016? Or do you still expect to sort of operate in the benign environment, where you get to keep all the benefit you have realized to date on the raw material prices?
Charles Bunch: We'll, certainly, I can add that we don't anticipate that we will keep all of the benefits. And typically as we've discussed whether prices on the way up or on the way down, we usually wait for a quarter or two as these things settle out, and we fully realize either the impact of raw materials on up or downside. And those are usually shared through the value chain or supply chain with our customers. So we're in regular dialog now with the suppliers and with the customers. So we do not expect that we would keep all of the benefits from a raw material changes.
Michael McGarry: Again, Dmitry, our raw materials are down modestly, low-single digits, so just to be clear on that number.
Frank Sklarsky: And there are other factors that go into our pricing too, like different kinds of value-added formulations, new products for our customers as well as there are other cost inputs associated with labor and other non-labor items. So overall, as Vince said before, a flattish environment overall for pricing, that was the case in the previous couple of quarters. We expect that for the rest of this year and probably into first half of next year.
Dmitry Silversteyn: I'm going to get in the 10-Q, but just for modeling purposes, can you update us on what the CapEx spend was in the quarter or for the six months?
Charles Bunch: We had in our presentation materials, total for the year about $160 million with about $90 million in Q2.
Dmitry Silversteyn: And then, just sort of a general question. You talk about the incremental leverage that you'll be able to obtain after having the cost, particularly in Europe, but also in other geographies, as you've integrated acquisitions and took capacity out and rationalize your footprint and so on. I guess, my question is I am not growing 22% volume, how do you actually drive margin in your business as to a higher level? I understand incremental margin, but you need volume to get it. So if you're growing at 1% to 2%, it's not going to be enough for you to drive the margin to generate earnings growth of mid-teens, let's say?
Charles Bunch: Dmitry, just to make sure, I want to make sure I spoke correctly. So our cap spending year-to-date was $160 million.
Dmitry Silversteyn: $160 million and $90 million in the quarter, I got it.
Charles Bunch: I just want to make sure of that. I apologize for interrupting you. I want to make sure that was clear. But in terms of our driving incremental margin profitability, I think we continue to look for ways to be aggressive with our cost. We continue to identify opportunity as we integrate these acquisitions, and we're typically bringing in lower than our operating margin or EBIT margin. And we continue to look for synergistic opportunities across our portfolio of businesses in terms of sales. So those are all -- again, we do have a challenging environment in certain markets, but we typically look for other opportunities to make sure we're maximizing our profitability with things we control. And again, along with the working capital improvement, there are also efforts underway to improve the efficiency of the supply chain. So the supply chain efficiency, there is manufacturing productivity, there is SG&A improvement associated with the restructuring program as well as the volume leverage we get from any incremental volume.
Dmitry Silversteyn: And then final question and I guess that that's sort of revisiting maybe a question that was asked earlier. But at the beginning of the year, you talked about a scenario of kind of slower first half of the year for European markets, and then a pickup in the second half of the year as the benefit from inflation of the currency and/or energy costs and things like that. Your European businesses in the first half I think did a little bit better than that. Is your expectation for the second half of the year equally bullish, sort of less bullish? Are you seeing [technical difficulty] more confidence and demand or is it a little bit less bullish?
Charles Bunch: Well, Dmitry, you've been breaking up a little bit on the connection here. But I'd say, we feel here, we talked maybe with a question from Bob Reitzes we talked about Europe being a little bit better than our expectations, especially in automotive. Here in North America, we do feel I think about the same in terms of the positive outlooks that we're seeing in automotive and the construction markets. As weather held that back we're looking at maybe some interest rate increases, the impact of the strong dollar and the weakness in the oil and gas sector here in the North America. I think overall it's probably helping us a little on the raw material side. But I would say North America is certainly not exceeding the expectations that we went into the year with some areas a little bit better. So I'd say, it's consistent, but I would say that, we, and I, in particular, probably felt that lower oil and gasoline prices were going to be more of a stimulant for the economy. And I think we've seen a little bit of improvement in consumer confidence, but I wouldn't say from a retail sales level or other areas of GDP and we've seen an out performance as a result of lower oil and gasoline prices. So I would say, it's about where do we thought it would be.
Operator: We have no further questions at this time. I will now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Morales for any closing remarks. End of Q&A

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q1 2015 PPG Industries Earnings Conference Call. My name is Tawanda and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Vince Morales, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Vince Morales: Thank you, Tawanda, and good afternoon, everyone. Once again, this is Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations for PPG Industries. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG and welcome you to our first quarter 2015 financial results overview. Joining me on the call today from PPG is Chuck Bunch, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Michael McGarry, President and Chief Operating Officer and Frank Sklarsky, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our comments relate to the financial information we released today, Thursday, April 16, 2015. I will also remind everyone that we posted detailed commentary in the accompanying presentation slides on our investor center at ppg.com. These slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide additional support to the opening comments Chuck will make momentarily. Following Chuck's perspective on the company financial results for the quarter, we will move to the Q&A session. Both the prepared commentary, the presentation slides and discussion during the call may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company's current view of future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. The presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures the company has provided in the appendix materials which are available again on our website reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC. And now let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch.
Chuck Bunch: Thank you, Vince and good afternoon everyone. I want to thank you for your interest in PPG. Today, we reported record first quarter 2015 financial results from continuing operations. We achieved record first quarter net sales of 3.7 billion and record first quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $2.37. Overall, we continue to deliver strong financial results and I'm pleased with our sales and earnings per share growth in the quarter. Our adjusted earnings per share were up 20% versus the first quarter record established last year with each of our reporting segments growing earnings by at least 10% in local currencies. As I will discuss in a few minutes, our strong performance was despite the fact that we faced some difficult prior year sales comparisons. As a global company, we were also impacted by unfavorable currency translation and continue to see variation in economic conditions among the major global regions. Contributing to our record first quarter results were the benefits from our recent strategic actions and cash deployment. This included both acquisition related earnings and a reduction in our share count stemming from cash deployed on share repurchases. We have also continued to work diligently on other company specific actions. This included a debt refinancing we recently completely which reduced our net interest expense in the quarter by nearly 50% versus the prior year. In addition, we have continued our strong legacy of cost and productivity improvements which you have come to expect from PPG. Finally, several of our businesses have continued to deliver strong and above industry growth rates as we benefited from our leading technologies and excellent customer service. Again, we achieved excellent quarterly results that were aided by specific actions we have taken strategically, operationally and financially. Now I will discuss some specific business trends for the first quarter. Our net sales and local currencies grew by 8%, while sales reported in U.S. dollars were up 1%. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted sales by 7% offsetting acquisition related sales growth of about 7% in the quarter. Our sales volume growth was modest increasing about 1% year-over-year and reflects overall subdued global economic activity and a difficult comparison with strong prior year growth rates in certain regions. Regionally, our highest coatings growth rate was in emerging regions which in aggregate grew at about 6%. This is up versus recent quarters as each of our businesses delivered emerging region volumes growth year-over-year. This improvement was driven by a performance in Asia and specifically China. In Latin America, demand was mixed by country and also by end-use market. Volumes at our U.S. and Canadian coatings businesses declined slightly, decreasing 1%. Sales volumes this quarter were compared against sales in last year's first quarter that included 7% volume growth, which is a difficult comparison. Last year's volumes were favorable across many of our businesses, reflecting strengthening regional economic conditions, coupled with pipeline fills of new products at several of our major architectural coatings customers. Despite the modest volume decline in the first quarter this year, overall demand conditions in the region were generally favorable. Most of our businesses continued to experience modest but consistent growth. From a seasonal perspective in the region, overall retail activity was weak in February, but did recover, and ended the month of March strongly. We expect increased economic growth and higher PPG growth rates in this region in the coming quarters. In Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, or EMEA, our volumes grew by 1%. This was also in comparison to strong coatings volume growth in the previous year's first quarter of 4%, which was very high relative to the economic conditions in that region. The previous year sales benefited from very favorable weather conditions that allowed for an early start to the architectural paint season. The region experienced a more normal weather pattern this year. Strong performance from our automotive OEM business offset the lower year-over-year architectural coatings results. We remain optimistic regarding the European auto market, given the pace of regional auto sales during the first quarter. As with previous quarters, overall demand throughout the region varied considerably by country. Most businesses delivered growth in the region with particular support from the U.K., Ireland, and certain Central and Eastern European countries. Conditions remained weak in other countries such as France, and also in our business in Africa. Overall for the EMEA region, we remain constructive on economic growth in the coming quarters. We expect consumer spending in the region will benefit from the lower cost of oil. Weaker European currencies are anticipated to stimulate higher exports, and this is being coupled with overall Central Bank stimulus actions. From a PPG perspective, we significantly lowered our cost structure in the region, and, as we experienced over the past several quarters, we expect excellent earnings leverage on any future volume growth. With respect to currencies, as I mentioned earlier, unfavorable currency translation impacted our overall PPG sales by about 7%, which equated to about $260 million in the first quarter. This is primarily attributed to a weaker euro, but included impacts from other currencies as well. Based on current exchange rates, we anticipate a full-year unfavorable currency impact on our net sales of about $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion and about a $110 million to $120 million unfavorable impact to earnings. This is an increase from the figures we provided in early January when we reviewed our 2014 full year results and reflects further weakening of many major international currencies against the U.S. dollar throughout the first quarter. We expect the largest unfavorable currency translation impact for the year to occur in the second quarter given the seasonality of our businesses. As a reminder, our second quarter is traditionally our highest seasonal quarter of the year. Based on current exchange rates, we expect the quarterly currency translation to reduce sales in the second quarter by $350 million to $375 million. From a segment perspective, our performance coatings segment contains roughly two-thirds of our EMEA sales exposure, as it includes our large architectural coatings EMEA business. A last but important point with respect to year-over-year sales comparisons, our 2014 acquisitions added about 7% to our first quarter sales. This was primarily from our Comex acquisition which we completed in November, but included other, smaller acquisitions as well. We remain very excited about our Comex acquisition. The performance of the acquired business over the first five months has been excellent. The business grew by more than 10% this quarter versus the prior-year pre-acquisition quarter, and we remain on track for a high single-digit volume growth for the full year. We expect to achieve the previously communicated acquisition related cost synergies, with action plans well underway. In addition, we are now looking to fully utilize their very well established concessionaire distribution network from the sale of other legacy PPG products in several areas, including light industrial coatings and protective coatings within Mexico. We plan to provide updates throughout the year on the acquisition and our progress on these potential sales synergies. Moving to our first quarter earnings performance, our 20% adjusted earnings per share growth continues a strong multiyear trend for PPG. Over the preceding three full years beginning in 2012, we have grown adjusted earnings per share by 20%, 31%, and 27%, respectively. This is a reflection of our transformed business portfolio and strong operational execution. For the quarter by segment, performance coatings sales grew 2% and segment income was up 6%. Contributing to the results were the benefits from the Comex acquisition, partly offset by unfavorable currency translation. Sales for the industrial coatings segment were down 2%, as strong volume growth of 5% was offset by a 7% unfavorable currency impact. Segment income was up 6% on the volume improvements and improved manufacturing costs. Glass segment sales were flat, with higher selling prices in both businesses along with positive flat glass product mix, offset by unfavorable currency translation. Glass segment income rose to $30 million versus $4 million in the prior year quarter. Results were aided by the improved product mix and lower manufacturing costs, including the benefits from our 2014 sale of a flat glass manufacturing facility. Additional segment details are available in the presentation material. Overall, our businesses performed well. However, we remain focused on our costs and are initiating restructuring actions focused on productivity measures in certain businesses or regions, along with securing the synergies we committed to with our recent acquisitions. We have approved and will record a restructuring charge of $135 million to $140 million in the second quarter. We anticipate the restructuring actions will be completed by the end of 2016, and expect full year pretax savings of $100 million to $105 million in 2017. Partial year savings in 2015 will be approximately $15 million to $20 million, pretax. While these are difficult actions, we need to continue to aggressively manage our costs. Lastly, we continue to work on balance sheet optimization and earnings accretive cash deployment. As I have previously mentioned, we refinanced some of our higher cost debt in the fourth quarter of 2014. Additionally this quarter, we issued about $1.3 billion in long-term euro-denominated debt at an average interest rate of 1.1%. We ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of cash and short-term investments, maintaining strong financial flexibility. Also, we remain active with respect to acquisitions. We completed the previously announced acquisition of REVOCOAT, an automotive specialty materials manufacturer. We also announced during the quarter that we submitted an offer to acquire the majority interest in an aerospace and automotive sealants business and are currently working through the customary works council and regulatory review processes. We have an active M&A pipeline and while we remain disciplined, this remains a priority for cash deployment. With respect to our shareholders, we repurchased $200 million of stock in the first quarter. Also today our Board approved an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.72 per share, we have raised our annual dividend for more than four decades and are proud of our track record. The Board also approved a two for one stock split that will be effective in June of this year. So as you can see, we have remained active on all fronts.  Now I will quickly summarize in the phase of somewhat subdued economic activity in the quarter, we delivered record first quarter financial performance supported by continued and aggressive operational execution. We had excellent contributions from our recent cash deployment including the Comex acquisition. We have continued to optimize our balance sheet and have kept focus on rewarding our shareholders.  This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again we appreciate your interest in PPG and now operator would you please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John McNulty with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
John McNulty: A quick question on Comex. I guess you had indicated that you saw volume growth, it was about 10% year-over-year organically. And I guess I'm wondering what's driving that, because it certainly seems a stronger than the general end markets down there would imply.
Michael McGarry: John, this is Michael. The Comex business has been performing on all levels, they have – the GDP down there is around little bit around 3% and we have been growing. We expect it, we told you in the last call we grow probably 1.5 to 2 times that, we have outperformed that, that's been both government sales as well as the cohesion with our other PPG products. So all in all, I would tell you they’re doing a very good job and they had a early Easter promotion as well at segment augmented sales.
John McNulty: Great, thanks. And then maybe a question with regard to the restructuring plan and where the $100 million to $105 million of savings are coming from, can you give us a little bit of clarity as to where you do see the biggest buckets in terms of opportunities there?
Frank Sklarsky: John this is Frank. So a little more than half of the actions are focused on some of the markets that have seen some subdued economic conditions so that will focus on Europe and some other areas of challenging economics. So some of that savings will be in area of administrative backoffice, increased shared services, parts of the supply chain in terms of manufacturing productivity, warehousing efficiencies things like that. But if you look across the spectrum of the 100 to 105 savings, it really does run across all regions, all businesses, and all functions. The other thing that we are focusing too as we stated in that release is that part of the restructuring is focused on the acquisition, synergies, achievement and that was we always plan to do that. So that's also part of it.
John McNulty: Great, thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche bank. Please proceed.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Chuck, on raw materials, did you see any material benefit in Q1? And what's your expectation in terms of Q2 for gross margin expansion, given lower raws?
Chuck Bunch: We saw very modest improvement in raw material pricing David, in fact if you look across all the corporation in both our fixed and variable cost, we had inflation that was just slightly negative less than 1% and so we still have not seen the full benefits of the raw material price reductions that we anticipate later this year. We think the second half of the year, we will be able to pull through some of these raw material price reductions in a more meaningful way. I think we’ve talked about first quarter working through higher cost, inventory levels as an example and getting those savings pull through from our suppliers, we don’t have index prices as a rule with either our suppliers or customers. So we focused on that and we think as we go through the year but certainly in the second half, we are going to see more raw material benefits from our raw materials.
David Begleiter: Very good. And just in Asia and China, you noted some acceleration in China. That's perhaps against what we're seeing in terms of growth slowing. So what are you doing well in China and Asia overall?
Chuck Bunch: I think for PPG we’ve been well positioned with several of the more consumer oriented markets not as focused on exports or construction, we have exposure to those businesses. And I think our strongest of markets in China were automotive OEM which is a domestic market in China, those sales have continued to grow above - slightly above the what their overall GDP growth has been stated as so high single digits for automotive growth. And we’ve been well positioned there with some of our new technologies, compact processes, we have done well in that sector, packaging coating would be another example of a consumer oriented end used market that has grown faster than some of the export oriented or construction related business.
David Begleiter: Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.
Ghansham Panjabi: First off, Chuck, are you sensing a new level of optimism from your customers in Europe correctly? Or are your comments on lower energy costs and the pickup in exports from the region more your expectation on a go-forward basis? And also, any early cycle businesses in the region that are starting to improve that you are particularly excited about?
Chuck Bunch: Yes Ghansham it’s good to hear from you, I would say in Europe we have been probably waiting for recovery for several years and we remain cautious on how the markets are trending. But I have been encouraged and this is not just a personal view, it is our team and they have been pessimistic or as cautious as I’ve been but especially on the automotive side of the business, you had seen sales growth accelerate here in the first quarter especially in Southern Europe. So we’re talking now about kind of high single digit sales growth that we haven’t yet seen translated into production, production increases or production growth which is where we have our sales and earnings. And our team feels that if these sales levels continue that we’re going to see higher growth rates in automotive as we go through the year.  If you look at consumer confidence indicators they have also turned up in Europe and I think they’re combination of yes we’re facing some weaker currencies there but the combination of some of the central bank actions with some of the earlier cycle markets like automotive is starting to move I am a little more optimistic in the recovery here after the 2008, 2009 recession automotive was one of the early movers after it really went down quite drastically. And then it was the construction markets here in North America that took a little longer to recover and I would say that seems to be the case a little bit with us at least in France and Southern Europe we’re not seeing the construction markets bounce back yet. But automotive we’re all more optimistic and that I think bodes well not only for that end used market but for a number of other industrial production end used markets.  So I’m a little more optimistic even with the weaker currencies and in fact that is probably going to be one of the contributing factors as we go through this recovery in the overall economies there.
Ghansham Panjabi: And then just as a follow-on on North American architectural, is it your view that pricing is sort of stable in the market? Just curious on what you are seeing from a competitive standpoint, just given all the promotional activity in the channel.
Chuck Bunch: The pricing is flat in the marketplace.
Ghansham Panjabi: Is that your expectation that it stays flat for the year?
Chuck Bunch: Take the expectation is that it will remain flat.
Ghansham Panjabi: Okay, thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America. Please proceed.
Kevin McCarthy: Yes, good afternoon. Chuck, it looks like we have some nascent momentum in vehicle miles driven. Are you seeing any benefit in your refinish business yet, related to that? Or would you expect any as the year progresses?
Chuck Bunch: Hi, Kevin. I would expect, it’s a little early, if you looked some of the winter activity last year we ended up having a pretty good year even though of the automotive refinish market started off quite slowly last year as well. And so, I think you were going to see some improvement in automotive refinish as we go through the year but the first quarter is a little too soon to get the benefit from what was pretty sharply cold winter here in the early months. We saw obviously some improvement in the second half of March when things finally got a little better but we won’t see that yet in refinish it’s probably as we go through the second quarter and into the second half of the year.
Kevin McCarthy: Okay, great. And then the second question, if I may, on the glass business -- or a two-part question. Can you comment on how much of the cost relief there was fixed versus variable? Just trying to get a sense of how durable it could be through the year. And then second piece, does the improved profitability influence your thinking on potential monetization of that business
Chuck Bunch: Well, I would say that there has been improvement in our flat glass business in a number of let’s call it P&L areas, so fixed cost obviously we got helped by the lack of a big cold repair that we had last year in our Wichita Falls, Texas plant.  We also completed the sale of Mount Zion facility in Illinois in the third quarter, so the absence of those two elements helped, so those were fixed cost improvements. We also saw pricing and demand improvement too. So I would say that, the numbers that you’re looking at are sustainable of these are not one-offs and I think we have changed the direction of the business, we’re at little bit of an inflection point, as you know this is a commercial construction business and that market has improved. Glass supply and demand is much more imbalanced, we’ve gotten some pricing, we’ve done well in the marketplace, natural gas cost and others have been under control. So I think we have some elements here for a sustained performance at this level and I think for us as always with this business, we are – we will listen if there are opportunities to create value for the shareholders in any transactions and at this point I think we’re – we are just continuing to execute on opportunities in front of us in the marketplace for the business and we’re optimistic that this can continue.
Kevin McCarthy: Fair enough. Thank you, Chuck.
Chuck Bunch: Okay, Kevin.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
Frank Mitsch: Congrats on a nice start to the year. I wanted to come back on the raw material question. I know that one of your competitors was talking about seeing a roughly mid-single-digit type of improvement here in the middle of the year, and actually accelerating towards year-end. Are those the sort of figures that folks should think about with PPG, as well?
Chuck Bunch: I’m not sure, I haven’t listened or seen any of the reports on any other industry or competitive activity. I would say as I indicated we do expect more help as we go through the year and in the second half, I would say my comments would be that sounds a little on the aggressive side. We’ve seen the oil prices move back up a little bit here and I would say that we expect some help but it not to the magnitude that you mentioned.
Frank Mitsch: All right. That's helpful. And I noticed that packaging was a nice mid-single-digit type of improvement there. What portion of that would you ascribe to BPA-NI? And what's your sense of the competitive balance there? And how should we think about that part of your portfolio?
Chuck Bunch: I think for us, it is certainly a good sign and some of those volume gains were in BPA non-intent or BPA-free coating. So I think it should give you some confidence as an investor that, we’re performing and delivering on the technology challenges for the BPA-free material, we feel pretty confident that we’re well positioned and I think you’re going to continue to see conversions in the food and beverage industry overall on the this technology. So I think it bodes well for us although I would say, we see other competitors active in this basis, well but I think we feel positive with volume growth that you’ve seen and I think it’s an indication that our technology is going to be, is going to deliver growth in the market.
Frank Mitsch: Thank you so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Bob Koort: I was wondering if you could talk on the North American architectural about -- do you have the confidence that there was no underlying issues around the big box distribution channel? And have you seen any changes in DIY versus contractors? That's my first. And then second, can you talk a little bit about how your PPG-owned stores and Akzo -- or Glidden stores, with the rebranding -- if there's any changes in what you've seen in dynamics there. Thanks.
Michael McGarry: Bob, this is Michael starting with the company owned stores, we merge that the network together so you can’t really pull out legacy Akzo versus the old PPG and as we said in our opening remarks, they were up mid single digits. So we were happy with that and when we look at the big boxes, we had some pipeline fill last year especially with the stain side we have nice stain position and that’s an early win there, we did not have that pipeline fill in this year. Overall we think, when we look at the sell out from the big boxes it is progressing at a normal rate obviously the slow start to the paint season given the weather but we saw acceleration starting in mid March.
Chuck Bunch: More your second question Bob that we covered.
Michael McGarry: Yeah, that was the…
Bob Koort: It was just around whether or not you've seen any variation in DIY versus contractor trends. And then in your own big box business, whether there's any regional -- or of any underlying trends, or it was really just an inventory management and tough comp issue.
Michael McGarry: No, I think it was all – I think the inventory is a one-time and we’re seeing no material differences and how it goes out in the marketplace. So we’re happy with what we’re seeing and the dealers and the contractors all performing what I would say as a reasonable marketplace.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please proceed.
Laurence Alexander: Can you give a little bit more detail on how much of a lift you should have next year from not having the pipeline adjustments in the North American architectural?
Vince Morales: Hi Laurence, this is Vince. Pipeline adjustments for last year, so it is just not recur so we actually have pipeline fills or higher levels of activity in the first quarter of 2014 and that’s what created the difficult comp.
Laurence Alexander: And then the price mix, can you give a little bit of regional flavor, how that was doing in Europe and Asia?
Vince Morales: Prices generally for the company in all regions were basically flat, the only favorable mix I’d say we had from an overall perspective was in our flat glass business where we moved up, as commercial construction glass is more a value added product versus residential glass. So, we are moving up the spectrum as we saw more commercial construction into the market based on demand.
Laurence Alexander: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan. Please proceed.
Jeff Zekauskas: Can you talk about the progress of your titanium dioxide chloride technology in China -- whether it's being well commercialized or well developed, or whether it isn't?
Michael McGarry: Hey Jeff, this is Michael. The plant is in the startup mode. We expect to get commercial quality product in the second half of the second quarter and we will be looking at that.  So far what we have seen, we have been pleased with everything and we’re happy so far.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay. And as my follow-up question, when you think about the changes in suppliers at Lowe's, where they've gone from two paint suppliers to three, do you think that that's a one-off event at Lowe's? Or do you think it's part of -- or it could be part of a larger industry trend as the coatings industry consolidates?
Michael McGarry: Jeff, I don’t know that we want to get into specific customers on this. Certainly Lowe’s made decision and we would expect the other folks to try their own business. So, we will wait and see how that works out.
Chuck Bunch: And just as a reminder, as we said on the first in January, you know, with respect to our own center customers for calendar year 2015, we picked up a little bit more product.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Vincent Andrews: Just a question on Comex. Just looking at your comments on exceeding your net sales range from January, I guess that's in the face of probably some challenging FX there. Could you just talk about what the dynamics are that allowed you to exceed the range?
Michael McGarry: Hi, Michael again. I think we have a strong market share down there. We have increased the number of concessionaires and when we bought the business from 3740, we are up at 3,900. We are adding a concessionaire every other day and that gives us additional penetration to the marketplace. We also have the strongest brand in Mexico and the government there some election spending or actually some elections later in the year and the local governments are spending some money to help beautify their local areas. So, that’s also positive. I think there are number of factors that are driving this.
Vincent Andrews: Okay. Thanks very much. I’ll leave it there.
Chuck Bunch: Let me just add to what Michael said. So we – our anticipation in Comex as we are going to have a total opening of concessionaires this year somewhere between 116 to 119 new locations. Again as Michael said, one every other day.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna financials. Please proceed.
Don Carson: Thank you. Chuck, a question on the trade-off between FX and raws. You outlined that FX will be almost twice what you thought it would be on the January call. You are a little more optimistic on the raw material outlook, perhaps not as much as one of your competitors. But do those two largely balance each other off? That is, more raw material cost reductions offsetting that increased FX headwind?
Chuck Bunch: Well, if you look we were down 7% in currency at least at the top line and we were down much less than that on raw material side. Although not all the currency impacts our bottom line. So, certainly I think they are offsetting to a certain extent and we think that unfortunately currency is going to be more of a headwind here in the second quarter if these currency trends continue and in the second half it’s a little early to say what we’re going to see on currency but we think we will get little more help on raw materials. So, we’ve got some, let’s call them countervailing trends here. They didn’t offset indirectly the same ways in the first quarter and it’s going to be how we see this thing play out both on currencies and very unpredictable. We think there is a broader trend in raw materials, but not in a relatively moderate way.
Frank Sklarsky: And Don, just one. This is Frank. Keep in mind that on the cost savings side, I think we do get in our cost structure – including those savings we anticipate to get now through 2017 due to restructuring program that’s real economic benefit and structural benefit to our structure whereas on the currency side only about 10% of that goes to the bottom line, because of the natural hedge we have by making our product generally where we sell it. And that’s a not really an economic exposure as much as it’s just a translation exposure from the foreign currency into U.S. dollars.  The transaction exposure, which would be the real economic impact is very limited and we do hedge a portion of that transaction exposure where we buy in one currency and sell in another currency. But that’s very, very limited. So we just want to clarify that.
Don Carson: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed.
P.J. Juvekar: Yes, hi good afternoon. I have a question on automotive refinish. Can you talk about the dynamics there, as one of your new competitors seems to be gaining some share? So just talk about what the dynamics there, and what kind of organic growth are you seeing in refinish?
Chuck Bunch: P. J. automotive refinish in the developed markets is a relatively mature market. And we have I would say a very incomplete industry growth data in terms of the actual refinish market. But I would say that for us in terms of the market trends this has always been a competitive market there are few large global players we feel that as PPG, we’re holding our own in the developed market regions and we’re continuing to grow in the developing markets like China and India where these are the fastest growing car parks and automotive refinish markets. So yes it’s a competitive market, we got a few large global players, we don’t see that competitive intensity decreasing, but we feel as PPG we’re well positioned and certainly maintaining our leadership in the industry.
Frank Sklarsky: If I can add just Chuck’s comments if you look at the technology in the marketplace everything is moving toward a water based technology. I think from our observations we’re the leader in that technology both in the U.S. and in Europe. So I think we’re well positioned from a technology perspective as well.
P.J. Juvekar: Thank you. And then I want to go back to Lowe's and just Lowe’s introduced this new HGTV brand. And I know Olympic is at a lower price point. But what is the risk that a person who walks into a Lowe store to buy Olympic paint could trade up to buy HGTV. I mean do you see any possible impact there?
Chuck Bunch: P. J. I think it’s too early to speculate and I think Lowe’s would like to be the one comment on that.
P.J. Juvekar: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Sheehan with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed.
James Sheehan: Thank you. On your architectural coatings sales in the US, if you exclude the impact of the pipeline fills, what would sales have done in percentage terms in the first quarter?
Vince Morales: James this is Vince. So if you look we had good volume growth as Michael mentioned in the company owned stores and comparable growth in the independent distribution market and that was just offset with the – I will call it the negative year-over-year comps with respect to the pipeline fill. The store – the sales in DIY were positive and at the door and we feel good about that going forward. The other thing that was impactful for that business from a sales perspective was currency in Canada was negative, we have a big Canadian business. Volumes in Canada were positive, but currency was negative. So again we’re pleased with our performance to-date early in the seasons as Michael mentioned and we did our kind of a different weather pattern, weaker in February, stronger in March.
James Sheehan: Okay. And on your commercial construction comments on the glass business, you have often talked about that flowing through into the coatings business over time. Are you starting to see that pick up in coatings on the commercial construction side?
Michael McGarry: Yes Jim, this is Michael. We’re starting to see that it's a little early, because as you know glass goes in the building it’s generally can be anywhere from 12 to 18 months before the paint goes in and upon the size of the building. So it's a little early, but we certainly expect that to flow through as well.
Jim Sheehan: Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed.
John Roberts: Good afternoon. Frank, does free cash flow get as impacted by foreign exchange as earnings? Or are there things you can do with working capital and capital spending, some of the offsets in the free cash flow, to sort of dampen out the foreign exchange on free cash?
Frank Sklarsky: Yes, we were irrespective of FX, we're always looking at ways to improve working capital obviously Q1 is usually the weakest from a cash flow perspective as you build a little bit of working capital, perhaps some of the payables from fourth quarter and build up over the working capital and where receivable as things pull up for second quarter. But we do have initiatives underway and we've made a lot of progress in terms of reducing pass to receivables, we have aggressive targets and try to streamline our inventory levels as well as complexity in each of our businesses during the year we’ll see progress more progress in the latter half of the year. And then payables are in pretty good shape. Yes, you do see some impact on the translation, but actually I think we're going to have adequate initiatives to offset and make some progress on the working capital and move through the year.
John Roberts: Okay. And then just secondly, is your strength in automotive OEM new wins as strong as the strength that you're currently seeing in the existing business?
Chuck Bunch: It's balanced between what you have in some markets where we did well such as Europe these are - I think - we’re seeing a ramp up of some of the customers that have been maybe most affected by this kind of long recession in Europe so that we’re customer based in Europe you don’t have as many new plants there. So these are your traditional customers that are now starting to do a little better as we see this pick up in sales, especially in some markets like Southern Europe where Fiat is starting to grow faster. And in Asia and in China and India for example that's a combination of new wins, but primarily these are new plants that are going in with global and domestic competitors both there and in India. So I’d say that’s more of a combination of new plants and existing market growth.
John Roberts: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Arun Viswanathan: I guess I just wanted to clarify, first, if you can give us some guidance on what interest expense would look like for the rest of the year with the euro refinancing.
Chuck Bunch: Sure. The interest expense was down and of course the numbers we gave was on a net basis went from $35 million to about $18 million in the first quarter as we look out through the rest of the year interest expense will be down between the $20 million to $25 million per quarter. Our weighted average interest rate in our portfolio right now, we've got debt about $4.6 million weighted average interest rate about 2.5%.
Frank Sklarsky: And Arun, so we did refinance as we said on our press release and Chuck's comments in the fourth quarter we also did put in a $1.3 billion of debt in March. So we had no interest cost for that in January, February so there will be a step up in Q2 of $4 million to $5 million verse Q1 partially rated to that. So mid-20s – mid to low 20s would be a good number on a go forward basis.
Chuck Bunch: And that’s a net interest expense offset against interest income and the cash balances.
Arun Viswanathan: Okay. Great, thanks. And then just taking that a step further, you guys obviously have quite a bit of balance sheet flexibility here. Can you give us a little update on the M&A pipeline? I know you completed two in the first quarter. Anything else look interesting, maybe in industrial coatings in Europe, right now?
Chuck Bunch: We have an active M&A pipeline, we don’t have any mega deals out there those don’t come along very often, but we have some good discussions going on. We announced the agreement although we have not closed yet on the French aerospace acquisition Le Joint Français or LJF from Total so that’s one that we are continuing to work and we hope to be able to close that in the second half of the year. And we have some other deals that we’re currently discussing and we hope that we’ll be able to announce some things as we go through the year, but it’s an active pipeline still we think good opportunities.
Arun Viswanathan: Great, thanks. And if I may, just one more on the Comex opportunity. Is there any way you could quantify the revenue opportunity, now selling some of those legacy PPG products? Thanks.
Vince Morales: Arun, Vince, again. We’re suddenly working closely with the concessionaires on what products they like, what products we’re actually selling in the market. We really need to go through a paint season to fully understand the acceptance of the products and its different obviously by geographic region in Mexico so we do want to give some sidelines for you guys. At some point it’s just too premature right now to do that.
Arun Viswanathan: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA. Please proceed.
Nils Wallin: Yes. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Industrial coatings revenues were down, but profitability was up year-over-year. Would you help us understand what happened there? Did you take some low-margin business out, or did you take some costs out? Just curious as to how you achieved such a solid result.
Chuck Bunch: This was productivity and we continued to perform well in the businesses that are in industrial coating so lot of cost down restructuring benefits from prior years and good growth of profitable business in our automotive OEM industrial coating segments.
Vince Morales: And then Nils, the 2% decline I think in sales revenue really was 7% negative currency, 5% positive OEMs for the segment so that 5% volume dragging along nice incremental margin as we’ve talked about in the past for the reason Chuck just mentioned. So I think that really hastened our improvement.
Nils Wallin: Yes, understood. Understood. I guess last year, Europe saw something like a 20% earnings growth on volumes that were starting to improve. Now it sounds like, in general, you are becoming incrementally positive on the region, some recovery. Should we expect that type of -- or better type of earnings growth in Europe on a constant currency basis for 2015?
Chuck Bunch: Well, I would say that remember we should still see earnings growth improvement in Europe primarily related to our industrial coating segment. So we have not yet seen strong improvement on the construction side of or the performance coating side of the business. But we think there will be some modest growth there and we’re obviously working on these restructuring actions that should help us late in the year.
Vince Morales: And keep in mind too that any incremental volume should accretive to at a pretty nice margin closer to the PC margin than the EBIT margin because the fact that we’re still 15 to 20 percentage points below peak volumes so we don’t have to add much of anything in terms of fixed supply chain cost to get that volume and in fact we continue to find streamlining opportunities on the administrative side. So any volume we do get – when we get in the commercial spaces on should accrue good margin.
Nils Wallin: Understood. And just one more, if I may. I noticed in the commentary the $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion of potential cash deployment over the next 12 to 18 months was removed. Was that deliberate? Although you had obviously highlighted continued cash deployment issues or goals -- so was that deliberate? Have you changed your view about how much cash will be deployed?
Vince Morales: The cash flow is still working as it did when we made that disclosure and that disclosure and guidance still does apply.
Nils Wallin: Great. Thanks so much.
Chuck Bunch: Thanks Nils.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we do have time for one final question. Your final question comes from the line of Kevin Hocevar with Northcoast Research. Please proceed.
Kevin Hocevar: Hey, good afternoon, everybody. On the auto OEM side of things, you continue to really significantly outperform the industry, which seems to be the norm at this point. So I'm wondering if you could comment on what's driving that. I know technology has something to do with it. Is the gap not closing between the competitors? Do you continue to innovate, and they are not keeping up? Are you are aligned with the right customers? Wondered if you could just comment on that.
Chuck Bunch: I think we’ve been – it’s a combination of both of those. I think technology and service our performance with existing customers has gone extremely well with the new technologies. We are the largest automotive OEM competitor in the space. We have a broad geographic or global footprint. So we’re able to I think deliver a value around the world whether you’re talking about North America or Europe or Asia or China any of those markets. So I think we’ve been very well positioned both from a technology service and we have a very broad based customer – customer array. And in China as an example we’ve seen both the global OEMs as well as the Chinese domestic players growing and we’ve been positioned on both sides of that so I think it’s a combination.
Kevin Hocevar: Okay. And then just quickly on the US architectural paint business. I noticed the independent dealer channel was up to mid-single-digits, which is kind of strong for that channel. So just wondering if you had any new business wins, or it just happened to have a good quarter.
Vince Morales: No, we had no significant new business wins, but I do think we got a fast start to the year.
Kevin Hocevar: Okay. Thank you very much.
Chuck Bunch: Thank you, Kevin.
Operator: I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Morales for closing remarks.
Vince Morales: Thank you. Once again I want to like to thank everybody for all of their interest in PPG and their time and attention. If there is any further questions on financials please call me in Investor Relations function. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's conference. That concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. And have a great day.

Operator: Welcome to the Quarter Four 2014 PPG Industries Earnings Call. My name is Sally and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Vince Morales. Please proceed.
Vince Morales: Thank you, Sally. Good afternoon, everybody. Once again, this is Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations for PPG. We appreciate your continued interest and welcome you to our fourth quarter financial results teleconference. Joining me from PPG on the call today is Chuck Bunch, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Michael McGarry, Chief Operating Officer and Frank Sklarsky, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our comments and Q&A relate to the financial information released today, Thursday, January 15, 2015. I will remind everyone that we posted detailed commentary and the accompanying presentation slides on our investor center at our website at PPG.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide some additional support to the opening comments that Chuck and Frank will make momentarily. Following Chuck's perspective on the company results, Frank will provide a brief financial update and then we will move directly to Q&A. Both the prepared commentary and discussion during the call may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company's current view about future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. The presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. In the appendix of the presentation materials are reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For any additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC. And now let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch.
Chuck Bunch: Thank you, Vince and good afternoon everyone. Today, we reported fourth quarter 2014 financial results that established new fourth quarter milestones for net sales of $3.7 billion and fourth quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $2.11. Our sales improved 6%, a figure that includes an unfavorable 4% impact from currency translation. So our sales in local currencies grew by 10%. Our sales volumes grew about 4% year-over-year, a growth rate higher than our third quarter level. Although the overall pace of business remained varied by region, the growth rate of each major region also improved sequentially. Our U.S. and Canada business delivered sales volume growth of about 5% year-over-year. Our Asia-Pacific region also grew 5%, the highest growth rate of the year. Sales volumes in Europe, the Middle East and Africa grew by about 1% after being flat in the third quarter. Our sales volume growth was broad-based across our business portfolio including our Industrial Coatings segment where each business in the segment delivered solid volume growth. Sales volumes also improved for aerospace, automotive refinish and our architectural coatings business in the U.S. and Canada. For the fourth quarter, we generally experienced normal seasonal trends in all of our businesses and regions. Supplementing the company's volume growth in the quarter were acquisition-related sales gains of about 6% stemming primarily from the Comex acquisition which closed in early November. Comex had partial quarter sales of about $175 million with a mid-teen percentage return on sales reflective of the quality of the business. From an earnings perspective, our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.11 improved 26% versus the prior year supported by growth of at least 10% in each of our reporting segments. The improved segment earnings were driven by higher sales volumes, continued aggressive cost management and benefits from the Comex acquisition. Cash deployed on share repurchases was also a contributing factor to our record results. We repurchased $300 million or about 1.4 million shares in the fourth quarter which brings our full-year total to $750 million or about 3.8 million shares. In the quarter, our average diluted shares outstanding were 2.7% lower versus the previous year's fourth quarter and 3.7% lower for the full year 2014. Now let me comment quickly on our full-year results. On a full-year basis, our sales were $15.4 billion, up 8% due to higher sales volumes and acquisitions. Our full-year sales volumes grew more than 4% in the U.S. and Canada between 3.5% and 4% in Asia and Latin America and about 2.5% in Europe, although most of the European growth occurred in the first half of the year. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share was $9.75, up 27% versus our prior year record. We have delivered at least 20% adjusted earnings per share growth for several consecutive years, clearly illustrating the benefits of our active portfolio management, earnings accretive cash deployment and persistent operational focus. For the quarter and full year, I was pleased with our strong financial performance and overall operational execution in what was a modest growth year from a global economic perspective. Just to comment on a few other highlights for the company in 2014, our earnings improved in each major region by at least 14%. This includes an improvement of more than $100 million or 21% in Europe despite muted regional economic activity and currency headwinds late in the year. Most of our businesses continue to execute very well and in several cases, we outperformed respective global industry growth rates. I'm also pleased to report that we have realized one year ahead of schedule a targeted run rate of acquisition synergies relating to our 2013 acquisition of Akzo Nobel's North American architectural coatings business. After nearly two years of successful business integration, we are now shifting to a growth focus for that business. From a balance sheet management perspective, in the fourth quarter, we refinanced some of our debt obligations which will result in lower net interest beginning in 2015. Frank will talk more about this in a minute. Strategically, 2014 was another very successful and eventful year as we continue to enhance our business portfolio. This includes the first-quarter sale of our ownership interest in the Transitions Optical joint venture for $1.7 billion pre-tax or $1.5 billion after-tax. Also, the Comex acquisition completed in the fourth quarter was the second largest in our company's history. We are very pleased to now have this high-quality business as part of PPG. Finally, we continued our heritage of returning cash to our shareholders with more than $1.1 billion returned for the year through dividends and share repurchases. I will remind everyone that we have paid a dividend for 115 consecutive years and raised our annual dividend payout for 43 consecutive years. We increased our per-share dividend 10% in April of 2014. Again, a very strong fourth quarter and full-year performance for our company. As we enter 2015, our overall outlook is similar to what we experienced last year. We anticipate growth rates will remain mixed by region with North American and Asian economies continuing to grow at rates generally consistent with 2014. Our base case assumption is that European growth will remain subdued overall; however, we believe that European economies stand to benefit considerably if oil prices remain at current levels which may stimulate higher growth in that region. Given our broad geographic reach and full array of coatings businesses, we expect to benefit from the continued global growth. From a PPG perspective, we remain focused on new product development, operational excellence and continued opportunities to deploy cash for earnings accretion. As many of you know, at the beginning of 2014, we provided a cash deployment target of $3 billion to $4 billion for acquisitions and share repurchases. That target encompassed years 2014 and 2015. Our actual cash deployed relating to acquisitions and share buybacks for 2014 alone totaled about $3.2 billion. Our acquisition pipeline remains active and share repurchases remain an integral part of our capital allocation strategy. We anticipate deploying an additional $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion of cash on acquisitions and buybacks in years 2015 and 2016 combined with a focus on creating shareholder value. Let me conclude by saying 2014 was an excellent year for PPG and our shareholders. We are looking forward to a successful 2015 and now I will turn it over to Frank to review a few 2015 financial assumptions.
Frank Sklarsky: Thank you, Chuck and good afternoon everyone. I'll now cover several items that will assist in modeling our 2015 sales and earnings. We've included in today's presentation materials a summary of these financial assumptions on slide number 13. First is the impact of the Comex acquisition. As Chuck mentioned, we closed this acquisition in early November 2014, so we benefited from partial quarterly results in the fourth quarter of 2014. For 2015, we expect the acquisition will add approximately $1 billion in full-year sales. Incremental sales for 2015 will be $800 million to $825 million reflecting our partial year 2014 ownership. The Comex business is expected to have a mid-teens earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT percentage return on sales for the year. However, this will vary by quarter due to business seasonality. The quarterly seasonality of the business differs somewhat from PPG's European and U.S. and Canadian architectural coatings businesses. The Comex quarterly sales phasing is expected to be approximately 20% to 22% in the first quarter, 23% to 26% in the second and third quarters and 29% to 31% in the fourth quarter. Next, as many of you are aware, a variety of foreign currencies began to weaken in the second half of 2014 as measured against the U.S. dollar. As a result, the company expects that year-over-year currency translation will unfavorably impact sales by $650 million to $750 million and earnings by about $65 million to $75 million. These figures represent our current assumptions and are based on current exchange rates as of this week. Again, these impacts are currency translation related and given the nature of our business, we typically do not incur significant transaction related currency impacts. The next item relates to the company's pension and other post-employment benefits or OPEB expenses. We are expecting these expenses to increase by about $60 million to $65 million in 2015. This increase stems from changes to employee and retiree mortality rate tables that are commonly used by most U.S. companies. Also, the year-end discount rate that is used to determine OPEB and pension liabilities was lower at the end of December 2014 versus December 2013. Both the discount rate and the mortality tables represent important calculation variables when computing estimated annual OPEB and pension expenses. This increased expense will be recognized in our financial results ratably throughout the year. As Chuck mentioned, we expect lower net interest expenses for 2015. We refinanced a portion of our term debt in the fourth quarter which is the key driver of this decrease. Included in the appendix of the presentation materials are details of the debt obligations we refinanced. We expect a total of $55 million of lower net interest expense year-over-year with $18 million less expense in the first quarter and $11 million, $14 million and $12 million lower in the second, third and fourth quarters respectively. Next, we anticipate that the company's 2015 tax rate on ongoing earnings from continuing operations will be in the range of 24% to 25%. The comparable rate for 2014 was 23.9%. The increase relates primarily to higher earnings in Mexico resulting from the Comex acquisition. The Mexican tax rate is higher than PPG's global tax rate. Other factors may also impact the 2015 tax rate throughout the year, including the regional mix of earnings. Finally as Chuck mentioned, the company anticipates cash deployment of $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion in years 2015 and 2016 combined for acquisitions and share repurchases. This is incremental to the approximate $3.2 billion that has already been deployed as part of the previous target of $3 billion to $4 billion. Once again a summary of these financial assumptions is contained in the presentation materials for today's call. This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again we appreciate your interest in PPG and now operator would you please open the line for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi from Baird. Go ahead, sir.
Ghansham Panjabi: Just in the context of all the macro data all over the world, you obviously saw an improvement in core volumes. Is that just your end-market exposure that leaves you better positioned on a relative basis or share gains? I'm curious on your perspective just because comps were tougher in 4Q.
Chuck Bunch: I would say that I think this reflects our exposure to the end-use markets on a regional basis. I would say that's probably the largest factor although we have several businesses that have outpaced the global growth rates as we look at them.
Ghansham Panjabi: Okay. And just switching to North American architectural, just given Lowe's announcement with the HGTV brand, just curious on your thoughts as to what your big retail partners are sharing with you in terms of strategy? Are they pursuing a more broad-based set of brands throughout their stores or is this something just a test case and we'll wait and see what happens?
Michael McGarry: Ghansham, this is Michael. First of all, I want to say that with the line reviews we did come out modestly ahead, so that's a net positive. I think when you think about the big boxes, they are all focused on getting more traffic into the stores. Once they get that additional traffic in the stores, they're trying to convert them at a higher rate and I think that's their strategy and we're certainly looking to be part of that higher retention and growth rate.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Go ahead.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Wondering if you could talk a bit about how we should be thinking about your raw materials as we move through the year just given the move in crude and in ethylene and propylene and how we should be thinking about that both in terms of the cost line potentially in terms of how it might impact the revenue line if you have to give some of it back and just sort of the cadence of it.
Chuck Bunch: Let me give you a little bit of a background. In the fourth quarter, we didn't see the raw material benefits, we've seen throughout the course of 2014 the stability overall in raw material pricing and that's where we were in the fourth quarter. What we have seen here at the end of the fourth quarter and now going into the first quarter of 2015 with these larger oil price declines, we are now currently negotiating with many of our suppliers around the world on the impact of these oil price declines on their pricing. I would say the general trend of the discussions is modestly lower at this point. We've seen some commodities that have moved more quickly. These would be products like solvents which are more commodity-like and trade closer between spot and contract pricing. But I would say that right now we don't buy our raw materials for the most part on indexes, so these discussions are really taking place around the world on a variety of commodities. We have seen a little more weakness, if I look at it regionally, a little more weakness in the Asia-Pacific region. Their prices typically respond more quickly. In Europe, we have seen lower economic growth, but weakness in currency that's muting some of these dollar based oil declines. So we're going to see where that takes us here over the first quarter and likewise here in North America, business conditions a little stronger and we're currently negotiating with our suppliers here and we're only two weeks into the first quarter, so it's a little too early to tell. I think we will have a lot more visibility by the end of the first quarter. And with our prices right now, we've had relatively stable pricing here at the end of 2014, a few puts and takes, but overall pricing is stable. That remains our base case as we go into 2015 and we'll evaluate that as we see the trends overall in the markets both here and around the world.
Vincent Andrews: Just maybe as a quick follow-up, could you just maybe tell us roughly in the raw material basket that's oil linked in one way or another, what percentage would you say is pure commodity versus what percentage might be a product that's priced for value rather than has some differentiation to it that's just not necessarily going to move one for one with a propylene or an ethylene price?
Chuck Bunch: Well, our raw material basket, if you look at all of the things we're doing in both the organic, inorganic area plus other packaging materials and general purchasing, I would say about 20% overall was tied to hydrocarbon pricing broadly. And I would say that, of that mix -- I haven't looked at it quite in terms of commodity versus polymeric differentiated resins, but certainly less than half of that total is tied directly to commodity pricing. So I would say we are typically buying things that are either specified or somewhat differentiated, so we're not buying a lot of ethylene. We're not buying any ethylene anymore and very little of the propylene or other monomers that you could directly attribute to these price declines.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Go ahead, sir.
Jeff Zekauskas: You talked about revenues from Comex being about $1 billion in 2015. I was wondering what Mexican exchange rate you're using? I think the peso has maybe fallen about 10% on average and so I would've thought there would have been more of a currency penalty.
Frank Sklarsky: Jeff, when we announced this deal the currency was 13.2, it peaked at about 14.7, it's trading today at 14.5. So it's up about 10%. But despite that, all the $0.65 to $0.75 of accretion that we expect on EPS we will deliver.
Vince McMahon: Jeff, this is Vince, we've seen growth in the business over that time period that eclipsed most of the currency declines.
Jeff Zekauskas: And then for my follow-up, I think in your financial statements you call out about $36 million in transition costs in the quarter, but in the footnotes it looks like there's $52 million in costs. There is a $21 million inventory step-up, $17 million in R&D, $14 million in other. So does that mean that some of these costs were included in operating earnings?
Frank Sklarsky: No, I don't know if you're looking at a pre-tax/post-tax number, but associated with the acquisitions primarily Comex is that $29 million that you talked about, it's a pre-tax number. Two-thirds of that is the inventory step-up, the rest of it is closing costs. So that's associated with Comex.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Go ahead.
P.J. Juvekar: Chuck, when it comes to your pricing of your products, historically you said that industrial customers look for a price break quickly compared to architectural business. So I was wondering if you can talk about that dynamic of industrial versus architectural pricing.
Chuck Bunch: Well, I would say, P.J., there is no real standard in terms of when we're going to have discussions with either industrial or architectural customers. Some of it is related to either bidding or negotiating policies when we've reached agreements. So I would say at this point that it's difficult for us to say with these movements in raw material, oil pricing that things that we can say hard and fast rule when we're going to be able to reflect any advantages that we get from lower raw material prices or when we'll have discussions with our customer base across the board.
P.J. Juvekar: Okay. And then my second question is on OEM. You've been growing faster than the market for many years and now one of your competitors is also claiming to be growing and gaining share. And if the overall pie is not growing, do you think somebody else is losing share?
Chuck Bunch: No I would say that as we reported in the fourth quarter, we continue to perform well versus a global industry growth rate. We think over time we have very capable competitors in this space and I think over time our growth rate should reflect overall industry growth trends on a long term basis.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Go ahead.
Duffy Fischer: A question on cash flow, if I just do the quick math of it, you talked about between $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion paying out either from acquisitions or buyback. Your dividend is running at about $360 million, so let's say that grows a little bit. The dividend plus that say high end at $2.5 billion gets us to about $3.3 billion, but your cash flow from ops this year without Comex was $1.8 million so over two years that gets us somewhere north of $4 billion of operating cash flow. So it seems like there is a gap where you either build $1 billion in cash or I wouldn't think pay down debt with that. So can you just walk through the triangulation of the cash flow generation over the next two years in the $2.5 billion number?
Frank Sklarsky: Yes, Duffy, this is Frank. So we ended this 2014 with about $1.2 billion in cash and we expect to generate over a $1 billion in both 2015 and 2016. Remember that's an amount that's after CapEx and after dividend. So what we're saying is without any of these additional actions, when you take that $1.2 billion and end up with something north of $3 billion by the end of 2016 and we intended to deploy $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion of that on acquisitions and share repurchase. So the difference on the cash flow number that you and I are quoting is really the dividend and the CapEx.
Duffy Fischer: And then if we just walk back, a year ago seemed very optimistic on the acquisition front. Obviously, at that time, you didn't know you were going to [Technical Difficulty]. You know that fell in your lap, but we haven't seen other acquisitions that obviously were on your plate at that same time. So what happened with those and I guess why weren't we able to or is it just a timing issue to do some more work on what was obviously your target list at this time last year?
Chuck Bunch: Well, Duffy, we did announce in the fourth quarter the acquisition -- the agreement for an acquisition with REVOCOAT or AXSON, the automotive OEM material supplier that has not closed yet, but that was announced in the fourth quarter and we still have a number of discussions and negotiations going on. So we remain confident and optimistic that we'll be able to deliver more acquisition growth here in 2015 and beyond. So I feel pretty good about it and we did get the other one announced that we haven't closed obviously, but I think that was a positive step and that will be a good opportunity for us going forward in our Industrial Coatings segment.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Go ahead, sir.
David Begleiter: Chuck, just on your gross margin, can you talk about the 2015 versus 2014 thoughts given, one, the addition of Comex and two, obviously the big drop you will see in raws? In the past, you've seen a pretty big uptick in the gross margin off of sharp declines in crude oil.
Chuck Bunch: Well, I would say at this point, David that we're looking to have maybe small incremental improvements in the overall gross margins with not only the acquisition of Comex, but also what we're seeing in our other businesses with some headwinds out there in terms of currency and the like. But we think it's going to be stable to slightly up in terms of margin performance. Obviously, we're going through this negotiation phase and we don't really know where raw materials and others have settled out. But I think there are some opportunities for improvement here, but right now I would say we're looking for stable to just slightly higher margin opportunities.
David Begleiter: So just on the trends in January, any destocking that you see amongst yourselves or your customers?
Chuck Bunch: This year, we have an early reporting date today so we haven't seen as much of a trend. There were some things happening in the fourth quarter with individual customers and inventory management, but I would say it's a little too early to say. I think what we did note in our recorded documents is that weather patterns looks like so far more of a normal winter here in North America, but we also benefited in the first quarter last year from very good weather in Europe. So right now, it's a little too early for us to see any significant trends overall for our business.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, Bob.
Bob Koort: Chuck, you guys noted the mid-teens operating margins in Comex and I guess I would've thought seasonally maybe it would've been a little bit lower than that. I think your guidance is for mid-teens in 2015, but you note there is seasonality. So is there something different about the Mexican paint markets from the U.S. paint markets in terms of that seasonality?
Michael McGarry: Bob, this is Michael. I think Frank covered some of this in his opening remarks, but think about 20% in Q1, 25% in Q2 and Q3 and 30% in Q4. Generally the mid-teens in the fourth quarter, it's a seasonally stronger quarter for them, so we'll start a little bit slower in the first quarter, but we'll build up and we have some good opportunities there. Their resin plant is not fully loaded, so we're looking at supplying our own Mexican operations with that. We've looked at some synergies as well. So I think right now we'll be trending toward that $30 million to $40 million synergy number that we gave you as well.
Bob Koort: And Michael, I know your beating stick has a little blood on it from marking up those TiO2 companies in the last few years. Can you give us a sense if there is any more room to rift or substitute or get some more price relief there or do you think we've come closer to the end of those trends?
Michael McGarry: I think our view of the market hasn't changed, it's still oversupplied. You have billions coming on with the new chloride plant in China. We've looked at the preproduction samples; they are getting better, more consistent, it will be up and operational late in Q1 early Q2. When you look at the industry in general, we still plan to take out TiO2, get more formulation, 1% to 2%. We think our other folks that we compete with have similar type programs. We saw Comex had a similar program. So the trends that you see I think will continue.
Bob Koort: Cost component of those substitutes which may be petrochemical-based doesn't reduce some of the likelihood of moving away from TiO2?
Michael McGarry: I don't think so.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Don Carson from Susquehanna International. Go ahead, sir.
Don Carson: Yes, two questions. First on going back to auto OEM and I think for over a year now you've been growing above industry growth rates. What exactly is it that enables you to do that? Is it your eco technology which is quite differentiated from others? And Chuck, why is it that you think you'll eventually fall back in line to just growing at industry levels? And then just a follow-on on your glass business, you seem to have an improving outlook there both from a volume and raw materials standpoint. Is now the time to monetize glass or do you think that there is further improvements to come?
Chuck Bunch: Well on the auto OEM side first, Don, I would say that I think we've been benefiting from some technology developments especially as they apply to new plants in the developing regions. So we were well-positioned there to take advantage of brand-new plants that were converting to newer technologies. So I think it was a good fit with the technologies and position that we had and we've been growing nicely with some of the most successful companies on a global basis. So we were well-positioned with some of the customers that we’re growing the fastest so that we have been the beneficiary there in what has been overall a very good period for global automotive growth not only here or in China, but in general we've seen good growth trends for the industry and we think that we're positioned to do that over the next couple of years. But as we look at the competitive arena, these companies that we're competing with either globally or on a regional basis are capable organizations so that I would say that over time we would expect that the growth trends for our company would be similar to what we're seeing in the global industry growth trends. And the second question is the glass business; yes the flat glass business and we've been talking about this for the last several quarters. We've finally seen some improving trends there. We had obviously one disposition of one of our glass plants here in North America to Fuyao and we think that business in particular is positioned to improve results as we go through 2015. As we have talked about in the past, these businesses are let's call them less core and we continue, as we did with this sale to Fuyao, we continue to look for opportunities to create shareholder value in these businesses. So if we see the right opportunity or the right transaction in either this flat glass business or the fiberglass business we will certainly proceed and the timing at least if these trends continue will certainly be better than some of the things that we've faced over the last couple of years and we said we were going to be patient. So we're going to wait and see. This is still early days in the recovery, but very good trends here.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America. Go ahead, Kevin.
Kevin McCarthy: Just a question for Mike, I was wondering if you could provide an update on your execution against your plans to increase store count in the U.S. and Canada as you had outlined back in May in Dallas. What have you done so far and how much do you see ahead for 2015?
Michael McGarry: Sure, Kevin, for 2014, we increased our store count by 35 through acquisition and 17 new. So that's a total of 52 plus 13 in Canada and then we also grew stores in Europe and of course with Comex they also added 174 concessionaires of which 32 of them were in the November/December timeframe. For next year, for 2015 that is, we have a count between 25 and 50 for the full year.
Kevin McCarthy: And then I guess a broader question. On slide 5 of your deck, you illustrate trends by geography and it just strikes me that in Asia and Latin America you've had a very steady pattern of acceleration there. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color as to what's driving that either by country or product line.
Chuck Bunch: So page 5, in Asia if we start there, Kevin -- the big growth driver for us has been China and we've had a number of end-use markets that have continued to perform well for us, automotive OEM, the refinish business the protective and marine coatings had good growth in industrial and businesses or segments like automotive parts. So we have been well-positioned in Asia and in Latin America I would say the biggest trend has continued to be the Mexican automotive and industrial end-use market where we've continued to perform well and that's not including this Comex acquisition. So let's call it the core or legacy PPG business in Mexico has continued to perform well. The South American market has been a little spottier, especially with the currency weakness, but most of that growth in that region has come out of our core legacy PPG business in Mexico.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS.
John Roberts: How much of the pension cost increase is interest expense and how much is this mortality rate change and what triggered that since I don't think you've done that before?
Frank Sklarsky: It's about half-and-half between the impact of the interest rates and the impact on mortality. The mortality tables do not get updated that often, but every several years folks that publish these things for corporate America do that and those came out in the fall. Folks like Mercer and other consultants, they go back-and-forth with this thing and negotiate what they think the most reasonable assumptions will be and then they get published to the world and so that's why it's rather infrequent on that element. The other element, the interest, is really based every year on the December 31 rate that's associated with a basket of debt securities that matches the maturity of our liability payouts to our participants. And that rate which is about 4.8% at the end of 2013 dropped to about 4% even at the end of 2014 which nobody would've expected at the beginning of last year, but that dynamic had an impact of $30 million of the $60 million of what we're looking for in terms of a headwind for 2015.
John Roberts: But that mortality rate change then will be an industrywide adoption that Mercer has now rolled out across most companies?
Frank Sklarsky: Yes, you're going to see that amongst a number of companies because we almost all of us use the same tables.
John Roberts: Okay and then secondly, the specialty coatings and materials segment last quarter, I think it was up -- not segment -- but the specialty coatings and materials SBU within Industrial Coatings, I think it was up double-digit last quarter and now it's mid-single. Is that just a more difficult comp that's there or what caused the deceleration there?
Chuck Bunch: There was no deceleration. I would say we have a variety of -- that's called specialty coatings products and optical products that are in some cases tied into the electronics material value chain. So this can cause some lumpiness in terms of quarterly sales because of seasonal trends for equipment, electronic equipment and alike, but there was no underlying business weakness issues, that was just more of a seasonal pattern.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo.
Sabina Chatterjee: It's Sabina Chatterjee in for Frank Mitsch today. Just going back to the cash question, how should we think about the pace of the $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion program? It's also a pretty wide range, so if you could just talk us through the factors that put you perhaps at the high versus low end that would be great.
Frank Sklarsky: I think that if you look at the entirety of everything, we've always taken that balanced capital allocation strategy and we've said that acquisitions and share repurchase are really the two pieces of that and the allocation between those two will depend upon the acquisition pipeline and the pace of execution of that acquisition pipeline. So in any given quarter, you might see more of one, less of the other. We've said consistently that share repurchase will continue to be part of our capital allocation strategy. So chances are we will be in the market on a relatively consistent basis on that element, but what might drive the number of higher versus lower would be again at any time we might be in the market with share repurchase, but also could potentially have an acquisition come over the transom and reach completion in any given quarter. As we also said before, we really don't have a limitation in terms of our cash domicile because we have enough tax-planning strategies to have the cash where we need it when we need it to execute this magnitude of returning cash to shareholders or doing acquisitions.
Sabina Chatterjee: Okay, and then on that topic of acquisitions you mentioned a pretty active pipeline. Where are you seeing the greatest opportunities either by product or region?
Chuck Bunch: Well, as you saw, Sabina, in 2014, we were fortunate that here in North America we were able to get a couple of smaller deals done in architectural and protective and marine coatings and then the big one here in the fourth quarter at Comex. So I would say that we're still seeing discussions and opportunities in every region, maybe for different reasons, but many of these companies, the small to medium sized companies that have been the core acquisition targets, they are moved by, in some cases, either succession planning issues or concerns around market weakness and alike. So for different reasons we're seeing discussions going on around the world. So I would say that we think as you saw after all these deals that we did in North America in 2013, 2014 and the announcement that we had in the fourth quarter around REVOCOAT, that's a European acquisition. So I think that shows you that we're engaged around the world and I would say that the patterns probably will continue this year.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Go ahead, sir.
Arun Viswanathan: I just had a couple questions. I guess first off, it appears that maybe one of the bigger risks that people are worried about here is Europe and in general industrial. So maybe you can talk a little bit about both, first off general industrial globally and then also as it relates specifically to Europe.
Chuck Bunch: For us, I feel that our general industrial business performed well in 2014. Not every end-use market was as strong, it depended on the region. Most of the businesses were strong here in North America. In Europe, you still had some growth in automotive and automotive parts for a number of our industrial businesses are still some of the strongest end-use markets. Some markets specifically here in the U.S. you see the construction market is stronger, so we've performed well there. So I would say as we looked on for the full year of 2014, our Industrial Coatings or general industrial business did well overall even if not all the markets were growing at a consistent basis over all the regions. And in Europe, we saw some weakness there overall in growth rates, especially compared to some of the other regions, but we've worked hard in Europe to become more productive focused on our costs. The automotive business in Europe hasn't been a strong growth market, but it has grown low single digit percentages and we've been able to take advantage of again our technology and service capabilities. So we feel pretty good about the business overall and going into 2015 as well.
Arun Viswanathan: And then on the performance side, just wondering about aerospace, you've been clipping at higher single digits there. Is there any -- what's the outlook given potential for deliveries on both the OEM side and then also for aftermarket? And then if you have any comments further on refinish as well that would be great. Thanks.
Michael McGarry: This is Michael. We still see very positive trends in the aerospace business. So I don't think that's going to change going forward. Our refinish business, we had I would call mixed results. The U.S. was by far the strongest and when you look at the trends that are driving that to lower gas prices, that's a positive, unemployment dropping that's a positive. Truck rate going up that's a positive, more congestion that's a positive. So I think we're going to continue to see good volume in our refinish business, but they are doing well in our light industrial and our commercial transport side. So overall, we're still very bullish on both of those businesses.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Kevin Hocevar from Northcoast Research. Go ahead, Kevin.
Kevin Hocevar: I'm wondering if you could provide us an outlook for your U.S. architectural paint business either by channel or by contractor and DIY market for 2015.
Michael McGarry: I would tell you that if you start with the macro, we're looking at housing starts being up 100,000, so that should be a positive. We're looking at the commercial market continuing to grow. The backlog is still there with our commercial painters. The dealer segment has been a declining segment, so we would expect that to decline 1% or 2% again. The big boxes should have modest growth as well, so I think overall I think you can probably draw a picture of what that overall trend line looks like.
Kevin Hocevar: Okay. And then just as my follow-up, you mentioned if lower oil prices are sustained, it could help stimulate EMEA growth. I was wondering if you're seeing any signs of that at all right now in any of your product lines, maybe those tied closer to the consumer or is that more of just potential to happen down the road?
Chuck Bunch: I think it's more a potential. I think that's going to drive overall consumer spending if this continues. The shortest term impact in our business directly, we do sell into the oil and gas business in a couple of our businesses notably fiberglass for pipe or protective and marine has a component of their business which is directly tied to the oil and gas industry. We haven't seen -- in the fourth quarter, we didn't see any declines there for the most part, but we're watching now, sometimes maintenance rates actually go up a little bit during periods of lower activity. But I would say we're watching that, let's call it limited exposure to that market and I think the longer-term benefits of these lower gasoline prices here or in Europe we think they should start showing up here as we go through this year. Certainly you're seeing it at the pump with the prices and that's going to keep more dollars in the pockets of the ultimate consumers and give them more opportunities to increase spending across many, many categories. As you know in the coatings world, we're exposed to a broad range of end-use markets. So we think that should be positive for us and the industry.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from Jim Sheehan from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Go ahead, Jim.
Jim Sheehan: In your commentary on industrial coatings, you mentioned consistent year-over-year global auto OEM industry growth for cash for the first quarter. I'm just wondering is that consistent with the fourth quarter trend or the 2014 full-year trend or if maybe you could be more specific.
Chuck Bunch: Well, I think we feel that 2015 is shaping up similar to the growth rates that we saw in the fourth quarter. Those were maybe slightly lower than the full-year 2014, but we're still looking for a positive growth here in the U.S. of North American market, China as well. Europe is going to we think still grow, but at a very modest level. So I would say it's closer to the growth rates that we saw in the fourth quarter.
Jim Sheehan: And what's your outlook for global industrial production that's in your assumptions?
Frank Sklarsky: 3% to 4%.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Nils Wallin from CLSA. Go ahead, sir.
Nils Wallin: Just on volumes in Europe versus earnings growth, one of the lowest volume growth regions, but obviously one of the biggest earnings growth regions. Clearly you have taken a lot of cost out of that business. Is that earnings growth entirely due to operating leverage or is there some other mix effect in there and can that continue to grow at that pace with provided volumes stay at these low levels?
Frank Sklarsky: It's definitely primarily the operating leverage and in the slide deck, you saw where we stand in terms of the volumes versus where we were pre-recessionary levels and we're still high teens below peak levels. So there is ample open capacity, capacity utilization capability in the EMEA region so that we can still accrete earnings at that 30% to 40% for every dollar to the bottom line. And as Chuck made some comments on the general industrial business, as that improves, as we continue to do well at high single digits in the aerospace business in that region and as things improve in the packaging sector, we also expect to accrete margins at a nice level because there is ample open capacity and good fixed cost leverage throughout 2015 and probably beyond.
Nils Wallin: And then just as a follow-up, more on M&A, certainly in the last year and a half, Akzo and Comex transactions were pretty unique opportunities immediately accretive which isn't always the case. How are you thinking about the opportunities going forward? Do all of them also look to be immediately accretive and what's your appetite for maybe not having an immediately accretive transaction?
Chuck Bunch: Well, I think a lot of the deals that we've been looking at are the small to medium-sized acquisition opportunities and there depending on the levels of synergy, we can see accretive transactions and so that's not necessarily a hard and fast rule for us and it has certainly played out in these recent transactions, but it just depends on what we feel is the best opportunity. Many of them we think we should be accretive over that first year or two after the acquisition, but not always in the first quarter or so. So we will continue to look at all of them, although we like the immediately accretive ones. It makes the discussions go a lot easier with our shareholders and analysts.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Dmitry Silversteyn from Longbow. Go ahead, Dmitry.
Dmitry Silversteyn: 2015 I think as of January French law mandates the absence of BPA in food packaging and cans and things like that and this was an event that you and others in the industry have looked forward to. Now that it's here, sort of what impact do you expect it to have on your European packaging business and your packaging business overall in 2015?
Michael McGarry: As far as France, we are getting inside-the-can wins, we’re running commercial batches. It is going well; the customers are pleased with it. We also have BPA non-intent coatings commercially running in this space as well and those customers are happy as well. So this is going to be a trend that's going to continue probably slowly. It's not going to just jump right up. This is an area that we gave up line time in 2014 so that we could position ourselves to grow as a once in a generation change inside the can. As you know, we have very little share inside the can, so these are all positive moves for our packaging business. And I'm sure you saw that we had that positive volume in the fourth quarter as well. So I think it's looking up for us.
Dmitry Silversteyn: Okay. So to sort of extrapolate Chuck's comments on 2015 being more like or possibly being more like the fourth quarter of 2014, should we expect stronger growth in the packaging business throughout the year as well?
Michael McGarry: I think we'll see continuing volume growth modestly throughout the year.
Dmitry Silversteyn: And then my follow-up question, broadly on EMEA, you've delivered very positive growth in the first half of the year. It slowed down a little bit in the second half of the year, but you still came out a little bit ahead. Is it possible for you given what's going on with the economy now and while you're waiting for the potential low oil prices to kick in to perhaps better economic activity later in the year, but is it possible for you to sustain positive volume growth in Europe in 2015? Is that part of your expectation going in?
Chuck Bunch: I think it is possible for us to have positive volume growth. If you look at the GDP forecasts for Europe, they are not robust, but they are slightly positive so we can hope at this point to see positive volume growth. We're going to really also closely focus on our costs and productivity in Europe going forward. If we see the trends not improving as we've shown in the past, we will go after additional cost-reduction opportunities there or anywhere else in the world to keep this momentum going.
Frank Sklarsky: Dmitry, the only thing I'd add to that, Chuck is absolutely right. The team over there is optimistic that we can look at modest growth consistent with 1% to 2% GDP industrial production projections over there, but keep in mind we're about 15 percentage points plus down on the exchange rate versus where we were last year. Current rate is about 117 on the euro versus high 120s, low 130s last year at this time.
Dmitry Silversteyn: No, no, I absolutely understand the foreign exchange portion. I was just looking at the price volume/mix organic growth. Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Christopher Perrella from Bloomberg Intelligence. Go ahead, Christopher.
Christopher Perrella: Could you just outline your outlook for growth in the Mexican architectural paint market for 2015?
Michael McGarry: We're looking at the economy growing between 3% and 4%. We have higher expectations than that for our PPG Comex business so I think you could probably take 1.5 times that, as much as even two times that. We're really seeing that they've done well.
Christopher Perrella: All right and how much of the synergies have you already captured with the Comex acquisition?
Michael McGarry: It's very small. We said we'd get $30 million to $40 million and we fully anticipate getting all of that.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Richard O'Reilly from Revere Associates.
Richard O'Reilly: Two quick questions, both follow-ups, the first is on the raw material comments that was a good explanation you gave, Vince. On the basket of goods, the other 80% of that, how much would be tied to like diesel fuel for shipping, resins for packaging? I mean there must be great opportunity for savings there.
Chuck Bunch: Rich, our freight costs for the corporation are somewhere between 7% and 10% of our total cost bucket. A portion of that, just a portion of that is diesel-related. We do expect diesel prices to roll through the transportation bucket at some point, but it's a portion again of 7% of our total cost bucket. We also have another call it mid-single digit percentage from packaging materials. Some of those are oil-derived, some of those aren't. Again, as Chuck mentioned, as we get further and further out from the oil wellhead, some of those take much longer to work their way through the system.
Richard O'Reilly: Okay. And the second question is I think you still own a piece of the Auto Glass venture and the equity owners must have owned it now for several years. Do you know of any change in their thinking of their ownership structure?
Michael McGarry: We sold 62% of that on September 30, 2008. We did sell a small portion of that, the insurance and services business earlier this year which we did net out a gain. Right now, our partner is Kohlberg. They continue to look at everything. I would tell you it is business as usual.
Chuck Bunch: But the sale was actually in 2014.
Michael McGarry: For the insurance and services.
Richard O'Reilly: For the extra, okay, fine. So business as usual. Good, thank you for those answers.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Vince Morales for closing remarks. Thank you.
Vince Morales : Once again, we would like to thank everybody for their interest in PPG. If there are any further questions please contact me in the Investor Relations function. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Thank you.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Third Quarter 2014 PPG Industries Earnings Conference Call. My name is Jenada and I will be your operator for today. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Vince Morales. Please proceed.
Vince Morales: Thank you, Jenada, and good afternoon everybody. Again, this is Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations for PPG industries. We appreciate your interest and welcome you to teleconference to review our third quarter 2014 financial results.

The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which again are available on the website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information please refer to our filings with the SEC. Now let me introduce PPG Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch.
Chuck Bunch: Thank you, Vince, and welcome everyone. Today, we reported third quarter 2014 financial results including record third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $2.82 and record third quarter sales from continuing operations of $3.94 billion. Our sales improved 4%, a rate of growth similar to the second quarter. Our higher sales were primarily due to higher volumes which grew 3% in the quarter in comparison to strengthening prior-year results. We achieved higher volumes in all major regions. However, the regional results remain uneven. Year-over-year volume growth was highest in North America and Asia, both about 4% as volume gains accelerated in both regions versus previous quarters. European volumes advanced slightly less than 1%. We continue to benefit from customer adoption of our leading technologies, our higher sales were driven by volume growth in aerospace, automotive OEM coatings and automotive refinish where the growth rate this quarter matched or exceeded the prior quarter's results. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.82 improved 22% versus the prior year. We once again achieved record earnings in each major region. Our European earnings were up 17% and North America and emerging regions advanced 10%. The earnings increase was a result of the improvement in sales along with an improved business mix. In addition, we’ve maintained our ongoing cost discipline in all of our businesses. Earnings per share growth also benefited from cash used for acquisitions including savings stemming from achievement of additional acquisition-related synergies. Cash deployed on share repurchases was also a contributing factor. We repurchased $150 million or about 740,000 shares in the quarter and $450 million or about 2.4 million shares year-to-date. In the quarter, our average diluted shares outstanding were more than 3.5% lower versus the previous year's third quarter. As I mentioned earlier, the pace of demand varied by region. In North America, we benefited from continued moderate economic expansion. Industrial activity remained solid, including higher regional automotive OEM coatings, aerospace and overall general industrial demand. Volumes in our businesses serving these markets were up mid to high single-digit percentages. Architectural Coatings sales were up low single-digits supported by higher U.S. sales in our company-owned stores and national DIY retailers and were partly offset by modestly lower demand in Canada. Also supporting the sales increase were signs of an initial modest recovery in non-residential or commercial construction which also was a factor in our improved flat glass sales during the quarter. In addition to the higher sales the 10% regional earnings improvement included benefits from additional acquisition related cost synergies from last year's North American Architectural Coatings acquisition. I have been pleased with our progress on this acquisition and we now expect to complete nearly all of the significant synergy actions by year-end more than one year ahead of schedule. In Europe, our results were mixed geographically within the region as well as by end use market. Our sales grew about 2% including slight volume growth of less than 1% in comparison with improving prior year sales. Currency translation was not a factor in the quarter as the three-month average euro exchange rate essentially matched the previous year. The euro weakened versus the dollar late in the quarter and based on current rates we expect euro currency translation to have a larger impact in the fourth quarter. In the region PPG continued to benefit from growth in the industrial and automotive markets coupled with improving aerospace demand. Our Architectural Coatings volumes in the region were down slightly declining 1%. We had solid architectural demand growth in the UK and Eastern Europe which was offset by modestly lower results in other countries including France where volumes were down low single-digit percentages and were consistent with results earlier in the year. Also important with respect to Europe is that demand in the region was generally consistent throughout the month of September. With regard to emerging regions, our sales in Asia were up 5% including 4% volume growth. Growth was broad-based spanning across nearly all PPG businesses in this region and was also led by industrial and automotive markets. Additionally, our Marine new build volumes were up very modestly as this industry begins to recover from several years of activity declines. In Latin America, which is our smallest region representing about 5% of our sales, regional volumes grew low single-digit percentages aided by higher automotive demand, but were offset by lower results in other businesses. Strategically in the quarter we completed the sale of a North American flat glass manufacturing facility and our automotive glass equity affiliate sold one of its business lines with both divestiture transactions generating onetime gains. We also continue to work on customary actions related to our pending acquisition of Comex. Let me take a few moments to give you an update on the Comex acquisition activities that have occurred since we signed the acquisition agreement. We submitted a formal filing with the Mexican Competition Commission requesting approval of the transaction within a few days of the acquisition announcement. Over the past few months we have responded to customary formal and informal information requests from the Competition Commission. Last week the Commission issued a time extension on their transaction review, without this extension the Competition Commission would have been required to rule on the regulatory filing within the coming days. This extension was anticipated and was included in our original projected four to six months’ timeline. We continue to anticipate that the Commission will complete their review and that we will close the transaction in the fourth quarter as we previously expected. Economic growth trends in Mexico remain very solid and we are looking forward to working with Comex's customers and employees. Looking ahead, while we are watchful of the pace of global economic expansion, we remain confident in our ability to deliver continued solid earnings growth driven by the ongoing momentum we have established in the many key end use markets. Additionally, we are just now beginning to benefit from an initial recovery in several long cycle industries including North American commercial construction and marine new build activity in Asia which had previously detracted from our overall growth. The fourth quarter is historically our slowest quarter seasonally and we anticipate normal seasonal trends will occur in our businesses this year. The fourth quarter is also traditionally our strongest cash generation period and we continue to maintain a high degree of financial flexibility as we ended the third quarter with $3 billion of cash and short-term investments. Including the pending Comex acquisition we will likely spend at or above the top end of our previously communicated range of $3 billion to $4 billion of cash in years 2014 and 2015 combined on acquisitions and share repurchases. Our acquisition pipeline remains active and share repurchases are expected to remain an integral part of our cash deployment including additional repurchases in the fourth quarter. This concludes our prepared remarks. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG. And now operator would you please open a line for questions?
Operator: (Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from the line of John McNulty with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
John McNulty - Credit Suisse: Chuck, maybe you can give us an update – we’ve seen oil prices come off pretty dramatically. I know you have got a lot of derivative exposure to that. Can you give us an update or a reminder as to what that exposure is? And then also, I know there are some outages around some of the derivatives that you use out there, but typically how quickly -- when we see a big oil price move, how quickly do we see it actually impact your cost overall? Thanks.
Chuck Bunch: I would say overall historically on our organic raw material purchases, when you see it at -- let's call it these wellhead prices you’re going to typically wait at least a quarter or two to see that begin to appear in some of the downstream products. So it would not be immediate benefit other than in -- we hope to see it a little more quickly in our transportation and distribution costs which have been one of the sources of this low single-digit inflation rate that we’ve been experiencing over the course of the last year or so.
John McNulty - Credit Suisse: And then maybe as a follow-up, I think you had indicated in the U.S. your stores business for PPG legacy businesses had upper single-digit volumes. Can you give us an update as to what the Akzo stores that you actually maintained through the full year or roughly for the full year, what their year-over-year sales growth was as well? If you're seeing any loss of business there or any improvements there?
Michael McGarry: John, those legacy Akzo stores were minus low single-digits. We have started to put the PPG products into those stores so the momentum has turned around and we saw increased sales out of those stores each month in the quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Matt Gingrich - Morgan Stanley: Hi, this is Matt Gingrich on behalf of Vincent. I was wondering if you could speak more to the inflationary cost pressures that you’re seeing in your performance segment including the higher logistics cost that you noted in the release.
Chuck Bunch: Well, I would say that we’re saying low single-digit inflation rates led by wages and benefits followed by distribution and transportation cost that I referred to. We've seen I would say also very modest raw material increases, but these were in some of our organic raw material chains on propylene and ethylene side balanced off by some of what I would say benign raw material environments for our other key inputs.
Matt Gingrich - Morgan Stanley: And then to follow up in regards to your North American Architectural Coatings business, I was wondering if you could talk more about how the independent channel performed over the last quarter.
Michael McGarry: So the dealer network was down very slightly and that has historically been a contracting segment for us and so it is consistent with our expectations.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Research. Please proceed.
Don Carson - Susquehanna Research: Chuck, a question, you mentioned that you've got some long cycle businesses starting to turn non-residential construction North America and then the marine business. Can you talk about what your exposure to non-residential construction is in North America, specifically in the architectural paints business? And I noticed new marine builds are finally showing a little growth. What kind of trajectory do you see in the recovery in that business?
Chuck Bunch: For Architectural Coatings on commercial construction typically is between 20% and 25% of the Architectural Coatings mix here in North America, some of that new construction, some of that repaint. So I would say that is the market that has been very quiet over the last few years even coming out of the recession and that’s where we are seeing some improvement both on the Architectural Coatings side as well as what we mentioned as the flat glass business where we’re starting -- where we have more exposure directly to that end use market. On the marine new build which is about 25% historically of our protective and marine coatings business unit. I would say that the improvement is early stages low single-digit improvement, but as we've been talking over the last almost now couple of years, that had a very sharp retrenchment. So it's good to see the improvement going in the right direction even if it's somewhat modest at this point.
Don Carson - Susquehanna Research: Just as a follow-up, on Comex is there any provision to reprice that acquisition given the recent drop in equity markets?
Chuck Bunch: To reprice? Excuse me, Don what's that?
Don Carson - Susquehanna Research: Well any price adjustment that you could see on Comex given that obviously valuations have come down dramatically since you made your first offer.
Chuck Bunch: No, at this point we are not envisioning any repricing of the acquisition and their performance as we've monitored it since the time of the acquisition has continued to be quite strong.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed.
Ghansham Panjabi - Baird: Just first off on sort of the macro mosaic, Chuck, any sort of high level comments as to what you are seeing specifically occur? Maybe conversations with your customers just given the mixed data out there? And then also for 3Q specifically I know you called out volumes during that last conference call for the month of May. Was there anything unusual for 3Q?
Chuck Bunch: No. So first, if we just look at business activity kind of across the end use markets with our customers and again it's been more of a regional mix or a regional story. So the North American businesses have remained quite strong as we have been talking aerospace, automotive OEM, we are seeing construction activity that has been I think consistently growing, initially residential, now we’re seeing it also more broadly on the construction side. So I would say, so the key end-use markets here in North America continue to be strong, especially here in the U.S. What we have seen in the rest of the world is some moderation of some of the strongest growth trends. We had seen some modest improvement in Europe over the first couple of quarters. Those trends I would say have continued but probably at a slightly more modest level, although the third quarter for us was still consistent with what we had seen earlier in the year. Asia has been, especially China, a good story for us especially in these consumer businesses that -- where we look at the end use market growth in an automotive OEM, automotive refinish packaging. These have been solid growth stories in the Chinese market. We see some improvement starting in India. South America or Latin America for us, outside of that automotive OEM and industrial space not growing as much in terms of construction activity. So we’re still going through both in Latin America and in Europe some moderation on the construction side and some slightly weaker currencies in both of those markets.
Ghansham Panjabi - Baird: Okay and then just in terms of Performance Coatings, did the operating margins come in where you thought they would for the quarter? I'm just wondering why there was a drop off versus the second quarter level.
Chuck Bunch: I think the operating margins were good. Typically in the third quarter you don't see as strong of margin or sales growth because of August being a slower month in Europe and those three months versus the second quarter in the architectural business is generally not quite as strong. But I would say otherwise we felt that it was a good performance in that group of businesses.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Neal Sangani - Goldman Sachs: This is Neal Sangani on for Bob. Some of the industry data out there showed a pretty significant deceleration in Chinese auto sales in September. Did you see something similar in that market? And what might the growth look like in China for the fourth quarter versus the strong 10% you saw in the third?
Chuck Bunch: We saw some of the data that came out in the third quarter. First two months of the quarter were quite strong and from a production or build standpoint which is where our sales are tied, we continued to see good growth. We feel have the momentum with some of the strongest performers in China in terms of automotive demand and at this point we’re seeing solid growth at the 5% to 7.5% kind of growth rates which were what we anticipated as we went into the year.
Neal Sangani - Goldman Sachs:  Great, and your skeptical outlook for (indiscernible) price hikes in the back half earlier this year looks to have been pretty accurate. At this point do you sense whether you might see some price inflation in 2015?
Chuck Bunch: That’s probably a little early to say, but I think right now we’re seeing very consistent flat pricing in some of those inorganic materials.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America. Please proceed.
Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: On a regional basis volume looks like it was the slowest in Europe, up less than 1%, and yet your earnings increased at the fastest pace at plus 17%. Can you elaborate on why that’s the case? Presumably costs are part of it. If things slowdown from here are there additional levers that you can pull on the cost side going forward?
Chuck Bunch: Well, I would say, Kevin, first on the volume side we did have a little bit stronger first quarter this year and I think we talked about it early in our calls that we had very favorable weather. We had, we think, some things that probably pulled some of that business forward for us. In the first quarter I would say the Architectural Coatings businesses in the third quarter probably a little weaker in terms of overall end use markets and we mentioned a couple of the Southern European markets including France were a little weaker. But we still are finishing up I would say the restructuring actions and the costs that we have continued to pull out of that business. It has been a very benign market in terms of inflationary cost more so than what you have seen generally out of Europe in terms of inflation. So we think that there are still some things that we can continue to affect in Europe to continue to be more efficient, more productive. And so, I would say that even in this very low volume environment we’re expecting to continue to drive more productivity and cost actions.
Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay and then as a follow-up Chuck, given the downdraft in the equity markets, do you see any potential to accelerate the pace of share repurchases relative to the 150 million that you bought back in the third quarter?
Chuck Bunch: We would anticipate, Kevin that we are going to be buying at a higher level here in the fourth quarter. During the second and third quarters we sat out a little bit of those periods from share buyback activities because we were waiting on to see if the transactions would develop or were out of the market. So I would say that we’re going to be continuing share buyback activities in the fourth quarter at a higher level. And we're obviously aware of the lower equity values for us and the market in general. So that could provide an additional opportunity to be a little more aggressive on share buybacks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: Chuck, you mentioned FX being a headwind Q4. Would you care to try to quantify the impact of the weaker euro on your operations both maybe top-line and bottom-line in Q4?
Frank Sklarsky: So if you look at the euro where we have the most significant impact. Canadian is somewhat less of an impact, but the big impact is the euro and I would say if the rates were to stay where they are now as compared to our plan which is basically in line with where we were last year at this time, you are talking about $60 million to $70 million of impact on the top line mostly from translation. The impact on the bottom line is more muted because we do have that natural hedge with our manufacturing and overhead infrastructure in the same region. So you’re looking at an EBIT or PTPI impact of single digits millions of dollars on that 60 million to 70 million on the top-line.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: And Chuck, just in terms nearer term trends, especially Europe, has October seen a pickup in demand either in the industrial businesses or architectural versus September?
Chuck Bunch: I would say, as I think I described our third quarter activity as September was consistent with normal seasonal trends coming off a slightly weaker August but a slightly stronger July here in the early part of October. I would consider the trends to be normal in our European operations.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.
Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities: And I guess normal in Europe is very positive these days. Hey, Chuck, you talked before about seeing marine starting to improve. Can you give us some orders of magnitude? How far down has it come over the past few years? And what sort of a recovery are we seeing there so we can have an idea as to how long that might play out?
Chuck Bunch: Well, I would say the new build activity which was again about 25% of our protective and marine business unit which let's call it rounding a $1 billion business. And we were down over 30% in that market and as I mentioned this is just the beginning of what we think will be a modest but longer term recovery. So, we are up in the third quarter low single-digits in terms of recovery. But it is a positive sign, we feel, that the market has hit bottom and is coming back.
Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities: So the expectation is that you could get back over the next two years 20% to 25% or so to get back to where normalized would be?
Chuck Bunch: I think if you look at the longer term trends and you are talking over the next -- this has been probably a trend that's -- the decline has been probably over three years. So if you look at a longer three to four year period I think we can get back to those kinds of production levels but over that kind of timeframe.
Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities: And then you mentioned in the prepared comments about the strong M&A pipeline. Are there particular regions or product areas that you are preferentially going to outside of Mexico of course?
Chuck Bunch: Yes. Well I would say is I commented earlier, although almost all of the acquisition, the modest acquisition activity that we have had this year, almost all of that has been here in North America and that is similar again to the target market for Comex. We see good discussions going on around the world probably now more balanced in the emerging region. So again discussions both in Asia, Latin America and Europe where maybe the levels of confidence over the last few years not quite as strong and this could provide us some opportunities going forward to make some key acquisitions over the next year or so.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets: I guess first question is on aerospace. Do see the growth rates there slowing at all or is there a chance that they could take actually accelerate when you kind of get more content on the 787?
Chuck Bunch: I think if you look at production levels now both at Airbus and Boeing and the backlogs that we see, I think you’re going to see a maintenance of this continued trend that we have seen in commercial aviation, some improvement we hope in on the defense or military side of this. Airline profitability had to also been improving, so we were expecting and are hoping to see more improvement on what I would call that commercial aviation aftermarket. So in general I think the trends are positive and growing, although commercial aviation build rates I think are at a very good level now and will probably get slightly better from here, but I don't see a major step change now with the build rates that they have.
Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets: And then on -- packaging has been lagging a little bit relative to the other businesses for a couple quarters. What is kind of that strategy here to turn things around or is it more market driven? Thanks.
Chuck Bunch: I would say it's both market driven and positioning of our business. So we’re very committed to the packaging coatings market, it’s been one of our best markets. We are going to be aggressive in this business to make sure that the new technologies that are coming in with the BPA free coatings, that we have we think an excellent opportunity to grow our position in the market. And so, we are taking the view that our participation and growth in packaging coatings albeit a mature market overall other than in the emerging regions is going to improve and increase as we go forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Edlain Rodriguez with UBS. Please proceed.
Edlain Rodriguez - UBS: Chuck, one quick question on auto OEM, you continue to outpace the industry rate and I think previously you had mentioned that technology is the key driver. If that’s the case should we expect that outperformance should continue in the foreseeable future?
Chuck Bunch: We still feel that we have very good momentum in the business both -- at all layers and in all regions, but especially where we have seen a lot of new automotive assembly operations. We are still very optimistic on the Chinese automotive market. We think we are still in the middle stages of very good growth in that market and we’re seeing our water-based technologies, our compact processes that eliminate one of the primer coating layers, our electro-deposition primers that are world class and new over the last two years in terms of corrosion protection and efficiency for the automotive manufacturers. We see these trends continuing, so we feel good about our position and the opportunities to continue to grow nicely in our business on the backs of these technological innovations.
Edlain Rodriguez - UBS: Okay and just to follow-up. As you talk about that initial recovery in commercial construction, I mean how confident are you that this is for real? And are there any risks there for something to go wrong?
Chuck Bunch: Well, you know I think that commercial construction has been probably lagging for now I would say 5 or 6 years here in North America. And if you look at the architectural billing indexes, many of the commercial construction indicators are beginning to turn around, we have discussed kind of the order book and backlog for our flat glass business which is one of the best indicators out there and our improving activity levels in Architectural Coatings. So at this point here in the U.S. market I think the trends are there. Can things occur that derail it? Possibly. Interest rates are at this point still quite benign here in this market. Employment levels, another important indicator, they are up here in the U.S. So I think the commercial construction market here looks solid. And in some of the other regions we haven't seen as much of a lag and we’re not expecting as much of a push now in markets like Europe or China from commercial construction, although we think the markets are -- have at this point normal activity levels, but we’re seeing the opportunity for improvement here in the U.S. market. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please proceed.
George D'Angelo - Jefferies: This is George D'Angelo on for Laurence today. Could you guys provide an update on margins in the Akzo business and where you are seeing that over year-end going?
Michael McGarry: It's consistent with where we saw it in the second quarter, so it's low double-digits right now which is a significant improvement from this marginally negative number they had when we bought it.
George D'Angelo - Jefferies: And just a follow-up, I know this is a question you guys have gotten in the past but glass is a non-core business. Are you guys open to selling it? And if so when would you sell it?
Chuck Bunch: Well we haven't really put a timetable on it. As we have stated in the past on many of our non-coatings businesses, we would be open to discussions or transactions that create value for our shareholders but we do not have any discussions going at this point on those businesses.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research: Just a couple of questions if I may, can you give us a little bit of detail, you talked about the Chinese market being a strong market for you in consumer products, you mentioned auto OEM and auto aftermarket. Can you talk about the architectural growth both in China specifically but also in Australia and Asia in general?
Michael McGarry: In China in the third quarter we grew low double-digits. So it was a nice performing quarter for us there. Australia we grew mid upper-single-digits. So we had new product launches in Australia, did very well there. So both of those market segments not only grew and also had improving bottom line as well.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research: That is not just on the architectural side, correct?
Michael McGarry: That is on the architectural side specifically. As far as Australia for our other businesses, they also had a very good quarter. It is growing and I would put it more in the low single-digits rates for those businesses and for our Chinese business, as you know, for our other ones it predominantly serves a local market. So it is a growing market. We had success in all our businesses.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research: Okay. If I remember correctly and perhaps I am misremembering, but your Chinese architectural business was not growing as strongly in the first half of the year. If that’s correct and you are seeing low double-digit growth there in the third quarter, sort of what changed given that the economic conditions in China probably didn't change for the better?
Michael McGarry: No, it was growing in the earlier part of the year as well.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research: It was? Okay. I must be misremembering. All right and then just a follow-up--
Michael McGarry: It is a small business, Dmitry, don't forget that.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research: I understand that. On the automotive OEM, Chuck did a very good job outlining sort of the new products and the initiatives that you have driving your above market sales, but if you kind of look at the 3.5% industry sale that you referenced versus a year-ago which was about double that. How much of that incremental growth if you will above the market is driven by the initiatives that -- the PPG initiatives that Chuck described? And how much of it is you being just partnered with your customers that may be gaining share because of faster relative growth of their brand?
Chuck Bunch: Well, we have a fairly broad industry representation. We serve almost all of the global OEMs. We have done quite well in China which is one market where you see a lot of domestic manufacturers, we have done well there and we have seen in some of the markets where we have been well-positioned in markets like North America where you see the truck and SUV markets have been probably the strongest segments. So that has helped us. We also have good participation with the Japanese OEMs outside of Japan and especially here in North America and Europe. And as you see the migration of those Japanese auto builds from a domestic production in Japan exported to the rest of the world, they have put more of their production capacity outside of Japan and that has given us a good opportunity to increase our participation in those Japanese OEMs as they globalize their manufacturing footprint.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan: There have been some I guess changes in ownership in the automotive OEM coatings area and I was wondering is when you look at the evolution of that industry, do you think it will be harder for you to take share or easier or the same? Is the industry competitive climate roughly the same or is it different?
Chuck Bunch: I would say the industry competitive climate has always been -- I would say has always been there. It's been what I would call a high competitive intensity, fewer players but high competitive intensity. We see that continuing and if I look at growth rates and participation in markets in Asia, as an example, I see a continuation of those trends. Although here again we have been able to do well in these markets despite what I would call large global competitors and I expect that activity to continue, Jeff.
Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan: Okay, and then for my follow-up, Europe did slow from 3% to something like flat growth or flat to up growth. Is this a one-off event or when you look at your European business over the next three or four quarters do you expect it to flatten out? You will be up against tougher comparisons because of weather all things being equal and it seems that economic growth has slowed down and will that change your approach to, I don't know removing costs or investing in the business?
Chuck Bunch: Well, if you look at a couple of the macro events in the region and so for us our European business includes Eastern Europe and Russia, it includes the Middle East and Africa. And we think that there has been some moderation obviously of growth in -- our Eastern European business has continued to be good relative to the overall market. Russia has obviously weakened some. The Middle East is a difficult market right now. And in Africa, although it's a smaller part of that overall region for us both with port congestion, Ebola and other things, there are some macro or geopolitical trends right now in Europe that are going to moderate those growth rates. So we’re going to focus more on cost reduction productivity as we have and if we see things beginning to weaken, we will become more active on cost reduction. I think as we said, Europe for us in September and here in early October has been a -- what we would call normal or consistent trends. Certainly we weren't in a high growth rate in any of those markets with the exception of what we experienced I think in the first quarter of this year when we got a little bit of favorable weather that helped the architectural business. So we’re going to hunker down if we need to and work on costs here in Europe to keep this very good earnings trend going even if the growth rates continue to be as modest as they have been this year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of PJ Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed.
PJ Juvekar - Citi: Back in May during your Analyst Day you talked about rebranding in the independent dealer channels. And can you just talk about how is that rollout going and what kind of growth are you seeing in that particular channel?
Michael McGarry: We are starting that as well as the rebranding in the company owned stores. And we said in an earlier question that the independent dealer market was very modestly lower. So I think a minus 1 kind of number to think about. So it has helped, but we haven't rolled it out completely but it is in progress.
PJ Juvekar – Citi: And then in the refinish market there is a big consolidation going on with the multi-shelf operators like Service King. So can you talk to us about what is your position with those customers?
Chuck Bunch: We have a very good position with the multi-shop operators. Service King in particular now -- there is ownership changes I think in that market and with that customer with private equity. But overall PPG's position in North America with multi-shop operators is very strong. There has been consolidation but we have continued to benefit from the trends and it is a growing trend. We think over the next few years to see more consolidation as you move across the value or supply chain in refinish, but right now we feel we are well-positioned in this market to take advantage of any acceleration of the existing trends.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Sheehan with SunTrust. Please proceed.
James Sheehan - SunTrust: Wondering if you could comment on the opportunity in interior can coatings? Could you just size the opportunity for us in 2015?
Chuck Bunch: Seize the opportunity in terms of overall market or sales?
James Sheehan - SunTrust: Overall -- yes, the sales that you might expect to generate, yes.
Chuck Bunch: Well, I would again mention that this is packaging coatings business, important market for us. It's one of our smallest business units, however and traditionally we have been less present on the inside of the can. And if you look overall at the market we’re -- this is probably around on the order of magnitude of less than $5 billion overall market and we think that if you look at the opportunity for us we can probably grow our position by double-digits over the next few years, especially with the introduction of new technologies with BPA free.
James Sheehan - SunTrust: And just on the Comex process, what are the next steps for that? Are you reasonably certain that all the information has been collected and you are just waiting on an answer? Or does there need to be any more hearings? What can we look for?
Michael McGarry: So the way that works is once a week they publish an agenda, so they will publish an agenda Friday, tomorrow for next week. All the questions have been asked and answered. We're obviously waiting on them to put it formally on the agenda. They have not asked any questions in the past 7 to 10 days. So we’re in a wait mode right now. We feel confident that given the fact that we have negligible presence in Mexico that they will look favorably upon this transaction.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA. Please proceed.
Nils Wallin - CLSA: Curious about the effect of raw materials, obviously you highlighted that with oil coming down that you might see some relief on your raw material for the next quarter or two. How will that impact your ability to hold price for your products? Will you be able to hold price for a few quarters after that or will you have to give up price almost immediately too?
Chuck Bunch: Typically, there has been a lag in our industry both on the upside or the downside. But I would tell you oil at the wellhead price is not a direct raw material input for us. So I would tell you that it depends on what's happening downstream in the petrochemical change so that you can get a lower oil price, but it may take a while and then it depends on what is happening in some of our monomer or polymer costs to see when those oil wellhead prices really translate to either lower gasoline or lower propylene cost.
Nils Wallin - CLSA: Understood. Also would you help us -- give a little bit more color what you mean by active when you refer to your active pipeline? Are you seeing more people come to you? Are you seeing more properties with an attractive price? What do you mean by active?
Chuck Bunch: Well active I would describe as; one there is probably more auction activity today. So if you look at kind of the larger space and I'm talking globally now, there is probably now several more auctions or properties that are actively being marketed for sale and they are also good. We always try to have a consistent dialogue with any coatings companies that may potentially now or in the future want to sell and I would say those discussions have been more active. But we’re also seeing auction activities that would demonstrate that the pipeline for us or the activity level in the coatings space is there.
Nils Wallin - CLSA: Understood, and there is just a follow-up. Would you sense that given what you see today in this activity that a year from now there could be an acceleration in how much M&A you have done? Or is it just an indication that the market has sort of -- that has been dry sort of opening up again?
Chuck Bunch: I would say you have seen some transactions announced over the last year. We have done a number of them, probably five or six here almost all in the U.S., smaller transactions. I would say that if the pace of activity continues you are going to see over the course of the next year or two probably similar levels of activity and some larger transactions. And I would say that if you described ours as bolt-ons, I would say that you are going to see some slightly bigger transactions even if they are not kind of megadeals. So I would be surprised if we didn't see more announced transactions both on the part of PPG or potentially others in the market over the next 12 to 18.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Perrella with Bloomberg Intelligence. Please proceed.
Christopher Perrella - Bloomberg Intelligence: A follow-up to the M&A activity with your targeted I guess returning 3 billion to 4 billion through acquisitions and share repurchases, if the acquisition pipeline doesn't pan out as planned would that indicate more share repurchases to hit that $4 billion number by the end of next year?
Chuck Bunch: Yes.
Christopher Perrella - Bloomberg Intelligence: All right, and for the Glass business have you done all the rightsizing of that business? And now the only thing left is for activity volumes to pick up there or are there more levers to pull in Glass?
Chuck Bunch: I think that there are still some more levers to pull as we try to improve the overall performance of the assets and I think we indicated in the third quarter, although we had improving let's call it operating performance in the flat glass business. We still struggled on the fiberglass side with our operation, so there is certainly an opportunity there to improve the performance of that business which is about half of the overall glass business. And I think we have some opportunities more broadly to improve the performance and the asset base of those businesses over the next couple of years.
Christopher Perrella - Bloomberg Intelligence: All right and quickly on Comex. Is there a legal deadline that the Commission has to make a decision on the application?
Michael McGarry: Yes, right now they have to respond by the middle of December.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Eugene Fedotoff with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Eugene Fedotoff - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Just to follow-up on the comments around the glass business. I think you said that natural gas costs were very heavy in the quarter. Do you expect natural gas costs to turn positive in fourth quarter or should prices stay at around the same level?
Vince Morales: Eugene, this is Vince. It will still be a slight negative, but the first quarter last year saw a significant increase in natural gas costs in the first quarter of ‘14. So if prices stay where they are today it would be a tailwind in the first quarter of 2015.
Eugene Fedotoff - KeyBanc Capital Markets: And just a question on U.S. architectural business, the (indiscernible) season it seems like is extending a little bit longer versus last year and you are negotiating some store closing, also doing some rebranding. So are you expecting year-over-year growth to accelerate in that business in fourth quarter?
Michael McGarry: We expect to see continued modest growth in our business in the fourth quarter. But remember, it's a seasonally weaker quarter to begin with as the paint season typically winds down.
Operator: This concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Vince Morales for any closing remarks.
Vince Morales: I just want to again thank everybody for their time and participation today. If there are any further questions please contact me in the Investor Relations function. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

Chuck Bunch - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Vince and welcome everyone. Today, we reported record second quarter 2014 financial results from continuing operations, including all-time quarterly adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.83 and record quarterly sales of $4.1 billion. The benefits of our new business portfolio are measurable as our adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 24% this quarter with an average quarterly increase the past six quarters of more than 30%. We achieved these record results due to our global reach as most major regional economies continue to expand. Our sales growth was 5%, including volume growth of 3%, which was consistent across each major region. In the U.S. and Canada, we continued to see moderate demand increases in most of the end use markets we supply. The overall pace of growth was modest early in the quarter, but accelerated in June. Certain PPG businesses continue to easily outpace the regional economic growth rate such as our automotive OEM business, which grew high single-digit percentages. Our earnings in this region grew 12%, reflecting our increased sales coupled with additional synergies from our prior year architectural coatings acquisition. In Europe, the demand recovery continued and broadened in terms of its PPG impact as more of our businesses achieved volume improvements. The year-over-year pace of sales improvement was slightly lower than the first quarter of 2014 but that was due to the strengthening of the prior year comparison period. We delivered 28% earnings improvement in Europe. We continue to realize excellent earnings contributions from the gradual regional economic improvement illustrating our earnings leverage driven by our previous aggressive cost reduction actions. Europe represents about one-third of our total sales and we expect this earnings leverage to continue. In Asia and Latin America combined earnings grew 14%. In Asia we achieved higher volumes driven by increased automotive OEM and general industrial demand in China and India. Overall Latin American volumes declined slightly with continuing growth in Mexico offset by weakness in South America primarily Brazil. In addition to our continued strong operating performance, our strategic actions and ongoing cash deployment were also notable factors in our earnings growth. As I mentioned earlier we achieved additional acquisition related cost synergies from last year’s North American architectural coatings acquisition. And on a run rate basis we have delivered about 75% of the targeted $200 million synergy target in just 15 months. These include administrative procurement related and operational cost savings plus the earnings benefit from closing about 100 redundant or underperforming company-owned stores in the second half of 2013. We expect the synergy capture to be nearly complete by year end on a run rate basis which keeps us ahead of the schedule. We have also completed several bolt-on acquisitions this year including Canal Supplies, Painter’s Supply, Masterwork and Homax. In aggregate these acquisitions are expected to add about $75 million in annual sales. But most noteworthy on June 30, we announced an agreement to acquire Comex, a leading Latin American architectural and industrial coatings company and one of the highest quality coatings businesses in the world. Let me give you a brief update on the activities that have occurred in just a few weeks following the signing of the acquisition agreement. We held a pre-filing meeting and then submitted a formal filing with the Mexican Competition Commission requesting approval of the transaction. As is customary in transactions of this nature the commission issued a hold order indicating that the transaction needs to remain open pending completion of their review. We continued to anticipate that the commission will complete its work in order for the acquisition to close in four to six months. We are very excited about the value this transaction will bring to PPG and we are looking forward to working with Comex’s customers and employees. With regard to other cash deployment actions we repurchased $100 million or about 500,000 shares of PBG stock in the quarter. We halted share repurchases in the middle of the quarter due to the Comex acquisition negotiations which concluded by quarter end. We ended the quarter with $2.9 billion of cash and short-term investments and we remain highly focused on additional cash deployment for earnings accretive opportunities. We are still targeting earnings accretive cash deployment of $3 billion to $4 billion in 2014 and 2015 combined. Our acquisition pipeline remains active and we expect to complete additional share repurchases in the second half of 2014. Looking ahead, we anticipate moderate global expansion and we remain well positioned geographically and with lower structural costs to deliver excellent earnings performance from the increased global demand. In addition, we still have a variety of PPG specific earnings levers remaining. These include additional use of our strong balance sheet and cash position and further demand recovery in some of our largest regions such as Europe and end use markets such as U.S. commercial construction, where demand levels remain well below pre-recession levels. In summary, we have again delivered record financial performance driven by benefits from our strategic initiatives, cash deployment, new PPG technologies and continued aggressive management of our businesses. And we remain optimistic regarding continued growth for PPG. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG. And this concludes our prepared remarks. Now, operator, would you please open the line for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: Thank you, Chuck. Chuck, you mentioned June picking up in the quarter, can you discuss what you think drove that pickup? Was it just normal seasonal activity? And what that has led to in July trends in terms of business volume?
Chuck Bunch: Well, as you know the first quarter, especially here in North America was weak due to the harsh winter. We came into April I think still without the momentum that we had seen last year in some of our major businesses and construction-related businesses in particular. You had later Easter, you had fewer selling days earlier in the month, and I think as we saw the weather improve over all of the geographies here in North America. And I think in Europe, we had what I would call regular weather patterns, so that we felt that by the second half of the second quarter, so the last month in particular, we saw lot of momentum building especially in the construction markets, but you saw it also in the automotive sales and we had a number of new programs that were started in the back half of the second quarter. So, I would say that there were some seasonal or weather-related events, but also I think some of PPG’s programs were ticking in as the quarter progressed.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: Chuck, on the same bent, how would you characterize this U.S. spring and ongoing summer paint season versus prior years or even expectations?
Chuck Bunch: Well, let me – I am going to ask Michael McGarry, our newly named Chief Operating Officer to respond. Michael has had responsibility for our architectural businesses globally. Michael?
Michael McGarry: Yes. David, I would say that this year is better than last year and then it’s continuing to trend up. We had good performance in our stores that have been opened for more than one year. And we saw continued – actually in Canada, we had a nice recovery in Canada as well despite the fact that Canada by and large is a very challenging market. So, I’d say overall, it’s trending upward.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: Thank you very much.
Chuck Bunch: Thanks, Dave.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed.
Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial: Thanks. Chuck, your OEM auto growth continues to significantly outpace the market. I am just wondering what’s driving that, is that new products, I mean, you mentioned one of the things helping business overall is just your customers adopting your new technologies? And sort of along those lines, do you have any sort of innovation or freshness index in terms of percentage of sales coming from new products, both current and where you would like it to go?
Chuck Bunch: Yes. As we have discussed before, our automotive OEM business has a lot of momentum. Two of the key drivers have been on the technology side both our new generation-seven electrodeposition coatings and we are getting an adoption rate that is accelerating on a global basis. And as the industry has continued to globalize, we are seeing adoption rates faster at our customers from new technology. The other new technology for OEM automotive coatings is the new B1:B2 PPG compact process. We are also getting very good success rates as this technology moves into brand new of automotive assembly plants. I think what we have seen over the last few years we were introducing the technology, but it really paid off best in brand new assembly plants where you could design the coatings systems, the ovens, the electrodeposition coatings around this new technology. So we have seen an acceleration of the adoption of those two technologies B1:B2 Compact Process or the top coat systems. So I would say that has caused some of the acceleration in our volume growth for PPG. We are also very well positioned with some of the companies that have been growing fastest on a global basis. So if you look at our new products and we are trying to have over 30% new products on a five year rolling basis and we are certainly ahead of that phase in the automotive OEM business.
Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial: Okay. And then just as a follow-up on the portfolio side you seem to have a major announcement every quarter, I guess the remaining business that doesn’t fit is the glass business and I am just wondering what the future of that business in the PPG portfolio is, is it something you want to get the returns up before you divest it or is it something you would consider keeping?
Chuck Bunch: At this point we have considered those businesses less core for PPG, but still strategically important. We think that we have more to do in those businesses. We have continued to invest in them. We think there are good opportunities with the market recoveries and some of the regional growth to improve the performance. And as you have noted we have been quite busy with our portfolio actions in last year and this year commodity chemicals, the transitions optical business, these big acquisitions. So we are aware of our performance in that business and the opportunities to improve and at this point we have no further news to report.
Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial: Thank you.
Vince Morales: Thanks Don.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays: The refinish business you had talked about the rough winter should lead to pickup in summer, one, are we seeing that uptick in refinish and two what’s happened with market share in refinish as there has been a little bit of turnover in one of your big competitors, changing and stuff like that, where do we stand with market share in refinish?
Chuck Bunch: Well, I would say Duffy that first of all we are seeing volume improvement in refinish here in North America as we come out of the winter. And we have also seen a modest pickup in Europe in our refinish business and the business in Asia-Pacific also continues to grow. So I think we are pleased to see continued growth, top line growth on the refinish side. Here in the North America or even globally with some of the – we have seen the competitors remain fairly similar in terms of the players competing in the market. We do not have however with this business let’s say is up to – as up-to-date volume and share information. It usually takes us a little longer in this segment because the publicly available data is not always correct. I would say that we have seen somewhat of a stable share situation from our perspective. There is movement within the market between the large multi-shop operators and some of the smaller ones. So we are seeing some consolidation there in terms of the Bodyshop network. So there are continuing consolidation trends globally in the downstream portion of the refinish or automotive collision markets. But I would say it’s too early to really say that there have been any significant share shifts regionally or globally.
Frank Sklarsky: I think Duffy the only thing I would add to what Chuck said, this is Frank, is that in Asia-Pacific, China specifically, China is going to produce something like 23 million units this year. And as they produce more the car park in China will continue to grow pretty substantial and we will continue to benefit from that. So were – the Asia or the China growth is probably a little bit higher than the overall global growth for us and we already have a significant position, market position in China. So we will benefit from that sector trend going forward with that car park growth.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays: Great. And then second question probably for Frank, when we anniversary the shutdown of those 100 stores on the combination between new and the acquired business, should we think about a financial impact when we anniversary that? Do we get a pick up or kind of a reduction in cost at that point or will that be pretty smooth and unnoticeable?
Frank Sklarsky: It’s not going to be a huge financial impact. Those were done pretty much in the more so in the second half of 2013 and so we will lap that by the end of this year. The impact you will see is that overall year-over-year compares on sales will improve, because those stores would have been lower performing than the legacy stores, but no major financial impact.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays: Great, thanks fellows.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of John McNulty with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
John McNulty - Credit Suisse: Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. So, for the first one as far as the marine business goes, it’s been struggling for a while, it does seem like it’s leveling off, at least on a sequential basis, but based on kind of your knowledge of the order books that are out there, I guess when should we be expecting the final turn in that business where we actually start to see good positive year-over-year growth?
Chuck Bunch: John, I would say that here in the second quarter, we had still modestly negative volumes in protective and marine. The marine business, notably in China and Korea, has been continuing to weaken, but at improving trends, let’s call it. And if you look at new order bookings for us, we are now we think we have turned a corner in terms of volume growth in the business trending with this order book improvement. So, I would say by the end of this year and certainly the first quarter of next year, you are going to see these new bookings showing up on our sales top line for the business.
John McNulty - Credit Suisse: Great, thanks. And then as a follow up in the performance business, certainly the margins continue to push higher, which is impressive at these levels. I guess my question is with the launch that you have had around some of the new re-branding that you are doing, both in the stores and in the architectural business and even outside the stores of the big boxes. Can you walk us through how to think about what the incremental costs were there that might have been one-time that may have even held back the margins a little bit despite what looked like pretty good ones?
Michael McGarry: Yes. John, this is Michael. I would say that from the cost side, we probably not want to get into that, but the way to think about it going forward is that we continue to get our cost structure lower, the stores are gone. We have consolidated sales into the higher performing stores. Chuck talked earlier about the run rate of the synergies were going north of where we were and we are going to be probably 90% of the $200 million number we gave you by the end of the year. So, I would tell you that everything is moving in the right direction.
John McNulty - Credit Suisse: Great, thanks very much for the color.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.
Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities: Yes. Congratulations Michael on the promotion. Just to follow up on that, did you – can you update us on where the margins are on the Akzo North American business? I think you guys had indicated those they were mid single-digits in Q1, where do we stand now and how does that trajectory look for the balance of the year?
Michael McGarry: Yes. We were low double-digits in the second quarter. And obviously, our goal is to continue to move that north, Frank. So, we feel pretty good about it. When we took it over, it was basically a breakeven business at best, so a significant improvement. The team has done an outstanding job of moving that north.
Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities: It sounds like that’s ahead of expectations even your expectations, if it’s…
Michael McGarry: I don’t know, you have to ask Chuck about that.
Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities: And you mentioned earlier in terms of share buyback that you stopped halfway through the quarter, after doing $100 million, because you knew you had the Comex negotiations going on, but that you are going to restart that here as we progress. Is the way for us to think about that is our run-rate kind of quarterly double that number absent another large transaction that might be on the horizon, how should we think about the pace of the buybacks for the balance of the year?
Frank Sklarsky: Yes. I mean, I think this is Frank, while we don’t get too specific on when exactly we will be in the market, Q1 we did 200, as you know we did 100 in Q2. I think it’s safe to assume that we have always said it will be part of our capital allocation strategy for the back half including share repurchase. So, we will be back in the market in the second half for some amount. Again, it’s always going to depend on the economic conditions, always going to depend on acquisition activity. We still do look at the pipeline of acquisitions and that is our preferred route to grow the top line organically, inorganically, but we will be definitely doing some share repurchases in the back half.
Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities: Alright, great. And then lastly you mentioned that the maintenance costs were heavy in the first half of 2014, care to quantify that and what sort of a tailwind will that be for the balance of this year?
Vince Morales: Hey, Frank, this is Vince. You are talking I think about our glass segment, we have some planned maintenance and repair work coming in to the year as we communicated in the fourth quarter. In total, for the first half, it was about $17 million of year-over-year delta in terms of costs. For the back half of the year, we expect the year-over-year delta to be negligible.
Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities: Terrific. Thanks so much.
Chuck Bunch: Thanks.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Good afternoon. Could you comment on your expectations for titanium dioxide, acrylic, and other raw material costs in the back half of the year versus the first half of 2014?
Chuck Bunch: Kevin, I would say that we are – we look at the trends as very flat right now. So, for TiO2 we didn’t see much movement between the first and second quarter and we are really not anticipating for TiO2 any movements up. For some of our emulsions, we are seeing also similar trends of little to know inflation. There is some noise around vinyl acetate monomer, but at this point, I would say that they are not strong. So, as we have commented earlier, low single-digit kind of inflationary pressure on raw materials and that would include natural gas that is up from last year although stable right now. We have a few other inflationary costs out there such as transportation, but right now, we see trends in the second half for raw materials and other costs, low single-digits.
Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. And then the second question has to do with your store count, you mentioned the rationalization last year, I think back in May, you indicated a medium-term plan to add 180 to 220 stores through 2016. So, early days versus that timeframe, but I think you have made a number of bolt-on acquisitions that seem to be bringing stores with them. So perhaps you could update us on where you might be this year in terms of organic and acquired stores?
Michael McGarry: Yes, Kevin, this is Michael. So, we picked up 10 stores in the Connecticut area, 13 stores here in the Pittsburg area. We are on a run rate to add probably in the range of 22 stores in the U.S. and about 17 stores in Canada. And so when you look at the number we gave you we are certainly thinking that, that’s the minimum that we are looking at over that period of time.
Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: So, just to follow up, Mike, you think you maybe able to exceed the 45 goal that you had for this year given 39 are in the books?
Michael McGarry: I think that’s going to be probably where we finish.
Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, thank you very much.
Chuck Bunch: Thanks, Kevin.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed.
Ghansham Panjabi - Baird: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. First off, can you just sort of update us with your thoughts on commercial construction in the U.S.? Your competitor that reported this morning was quite bullish on the trend line there, do you share that same enthusiasm?
Chuck Bunch: We have been seeing an improving trend as we went through the second quarter. We didn’t see as much in the first quarter. And as we look at a couple of our businesses the touch commercial construction, including the flat glass business that really reported in the second quarter the best volumes that they have seen for their business since 2007 and there are a commercial construction business, although they also saw some improvement on the residential side. I would say overall in our other businesses that touch commercial construction here, we are seeing good improvement but it was – it came later in the second quarter. But we are seeing very positive trend, so we are optimistic that these will continue in the second half of the year.
Ghansham Panjabi - Baird: Okay, that’s helpful. And then on architectural EMEA, how did the volumes come in relative to your initial expectations for the quarter. And have you also seen any improvement in Eastern Europe?
Michael McGarry: This is Michael again. Yes, I would tell you that we had very nice improvements. The areas that were up were the UK, Benelux. You had all of the Eastern Europe was up significantly. This is a nice trend for us and overall we are – we would say the only area that is still under pressure I would call it flattish is France.
Ghansham Panjabi - Baird: Okay, thanks so much.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs: Thanks very much and congrats, Michael.
Michael McGarry: Thank you, Bob.
Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs: I wanted to ask maybe some granular data around the U.S. architectural market, I think you mentioned your big box revenues were up mid-single, your stores were up better than that, and your dealer network – or independent network, worse than that is should I read something about the variation in pricing power across those channels, or any shift in DIY versus contractor trends, what would you describe the difference between the channels to?
Michael McGarry: I think the difference, Bob really goes to the way they go to market. So the DIY guys show up in the home centers and I would tell you that we had good home center numbers. We also had some new products that we rolled out with Ralph Lauren with the Glidden Professional. So that was the positive. The dealers obviously are working hard in their own segment, so they are a little more challenged in the contract end market. So I don’t think there were any surprises in there.
Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs: And you had cited an outlook of modest U.S. growth, your big competitor in Cleveland certainly seemed a little bit more enthusiastic, so might you give me a definition of modest?
Michael McGarry: I would say 5% plus is the areas that we are looking at.
Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs: Got it and the last one, Chuck, hallmark of the paint industry is its stability and I noticed on the monthly volume trends you gave, April was up 3, May was flat, June was up 7, that doesn’t really speak to stability, is that atypical, or is it just normally we see a quarterly number and we don’t know that there’s quite as much month-to-month volatility in year-on-year trends?
Chuck Bunch: Well, we track these things on a daily and weekly basis too. I would say that typically you don’t see that much variability around these normally seasonal trends. But I would say this year especially here in North America, the season just started coming a little later than usual. And although we said that the first quarter was notably weaker because of the weather, we still saw that continuing. We have a bigger share now up in Canada, which had some of these same seasonal trends. So we were encouraged because we came into the year saying, hey the overall construction indexes are going to get better, we have seen the growth improving over the last couple of years. We didn’t get it in the first four months. May was, we thought, going to be a little better than it turned out to be. We didn’t have as many ship days. But I think as we have worked through some of the inventory by the time they started to reorder in June we saw some good uptick. So normally less variability but we think this is the start of the good seasonal trend now for the rest of the season.
Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs: Great, thanks for the help.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed.
John Roberts - UBS: Thanks for taking my call.
Chuck Bunch: Hi John.
John Roberts - UBS: I’m looking at Slide 7 and I really like the format of that presentation of the adjusted earnings per share trend. The last four, the right-most four orange boxes are all roughly similar in size. And you have mentioned you are going to start to anniversary the easy comps on Akzo, and if comps get a little bit more challenging on auto OEM. So should we think of – I know you don’t give specific guidance, but we should maybe think about the orange boxes maybe back in the first half of 2013 is kind of where we will start seeing comps level off to?
Vince Morales: John, this is Vince. As you know our portfolio is a bunch of different businesses and I certainly agree with your comments that we will start to anniversary some of the acquisition synergies. But if you remember last year, first half Europe was very week. We still have a lot of recovery growth left in Europe in our opinion. We still – we are battling all of last year as we pointed out earlier, tough marine market and a sluggish commercial construction market and we still have those tailwinds coming. And so there is still I think – and we still have cash deployment as another avenue as we get later in this year certainly as four to six months from now when we close Comex. So I still think there is a lot of opportunities to continue this trend up to some degree.
John Roberts - UBS: Good answer. And then on Slide 11, the acquisition, you said the acquisitions add $75 million in sales, but only $24 million has been spent on acquisitions, do we have still some cash outflow to go with those additional smaller ones you did recently?
Vince Morales: Yes. There is the Homax one closed just after the beginning of the third quarter. So there will be more money that will have gone out at that time at which, for the sales which are included in that $75 million.
John Roberts - UBS: Okay. Thank you.
Vince Morales: Thanks, John.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley: Sure. Thanks very much. I am just looking at the Slide 5 here with the sequential volume trends, do you think the sequential growth rate decelerating in Europe from 4% to 3%, is that just the function of the comps being easier in the prior quarter or were you not – were you surprised that you didn’t see sort of a pickup?
Chuck Bunch: The weakest quarter last year for Europe was the first quarter, so it wasn’t easier comp. So we didn’t see any deceleration. It’s still modest growth recovery, but we are not concerned that the trend is going in wrong way.
Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then just how is it looking going in to 3Q so far?
Vince Morales: In Europe, Vincent?
Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley: Yes.
Vince Morales: We said in our prepared remarks and we see that trend, it’s very early obviously in the quarter, but we actually have volume growth in almost every business in Q2. And that wasn’t the case in 1Q. So again, we think the general recovery again still modest in early innings, but we do think it’s broadening.
Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley: Alright. Okay. Thanks very much.
Vince Morales: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed.
Dan Juster - Citi: Hi, this is Dan Juster on for P.J. this afternoon.
Vince Morales: Hi, Dan.
Dan Juster - Citi: So on packaging coatings, it seems like your European volumes have been declining for three or four consecutive quarters now even as you just mentioned that sort of other volume in the region is starting to improve, so can you just walk us through some of the factors that are impacting that particular business. And I think comps get better in the second half, so should we expect to see some sort of the stabilization later this year?
Chuck Bunch: The packaging coatings business, there are several factors at work especially in the European market. It has been slower season in Europe. You also have technology transition going to these BPA free coatings. So there has been some whole holding back of volumes waiting for some of these technology changes. But as I mentioned in my previous quarterly remarks, we have seen heightened competitive activity especially positioning before some of these technology changes. So you are I think also seeing the impact of that in Europe on the overall marketplace.
Dan Juster - Citi: Thank you. And then quickly on back to the U.S. architectural market, you talked about some new products that were launched Ralph Lauren, Olympic ELITE any channel fill benefit in the quarter that you can point to?
Frank Sklarsky: Not significant.
Vince Morales: This is Vince. We had only a partial quarter of those products. The products are being set throughout the quarter, so we didn’t have a full benefit in the quarter.
Dan Juster - Citi: Okay. That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA. Please proceed.
Nils Wallin - CLSA: Yes. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. On Europe, the profit improvement is 28% or so, it seems pretty remarkable given volumes I think in that geography were only up 3%, so would you walk us through what were the other contributors to profit growth i.e. price, currency and then if you are still tracking those 35% to 40% incremental margins in that region?
Frank Sklarsky: Yes. And that last comment of yours really nails it because as we had said previously we expected based on the cost reduction actions, all the rationalization that was taking place that we would have expected 30% to 40% incremental to the bottom line form the additional volume and we are seeing accretion at the high end of that range. And its volume on the fact that we don’t have much incremental fixed costs on either administrative side nor the capacity side, because we are still obviously significantly below peak volume. So there is additional – plenty of additional capacity utilization that we can take up as the volumes accrete. Modest – very modest pricing environment, a little bit of help from currency on the euro on a year-over-year basis as you know, so that helped a little bit. But volume in the basically mid-single digits range. And some of the business and as Vince said are becoming more broad based is what really drove that utilization. So we are seeing that 40% range of the accretion.
Nils Wallin - CLSA: Got it. Then on, I know you have mentioned number of times, back when you announced the Comex deal and obviously in this quarterly comments the quality of the assets, are there assets out there geographically that you can that might be of a comparable quality that you could be interested in?
Vince Morales: Nils, this is Vince. We don’t particularly talk about any specific targets. We do think coatings pace is as our portfolio changes have occurred over the last decade indicate, remains a very, very good space. There are small, medium, and in some cases large competitors out there, potential targets for us. So yes, I think we expect to continue to consolidate space over the next couple of years. And one of the benefits of the coatings industry is the amount of free cash flow we have. And again, we would use that again for quite some time to grow inorganically.
Nils Wallin - CLSA: Okay. Thanks. And then just one more if I may. It seems like recently you have done a number of independent distributors in the U.S. versus company-owned stores, is there a preference for independent distributors as you look to expand in the U.S., North America architectural and what might that be?
Michael McGarry: Nil, this is Michael. I would tell you that the independent distribution we bought really boiled down the fact that they had no succession plans. And they came to us and asked us to facilitate their long-term plans and we took advantage of that. Obviously, we favour our own stores if they were a chance, but we love the dealer market as well, so we participate in both of them.
Nils Wallin - CLSA: Thanks so much.
Vince Morales: Thanks, Nils.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research: Good afternoon, guys. A lot of the questions have been answered, but I just want to follow-up on the share repurchases, I think that – was it two weeks ago when you had the conference call on the Comex announcement, you talked about suspending share repurchases until the deal closes, but now you are talking about being back in the market in the second half of this year, so did you get a different ruling or a premium from your counsel or was it just a sort of internal change of direction?
Frank Sklarsky: No, we – I think we have been pretty consistent in our commentary that it was obviously appropriate for us to suspend the share repurchases when we were in discussions with earnest with Comex during the second quarter, so that’s why we did the $100 million. And consistent with all of our counsel and the guidance we gave a couple of weeks ago, we are free to be back in the market as long as we are not in position of any material non-public information. And so that’s why we are say as we did at that time that we could be back in the market in the second half.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research: Okay, alright. Thank you for that clarification. You have been touching base as a follow-up on your international businesses outside of North America and EMEA, in Asian architectural business and industrial business, you talked about seeing a little bit of pickup in the industrial side, can you talk about the environment in the architectural side of the business both in terms of China and Australia and other parts of Asia. And then on Latin America, this morning your Cleveland based competitor was pretty pessimistic about at least 2014 results in that region, given the economics and the foreign exchange issues, sort of what are you seeing and kind of how do you view that market for the balance of this year and into next year?
Michael McGarry: Dmitry, this is Michael. If you look at China our market was up low-double digits, earnings were up as well. Australia, we were up mid-single digits and earnings were up. In Brazil it was not a good market, but our earnings were up as well, as we took advantage of the cost, the ability to get cost out. So in all the architectural segments around the world we had improved performance.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research: Okay. So you had double-digit growth in China in architectural paints?
Michael McGarry: Yes. That’s correct.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research: Okay, great. And that was quite a reversal from I think you had a little bit of a loss in volumes even as late as the first quarter, so is something that’s changed there in the market or in how you go to market sort of…?
Michael McGarry: In China, we have had continuous upward trend. And in Australia we have also been growing there as well.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research: Okay. So the overall Asian paints business being down last quarter in volumes, I assume that was areas outside of China that were weak or how do I?
Vince Morales: Dmitry this is Vince, that was marine impact.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research: Okay. I thought that maybe we were talking about just performance coatings and architectural coatings last time as well, but maybe I am wrong. Alright, thank you.
Chuck Bunch: The marine is in performance coatings segment.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of James Sheehan with SunTrust. Please proceed.
James Sheehan - SunTrust: Yes. Thank you for taking my question. In performance coatings, you referenced some cost inflation and you have got some price increases out there to offset that, when do you anticipate being fully caught up on the cost inflation that you referenced?
Vince Morales: Yes. James this is Vince. We enacted pricing in the first quarter in anticipation of what we were seeing in transportation markets somewhat on the weak retail wage side. We are complete in terms of cost versus price at this point. And so we don’t expect much more inflation more than we have today in those two buckets. And we have modest targeted pricing but not material for the segment overall in the back half of the year.
James Sheehan - SunTrust: Alright. Thanks a lot, Vince.
Vince Morales: Thanks James.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Hope you are doing well. Yes, thanks. I guess the first question was just on aerospace it’s been a pretty decent market for you guys for a little while, what’s your outlook going forward and do you think you can keep up mid to high-single digit growth rates there?
Chuck Bunch: We are still quite optimistic about the aerospace market. If you look at the commercial mainframe OEM builds from Boeing and Airbus, they are quite strong with good backlogs. We are seeing modest pickup in business aviation and the aftermarket especially with the airline profitability is also improving. So we continue to see similar trends. Military has been somewhat muted, but overall we are not seeing a trend, a change in the trends that we have experienced and we are quite optimistic that the market is going to continue to be – to perform well.
Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Thanks. And then another question kind of higher level, I mean historically your earnings and your top line growth was very tied to global IP, but with all the portfolio moves, it seems like that’s come down a little bit, so if we do see a material pickup in global IP over the next couple of years, would you think to see a similar benefit from it as you did in the past or you think they would be less so?
Vince Morales: No, I think we still have – we have obviously over the past couple of years expanded or exploded to the U.S. commercial construction market, residential construction market. But we still have a close link to global IP, so I think the relationship you mentioned still exist.
Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Thanks.
Vince Morales: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Eugene Fedotoff with KeyBanc. Please proceed.
Eugene Fedotoff - KeyBanc: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just have a follow up on packaging coatings can you talk about volume trends that you are seeing outside of Europe and whether you saw a pick-up in demand before or during World Cup?
Chuck Bunch: The volume trends here in North America were slightly positive, but modest. The Asia continues to be a growth market for packaging coatings and that continued. We didn’t see a noticeable change in the industry for the World Cup. And you had a lot of other trends going on in South America at the time from volumes, currencies and the like. So, we did not see a specific change in demand for the industry due to the World Cup.
Eugene Fedotoff - KeyBanc: Thanks for that color. And also you mentioned the recovery in general industrial coatings can you talk a little bit more in details about the specific markets, end markets that are leading that recovery?
Chuck Bunch: Well, for our industrial coatings business, the strongest market globally has been automotive parts. We have seen good growth in the global automotive industry as we have indicated, but our business has continued to perform well there. Coil and extrusion markets, again they are tied more to construction. We have seen some growth there as well. Heavy duty equipment in the developed regions was a positive story, although in the developing regions in Asia, a little less so. Consumer electronics, what I would call, mixed return to growth overall, but I would say not at some of the growth trends that we have seen earlier. So, those would be a few of the markets that we have seen improving. Appliance was also better in all the regions geographically.
Eugene Fedotoff - KeyBanc: Great, thanks. And just a last question on Comex, do you think – and I am sorry if I missed that, do you think there is a potential upside to the 3%, 4% synergies that you initially identified? 
Frank Sklarsky: We just announced the deal a couple of weeks ago, Eugene. So, when I think we are still going with our original financial projections.
Eugene Fedotoff - KeyBanc: Thanks a lot.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Robert Walker with Jefferies. Please proceed.
Robert Walker - Jefferies: Alright, thank you. On auto OEM, how much of your above market growth can you attribute to new capacity wins versus customer retrofits or other items, just wondering kind of how vulnerable the growth rates could be if auto capacity growth slowed?
Chuck Bunch: Could you repeat the question again?
Robert Walker - Jefferies: Alright, yes. The above market growth you are seeing in auto OEM, how much of that is attributed to winning higher share of new auto facilities versus kind of de-captivating existing facilities for other customers having a customer retrofitted of a plant?
Chuck Bunch: Well, I would say that the – thinking of one of the biggest trends here recently in the global industry has been the amount of new assembly plants. So, typically, those are the best opportunities to win new business is when a plant has, is just commissioning and I would say that we feel that we are winning our share – more than our share as these new plants get commissioned, because it’s an opportunity to introduce new technologies. You see less share shift on let’s say the facilities that have been in existence for a while if they are performing well. So, I would say that there will still be new automotive assembly plants starting up over the next couple of years. You have seen a number of them in China, Mexico. You have seen a number of new assembly plants announced. So, I would say the trend is still encouraging there. And I don’t think that all these plants and some of them that were winning business have yet ramped up to full capacity. So, I think there is an opportunity for more growth from some of these new facilities, but those will be the two countries that we see the most growth in, in terms of new construction.
Robert Walker - Jefferies: Alright, thank you. And then a question for Frank, in terms of free cash flow generation, do you expect a similar pattern to previous years and kind of overall, what kind of free cash flow to net income ratio should we expect this year?
Frank Sklarsky: Well, without getting into too much specific on the percentage, we do expect a similar pattern to prior years, where things do pickup in the back half. We are spending a little bit more in CapEx this year, but all that CapEx is very, very accretive in terms of capacity expansion that we expect to get a very quick return on making good progress on working capital as we go through the year. So, similar pattern and it’s always going to be kind of a high double-digit conversion ratio of cash flow to net income. So, it’s safe to assume that.
Robert Walker - Jefferies: So, do you mean 90% plus or?
Frank Sklarsky: It’s going to depend on the quarter and on the month, but overall, it will be in the certainly more than 80% conversion ratio for the year.
Robert Walker - Jefferies: Okay, thank you.
Chuck Bunch: Thanks, Rob.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Richard O’Reilly with Revere and Associates. Please proceed.
Richard O’Reilly - Revere and Associates: Okay, thank you. Good afternoon guys. I also wanted to ask about the Comex synergy target and I guess why only a 3% to 4%, not that there is upside to that, but it just seems like a low number, low percentage. Can you explain is it because you don’t have a footprint there, there is no corporate savings?
Chuck Bunch: Rich, if you go back to the June 30 call we held, this is an asset that from a geographic perspective is tremendously complementary to us, but we have no meaningful architectural presence in Mexico. That limits in a certain degree some of the operational synergies we would get out of the transaction. So, this is more of a plug and play type transaction as opposed to our prior acquisition last year, where we had tremendous overlap both administratively and operationally. So, I think – and this is a high-quality asset, because it’s well run as well. So, I think those two factors are the predominant reasons why you are seeing the synergy target we put out there, which is still a nice synergy target by the way.
Richard O’Reilly - Revere and Associates: And second question, a quick question, a math question, what the business unit you call now specialty coatings and materials, the (indiscernible) and optical materials, are those volumes within that aggregate coatings volume of 3%, are they within that slide there or does that slide exclude that?
Frank Sklarsky: It would include the overall coatings volume improvement would include specialty coatings and materials, you could say the specialty coatings and materials probably has a growth rate above that smaller business, smaller component in the total, but it is in the number.
Richard O’Reilly - Revere and Associates: Okay, fine. Okay. So, it’s basically the two coating segments excluding the glass segment?
Chuck Bunch: That’s correct, Rich.
Frank Sklarsky: Yes, specialty coatings and materials is in the industrial coating segment.
Richard O’Reilly - Revere and Associates: And it’s now in the industrial, okay, good. Thanks a lot for that.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. And with that, I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. Vince Morales. Please proceed.
Vince Morales - Vice President, Investor Relations: I just want to get in and thank everybody for their time and interest in PPG. As is customary, I will be available today, tomorrow and next week for any follow-up questions you may have. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today’s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the First Quarter 2014 PPG Industries Earnings Conference Call. My name is Philip, and I’ll be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are now in a listen-only mode. Later, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed sir.
Vince Morales: Thank you, Philip and good afternoon, everybody. Again, this is Vince Morales, I am the Vice President of Investor Relations for PPG. Welcome to PPG’s first quarter 2014 financial teleconference. Joining me from PPG today on the call is Chuck Bunch PPG’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Frank Sklarsky, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our comments relate to the financial information we released today, April 17, 2014. I will remind everybody that we posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on our Investor Center at our website www.ppg.com. These slides are available on the webcast site as well and provide additional support to the opening comments Chuck will make in a few moments. Following Chuck’s perspectives on the company’s results for the quarter, we’ll move directly to the Q&A session. Both the prepared commentary and discussion during the Q&A may contain forward-looking statements, reflecting the company’s current view about future events and their potential effect on PPG’s operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. Today’s presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials which again are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG’s filings with the SEC. Now let me introduce PPG’s Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch.
Chuck Bunch: Thank you, Vince. And welcome, everyone. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG Industries. Today, we reported record first quarter 2014 financial results from continuing operations including records in sales and adjusted earnings per diluted share. This strong performance occurred despite continued mixed global economic conditions and inclement weather that postponed demand in some of our U.S. businesses and emerging region currency headwinds. Even with these challenges, we delivered record first quarter sales of $3.6 billion, eclipsing last year’s figure by 17%. Our global volumes grew 5%, representing our largest gain in three years. Each region also posted solid volume growth led by the U.S. and Canada as our coatings volumes here improved by 7%. Volume improvements were achieved in most businesses as overall economic conditions in this region remain solid. Year-over-year European volumes advanced 5%. This represents our first volume increase in that region in 10 quarters, reflecting the early stages of an economic recovery there. Emerging region volume performance also improved year-over-year and sequentially versus the fourth quarter, although results remained mixed by country and industry. Each of our major regions benefited from improved demand in automotive OEM, aerospace and automotive refinish as we continue to outpace the industry growth rates in these end use markets due to our leading technologies and focus on customer service. Also our architectural coatings EMEA business delivered mid-single digit volume growth, including some benefits from favorable weather. Supplementing our organic growth were acquisition related sales gains of about $360 million which represents over 11% sales growth. From an earnings perspective, each region delivered higher pretax earnings led by Europe, where our earnings growth was nearly 40%. We realized excellent earnings leverage on the improved demand as a result of the actions we have taken in the past several years to significantly lower our cost structure. In addition, our ongoing cash deployment contributed to the earnings growth. This includes higher earnings from additional acquisition related cost synergy achievement and continued implementation of our restructuring program announced last year. We also repurchased $200 million or 1.1 million shares of PPG stock in the quarter. As a result of all these actions, our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.98, up more than 40% versus last year’s comparable figure and a record for the company. And we more than fully replaced these earnings from the businesses divested in the quarter. As we previously communicated, we finalized the sale of our interest in the Transitions Optical joint venture in our sun lens business at the end of March. Results for the divested businesses are now reported in discontinued operations and prior year results have been recast accordingly. We also introduced a new reportable business segment structure. Lastly, we received gross proceeds of more than $1.7 billion from the divestitures, which added to our already strong cash position. We ended the quarter with $3 billion of cash and short-term investments including strong first quarter cash from operations aided by the higher earnings and continued improvements in working capital. Looking ahead, we anticipate solid global growth to continue, but it will not be uniformed across geographies or industries. We remain well positioned with the balance coatings portfolio both regionally and by end used market providing broad growth opportunities, while minimizing the impact of any individual fluctuations. We anticipate further earnings accretion from our internal actions including additional synergy capture from the ongoing integration of our acquisitions and further implementation of our restructuring program. Finally, we intend to deploy our cash balance in a timely yet disciplined manner with a continued emphasis on earnings accretive cash uses including additional acquisitions and share repurchases. We are still targeting earnings accretive cash deployment of $3 billion to $4 billion through the end of next year. Also, we remain focused on returning cash to shareholders. Today, our Board of Directors approved a $2 million of share repurchase program and they also approved a 10% per share dividend increase. In summary, I am pleased we were able to begin 2014 by delivering record first quarter financial results. We remain focused on aggressively managing our business to deliver continued top and bottom-line growth this year and on creating additional value for our shareholders. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG. And this concludes our prepared remarks. Now operator would you please open the line for questions.
Operator: Of course. (Operator Instructions). And your first question comes from line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Neal Sangani - Goldman Sachs: Good morning. This is actually Neal Sangani on for Bob. A question on the industrial business in addition to the Akzo acquisition it looks like you’re annualizing point last year where you really started to outpace the industry growth rates. Does that suggest maybe a deceleration in the last three quarters of the year or are you going to see something similar going forward?
Chuck Bunch: Neal, could you repeat the question please?
Neal Sangani - Goldman Sachs: Looking at the industrial business it looks like you’re lapping some of that outperformance over the, specifically in auto OEM over last year when you started outperforming the industry rates. Does that suggest a deceleration going forward or are you going to see a similar pace of outperformance going forward?
Chuck Bunch: I would say that yes, we continue to feel optimistic about the automotive OEM business both the underlying market, where we are seeing good growth rates, as well as our positions in the various geographies and with our customers. So, we can’t be sure we’ll continue to have growth in excess of let’s call it these global averages. But we think we’re doing quite well and have good momentum in the business. And so we would say we remain optimistic overall in the industrial segments and in auto OEM, in the auto OEM business in particular.
Neal Sangani - Goldman Sachs:  And you also didn’t specifically call out raw materials much in the prepared remarks, is that something you are seeing or is it some type of lag that we should see in next coming quarters?
Chuck Bunch: I would say raw materials for us have been relatively benign. We have had a few commodities, actually slightly below our last year’s average, a few slightly above. We are projecting for the year low single-digit inflation in raw materials and we have some other inflationary costs, labor, transportation, natural gas. But right now overall I would say raw materials it’s a relatively benign story for us early in the year.
Neal Sangani - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thank you.
Vince Morales: Thanks Neal.
Operator: All right, your next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird: Hey guys, good afternoon. First off just on the macro outlook for Europe, Chuck, how much of the improvement do you think is purely from just easier comparisons over the last couple of years versus any sort of structural improvement. And of the various end markets that you are exposed to in the region, which particular one are you most optimistic for specific to this year?
Chuck Bunch: Well, I would say the end of 2012 and almost all of 2013 Europe was very weak. So we do have let's call that easier comparables compared to last year. But we saw what we thought was some pretty solid volume growth, some improvement in economic industries. So we're more optimistic that this is the early days or early stages of a modest improvement. We talked about some of the sectors more broadly; automotive has been a nice bright spot in terms of improving volumes for the European region. Aerospace, although smaller in Europe, is still a solid business for us. We finished the first signs of volume improvement and the construction markets, they have been a little slower to recover, but we saw some of that recovery in that. We have signaled the last quarter especially in the Northern; let's say the Northern geographies, the UK, Benelux were areas where the construction markets were also showing some early signs of improvement. So, those are all I think encouraging for us.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird: Okay. And then a commentary on packaging being a little bit weaker in Europe, which particular end market did you see the weakness in, because one of your, presumably one of your bigger customers reported this morning the beverage can side and Europe was actually up for them, so just curious why the difference there?
Chuck Bunch: Well, we have a big exposure in Europe on both the food and the beverage side; there is also a lot of activity in terms of BPA, non-intent or BPA free coatings so a lot of trialing going on there. There is heightened, also heightened competitive activity in the European packaging coatings right now. So there are a few moving pieces on the European side, although the business for us grew nicely in the Asia Pacific region, but there was more competitive activity in Europe during this quarter.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird: Okay. Thanks so much.
Vince Morales: Thanks Ghansham.
Operator:  Alright your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank:  Thank you. Chuck just on Comex I know you can’t say too much, but obviously bid the first time. Is there still interest from institutional standpoint towards that asset and beyond Comex can you discuss the M&A pipeline globally for coatings?
Chuck Bunch:  Well, we continue to be interested in making acquisitions both in the coatings space and in the near adjacencies of specialty chemicals. We look at almost all potential acquisitions both small and large; we made just a couple of what I would call smaller this year in the first quarter. So we continue to be interested and look at all of the acquisitions. I would say the pipeline I find somewhat encouraging at this point. These are not all big deals as we announced with high (inaudible) supply, but I think there is a good level of dialog, I’m little more optimistic today than I was six months ago as we proceed with some of these conversations. So I would say I am encouraged.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank:  And so just on auto OEM you have done a fantastic job and this business is growing well above the market. How long can it continue? Can you grow 8%, 9% for the full year or will grow slow back half of the year in auto OEM?
Chuck Bunch: I think auto OEM in terms of the general market if you look at the [overly], we’re seeing here in the North American market we’re still seeing good growth, we’ll be at little or maybe slightly lower than where we were last year, but we’re just looking 4%, 5% growth. We saw the sales come back here in North America in March. So we feel pretty good about market conditions here in Europe as we discussed it is finally showing some volume improvement and some strength and China has continued as our largest market in Asia, it’s continued fairly soft. So we have again a good mix of technological innovations all layers in the automotive coatings profile. And so we think that we have a good opportunity with the technologies and we do business with almost all of the major automotive OEMs both the global ones and it looks very strong national domestic players around the world. So we think that we’re well positioned, we’ll continue the slower momentum and the overall market on a global basis, we think is pretty good.
Frank Sklarsky: And David, this is Frank. Recall that we continued to do well when the Japanese and European makers locate new manufacturing facilities outside their home markets because of our product consistency service level or whatever. So the transplant facilities, we’re getting plants, we’re getting layer. So to the extent we’re able to continue to do that when we may not have the incremental several digits percentage above the market growth rates as we have in the past we think we have ways to continue to enhance our share position.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank:  Thank you very much.
Chuck Bunch: Thanks Dave.
Operator:  All right. And our next question comes from the line of John McNulty with Credit Suisse.
John McNulty - Credit Suisse: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So now that you have gotten a lot of the transactions done, transitions done, access being integrated in, when we start thinking about your SG&A line and its ratio to sales, how should we be thinking about that going forward. Where can you get that overtime like order where you’ve been in the kind of low 20s in the past. Is that an area that we can think about going forward should it be lower than that like how should we think about that?
Vince Morales: John, this is Vince. I think the first quarter would be approximately the first quarter doesn’t include any of the divested businesses all of the results [both] last year with commodity chemicals and this year with Transitions has been moved to discontinued operations. So the first quarter would give you a proxy for that particular quarter’s return on sales. We did restate the entire 2013 year that’s available via in 8-K filing. And you could see again in those numbers for 2013 by quarter what our sales, what our SG&A as a percent of sales was last year. And that would include some seasonality to it; you really have to look at it on a quarterly basis, buts that’s what I would point to you o John.
John McNulty - Credit Suisse: Okay. I mean maybe taking it from a slightly different angle, when we think about some of your businesses are really just starting to recover now, you also have Akzo really kind of early in this integration stages. So I guess as we think about how the SG&A launch progressed over the next few years versus your sales, how should we be thinking about the leverage that you should be getting off of the SG&A line going forward?
Frank Sklarsky: Yes. And we don’t want to necessarily pull whether it’s going to be 50 basis points or 100 basis points. There will definitely be operating leverage. So when we characterize the incremental profitability of 30% to 40% plus going to the bottom line from incremental revenue dollar, some of that comes from the fixed base in the cogs line and some of that comes from the operating leverage from the SG&A line, because the only part of SG&A where we have to add traditional revenue dollars is sales resources. The back office as we continue to move toward shared services environments in the regions, will definitely give us leverage and SG&A. So, that’s got a specific percentage, but there will clearly be the opportunity to gradually reduce that as a percent of revenue as the markets recover. Particularly in Europe, where we have an infrastructure there, we’re accelerating, moving things into shared services center in Czech Republic and so we don’t have to add incremental resources on that pure G&A line as the revenue line creates.
John McNulty - Credit Suisse: Great. Thanks very much.
Vince Morales: Thanks John.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America. Please proceed. 
Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America: Yes, good afternoon. If I look at your volume growth at the company level of nearly 5%. It’s double or more than double that of your principal global competitor that reported this morning. And I guess, I’m tempted to ask you about market share trends in that context. Obviously there is a mix differential and I saw your plus 10 on auto OEMs volume. But if I put auto OEM on the side, are there other categories where you feel you’re gaining significant market share versus your competitors these days?
Chuck Bunch: Well, I would say first of all Kevin that we -- today is a busy day for us. We had our Board Meeting, our Annual Shareholders Meeting. So we haven’t had an opportunity to look at our competitor’s, either their earnings reports or their slides or Q&A. But I would say that we don’t have the same, even if you look at the global business profile, we don’t have quite the same mix of businesses. And I think you indicated we did well in automotive OEM as that market continues to recover. They don’t have as much exposure with the acquisition that we made of their business here in North America. So some of our strongest volume growth as you know was here in North America as the economy despite the weather continues to improve, they don’t have as much exposure here. So those would be some things that I would point to but it’s really too early and it’s only one quarter to comment that there would be any change in share, it may be do as much to just regional mix for the company.
Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America: And then I guess second quarter on returning capital to shareholders, is the timeline are likely pace of execution on your $2 billion share repurchase program meant to be coincident with the end of 2015 bracket on your 3 billion to 4 billion goal or is that not necessarily the case, perhaps you can just comment on what your strategy will be there?
Frank Sklarsky:  Yes. So, this Frank. We have left no timeframe specifically on a $2 billion. What we have said is we are going to deploy the $3 billion to $4 billion over the next 12 to 18 months as shareholder friendly manner. What we would say about the share purchase is we are committed to returning that cash to shareholders but the pace and the timing will be dependent upon market and economic conditions but it will also be dependent upon the magnitude and the timing of acquisition activity. And we’ve said consistently that acquisitions, accretive acquisitions would take priority. But the message here is that we will deliver that value to shareholders by acquisitions when available and then also making sure that we maintain that commitment to return that cash to shareholders or deploy that cash I would say in accretive manner to the extent that we don’t execute all of that $3 billion to $4 billion acquisition activity over the next 12 to 18 months. We will continue to have share repurchases be an integral part of the capital allocation philosophy.
Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America: Okay. And then last question if I may. Can you speak to your U.S. architectural coating sales by channel please?
Chuck Bunch: Well, I would say that we had some mix effects and I would say different strength by channel, Kevin. Overall, I would say that we had good strength in U.S. stores channel. We’re saying mid single-digit improvement there, again we have some moving parts because of some of the store closures after as part of the integration. We saw also volume increases in our home center channel, although weakest of the few channels. And we think it’s more related to weather here with kind of the geographic mix. But the dealer channel was weaker from a volume standpoint in the first quarter here in North America.
Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America: Thank you very much.
Chuck Bunch: Thanks Kevin.
Operator: All right. Next question comes from line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed.
Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial: Chuck, a question on your outlook, does this stronger start to the year and perhaps better than expected operating leverage make you more optimistic on your earnings growth potential for calendar 2014?
Chuck Bunch:  Yes, I do feel a little better, Don. And Europe was encouraging. Here I think, we did well despite what I think was some poor weather conditions that affected some of the end use markets as well as just sort of supply chain transportation. In China, there has been a lot of discussion around China, the automotive related businesses in China continue to do well. This is automotive OEM, automotive parts, automotive refinish, some of the mixed and some of the other end use markets in Asia, like consumer electronics. But as I mentioned packaging, coatings, some of the construction related markets in China held up. So I would say here in April, as we look back on the quarter, I would say I’m more encouraged for 2014. We have some geopolitical events, we’re monitoring currencies in emerging regions, there are few watch-outs I guess as you say, but in general especially based on the first quarter, we’re encouraged.
Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial:  And I want to go back to issue of how you are outgrowing the industry on autos and not just the mix of say transplants; is it a technology issue or your better technology for example in e-coat and things like that and are there other opportunities to grow through technology transfer amongst your various businesses?
Chuck Bunch:  I would say yes, we were introducing and I think we sort of talked about this last year, the introduction of the new generation side of e-coat. And I think that has continued to build momentum for us. We’ve taken that product global with our global customer base. And so, I'd say from an echo perspective, we feel technology, innovation and development backed up by our service and globalization in all regions of the world. So, I would say that's an example. And then we are also working with new contact processes that would be in the top coat layer. This is primers to base and clear coats and some compression of these layers; we've had good waterborne technology introductions. And I think the advantages of some of our new technologies are most evident when you have this new Greenfield plants sort of starting around the world especially in the emerging regions, but also here in places like Mexico or the Southern part of the U.S. So I would say we are very pleased with the technology that we've been developing and the receptivity on the part of our customers. And I would say this is probably the biggest story around the growth that we’ve had in auto OEM.
Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial: Thank you.
Vince Morales: Thanks Don.
Operator: All right, our next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.
Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities: Good afternoon gentlemen.
Chuck Bunch: Hi Frank.
Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities: Obviously you had some positive volumes overall in Southern Europe and you were able to translate that into fantastic earnings improvement. What role is our cost reduction is playing? And what [inning] are we in some of the cost reduction efforts Frank had outlined in the past?
Frank Sklarsky: Yes, that’s right. This is Frank. So we had announced of course that 2013 our restructuring program in the third quarter, which had a lot to do with completing of synergies for the North American Akzo business that we acquired, but also where we had identified some rationalization opportunities in other markets which were perhaps weak up to that point. And so that is playing a role and once we take that cost out obviously that the teams have been dedicate to making sure that as revenue grows we do not add that cost back and so that leverage is taking place. And as we go through 2014, we are expecting somewhere between $75 million and $90 million of incremental savings from these restructuring and synergy programs. So that will continue to benefit the bottom-line and the leverage that you spoke about.
Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities: All right, terrific. And you mentioned I guess mid single-digit margins on the Akzo North American business and I guess with all (inaudible) headed to the mid-teens what sort of timing are you thinking up there?
Vince Morales:  Frank, it’s Vince. One thing we did in the first quarter, which I’ll remind due to seasonally slower quarter for everybody in the architectural business in this country, our projections will be in the above 10% by the end of this year on a run rate basis and that our targeted level by the middle to end of ‘15 which is 12.5%, 13%.
Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities: Terrific. And then lastly, you referenced some of the positive benefits from weather in Europe, is there a case that there might have been some pull forward from Q2 to Q1 or not necessarily?
Chuck Bunch:  I think it’s always a good indicator when you get better weather in the first quarter and it tends to lengthen the season. Did we pull some things forward? I wouldn’t necessarily say that, it depends on how the weather shapes up. But I would say we are encouraged because even in market that’s been weaker in Europe Frank, Eastern Europe now they did have better weather, but we saw them finally bounce back and we have some nice shares in markets like Poland where we had struggled a little bit during the latter half of 2012 and 2013. So I think the weather is helping, but I don’t think it’s going to produce here in the second quarter some snap back in terms of the volume momentum. I think we feel pretty good that we have some strength here that the weather just will make the season longer and then hopefully better if it holds out for the year.
Frank Sklarsky: Yes. And then if you look at the global insights projections as Chuck said in his remarks, the recovery still hasn’t been totally even by countries. There are still some countries in Western Europe that haven’t recovered as fast as others so that still represents upside for us in particularly in some of the architectural markets.
Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities: Terrific. Thank you so much.
Vince Morales: Thanks Frank.
Operator: All right, our next question comes from line of John Roberts from UBS. Please proceed.
John Roberts - UBS: Good afternoon. Chuck when you talk about adjacencies in terms of your acquisition strategies is it anything in surface chemistry related or how broad would you define adjacency areas?
Chuck Bunch: Well, when we talk about adjacencies we are talking about businesses that we are already in the end used markets that we were already in. So if you look at some of the best examples adhesives, ceilings, pretreatment these are three examples of adjacent chemistries that build on our strength we’re already in these businesses in automotive, in aerospace in industrial and this would be what I would call near adjacencies with good synergies and similar end used markets surface chemistries would be obviously one of those.
John Roberts - UBS:  And could you talk about anything in the silicas area?
Chuck Bunch: We have now reconstituted the business of specially coatings and materials that includes our precipitated silicas business along with OLED, dyes, Teslin and some of our research capabilities in optical in to the monomer business. So we had not excluded silicas as a possible area of growth. You saw the comments that we made around that business unit for the first quarter, they have a very good growth across the spectrum of the end use markets and products there in specialty coatings in materials. So we would not exclude growth in the silicas business and margins and growth performance quite good, not only in the first quarter that we just finished but over the last year and half to two years, we see good growth in that business. And we’re looking forward to a very solid year for the businesses.
John Roberts - UBS:  Okay. Thank you.
Vince Morales:  Thanks John.
Operator: All right. Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley: Sure, thanks very much. Just looking at your 5% volume growth and some of the markets for your outperforming the balance of the industry. Could you talk a little bit about how you’re thinking about price here, are you happy with your price level particularly in Europe, is that something that you think there could be, maybe the high level, just some focus on going forward and are you premium priced as it relates to your business in autos or what’s the outlook here?
Chuck Bunch: Are you talking now about the automotive business or more broadly for PPG’s coatings business?
Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley: Well, I was talking more broadly about the European business, which is about the pickup, I was just wondering if you’re happy where the price points sold out? And then sort of separately to autos, broadly where you are from the pricing perspective just given your market share performance relative to the peers?
Chuck Bunch: As we talked about, we see a relatively benign raw material inflation environment at least here early in the year. That’s always been one of the drivers of the inflationary environment for our pricing strategies. We typically don’t price off a narrow, a more narrowly focused spot pricing opportunistic. We tend to be longer term in our approach. So, at this point, I would say that even though there maybe some tactical opportunities in products or specific markets, I would say the pricing environment today in Europe is relatively flat. And that’s consistent with the major inflationary factors, although we are watching. So that there has been some discussion that even though there has been a lot of inflation in Europe over the last few quarters, that could pick up later this year if we see continued volume growth. So we’re watching carefully, but right at this point, I would say there are no major initiatives.
Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley: Okay, thanks very much. That’s very helpful. I’ll pass along.
Chuck Bunch: Thanks Vince.
Operator: Alright. Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Please proceed.
Dan Jester - Citi: Good afternoon, it’s Dan Jester on for P.J. Circling back to the architectural business in North America. One of your competitors is rolling out a premium branded product through the one of the bigger independent dealer channels. And I was just wondering if you are seeing any changes in that competitive landscape or maybe promotions ahead of the spring painting season?
Chuck Bunch:  I think I know what you are referring to and at this point I would say, it is very, it’s early in the season to see what if any impact, any rollout would have in the independent dealer or hardware store channel. I think we have all been encouraged by what we are seeing in terms of a market potential. I think you are going to see a lot of new product line extensions, we’ve seen new campaigns supporting some of these rollouts and introductions. So I think it’s going to be a competitive space here in 2014. But I think the opportunities will be there for all of the suppliers if the current momentum around the construction markets is maintained.
Dan Jester - Citi: Okay. And then secondly and I apologize if I missed this from earlier. Have you completed all of the Akzo related store closings and can you sort of update us on what your expectation is for sort of the net change in your company own stores will be in 2014 versus 2013?
Vince Morales:  Yes. This is Vince. We have completed the store closures that we earmarked for the acquisition on a net basis, it was just around 100 stores and we move to a growth mode from a store perspective. On a short to mid to long-term basis, we are going to add 25 to 40 stores a year, and a lot of these differ each year so that’s we’re starting with that growth expectation beginning this year.
Dan Jester - Citi: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: All right. Our next question comes from line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please proceed.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies: Good afternoon. Two quick questions on incremental margins, first for Europe. How far do you think you can expand volumes before incremental margins start to deteriorate? When do you see there is a 10% or 15% kind of leeway before you see a step down? And secondly on the emerging markets, do you think that you need to see a [sergeant] level of volume growth, underlying volume growth to start to see higher incremental margins there?
Chuck Bunch: We’ll take the European one first. We still think there is a good amount of headroom. You mentioned 10% to 15% that’s only a possibility because when you look at capacity utilization levels as where they are and with volumes still as of the end of the year about 20% below peak there is ample headroom to continue to accrete the bottom-line at that 30% to 40% for a while. When you talk about emerging markets, it depends on the emerging market; Latin America where our profitability is a little linear than it is in some of the markets like China for instance, we have a lot of opportunity in Latin America for instance by changing the mix of our inputs so as we’re putting capital into -- putting resin capacity in Brazil for instance that will give us some kind of a step function improvement in raw material costs which will go right to the bottom-line avoiding duties on incoming raw materials. For China for instance in some cases we will be building new capacity so while you might not get the same leverage to the bottom line on the incremental revenue we will clearly be accreting margin to the bottom line in a way that still creates shareholder value because we’re getting good IRRs on our new capacity investments. And so we make those decisions on a case by case basis. We have plans over the next couple of years to enhance our capacity of shipping the automotive industrial space and that tends to be very accretive from a value creation standpoint. But also -- and while it may not substantially enhance margin percentage it will substantially enhance margin dollars per unit, per dollar invested.
Vince Morales: And Laurence this is Vince. One other comment I will make on Q1 in particular with respect to emerging regions is, we did see higher earnings in emerging regions in Q1. Those earnings were on higher volumes, but those earnings were tempered a bit by foreign currency, negative foreign currency translation. And so on a non-U.S. denominator local currency perspective our margins were higher than they were and we brought them back to the U.S.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies:  Okay. That’s very helpful. And just [going to tease out] one nuance on the emerging market side. Are there any regions where a small acquisition could have a material change in market structure and therefore help margins that way?
Chuck Bunch: I would -- I’m trying to think of but I would say that, it’s somewhat theoretical as a question, in some cases that can happen but at this point I wouldn’t say that that’s a significant factor or something that we see as likely.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies:  Thank you.
Vince Morales: Thanks Laurence.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Nils Wallin from CLSA. Please proceed.
Nils Wallin - CLSA: Thanks and good afternoon gentlemen. On marine, I know that it stabilized over the last couple of quarters, but it’s still trending down. When do you guys think that you will see at least a flat comp or a positive comp in that business?
Chuck Bunch: I would say in the, we should see stability through the course of 2014. And we're looking for growth returning on a volume basis in marine OEM in 2015.
Nils Wallin - CLSA: Okay. The independent channel in North American architectural is, it's consistently been called out as weak. Is there any reason that this needs to be a channel that PPG needs to be in or even if you don't need to be in it, there is a significant loss of synergy, if you try to exit that channel?
Chuck Bunch: Well, we have a long-term commitment to the inter channel, it's been one of PPG's strength. So over the years in the North American market, we intend to continue to support our independent dealer base, the channel has not grown as much over the last decade or more, largely due to the growth of some of the national home centers and the company owned stores. But it’s still an important channel for the industry and an important channel for PPG. And we continue to support it and we work to ensure that it can be as successful as possible and it should be well positioned with the improvements that we see in the underlying markets over the next couple years wasn’t as evident in the first quarter and the dealers do tend to watch their inventories a little more closely, our dealer profile is skewed more to the, let’s call it colder weather regions. So we think they were impacted a little more than the other channels, but we think there will be growth there as well during the course of this year.
Nils Wallin - CLSA: Understood, thanks. And just finally in the last two years obviously there has been a dramatic change in the portfolio. Is there any reason to expect that there are going to be dramatic changes going forward or have you strategically looked now more towards just intensifying your coatings division?
Chuck Bunch:  We think that we have largely completed the transformation. There are continued consolidation and growth opportunities in the coating space and some of the new adjacencies that we talked about on this call. So I think you have seen largely complete now the PPG transformation. Although there are couple of business units that aren’t in the coatings or adjacent space but these are very small now for PPG’s total portfolio.
Nils Wallin - CLSA: Thanks for your help.
Vince Morales:  Thanks, Nils.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn from Longbow Research. Please proceed.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research:  Good afternoon guys and congratulations on a good start to the year.
Vince Morales:  Thanks Dmitry.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research:  Question on we touched on the weather impact in architectural and it didn’t sound like it was all that material for you although you did called it out in the press release, but was there a weather related factor in your collision repair business on the automotive aftermarket side or may be not in this quarter but do you expect maybe a little bit of a pickup in that business in the second quarter as people get around to repairing their things and reruns?
Chuck Bunch: We think so. The weather, the inclement weather actually helps the automotive refinish business, Dmitry as you know. So, we had more than our share of it here in the northern part of the U.S. although in many cases, one it was either -- we saw a lot of accidents, so a lot of let’s call it, built up demand that didn’t get completed in the first quarter and we also had some supply chain issues. We’re shipping a lot of order base automotive refinish coatings now. So those supply lines were disrupted at several times during the quarter. So we think that the next few quarters for our North American business are going to be good, because there will be a back -- and there is a backlog of work now in the collision shops. And so we think that the next couple of quarters here in North America should be good ones.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research: Switching gears a little bit, if you talk about your Asian paint business and how that’s doing if I would recall for much of 2013, it was under pressure and delivered some lower volumes from time to time. Are you seeing that business turnaround or at least stabilize and sort of what’s your expectations for that in 2014?
Chuck Bunch: This is Asia Pacific in general for the region or Asian Paints, our joint venture in India Dmitry, what -- we were cutting out there as you were asking the question?
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research: Okay. I am talking about the general Asian paint business as architectural coatings that you report in the performance materials. Well, now that you are reporting all your coatings, but -- all your paint, but when you used to report paint being basically North America and Asia, talking about the Asian piece of that?
Chuck Bunch:  Okay. Well, we have, in this case, if we look at architectural coatings businesses in Asia for us, those are two principal markets Australia, New Zealand and China. Australia, New Zealand, the market is positive. We saw some growth here in as we -- in the second half of 2013 and the first quarter, so our position in Australia continues to improve. We have seen volume growth and improved profitability. China, likewise, so it’s a smaller business, so we have a smaller regional business in China focused in the East Coast major cities. And we saw an improvement there as well, again smaller volume growth for our business than what you have seen in some of the other western Tier II and Tier III cities. But we saw a nice improvement for the business despite let’s call it the smaller size of our business in China that did grow there in terms of volume and profit.
Vince Morales:  Yes. The only thing I would add to that is the fact that we did have good volume growth in those architectural markets in Asia, fortunately in the first quarter versus the prior year we were subject to currency changes on the translation side, principally in Australia and a significant change ever since Q1 ‘13.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research: And then finally, I’d just like to follow-up on a question asked earlier around your strategy in the U.S. or North American independent dealer channel. You’ve increased your exposure there obviously, with the Akzo acquisition and then recently you have announced a closer tie with the group of stores in the Northeast. There has been some disruptions in the business and one of the largest suppliers into that market and they are under 3rd or 4th CEO and losing track already. Is that an opportunity for you even though this is a market that maybe trailing sort of the growth rate that you would expect from company on stores or from big box DIY? Is it still a market that given maybe a little bit easier competitive environment, where you can gain some share and actually become a more meaningful supplier into that channel?
Chuck Bunch: Well, we feel that we have been -- we’ve had a commitment to the independent dealer channel here for many years. And we’ve reaffirmed that Dmitry, even with the acquisition that we made last year where we did pick up additional exposure to the independent dealer channel here in Canada but also got additional stores and home center sales as well. So, we think it’s been a -- it’s an opportunity for us to bring more value to the independent dealers, so many of them are committed to staying in the market and growing despite the competitive environment. So, we think it’s a good opportunity for us. Yes, it’s not as fast growing as the other channels, but we think there is a good role for us. We can support these dealers and we’re going to continue to do that.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research: Thanks very much.
Vince Morales: Thanks Dmitry.
Operator: All right. And our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Please proceed.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays:  Hey guys.
Vince Morales:  Hey Duffy.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays:  Just quick question or maybe not quick. Talk about the puts and takes and the difference for your business and architectural in the recovery that’s left in Europe versus the recovery that’s left in the U.S. kind of where do you see the most upside in those two architectural markets say over the next three to four years?
Chuck Bunch:  Well, let me think about that for a moment. I think we are in the early innings of the recovery in Europe. This has been -- and we have seen negative volumes for the last three or four years in the market. We saw the biggest drops in the Southern Mediterranean regions in Europe. So, I would say that as we look at the markets now of UK and Benelux starting to come out and we are encouraged there. Our biggest market in Europe is France. We didn’t see as much an improvement overall in the construction indices in France. So, I would say that’s our biggest opportunity. We don’t have much exposure in Southern Europe. There is soft recovery there, we have a smaller exposure. So I don’t think we have as much to benefit in Spain or in Italy at this point. And Eastern Europe has also been bettered. And the first quarter you saw that for the first time we saw some nice improvement in markets I told. So I would say that biggest opportunity -- I think we are still in the early innings of the regions or countries that the growth has restarted. And I think for our biggest engine in Europe which is France, if we can get them moving; and you have seen recent elections and more of a commitment around returning to growth in the French markets and as that works its way through to the construction markets, I would say that’s our greatest opportunity. So still early days in Europe on the construction side, I think automotive is actually probably a little bit ahead of construction because they have a large export base in Europe. Here I would say that we’re couple of years into the recovery. And although it has been slower in coming than we thought, so I do think that we’re going to see several more years Duffy of growth in architectural coatings here in this market. We haven’t seen the commercial construction or non-residential side come back as strong, most of the improvement we’ve seen in residential. And that’s coming and helping us. DIY was probably a little more affected here in the first quarter with weather, but I think we have more to go on residential. And non-residential which we were getting more optimistic about in back half of last year, things slowed down a little bit we think more due to weather. So I think that’s going to provide the impetus for the next couple of years, completing this kind of residential recovery and with non-residential stuff coming through on an extended basis.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays: Great. Thanks guys.
Vince Morales: Thanks Duffy.
Operator: All right. Next question comes from the line of Ivan Marcuse from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Ivan Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Thanks. A couple of quick questions, on top, the European question that was just asked. What would your volumes be, how much are they pre-downturn levels, so if you compare them where they are today versus I guess 2011 when they started to tail off?
Vince Morales: We typically go back Ivan to 2008, that’s kind of a point in time we started to see volumes fall in Europe. The volumes today versus 2008 levels are still down, high teens percentages even with the early recovery we saw in first quarter.
Ivan Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Got you. And then where are we and how much in synergies were -- it helped I guess performance chemicals, or maybe performance coatings on -- from Akzo and how much more is there to go, how much should you see going to the year?
Vince Morales:  We expect out of the 200 synergies that we said will be our ultimate goal by early 2015, our run rate by the end of this year should be around 170 or so out of that 200, with about 30 left to go remainder of the year. We closed 2013 at a run rate of 100, so about 70 incremental kind of ramped up through 2014 from that 100 run rate to 170 run rate this year.
Ivan Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Great, thanks for taking my questions.
Vince Morales:  Sure. Thanks Ivan.
Operator: All right. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Reitzes from BroadArch Capital.
Robert Reitzes - BroadArch Capital: Hi. Most of questions I had have been answered. The one I would ask is that when you look at all the damage that was done by the storms in the first part of the year, have you guys seen a pick up or do you anticipate pick up in the sale of paint et cetera during the second and third quarters as repair and modeling?
Chuck Bunch: Yes, we do. [Weather] like we have takes its toll. We saw pick up last year after hurricane Sandy hit the East Coast. I think we’ll -- we should be in a position in the second and third quarter for this year to, I think capture more opportunities both from the [storms] and from the people that weren't able to get out and shop for some of their painting needs during January and February. And I think we talked about the automotive refinish business, lot of accidents here in the first quarter that lot of those didn't get repaired. So those are two examples both on the architectural side and the automotive refinish side where we think over the next couple of quarters it should get some help here from some of this demand.
Robert Reitzes - BroadArch Capital: Thanks.
Vince Morales: Thanks Bob.
Operator: Alright, our next question comes from the line of Kevin Hocevar from Northcoast Research.
Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research: Hey, good afternoon everybody. I was wondering if you could give us an update on the level of success you had and the price increases you had at the Paint Stores in the U.S. and if you expect that to spill over in any other channels?
Chuck Bunch: We were able to capture a low single-digit increase, price increase in the Paint Stores during the first quarter.
Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research: Okay.
Chuck Bunch: Have those and carry through for the remainder of 2014.
Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research: Okay. And then just another quick one when you parsed out the pieces in the performance of this coating segment, could you give us an idea of how much the architectural EMEA business margins improved in the quarter?
Vince Morales: Hey Kevin, this is Vince. That was the business as Frank mentioned earlier that had the most leverage potential. Volumes were up 5% and the business sales last year were separate segments. So you can easily do the math, 5% volume increase and again I would tell that as we said coming into this year we expected incrementals somewhere between 30% to 50% and again that was the one business we certainly year marked is having highest potential given the largest drop in volume over the last couple of years.
Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Vince Morales:  Thanks Kevin.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas from JP Morgan. Please proceed.
Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan: Thanks. What was cash flow from operations in the quarter?
Frank Sklarsky:  Cash flow from ops in the quarter I think Jeff, give me one second I will find it. You could ask if you’ve another question Jeff.
Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan: Sure. On a pro forma basis the Akzo, both the acquired Akzo sales in the United States grow versus what they were when they were run by Akzo in the first quarter of last year?
Chuck Bunch:  Jeff they were very comparable with last year, slightly ahead, but very comparable. We shuttered about 100 stores as part of the synergy capture.
Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan: And into the cost reduction that you are doing there since the sales aren’t growing very fast, what’s left. I mean what is the cost that will come out for you to hit your synergy targets? Are there more plants to close or how do you conceptualize that?
Chuck Bunch:  Well, we still have -- we are working through the operations and supply chain portion, some of those changes take quite sometime as we are moving production obtained around the different plants, different distribution centers, we still have back office opportunities that we are working through as we integrate the two organizations those would be two of the bigger buckets left.
Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan: And now that we will annualize the Akzo business, what’s the normalized SG&A growth going forward? Is it a couple of percent or is it [cashed] in that?
Frank Sklarsky: Looking for the company in total?
Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan: Yes.
Frank Sklarsky: We should be I mean if you look at the run rate where we are today, we will be going up from our current run rate in the first quarter. We should be continuing a downward trend, gradual downward trend in terms of SG&A as a percent of revenue.
Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan: All right, okay.
Chuck Bunch: And you asked the cash flow, the cash and I want to make sure you hit the right terminology here, you’ll see the Q coming out in very near future obviously. But cash from operating activities from continuing operations, a $130 million of course that one and then you have some from [discops] and continuing ops about $160 million that’s before CapEx obviously. And we’ll spend between $500 million to $600 million this year in CapEx probably ramping up a little bit more (inaudible) a little less earlier in the year.
Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan: And then lastly, you bought back about $200 million from stock this quarter, how did you pick that number, why wasn’t it zero or $500 million, where did $200 million come from?
Frank Sklarsky: We’ve said that we will continue to have share purchase the integral part of our capital cash deployment strategy. Obviously we look at the entire landscape between dividends, organic CapEx, share repurchase and acquisition activity, we get a little bit of acquisition in the first quarter [high-temp] coatings that was announced, a couple other very small ones that we announced. And we had a remaining offer on our existing share repurchase authorization when we close the year and that was enough that we felt prudent about for the quarter.
Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan: Okay, great. Thanks very much.
Chuck Bunch: Thank you, Jeff.
Operator:  All right then. We have one more question coming from line of Rich O'Reilly from Revere Associates. Please proceed.
Rich O'Reilly - Revere Associates: Hi. Thank you all. Jeff, beat me to the question about Akzo. Okay thanks a lot guys.
Chuck Bunch:  Thank you.
Vince Morales:  Thank you.
Operator: At this time we have no further questions and I would now like to turn the call back over to Vince Morales for closing remarks.
Vince Morales:  Okay. And I’d like to thank everybody for their time and interest in PPG today. If there are further questions please contact me in the Investor Relations section. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, conclude today’s conference. Thank you all for your participation. And you may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Vincent J. Morales: Thank you, Philip. Good afternoon, everyone. Again, Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations. Welcome to PPG's fourth quarter 2013 financial teleconference. Joining me from PPG on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Frank Sklarsky. Our comments today relate to the financial information we released Thursday, January 26 -- or January 16, excuse me, 2014. I will remind everybody that approximately 1 hour ago, we posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on our Investor Center at our website at www.ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide additional support to the opening comments Chuck will make momentarily. Following Chuck's perspective on the company's results for the quarter and the year, we will move to a Q&A session. Both the prepared commentary and discussion during the call may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company's current views about future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. The presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix materials accompanying the presentation and again available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For any additional information, please refer to our filings with the SEC. Now let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch.
Charles E. Bunch: Thank you, Vince, and welcome, everyone. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG Industries. Today, I'm pleased to report record 2013 fourth quarter and full year financial results. This record financial performance caps off one of the most successful years in the company's history, both financially and strategically. Quickly reviewing our strategic initiatives, we announced or completed several considerable actions during 2013. In January, we completed the separation of our Commodity Chemicals business. We closed the North American architectural coatings acquisition in April and announced an agreement to sell PPG's ownership interest in the Transitions Optical joint venture in July. These actions were focused on creating additional value for PPG's shareholders as we shift to a more consistent and higher growth business portfolio. Financially, we once again delivered record results. Our sales for the fourth quarter increased to $3.7 billion, up 14%. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were a record $1.81, exceeding the prior year record by 45%. This marks 14 consecutive quarters of record adjusted earnings, illustrating the benefits of the company's strong coatings portfolio, broad global footprint, prudent cash deployment and measurable results from the strategic initiatives. Supplementing acquisition-related sales gains, our year-over-year volumes grew 2% in the fourth quarter. Volume trends in North America and emerging regions were similar with previous quarters. As we indicated last quarter, Europe continues to stabilize, and our fourth quarter year-over-year coatings volumes in Europe were flat following nonconsecutive quarters of decline. Aggressive cost management, including additional restructuring-related cost improvements, remained a contributor to our earnings growth. Our 2012 restructuring program is substantially complete, and I am pleased to report we have achieved the targeted annual cost savings run rate of about $140 million. Our acquisition integration continued for the acquired North American architectural coatings business, and our synergy achievement in 2013 remained slightly ahead of our targets. We still have a considerable amount of integration work remaining, and initial actions are underway from the restructuring program we approved in the third quarter of 2013, primarily focused on capturing the remaining acquisition synergies. Finally, on fourth quarter results, aggregate segment earnings grew 19% in the quarter with improvement achieved in each reportable segment. Also, each major region delivered earnings growth of at least 14%, including Europe, where our earnings improvement accelerated throughout the year. Quickly reviewing full year results. Sales from continuing operations were $15.1 billion, up 12% versus the prior year. Our volume trend improved throughout the year, aided by the improving European trends during the year, which I mentioned earlier. Volume performance remained generally consistent each quarter in North America and Asia. Adjusted 2013 earnings per share from continuing operations were an all-time record of $8.28. I am pleased to note that we fully replaced the earnings from the separated Commodity Chemical business and did so within 12 months. Our continued strong operating performance and earnings growth from our cash deployment were the main contributors to our year-over-year earnings growth. From a cash perspective, our operating working capital efficiency improved by 160 basis points and contributed to our continued legacy of strong cash generation. We achieved record cash flow from operations, from continuing operations of $1.8 billion for the year, up 15% versus the prior year. Our cash uses remained balanced with a total of $1.5 billion deployed, with a focus on growing the company through acquisitions and capital spending. Additionally, $1.35 billion was returned to shareholders, including dividends totaling $350 million and stock repurchases of $1 billion. We maintained our strong financial flexibility, ending the year with a solid balance sheet, including cash and short-term investments of $1.75 billion. Looking ahead to 2014, we expect modest global growth to continue. We anticipate growth to remain the broadest in the U.S. economy, spanning across several coatings end-use markets as favorable market conditions continue in automotive OEM, architectural coatings and aerospace. Emerging regions growth is expected to remain mixed, but I expect PPG to post solid growth based on the end markets we supply. In Europe, where we have about 1/3 of our sales, economies appear to be improving but remain fragile. We anticipate modest growth in that region in 2014. Equally important is that we expect to realize solid earnings leverage due to the actions we have taken the past 2 years to significantly reduce our cost structure in that region. As I mentioned earlier, we are implementing our restructuring program, primarily focused on capturing additional North American architectural coatings acquisition synergies, and we expect 2014 incremental cost savings of between $75 million and $90 million. We expect the pending sale of our ownership interest in the Transitions Optical joint venture to close by midyear, with PPG receiving about $1.5 billion in after-tax proceeds. That, along with our history of generating strong free cash flow, will supplement our existing balance sheet flexibility. Finally, over the next 18 to 24 months, we anticipate deploying between $3 billion and $4 billion of cash in a disciplined manner on incremental earnings growth initiatives and return of cash to our shareholders. In summary, 2013 was a very successful year for the company overall and also for our shareholders. As we head into 2014, we remain focused on creating additional value for our shareholders. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG. And this concludes our prepared remarks. Now operator, would you please open the line for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs.
Angel Castillo Malpica - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: This is actually Angel Castillo on for Bob. I was just hoping to understand a little bit better. You mentioned the $3 billion to $4 billion in capital deployment. If I'm doing the math correctly, it seems that you really aren't assuming much or any incremental leverage. I was wondering if you could talk about that and just how should we think about that and just your acquisitions versus repurchase strategy, especially since you exceeded your repurchase guidance in 2013.
Frank S. Sklarsky: Yes, in terms of the -- this is Frank. In terms of the leverage, yes, we're looking at the $3 billion to $4 billion being able to be deployed when considering the existing cash balance at the end of this year, $1.75 billion, plus the $1.5 billion Chuck referred to as the after-tax proceeds from TRANSITIONS, along with the ongoing cash flow from operations that we'll continue to generate in both 2014 and 2015. That will be definitely adequate and ample in order to be able to deploy that $3 billion to $4 billion. The question around leverage, we do not need to take on additional leverage in order to deploy that $3 billion to $4 billion, although there's certainly capability on the balance sheet to do so, if we were to desire to do that. But it's not required for the $3 billion to $4 billion to be deployed.
Angel Castillo Malpica - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Great. And just a follow-up question. With all the moving pieces in performance for this quarter, can you help us understand some of the larger impacts, namely just the seasonality that you saw from the Akzo business?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, as we've been highlighting in our second and third quarter reports, the architectural coatings business historically is a seasonal business, with the strongest quarters in the second and third quarters of the year. Fourth quarter, traditionally weaker. That seasonality is present in the Akzo businesses that we acquired. In fact, maybe slightly stronger because of the strong Canadian business that's part of that acquisition. So there was -- we felt that -- we felt good with the performance of the Akzo business. However, as we tried to note in the earlier comments, it is a seasonally weaker quarter with less earnings generation than what we experienced in the second and third quarters.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi from Robert W. Baird.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: On the North American architectural price increases, how should we think about the price realization impact, Frank, on a quarterly basis? And also, you mentioned that the increase was implemented through your stores. What about the other channels?
Charles E. Bunch: Right now, the price increase that we announced and we're implementing, you'll see that -- the effects of that in the store channel in -- beginning in the first quarter of the year. The other channels are -- these are still discussions that we're having with our customers, and we have no announced price increases at this point outside of the one that we've noted in the stores channel.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And what about in Europe when you're -- in the network there?
Charles E. Bunch: The pricing is relatively flat going into 2014. We have the -- some initiatives around certain products or markets. But by and large, we're going into 2014 in Europe with stable price.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then just one more on Europe. Chuck, you were a bit more positive on the region during the third quarter as well. Did anything change during the fourth quarter, either positive or negative, that sticks out, either by region or product line?
Charles E. Bunch: Actually, we feel good about what's going on in Europe. If you look at one of our largest markets, automotive, on the sales side, things were picking up. And it looks like now, if you look at all the forecasts for 2014 in automotive production, they are now forecasting an increase in production for automotive, a modest one, 2% to 4%. But that is, we think, an indication of a positive trend. In architectural, even though the fourth quarter European volumes were still down, this was our best performance during 2013. And as we noted in the fourth quarter, overall, for all our businesses, volumes were flat, and that was our best performance. So I think we had discussed what we thought was a stable to improving trend in Europe. We see that. And right now, we feel good about these modest improvements that we're seeing. And although we note that much of the earnings improvement for PPG during 2013, where we did have record pretax, pre-interest earnings was a result of our productivity and cost initiatives, we do feel now that the volume is stabilizing and looking now to be positive, albeit modest. So actually, we still feel pretty good about our commentary around what's going on in Europe.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer from Barclays.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division: A couple of quick questions. One, just the $3 billion to $4 billion in cash back to shareholders, is that inclusive of dividends?
Frank S. Sklarsky: No. In fact, the $3 billion to $4 billion is a combination of cash that could be both returned to shareholders, as well as incremental growth, inorganic growth initiatives, so could potentially be M&A activity to the extent we identify things over the next 18 to 24 months. But it excludes the cash that is already slated to go toward dividends.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Fair enough. And then on the Slide 6, where you're walking through the volume trends, I mean, it's kind of interesting. If you just eyeball down, everything was getting double derivative better throughout the year except the U.S. and Canada looked like it turned or negative in the fourth quarter, again, kind of on a double derivative in that the gain was smaller than the quarter before. Is that an inflection point? Is that -- should we read into that? Or was that an anomaly relative to everything else, do you think?
Frank S. Sklarsky: No, Duffy. If you look last year, that's on a -- we had very good growth in Q4 of '12. So that's just on a more difficult comparable period than the third quarter, as an example, was. So we started to see the inflection actually in '12 of an uptick of activity.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And then just the last one. The sales growth faster than the market in auto OE is a little bit of a lagging indicator in that it's the wins that you got in the preceding year. When you look back at '13, how was your win rate on new business for auto OE globally?
Charles E. Bunch: We felt good about our performance on, let's say, new business in auto OEM. And as you know, there's a lot of new construction of manufacturing facilities around the world, both here in North America and in China, 2 of the biggest markets. But we're also seeing it in not only in Mexico, part of the North American growth, but also in South America. So we feel very good about the new technologies that we've introduced over the last couple of years. The compact process for the total coating system in automotive OEM, plus our new electrocoat generation is doing very well. So we're confident that the sales growth that we've seen and getting our share of new business from these new facilities or additional awards are in place.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Chuck, just on Performance Coatings, you know that earnings were hurt by some growth-related spending in aerospace and refinish. How much was that? And is that continuing into 2014?
Vincent J. Morales: Hey, Dave, this is Vince. The additional spending on higher sales level combined is single mid -- single-digit millions of dollars. So fairly de minimis.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Very good. And Chuck, just how is the M&A pipeline today?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, it's very active. From a discussion standpoint, we hope to realize some acquisitions here throughout 2014, having what we feel are good productive discussions. But obviously, we're maintaining our traditional discipline around valuations. But we're confident that we'll be able to announce here in the coming quarters new acquisitions for PPG.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And just lastly, on the 10% auto OEM growth, Chuck, I think there was some benefit from a competitor who was recently acquired. Do you expect that -- those benefits to taper off in 2014 as that competitor gets its feet under it?
Charles E. Bunch: I think that the trends that we've seen, the competitors that we have out there are all -- seem to be performing in the marketplace. And so we feel that the momentum that we have that we think is continuing is again based on service and technology, and it's always been a competitive environment out there. But we feel confident that we're going to be able to continue to grow the business nicely here in 2014.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.
Robert Walker - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: This is Rob Walker on for Laurence. I guess, can you be a little bit more specific about the growth projects you have planned for '14?
Frank S. Sklarsky: Is there specific business, Rob, you want to talk about or just in general?
Robert Walker - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: The increase. I mean, is it mostly in North America? Any particular region or line?
Frank S. Sklarsky: Well, we do have some incremental CapEx in the year. We're not talking about hundreds of millions of dollars, tens of millions, let's call it, and that's to expansion capacity in automotive OEM and industrial in each one of the regions. And to that extent, that spending's going to be very accretive from a value-creation standpoint. So from an organic standpoint, that's what we have going on from an inorganic, as Chuck referred to, on the M&A side of things.
Charles E. Bunch: But we have a number of businesses outside of just the industrial or automotive space, and I think Frank highlighted some of the projects that we have in Russia, Brazil, Mexico, China, where we feel that 2014 is going to be a very good year for the automotive OEM and the industrial businesses. But on the Performance Coatings side, aerospace looks to have another solid year in front of it, a lot of momentum on the commercial aviation sector. We're well positioned with our products, including the growth from the new acquisition at Deft. The refinish business continues to grow, especially in emerging regions. And we look for continued improvement that we saw at the end of the year in Europe. And on the construction markets overall, for both our architectural coatings and our flat glass businesses, we think they're going to benefit from this continued growth here in North America. And as we've said, the European business on architectural should be stronger, along with the rest of the region. So we're quite excited about the prospects that we're seeing, and we think we have a lot of initiatives in place to drive profitable growth for the company.
Robert Walker - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: And I guess, just on Performance Coatings, what -- how much were volumes, either up or down, excluding marine? And I guess, your expectations kind of for the next quarter? Can those be -- start to turn positive?
Vincent J. Morales: Rob, Vince again. If you look at the segment, the volume decline of 3% that we included in our prepared materials was exactly the decline related to marine. So if you took the marine negative out, it would have been flat.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar from Citibank.
Daniel Jester - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: It's Dan Jester sitting in for P.J. So on your favorable view of the North American architectural market, is that still predominantly residential recovery? Or are you starting to see some improvement in the commercial market?
Charles E. Bunch: We started to see -- 2013 was primarily about the recovery in the residential markets, and we see that continuing. We saw some signs later in the year and in the fourth quarter that the commercial market may be beginning its long-awaited recovery. The business that we have that's most directly exposed to commercial construction activity is the flat glass business, and they had a better fourth quarter when you look at the architects' indexes and the like. And so we're more comfortable that the commercial market, starting with maintenance markets but also expanding out there, we're going to see some growth here in commercial construction in 2014.
Daniel Jester - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then on titanium dioxide, I think that you said previously that your goal in 2013 was to reduce your usage by 2% or 3%. I guess, did you hit those goals? And do you have any goals for 2014?
Charles E. Bunch: We did hit our productivity targets for TiO2 within that range, the lower end of that range, but we did achieve them. And we are continuing the programs that we've discussed. And again, I would expect further productivity improvements for us in 2014. But probably again, probably at that lower end of the range as we've, I think, capitalized on the best or quickest opportunities that we had. So I think there's still more to go. But we've certainly hit our targets over these last 2 years. We're still working, but I don't think that we're going to see the kinds of reductions that we saw in 2012 and '13.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities.
Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: This is Frank Mitsch sitting in for Frank Mitsch. Chuck, I wanted to get a clarification on the volumes in Europe. You had mentioned that you expect them to be positive in 2014. Is that an overall comment or are you speaking specifically to architectural EMEA?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, that's an overall comment for all of our businesses. So that if you look at the fourth quarter, we were flat on volumes. But I would expect that as we go through the year in architectural, that we're going to see a return to positive trends as we go through the year here in architectural.
Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: A return to positive trends. Okay, great. And obviously, that business was a big beneficiary of the cost-cut programs. Your margins went up over 200 bps. What -- is there any incremental savings left in 2014 that will supplement the sort of improvements you're going to have from volumes moving in the right direction?
Charles E. Bunch: Yes. We're going to see a small, what I would call, a small increment in the cost savings for architectural in Europe. And you're going to -- if you look at it, an anniversary of those benefits, so we're going to still see in the first half of the year, the completion of the rest of the cost savings and productivity initiatives. So we still have what I would call modest improvements to look forward to here in the first half.
Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: All right, great. And then lastly, we talked a little bit about price increases in the company-owned stores. What's your overall take for the raw material environment in 2014 on the coatings side relative to 2013?
Charles E. Bunch: We are still looking forward to relatively stable raw material prices inflation projections, low-single digits. Now we've seen some of the commodities moving around a little bit. We have a little bit of energy cost inflation. If you look at what's happening to natural gas and some of the transportation costs, propylene has moved up a little bit. It usually does at this time of year. Nothing that's an overall concern. But our forecast right now overall for the inflation basket, including raw materials, low-single digits.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I guess, I still have a couple of questions on Performance Coatings. I think your operating profits were up $2 million year-over-year, and your sales were up $290 million. And I realize that it's seasonally weak. But why weren't operating profits higher?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, in the fourth quarter, if you look at what we've indicated, we had weaker activity in marine, which had been a very profitable segment or market for our protective and marine segment. And also in architectural coatings, there is an amount. You have seasonally weaker volumes in the business. We've talked about the seasonality of the Akzo business, which is a little higher because of the presence there, Canadian presence. But you do have higher fixed costs in architectural coatings, especially with the store networks. So that as you're putting less volume through, the cost structure, both manufacturing, distribution and stores network, that will affect your profitability for the business in these seasonally low quarters.
Frank S. Sklarsky: And the other thing I would add is that even in some places where we had some volume uptick in Asia, for instance, there was a little bit of currency headwind there. So you have to take that into account, too.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I think earlier in the call, you commented that if you excluded the marine business, the volumes would have been flat in the fourth quarter and Performance Coatings. What were the other things that shrank? Why weren't Performance Coatings even a little bit stronger, excluding the contraction in marine?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, I think as we indicated in the supplemental material from this afternoon, Jeff, that we are, in the fourth quarter, still experiencing the volume declines in our legacy architectural business from the loss of the price points, the low-end price points at Lowe's. So that was the other volume indicator in the fourth quarter for Performance Coatings.
Vincent J. Morales: We had growth, Jeff, in aerospace and refinish that offset that.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then lastly, why have you increased prices in company-owned stores? There's not really a lot of raw material inflation. Are your prices lower than some of your competitors? Or what's the justification you've got?
Charles E. Bunch: No. There is still inflationary cost in the store network. Both -- from a distribution standpoint, we have higher transportation, higher labor and benefit costs. So these costs are still impacting our businesses, and so this was what we felt was the right opportunity to announce these price increases early in the year, the beginning of the season, that we would be in a position to offset these increases as we move through the year.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Chuck, you seem cautiously optimistic on the organic growth outlook. Can you talk a bit about what's kind of your macro call on global industrial production? And then what -- given all the cost cutting and productivity moves you've made over the last years, what kind of incremental operating and gross profits do you see in businesses like EMEA or industrial?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, at this point, our macro forecast on global industrial production is up 2% to 2.5%, something in that neighborhood, a little stronger here. Obviously, stronger in China today, not as much in a couple of the other emerging regions. And Europe, just kind of breaking into kind of a positive low-single digit. So overall, we think that the improvement is going to be noticeable even if it isn't considered robust.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: And can you comment on incremental -- what kind of operating leverage you would get from even a modest rebound in volumes in some of your key businesses?
Vincent J. Morales: Hey, Don, this is Vince. It depends, obviously, on the market and the region. As Chuck alluded to in his opening remarks, for us, Europe provides the most upside as we've got -- as we've taken out a tremendous amount of cost and we've got good leverage there. And we'd see margins between 25% and 40% incrementally depending on the business, the time of year. And elsewhere in the world, it would be toward the lower end of that range.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. And then finally, on the $1.5 billion from proceeds from the TRANSITIONS sale, is the plan to do a significant share repurchase to offset the loss of the TRANSITION earnings as they go out the door? Or are you still focused on using that for acquisitions?
Frank S. Sklarsky: Well, again, that would also be wrapped up in that $3 billion to $4 billion that we could potentially deploy -- or that we will deploy over the next 18 to 24 months. And we will continue to have share repurchase and M&A, both as integral parts of the capital allocation strategy. And in some quarters, it might be more of one -- more of the other depending on the timing of the acquisition activity. I can think -- you can see that we have actually absolutely been committed to returning cash to shareholders, as evidenced by hitting $1 billion in 2013 with the significant amount we did also of $680 million in the fourth quarter. So again, that $1.5 billion is in that $3 billion to $4 billion that we intend to deploy.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nils Wallin from CLSA.
Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division: On Slide 8, shows very helpful volume trends index to 2008 and it's, I think, interesting to show how much Europe is down, as well as U.S. and Canada. Is there anything structural that would imply these volumes can't get back to the 2008 levels? And if so, what would it -- if there isn't anything structural, what would it take to get there? And how long?
Charles E. Bunch: If you comment on the situation, I'll take the example of the North American automotive industry. When the volumes really declined by almost 50% here from 2007 through 2009, there was a view that we'll never get back to those peak years in automotive in North America of 2005, '06 or '07. And here we are 3, 4 years into the recovery at production volumes for North America in automotive at near records, and we're going to see that, we think, continue in 2014. So there is a lot of pessimism sometimes at the depth of these recessionary environments, and I think it will take a while for Europe to get back to what we saw prior to the Great Recession, but I think we're going to see that begin to turn. There were a lot of structural and banking issues in Europe. But I'm confident that they're going to start to see a modest recovery, and it may take them quite a while because I think we addressed a number of those issues here in North America, probably a little more painfully in the early parts of the recession, but it did position us for a recovery. And so I am confident that over time, you will see the growth in Europe return, may take a few more years. If you look at that chart, it's taken us 4 years, and we're still not quite back overall in the economy to that level. But you were seeing it in automotive now. I think we're going to see it in the construction markets. And I think we're going to start to see that line turn a little bit, but it's going to be slow in Europe. And we're certainly not expecting a robust recovery, but we think we'll start to see those early signs of a positive economic growth even at a very low level.
Frank S. Sklarsky: And in automotive, to Chuck's example there, in Germany, in France, Italy, U.K., Spain, even in commercial vehicles, December registrations versus prior year were all up, and that's a turn for some of those countries versus several months of being down year-over-year. So that started to turn. Architectural, as I said before, should be going from negative to modestly positive during the year 2014. Refinish has already turned positive. Aerospace has been positive. So all those are positive indicators to start chipping away at that 20% you see on Slide 8. And in fact, in Germany, when you look at industrial production or GDP, those were all solidly positive with industrial production ahead of GDP because they've got some exports going in their favor as other parts of the world pick up growth. But -- so U.K., the strongest, followed by Germany. Benelux has been fairly strong; Poland, returning to growth; and Spain, turning positive. So all positive indicators.
Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division: Got it. That was helpful. Just on -- just turning to your protective coatings, the synergies you got from selling protective coatings in the stores, was that in the original synergy guidance? And if not, what's the opportunity there?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, we were aware that there would be an opportunity to sell additional protective coatings in North America with the acquisition of Akzo North America business. We also made a small acquisition in Canada during this time where we picked up -- or we returned the license to PPG for one of our Canadian distributors. So we think that the combination of these opportunities, not all just related to the Akzo acquisition, are going to produce some positive synergies. We think we're going to be able to see that capture throughout 2014 in a way that we were just getting started in some of these markets during 2013. So we think it's an additional synergy opportunity. We were aware that there'd be some of that, but we think the opportunity is there, if we can capitalize on it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: A question on Performance Coatings. If we were to strip out the acquisitions, would your fourth quarter margins have been flat, up or down? Trying to get a sense for how the legacy PPG businesses would have been trending, recognizing the size of the deals and the pronounced seasonality there.
Vincent J. Morales: Yes, Kevin, this is Vince again. As you read the commentary we put out at 1:00, we had roughly $300 million of architectural acquisition-related sales in the segment, and that was roughly at a breakeven for the quarter, which is customary. Last year, that business was not owned by us. It was in the red, solidly in the red. So we've made -- our synergies have made it a breakeven business in a seasonally low quarter. And if you do the math on that, you can see that our margins on the legacy Performance Coatings segment would be up year-over-year.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And if we adjusted for Deft in a similar fashion, would that still be true, Vince?
Vincent J. Morales: Yes. That was a small contributor. It's a smaller business, much smaller business.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Yes. Okay. Secondarily, Chuck, you've been very active on portfolio management, to say the least. You've commented on M&A a bit. I'm wondering about your view on the divestiture side and whether we should anticipate anything in terms of flat glass or fiber glass, say, looking over the next year or 2.
Charles E. Bunch: Certainly, looking over the next year, we don't have any active discussions going on for those businesses. As we've said in the past, for these or any of our other less core activities, that we would certainly consider a -- any transaction that created significant value for our shareholders. But at this point, over the next year or so, we don't have any active discussions. And we see these businesses as now benefiting from some of the recovery here in North America and some of our key markets. So we view them as stronger contributors over the next year as some of these markets recover.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And finally, if I may, just on a housekeeping issue. Would you intend to leave Optical in your financials or move it to discontinued operation for the first quarter?
Frank S. Sklarsky: Well, as we've said, we intend for the business to -- transaction to close in the first half of the year. And once the conditions for a closing have been met, at that point in time, we would move it to discontinued operations. So all we can say right now is it'll be sometime in the first half. And of course, once it moves to disc ops, it will recast for all periods presented.
Charles E. Bunch: But that would be a recast for the TRANSITIONS business.
Frank S. Sklarsky: Right, right.
Charles E. Bunch: Obviously, we have an ongoing Optical and Specialty Materials business that's also performing well. Now if you look at our quarterly performance in silicas, in our OLED business and the remaining pieces of Optical outside of TRANSITIONS, we have what we feel is a strong business portfolio outside of TRANSITIONS, which, as Frank described, would move into discontinued ops with the -- with all the conditions to closing that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ivan Marcuse from KeyBanc.
Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Most of my questions have been asked. Just have a couple of quick ones. In the fourth quarter, what was your -- for coatings, the raw material basket, was that up or down or flat year-over-year?
Charles E. Bunch: I would say flat.
Frank S. Sklarsky: Yes. Ivan, if you dissect that a little more detailed, we are seeing, as Chuck alluded to earlier, higher propylene derivative costs year-over-year offset by some other items that are slower in terms of pricing.
Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Great. And then in the packaging business, you mentioned that was up in all regions except for Europe. Was Europe just more of a market demand thing or was there some sort of share -- market share shift?
Charles E. Bunch: That was -- I think the market conditions in Europe were slower. But there has been an increased competitive activity in the packaging coatings business, especially in the European region. But obviously, we are holding on our own and growing in the markets that have growth like Asia.
Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And then my last question, you may have touched on this in a previous answer, I just missed it. But you mentioned that the U.K. was up, and historically, I believe that U.K. has been -- is a bit of a leading indicator for PPG for that region. Historically, how long has -- does the other countries follow, if that's true, U.K. after you see it sort of turn? If you understand my question.
Charles E. Bunch: We do, and I think, historically, what we've seen is the U.K. markets have -- if the U.S. starts to turn, we see the U.K. improvement earlier than Continental Europe. And then probably if you look at the tendencies or the trends that we're seeing, that's going to be followed by Eastern Europe. So what we saw in 2013 was a clear improvement across a number of markets in the U.K. They're not the leading automotive producer. But certainly, in automotive sales and in production, the U.K. was growing. The architectural market turned around in the U.K. We would look then for the Western Europe to follow, usually with a couple of quarters lag. And then from there, you'd usually see then Eastern Europe follow. So I would say that's one of the reasons why we feel that there will be a positive turn in Europe, albeit, I think, we use the word fragile. I would say it's going to be weak. But the markets that have been weaker and shown less signs of a turnaround have been in Eastern Europe. And we're looking here in the first half to see some improvement in Western Europe now. And hopefully, by the latter half of the year, to see some of the economies in Eastern Europe also begin to stabilize and turn around.
Frank S. Sklarsky: Yes. Ivan, I mean, in the U.K. where a lot of our business is architectural, that's one of the reasons we're seeing that business turn positive in 2014. That economy's followed by Germany, where we have more of a business in automotive, and so we've seen -- already seen that turn positive, and that trend should continue. What'll really help us from an operating leverage standpoint is when France turns. And right now, of course, it's been a little bit flattish. But when that turns, substantial part of that business is architectural and that'll really help us accelerate the growth there and in a very accretive way. We just are -- it's just an uncertainty as to when that will turn as the U.K. has. So far it hasn't had happened, but we're hopeful for sometime in 2014 for that to turn also.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Charles Dan from Morgan Stanley.
Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Most of my questions have been answered, and I apologize if it did miss this earlier. Can you just clarify, of the forward guidance you gave on restructuring-related benefits, how much of that is related to the acquired AkzoNobel assets?
Vincent J. Morales: Yes, glad you asked the question, Charlie. If you look, we laid out in the press release and the prepared remarks $75 million to $90 million of incremental year-over-year cost savings. Those are programs that we've announced previously. If you recall, we closed on the acquisition in April. We put out a synergy target and also indicated we'd have some restructuring, which we announced in the third quarter. And so this $75 million to $90 million are programs that we've already announced. The lion's share of that will occur in our Performance Coatings segment with the synergy capture of Akzo. We also have some targeted synergy -- targeted cost savings, excuse me, in restructuring and in a few other businesses. And again, we laid this out in our third quarter. That included much smaller amounts in businesses like architectural, EMEA, marine and fiber glass. So of the $75 million to $90 million, the lion's share of that would be specific to that acquisition and a much smaller portion allocated to those 3 other buckets.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts from UBS.
John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: It sounds like we'll have the TRANSITIONS business in the earnings here in the first quarter. Should we expect another really strong quarter? I mean, the $1.5 billion doesn't change, and you get to keep half of anything you can generate over the next couple of quarters. So I assume you're running that business relatively hard right now.
Vincent J. Morales: Yes. John, again, we can't tell when we're going to get the final regulatory approvals, which is what we're waiting on. But until we do that, we'll continue to classify the business as continuing. We didn't talk a lot about it, but the business had a very successful Q4. Substantial event occurred with the new release of a Gen VII product in North America about a week or so ago. There was a nice pipeline fill in Q4. And we're certainly still waiting to see how that is going to translate in Q1 at market sales, but we're certainly excited. We did see good progress last year in Europe under similar circumstances. So yes, we feel good about the business. The fourth quarter was strong, and we expect that to continue here, early part of the year.
John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: If you had another 14% sales growth in that segment, would you have another 25% earnings growth? Is that incremental math still in play in the first quarter?
Vincent J. Morales: Yes, all that sales growth, as Chuck alluded to, was not all TRANSITIONS. We did have good silica. We did have good optical products outside of TRANSITIONS. Typically, these businesses, coatings and specialty materials, do have a lot of leverage on the upside to a degree.
John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And then secondly, are the same-store sales in the PPG stores benefiting at all from closure of Glidden stores? That is, are you capturing some of that closure sales volume in that same-store sales number or in your continuing stores?
Charles E. Bunch: Yes, we think there is some of that, a small piece. As we've tried to analyze it over the last few quarters, we obviously have closed stores in the combined network now. So we're looking to maintain as many of those sales in the remaining stores. So again, a very -- what we feel is a very solid number for same-store sales growth for PPG, but we think there is a little bit of benefit in there from the closed Glidden stores in the network.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Hocevar from Northcoast Research.
Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research: I was wondering what your visibility is like in the marine market, and as the year progresses, if you see that flattening out. Or do you expect kind of these negative volume comps to continue throughout all of 2014?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, when you look at our sales over the course of 2012 and 2013 and the new business that we're capturing for future sales, we experienced probably one of the larger decreases in our marine sales between the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013. So one of the things that we're suffering in the fourth quarter is the comparison with what was still a stronger period of sales level in marine from business that had been previously booked and was being finished up. So I think in the first quarter of 2014 and throughout the year, we will have, let's call them, easier sales comparables with the prior year. And we are seeing new bookings growth, but I would not expect the sales level to move up significantly until the latter part of 2014. But certainly, we're seeing a stable level of sales now going into 2014. So the comparables will be better.
Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research: Okay, great. And in terms of the auto OEM business, could you -- you mentioned you expect to outperform the industry again in 2014, and I believe you've outperformed the industry 700 or 800 basis points, something like that, in 2013. Is that type of outperformance what we should expect in 2014 as well? Or is that a little bit optimistic?
Charles E. Bunch: I would say that I don't know that we look for that type of outperformance in every year. We think that we've benefited, again as we mentioned, on the technology side and being well positioned in the fastest-growing markets in places like North America or in China. So I think on a longer-term basis, you wouldn't expect that, but we still feel that we have positive momentum going into 2014.
Vincent J. Morales: And one of the other factors, too, is that as the Japanese OEMs and even some of the European OEMs localize production in other markets to add incremental capacity, we do tend to benefit from that by virtue of our technology, service levels, contact process, whatever. So new facilities, we tend to get a very good portion of that market in addition to the layers as a result of some of the technologies in existing facilities. So that also helps to contribute to having some level of over performance versus the market going forward.
Operator: All right, ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one final question, and that question is coming from the line of James Sheehan from SunTrust.
James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Chuck, just wondering on the price increases in the company-owned stores, for the Akzo stores in particular, are the price increases equivalent to those in the legacy PPG stores? Or are they a little bit higher or lower?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, right now, we're consolidating store operating systems. We're consolidating management and practices. So you should expect similar strategies and policies, including pricing, regardless of whether these were a legacy Akzo or PPG's store.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Vince Morales for closing remarks.
Vincent J. Morales: I just want to thank everybody again for their attention and interest in PPG. If you have any further questions, please contact our Investor Relations function. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may all now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2013 PPG Industries Earnings Conference Call. My name is Philip, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Vincent J. Morales: Thank you, Philip, and good afternoon, everyone. Again, this is Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations for PPG Industries. Welcome to our third quarter 2013 financial teleconference. Joining me on the call today from PPG is Chuck Bunch, PPG's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Sklarsky, Executive Vice President of Finance and CFO. Our comments relate to the financial information we released today, Thursday, October 17, 2013. I will also remind everyone that approximately 1 hour ago, we posted commentary and accompanying presentation slides at our Investor Center on our website at www.ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call, and they provide additional support to our opening commentary. Following the opening comments, we will move to a Q&A session. Both prepared commentary and discussion during the call may contain forward-looking statements, reflecting the company's current view about future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. The presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which again are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For any additional information, please refer to our filings with the SEC. And now, let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch.
Charles E. Bunch: Thanks, Vince. As all of you can obviously tell, I have been having issues with my voice these past few days. I've been told I need to limit the amount of my talking to rest my voice so it can return to normal. So I am going to leave the vast majority of the earnings call commentary today to Frank and Vince. I will stay on the line and participate in the call. I want to express my regrets to everyone for this unexpected issue. Now I will turn the call over to Frank to go over our prepared remarks.
Frank S. Sklarsky: Thanks very much, Chuck, and good afternoon, everyone. We do appreciate your continued interest in PPG. Today, we're very pleased to report our third quarter financial results, which included records for both sales and adjusted earnings per share. Our sales in the quarter of $4 billion were up 17% versus last year. Our adjusted earnings per share of $2.44 from continuing operations exceeded our prior year record by 31%. Similar to last quarter, we more than fully replaced the earnings per share reduction stemming from the separation of our former Commodity Chemicals business. Feeding our performance in the quarter were improvements in overall market conditions, and compared with the first half of 2013, our year-over-year sales volume trends improved in each major region during the quarter. Our growth rates in North America improved and were more broad-based and included continuing benefits from aerospace, automotive OEM coatings, and Architectural Coatings, as well as contributions from most other businesses. In Asia, higher demand occurred in most end-use markets we supply. However, marine new-build activity remains sharply negative on a year-over-year basis. Lastly, while volumes remained slightly negative in Europe, the trend has significantly improved versus the earlier quarters this year as we experienced some initial signs of stability in the region. Our volumes were down 2% in the Euro region during the third quarter compared to mid to high single-digit percentage declines experienced in the first half of 2013. Another contributing factor to our performance is the ongoing aggressive management of our cost base. Our cost actions included the continued implementation of the business restructuring actions that were approved and started in early 2012, as well as other ongoing discretionary cost reduction initiatives. As a result of both the improving regional demand trends and our proactive cost management, PPG team delivered record third quarter earnings in all major regions, once again this quarter, including Europe. Another element contributing to our overall stronger financial performance was the result of our cash deployment, including the sales and earnings benefit from the North American Architectural Coatings business we acquired from AkzoNobel on April 1. Sales in the quarter from the acquired Akzo business, approximately $400 million, and we achieved an earnings return on sales in the upper mid-single-digit percentage range. We continue to integrate the business and with good progress. Within 6 months of closing on the acquisition, we've already achieved, on a run-rate basis, over 50% of our full acquisition synergy target of $200 million. While we still have a considerable amount of work to complete, we're pleased with the team's progress to date. In addition, we spent $180 million in the quarter on share repurchases, bringing our year-to-date total to about $325 million or slightly higher than 2.1 million shares repurchased. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect to continue to benefit from the gradual growth in global demand trends. The fourth quarter is seasonally slower than the third quarter in many of our businesses and especially Architectural Coatings. We're expecting a larger magnitude of sequential seasonality this year as Architectural Coatings now represents a larger proportion of our revenues following the previously mentioned acquisition. Regarding regional trends, we expect the U.S. economy will continue its modest growth supported by increasing demand in the many markets we supply. Emerging region growth is expected to continue and remain inconsistent by end-use market and country. In Europe, where our volumes are still down about 20% versus prerecession levels, demand appears to be stabilizing, and we remain poised to benefit from the operating leverage based on any volume improvement given the actions we have taken there to substantially reduce our ongoing cost structure. Also from an overall PPG perspective, we remain focused on achieving additional cost efficiencies and have started implementation of the business restructuring program that our Board of Directors approved during the quarter and was included in our reported earnings today. The elements of the program include securing remaining synergies in the acquired Architectural business, along with targeted actions in certain businesses that continue to face challenging market conditions, including protective and marine coatings, Architectural Coatings EMEA and fiberglass. As these actions are now just being implemented, they will only provide nominal earnings benefit in the final quarter of 2013. However, given the rapid payback nature of these actions, we expect to realize the majority of the savings benefit in 2014. Finally, our year-to-date cash from operations is $1.3 billion, up about 25% versus last year, which includes the benefit of our strong earnings results, coupled with improved working capital performance. We once again ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet and with cash and short-term investments of about $2.2 billion. We remain focused yet disciplined on timely cash deployment geared towards earnings accretion, and we continue to assess potential acquisitions and other growth-related uses of cash with attractive rates of return, including organic capital spending. We expect additional free cash flow in the fourth quarter, which is traditionally our strongest cash generation quarter seasonally. And in the continuing heritage of returning cash to shareholders, we are increasing our targeted full year 2013 share repurchase level toward the higher end of our previously communicated range of $500 million to $750 million. Once again, we appreciate your interest in PPG. This concludes our prepared remarks. Now operator, would you please open the line for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi from Robert W. Baird.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Yes, on your prepared comments, you noted that auto refinishing was a little bit weaker in North America. Just curious as to why this is because previously you talked about weakness in Europe, but was it just a tougher comp in North America or was there something else there?
Frank S. Sklarsky: Yes, I think that's it. It's still doing very well. It's just really the comparison as you mentioned. This is still performing quite nicely with good profitability. So no significant issues there.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then just sort of on Europe, just given your commentary of Europe stabilizing or less bad, if you will, does that region get more attractive for you? As you start to think about future acquisitions, are you sort of repositioned for the upturn in the various countries there?
Frank S. Sklarsky: Certainly, the acquisition of pipeline that we're looking at is going to include a variety of opportunities in all the regions in a variety of businesses. So we certainly wouldn't shy away from that should a good opportunity present itself. But yes, I mean, when we look at the outlook for 2014, fourth quarter and 2014, things are stabilizing and turning. The decline rates in those businesses that are still showing decline are moderating substantially. Auto business continues to do very nicely, aerospace and some of the others. So yes, we would not shy away from Europe as a region.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay, great. Chuck, I hope you feel better soon.
Charles E. Bunch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Securities.
Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Yes. Chuck, let me offer my well wishes for a speedy recovery of your voice. Frank, a large part of the transcript and some of the commentary did revolve around Europe, and you're seeing pockets of growth there and you're suggesting signs of stabilization. What gives you the confidence? And where are those pockets of growth? And looking at that Slide 9 where you see how the year-over-year volume trends are moving in the right direction, I mean, are -- is it fair to say that we're going to get close to the breakeven point in the next quarter or 2 and then start seeing positive comps there?
Frank S. Sklarsky: I mean, if you look at it from a macroeconomic standpoint, all the economists are projecting a very modest GDP growth next year. And we're kind of seeing the same kind of outlook when we talk to our businesses. The recent trends have pointed very clearly to dramatically reduced decline rates. We see that in Architectural, we see that in the Industrial segments and the refinished segments, PMC, and so forth. And auto continues to be very positive and strong, and that has not subsided. So the vast majority of our businesses are starting to migrate toward that breakeven lines and a few of them already have crossed that. And so we are cautiously optimistic and see more favorable trends. And certainly, as we get into next year, if the GDP prognostications are correct, I mean we expect things to turn. And again, as we said, we think there's some really nice operating leverage out there in the months and years ahead, given all the work that's taken place on the cost base.
Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: You're already seeing, in some avenues, positive comps already but the expectation is that 2014 will bring a lot -- or more of it if the forecasts are correct. And speaking of 2014, obviously, you guys have a lot of self-help measures in place. The comments about Akzo synergies running a little bit ahead of schedule, at least on a run rate basis. Then you talked about restructuring benefits. How should we be thinking about the year-over-year delta benefit 2014 from those sorts of actions? Can you kind of quantify it and size it for us?
Frank S. Sklarsky: Yes, I mean, if you -- if we start with the synergies from the Akzo acquisition, as we said, we are a little bit more than halfway to the $200 million on a run rate basis. So if you look at the end of this year, call that $100 million-plus out of the $200 million on a run rate basis. And then by the end of 2014, expecting to be upwards -- to the $175 million to $180 million on a run rate basis by the end of the year. And if that occurs evenly throughout the year, which we fully expect, you would book about half that increase actually in the year. So that's that piece of it. On the restructuring programs, of course, when we had the program in 2012 and the benefits from that, we accrued some of that last year. We expect an amount around $80 million in addition this year and then the trailing amount of a modest amount, low double-digits in 2014 to accumulate to the total benefit that we had originally anticipated. And then the new program, we're really not going to see anything significant in terms of benefits in 2013 as we're just getting things underway. But I would say the majority of that new program, the one we announced, the $98 million, the majority of that is associated with achieving the synergies that we've already talked about for Akzo and then a more minority piece, but still significant, is associated with some of the other regions and businesses as we described, and we expect to get most of that remainder occurring through 2014.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs.
Neal Sangani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: This is actually Neal Sangani, on for Rob. Can you maybe, just going back to the synergies, talk a little bit more on the revenue side about what you're seeing and what the outlook is and others, maybe some store closings left to do? And what synergy opportunities are you seeing in brand rejuvenation or anything else on the revenue front?
Vincent J. Morales: Neal, this is Vince. With regards to the Akzo business, the acquired business, we've gone through our process to rationalize the store network already. So we've done that, and that process had been completed. As we noted, we still had for the acquired business about $400 million of sales, which is comparable to what Akzo had last year when the business was still owned by them. With respect to any further revenue synergies, we didn't have any revenue synergies in the project. And again, we're maintaining the top line with a smaller, a more consistent store base, let's say.
Neal Sangani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then on the aerospace side, what contribution is the Deft acquisition having on the top line?
Vincent J. Morales: What we said is that's about a $50 million a year business on the top line. And it's fairly prorated throughout the year, so each quarter's a little over $10 million.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer from Barclays.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division: You guys have a pretty good history of macro analysis, I guess. So you've just gone through probably your '14 planning reviews with all the business leaders, where do you think your guys are more or less negative than kind of the consensus economic stuff that you're reading?
Frank S. Sklarsky: Yes. We're still finalizing and in the process of our 2014 planning, so not complete there just yet. But I would say that, overall, our folks internally are relatively consistent with what you'd see out there from the economists. We start with the GDP projections and also get projections on things that are industry-specific, automotive OEM, for instance, and then look at how we participate in those markets and what new products or offerings that we can offer and put our planning process together from there. But in general, I would say, to your direct question, we don't see -- we don't have any major differences with the major economic assumptions out there with respect to either GDP or exchange rate or things like that.
Vincent J. Morales: And Duffy, I'd say in one instance, which is in Asia, I think we've been a bit more bullish regarding Asia all year. I think our numbers have been -- outside of the Marine business, our numbers have been supportive of our stance. And we have a very good array of businesses there that are really focused on middle-class consumption, automobiles, auto repair, packaging, refinish. And those are what's being propped up, if you will, in China with all the -- their 5-year plan. And so, again, I think we -- our bullish stance there has been warranted.
Frank S. Sklarsky: Right. And I guess, just to add to that, we don't have as significant a presence in the Architectural, which is not -- doesn't particularly bother us right now given maybe some of the modestly -- more modest growth rates in the residential and commercial real estate in the China market right now. So I think things are in fairly good shape.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then in the written commentary, a number of points around the seasonality, kind of Q3 going to Q4, which would lead one to believe that numbers need to come down a little bit, is there something different about the seasonality this year versus what we should expect going forward or what's the right template to think about what a Q3 going into a Q4 should look like with the new footprint?
Frank S. Sklarsky: When we think about the trends, Q3 to Q4, that has not really changed. That same dynamic occurs. All we're trying to do is make sure that there's a common understanding around the fact that because the North American Akzo business, we acquired it on April 1, this is the first quarter, this year's fourth quarter is the first fourth quarter where we will have that business in the mix. And given its significance, the fact that it will exhibit a similar seasonality decline rate from Q3 to Q4, that will just make up a larger proportion of the mix. That's a $1.5 billion business on a run rate basis, let's say. So -- but we said about $400 million of revenue in the third quarter, that declines to 25% per the slide we published this morning. As the other Architectural businesses, it's just making sure there's an understanding of that dynamic. It's just a bigger piece of the pie, but the dynamics really haven't changed at all.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.
Robert Walker - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: This is Rob Walker, on for Laurence. I guess on Europe, so this year, your volume is down mid-single-digits, earnings are likely up mid-teens year-over-year. I know a lot of that's restructuring. I guess, is it normalization improvement you're seeing there? If volume is flat next year, how much can profits grow or do you need volume growth to get the incremental margin benefit?
Frank S. Sklarsky: Yes. I would say if you look at where our earnings profile is right now, if there were to be no change in the volume run rate versus where we are in Q3, you would see an incrementally better profitability story, certainly, in the first half of 2014 because we've gotten a lot of cost rationalization as we have come through the year 2013. But any modest improvement in volume, because we do not have to add structural cost either in the area of capacity in most cases or back office, you're looking at a 30% to 40% profit contribution to the bottom line from incremental volume improvements. So you'll get some improvement in the first half of next year because of the cost improvements that were achieved during that time in 2013 and then any uptick will accrete in a slightly larger way because of the -- you're dropping the profit contribution margin without having to add incremental fixed costs in a big way.
Robert Walker - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Great. And then on raw materials, overall for the basket, how much were -- I guess if you could split it out inorganic and organic, were they up or down year-over-year in Q3? And what's your expectations for Q4?
Vincent J. Morales: Yes. Rob, if you look at our raw material basket, again, it's fairly benign as it's been all year. If you look on the 2 sides, as you mentioned, propylene costs on a year-over-year basis are up more than 25%. TiO2 costs, on the other side of the equation, though, have come down from last year's level. So net, again, if you look at our total raw material basket, it's been fairly benign all year with some ups and downs.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar from Citi.
P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Chuck, I hope you feel better. Frank and Vince, a couple of questions. On automotive OEM, your volume growth at 10% continues to outpace the global OEM industry. So can you tell us which geographies or which areas are you gaining share in?
Frank S. Sklarsky: Well, when we talk about the volume uptick, we gain volume by serving our customers. We have very good relationships with our customers and we bring value-added products and services to them. In some cases, we will pick up business at different facilities with different customers based on our product offering. And so, if we add a facility, you could argue that, that is market share. But we look at it on a manufacturer-by-manufacturer basis, on a plant-by-plant basis, and that's how we pick up business. Now the other dynamic that's taking place that we benefit from is we do not participate with the Japanese OEMs in Japan. As those manufacturers continue to localize their production in the markets that they may have traditionally exported to, in Europe and North America, Latin America, wherever, we have tended to do well in those facilities. And that's another area where we have been able to solidify our market position. So I guess that's the way I would answer it really, that it's the increase over the market. While we may not be able to sustain double-digit increases vis-a-vis market growth forever, where we have been able to pick up business based on our product offerings, our multigenerational product plan and some of the Japanese OEM facilities, that's how we've been able to do that.
P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And just a quick question on sort of M&A divestitures. In Glass, you've seen your segment at its highest in 3 years. So with that kind of recovery, is this now a candidate for divestiture? And then on M&A front, you had mentioned earlier that you guys were interested more in Asia. And can you just talk about what kind of landscape do you see there, and have the bid and ask spreads on these deals coming in?
Vincent J. Morales: Yes, P.J., on Glass, well, the sales have moved up a little bit to our highest level in a couple of years. From an earnings perspective, it's still below the corporate average, and we're just now starting to see -- I think we were a little more bullish on commercial construction coming into the year. That didn't pan out for us in the first half. We did start to see a little bit of a creep-up in volume and commercial construction in 3Q. So some of the end markets that Glass is supplying, we're just starting to see in the early stages of recovery. So we'd like to see that go further, profitability a couple of years ago was in the double-digit range in EBIT and return on sales. So we still think those businesses have some improvement left. I'll let Frank answer the M&A question.
Frank S. Sklarsky: Yes. I guess, we wouldn't want anybody to believe that we're not looking at opportunities in all the major regions because there are opportunities for acquisition, for bolt-ons either in the technology nature or help us solidify a market position or whatever in each of the regions. Certainly, emerging markets are attractive because they can add to our growth profile but so are some opportunities in other regions where we can achieve either revenue or cost synergies or, like I said, solidify market position. In terms of the multiples, multiples are -- we believe are healthy for a couple of reasons. So one is the fact that money is still cheap and valuations adjust based on the fact that cost of capital, at least in the short term, is still very affordable. And then the other piece is that, as some of these markets come out of -- still come out of recession, particularly late cycle types of companies, that's reflected in the present value of their, as you know, future earnings and the multiples will reflect just that. But that doesn't necessarily scare us away from good, solid, high-quality acquisition targets. And like I said before, the pipeline includes a variety of things in all the markets. And all we'll say is that we will continue to focus on our core Coatings businesses as well as close adjacencies to build the portfolio.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson from Susquehanna.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: A question on capital allocation. I'm just wondering, you bumped your share repurchase to the top end of your $500 million to $750 million range. Should we regard this range as a good number for annual purchases from cash flow? And then when you do one-off transactions, whether it was chlor-alkali earlier this year or the TRANSITIONS sale next year, that, that would lead to significant onetime reductions in shares outstanding?
Frank S. Sklarsky: I guess, we wouldn't, at this point, want to nail down a specific number that we would necessarily do on an annual basis. But we would say this, and we have stated this before, and we want to make sure that everybody understands that we're living up to what we've said in terms of our commitments on our capital allocation model. Our priority is continue to invest in -- on organic growth, keep driving the top line, whether that's in technology or incremental CapEx to build for capacity actions, which are highly accretive, number one. Number two, continue to -- sustainable dividend increases along the lines that we've seen in the recent past and even before that. Number three, acquisition targets we just spoke about. And then, where there is excess cash, continue to have share repurchases be an integral part, an important integral part, of our capital allocation philosophy. And there's no reason to believe that, that won't continue. In terms of specific amounts and specific timings, some of that will depend on the exact timing of what we -- identification and completion of certain acquisition targets. But I think it's reasonable to expect that the share repurchases will continue to be an important part of that capital allocation model. And obviously, we disseminate that, updates to that and news about that into the marketplace as soon as our board makes the decisions along those lines.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: One follow-up on U.S. Architectural. You originally targeted, I think, a 10% operating margin for Akzo once you had the synergies behind you. You're already in the upper single-digits. So have you expanded your outlook for the potential margins from that acquisition, and for your overall U.S. Architectural business?
Vincent J. Morales: Don, this is Vince again. I just -- if you look at our targets, we were looking at about a 12% return on sales upon achievement of the full synergy range. We're not changing that outlook. We've got good traction to date. We have a lot of work to do. But I think that's still a good target for us, again, 12%, 12.5% for that acquired business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nils Wallin from CLSA.
Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division: First off, Frank, you mentioned something about M&A and coatings adjacencies. So I was curious if you would clarify that a little bit, what you mean by adjacencies.
Frank S. Sklarsky: Yes, I mean, when we talk about adjacencies, we're not going to go too far afield. But we could explore things in coatings and sealants and adhesives, things that are closely aligned with core competencies in material science where you have a common customer base, we can take advantage of our supply chain, things we know well, things where we can get revenue and cost synergies. So that's what we're really referring to there.
Vincent J. Morales: And Nils, we're in those businesses.
Frank S. Sklarsky: Right.
Vincent J. Morales: They're embedded in our current business structure. Like in automotive and aerospace, we already sell sealants into those markets.
Frank S. Sklarsky: Right.
Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division: Got it. Okay. Since Akzo had the same number of sales year-over-year, if I heard you correctly, and yet a lower store base, does that mean that you just got rid of stores that had really poor sales or was the growth rate in the -- on the lower base just much higher than your base business?
Vincent J. Morales: Well, what I'll remind you, Nils, is the market is growing. And so, while we'd like to think we would keep every dollar from every -- of sales from each store we close, that's not realistic. But we've had very high retention where we've had overlap in stores, and we've got the benefit of market growth. So again, that's how I would characterize how we've been able to maintain that top line.
Frank S. Sklarsky: And in some of the stores, we're in very close proximity to each other geographically. And so, you try to rationalize that in a sensible way. And also there were some that were performing less so and, obviously, that was part of the mix, too.
Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division: Great. And just one last, if I may. On the Industrial Coatings businesses, great, great volume growth year-over-year. But pricing growth has been pretty moderate, which is surprising, given how well auto OEM is doing. Is there something I'm missing there? Is there a mix effect? Just curious as why price growth hasn't been as strong as volume growth.
Vincent J. Morales: We typically price, Nils, in reflection of raw materials. We do get, certainly, new products, we're able to price a little higher. But our focus on pricing is to cover raw material inflation and transportation inflation. And we -- as I said earlier in the call, raw material inflation's fairly benign. We do have transportation inflation this year, which is what we're trying to do with our pricing this year.
Operator: And your next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Frank, in Industrial, you're doing quite well on OEM autos, you're doing okay in packaging. Can you add a little more color on the industrial portion of that business, I guess, as the mix trends in Europe versus the rest of the world?
Frank S. Sklarsky: Yes. I think that when you look overall, first, globally, in Industrial business, the areas that are doing well are heavy-duty equipment, some of the automotive parts and accessories kinds of things where we coat certain components there. The part that is probably a little bit softer out there is the consumer electronics, and we've said that before, no secret there. But other than that, we continue to see some pretty good volumes and some pretty good recovery. And as the commercial construction -- when the commercial construction recovers, we expect to see continued strength in that heavy-duty equipment sector.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: That's a good segue into China. I know you made some comments about China in Q4. What's your expectations for China demand heading out of Q4 into 2014?
Frank S. Sklarsky: I mean, I think we're pretty pleased with the mix of business we have in China. As Vince said before, automotive OEM, refinish, some of the Industrial categories are still doing well. The experts are saying around 7% growth in China next year, which might be a little bit less than it has been traditionally. But 2 things there: one, the law of large numbers is starting to take over; and number two, some of the downdraft is because of residential and commercial construction where we probably have less of an exposure. So we're still pretty optimistic about China for the businesses where we compete. Clearly, we've said before, Asia, on marine new-build, not expected to come back anytime in the near future. But the other businesses, again, we're still optimistic about those for the rest of the year and for 2014.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And just last, some of the TiO2 guys have put forth some price increases with a Jan 1 implementation. What's your view on potential for TiO2 price increases in 2014?
Vincent J. Morales: Dave, we still -- we're not having any problems getting any supply. We're exiting, really, the peak of the paint season now, and our view is that market has sufficient supply. We may come to a situation where we go back to, what I would call, a more seasonal pattern of inflation in some of our raw materials where in parts of the season, they are in more demand; in other parts, they are not. But our view is that market remains sufficiently supplied.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ivan Marcuse from KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Real quick. In Europe, you mentioned in your commentary that it's projected that European automotive is expected to grow, which is consistent with some other data, in the fourth quarter. So how meaningful of a business would that be for you in improvement? And then, if you also look at Europe, you're saying you're going to miss 2 days. How much of a drag in terms of volumes would those 2 days be on that region?
Vincent J. Morales: Ivan, the 2 days less -- 2 less shipping days in the fourth quarter are really an only architectural-driven event. The auto companies and most industrial companies run 24/7. So they're not affected by that. So it's more retail-oriented. So I would say that that's a small -- that's a typically light season anyway, but it's 1% or 2% in terms of just pure math. With respect to automotive OEM, again, if you look at our mix of business geographically, our auto business is about 1/3 U.S., about 1/3 Europe and about 1/3 Asia. So we've got a good mix. And certainly, one of those portions of those businesses have been a downdraft, which is Europe. And from an industry perspective, we perform well. We're glad to see that start to turn the corner. And we would hope that, as Frank mentioned earlier, that it continues, and that'll give us a lift because of the cost we've taken out of the region.
Frank S. Sklarsky: Right, and the operating leverage because the capacity is in fairly good shape at the European business. So any incremental volume will accrete at something closer to the profit contribution margin versus the just the bottom line PTPI margin.
Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Great. And then -- and would that contribution margin be in the same sort of degree that you -- on an increase of volume that you described, previously, in that 30% to 40% range?
Frank S. Sklarsky: I think it's a good rule of thumb to use overall.
Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then in North America, you may have mentioned this, was there a significant difference between sales in your stores versus your mass retail?
Frank S. Sklarsky: Yes. I mean, I think the mass retail is doing well. The company-owned stores are doing well, and I think we stated that the one spot that is doing okay, but not as well as the other 2, would be the PPG legacy and the Akzo dealer store channel. But other than that, things are going fine, continue to benefit from the residential recovery.
Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: So would the stores and the mass retail be up about the same in terms of volume?
Vincent J. Morales: Stores were up a little higher, Ivan, and the mass retailers were up but not as much as stores.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of John McNulty from Credit Suisse.
John P. McNulty - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just a quick question. On the Akzo stores, in the second quarter, I believe the sales rate was about 475, and it dropped to 400 in the third quarter. I know there's a little bit of seasonality, but not quite that much. Is it all just the store closures or is there something else that may be going on, at least temporarily, in that business?
Vincent J. Morales: No, John. If you look -- I'll remind you in the first quarter, on our first quarter call, we put out projected seasonality for that business. And we're tracking almost to $0.01 with what our projections were and what they did last year. So that seasonality you saw, it's about a 15% haircut, it's consistent with history for that business, and it's also consistent with our U.S. legacy business, about a 15% downdraft from Q2 to Q3. And I'll remind you, Q3 to Q4, again, for seasonal reasons drops about 25%.
John P. McNulty - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, fair enough. And then one last question on the stores. Can you give us your outlook potentially for pricing in 2014, if there's room to push higher? Because I think you probably would have to launch it relatively soon if you're going to do it in time for the contract season next year.
Frank S. Sklarsky: I mean that -- a lot of that would depend on the change in raw materials. But as Vince said, that we expect that to be relatively modest, particularly in those materials that impact that segment. So as long as the raw material environment remains relatively benign, we would expect a relatively stable pricing environment.
Vincent J. Morales: Yes, with the -- again, the other thing we're watching, John, is freight. So if that moves up, that's a big -- it's a distribution business.
Frank S. Sklarsky: Right.
Vincent J. Morales: That does have a hefty freight component to it. So if freight costs move up, which they have been, that would be another -- it would be a catalyst for some further pricing.
Frank S. Sklarsky: And OEM was, obviously, one of the drivers of that also on a delayed basis.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: On a per pound basis, did you pay less for TiO2 in the third quarter than you did in the second?
Vincent J. Morales: Yes, Jeff, we typically don't talk about our particular raw materials in that level of granularity. What I can say on a more broad sense is we're not seeing any -- outside of some propylene transitory inflation, everything else is fairly benign.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. You indicated that you lifted your share repurchase target to the upper end of $500 million to $750 million range. But given that you have $2 billion in cash on the balance sheet and you have more coming in, in the fourth quarter, it seems that you've made a decision to retain a lot of cash that is -- I think in the old days, you had a target of maybe having $1 billion cash balance. So what's changed in your thinking? Is it that you bought back so many shares last year, you don't want to buy back too many over a shorter period of time? Or why does it seem that you want to hold more cash now?
Frank S. Sklarsky: Yes, and I would say that, that is not necessarily the case at all. Going -- as we said, we've done about $325 million so far this year. And if we go to that upper end of $750 million, by the end of the fourth quarter, that is buying back over $400 million worth of stock in one quarter, which is a pretty healthy clip. And so, I guess, what we would reiterate is that, as we go forward, as we continue to assess the pipeline of acquisition targets, we also will be looking at making sure that the share repurchases continue to be an integral part of that capital allocation model. And of course, all decisions around that, obviously, are reviewed with our Board of Directors, and they make the final call. But I think we would all, here, internally, our Board of Management agree that, that model that we've used will continue. And no, we do not necessarily believe we need to hold a substantial amount of excess cash on the balance sheet. Let's keep in mind, too, that the TRANSITIONS deal is not yet complete. We expect that by mid next year. But you're correct in saying that we have a very healthy cash balance. We will continue to generate cash, and we will make sure we continue to deploy it in a manner that's accretive and value-creating for the shareholders.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then lastly, you increased your environmental reserves $56 million. Have we come to the end of that or are we going to see another, I don't know, $100 million or $150 million increase in reserves over the next couple of years?
Frank S. Sklarsky: Some of these projects and sites go for a long period of time. And parts of those projects are more predictable than others. We took this reserve now because we had done more work on one of the key sites, in the Jersey Chrome site has been disclosed and, obviously, have more granularity in terms of information and rigor of analysis as we go through time. So we felt this was the appropriate time to take that reserve, it made all the sense in the world. As we go through time, we'll continue to assess the remaining exposures we have at that site and other ones. And the other thing I would say is that when you look at the amount of the reserves, not just for this site but for all the other sites, it is a number of years over which we typically discharge these liabilities. So the amount of cash expenditure in any given year is not really material to our results or our ability to deploy cash. So it should not be a significant concern.
Vincent J. Morales: And Jeff, if you look, we have in our filings some mentioning around what environmental projects we're working on. I think we've been very descriptive in all of our filings about the current and future situations. The cash comment, I just want to elaborate on a little bit from Frank. We spent about $60 million a year in 2010 and '11 on environmental cash deployment. We moved that up about $30 million or $40 million to $100 million, which is the rate we're going to run at for the next couple of years. So Frank's comments that we've not -- we're not spending a lot of cash, this will be discharged over a long period of time, I think are important to understand from a shareholder perspective.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I just want to follow up on store count, Vince. I think you'd mentioned you've completed the rationalization of the Akzo store network. A couple of questions. How many stores did you close there? Also, what was the change in count on the legacy PPG side? And then if you look ahead for, let's say, 2014, how many stores would you plan to add? And what does that future trajectory look like?
Vincent J. Morales: Yes. Kevin, if you look, we started with roughly 1,000 stores. We -- as Frank mentioned, some of those were in very close proximity to each other, in some cases, right across from each other. And we've rationalized, let's say, 5% to 7% of our store network. And so, that's 80 to 90 stores net and, on a go-forward basis, we'll be targeted in store additions. I don't want to give a rule of thumb number, but it's not going -- it's going to be, in a given year, anywhere from 20 to maybe 30 or 40. It depends on the year and what locations we're looking at geographically. So again, I think we'll be measured -- we've got, as you know, 3 different distribution outlets. We got the stores business. We also have the national accounts or DIY business to have another customer touch point in the dealer network. So we want to grow in all those networks.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then just to shift gears, a clarification, if I may, on Optical. I think you've said in the past, you would expect the divestiture to close in the first half of 2014. I guess we've got maybe 2.5 months under the belt now. Any updated thoughts on when you would expect that deal to close? And then also in Optical, I think you're rolling out Gen VII in the U.S. So can you comment as to the 4Q versus 3Q pattern? Is there a loading of the channel to come there?
Frank S. Sklarsky: Yes. And I'll first -- the first question around the timing -- our expectations haven't changed around the timing of the deal, it's still going through the typical normal regulatory approval process in the various regions, and still expect an outlook of first half, by mid-year next year, the closure of that deal. In terms of the Q3, Q4 dynamics, I'm -- recall last year in 2012, Q3, there was some destocking around the circuit, which made the Q3 comparison -- aided the Q3 comparison in terms of a favorable look versus the prior year. In Q4, probably a more typical comparable performance Q4 over Q4. We do have the loading that has been taking place already in anticipation of the January launch in the U.S. of TRANSITIONS VII, that continues. But Q4, last year, was very solid. So probably a more comparable comparison vis-à-vis the very favorable performance this Q3 because of the destocking last year Q3.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn from Longbow Research.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: Chuck, I hope you'll feel better with your voice. A couple of things that I want to touch base on that haven't been discussed already. Number one, when you talk about the Industrial segment, you've done a good job outlining what's going on in automotive and provided some ideas on general Industrial. Can you talk about packaging coatings of the business in the third quarter and your outlook for the fourth? Crown came out with results that were not that spectacular in terms of volume growth on the can business, particularly in the European food pack and U.S. beverage. So can you talk about what you're seeing in the end markets, how your BPA share gains are progressing, and just give us any commentary you can on the Packaging business?
Vincent J. Morales: Yes, Dmitry. We're seeing -- let me give you a little bit of background. As you know, we've got a lot of good activity going on in Asia in terms of just overall market growth. We've got a good position there. And our emerging region growth has really helped us grow on a global basis. We're seeing, like our other European businesses, our business in -- our packaging business in Europe is down modestly. Again, similar to some other businesses in Europe. It hasn't been moving around much. The U.S. business or North American business is solid. It's not a -- it's a GDP-type growth business. With respect to BPA, we're seeing a lot of activity in Europe in terms of going through the testing process. There is some dates out there as you -- as I know you and I have talked about, with respect to what France's legislation is, so there's a lot of -- the can fillers, as well as the can makers are doing a lot of activity. And we're pleased with the progress we've made, but it's still a very small portion of the total packaging business at this point. We do expect it to grow certainly next year and in years coming. But right now, it's still fairly modest in terms of its total size.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: Got it. And if I could ask just on sort of the trends that you saw towards the end of September and, perhaps, early in October. Some of the industrial companies pointed out that there was a little bit of a softness, particularly in the U.S., at the very end of September. Whether or not it had to do with what's going on with the government or not is a different story. But have you seen in any of your businesses, any kind of sort of late quarter pullback from customers in terms of their order patterns or maybe you're seeing it in the first couple of weeks of October or has this just not been an issue for you at all?
Vincent J. Morales: Just to the contrary, Dmitry, if you look at our progression as we went through the quarter, September was our best year-over-year month of all 3 months. So it's just the opposite of what you're describing.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: Okay, all right. So I was just curious because these were comments that were made by some industrial companies but not by others. So I was curious where you came out on that.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Charles Dan from Morgan Stanley.
Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Just a couple of clarifying questions. One, can you quantify how much of a drag on the Architectural business was the lost contract at Lowe's or what that sort of mid-single-digit growth rate would have been without that? I guess we can start there.
Vincent J. Morales: Yes. Charlie, as we said in the past -- I think I'll just give everybody a backgrounder. About 2 years ago, we picked up a position at Lowe's with our Olympic ONE brand. That for us was about $60 million a year. And in addition, this past year, we lost 2 price points at Lowe's. They were the $12 and $18 lower price points. That was a commensurate $60 million a year event. So about $15 million a quarter. And again, we did have positive comps in our DIY channel, so that market growth and the performance of our DIY channel overcame that. And so, we would have been up, obviously, mid to high single digits without that absence of business.
Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And just on the Marine business, can you give some sense for when -- we've seen sort of an extreme decline there, when those comps really get easier and could we potentially be lapping those really severe declines by the first quarter of next year?
Frank S. Sklarsky: Yes. I think to your point, we're within a quarter or 2 where the comps will start to look less unfavorable, start to sort of even out on a year-over-year basis. Keep in mind that there was quite a bubble a few years ago. We don't expect -- so we're sort of bouncing along at lower levels here, absolutely good, but I wouldn't expect any significant uptick in the new-build marine business, certainly, during 2014, perhaps sometime mid-late 2015. Keep in mind, these are long cycle projects, and we will typically participate in terms of ringing in the cash register in the latter part of the project when the coatings go on, on the ships. So the first stage is the RFPs go out, we bid. That can be up to a 12-, 18-month process, then the construction commences. And we put our part of the project in place, and then we generate the revenue and the cash, probably still a couple of years off before you see that happen in a meaningful way. But we are starting to see some repair in terms of deferred maintenance, which is the first glimmer of hope that you start to -- you see some of the shippers release the purse strings a little bit on some of the deferred maintenance and on a follow-on to that, obviously, they'll be doing RFPs on the new-builds. So compares will be a little bit easier, but a little bit of time before we see a significant uptick.
Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: If I could, just one quick question. You guys gave a lot of numbers on sort of the run rate improvements you're seeing in the Akzo synergies. Just so that everybody's clear, is it possible for you to give a range of sort of what your view is on the operating income line there for that business next year?
Vincent J. Morales: Charlie, where we are now is again upper mid-single-digits. We would expect that to go up next year with, again, the increase in synergies capture. So I'm not -- we're not going to put an exact number on it but, again, it'll be part of the way between where we are today and the 12.5% target.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts from UBS.
John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Get well, Chuck.
Charles E. Bunch: Thank you.
John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: For the European recovery that you're seeing, can you talk about how much of that might be export automotive and aerospace? And what I'm getting at is things that might not be local European demand recovering but global recovery just being sourced out of Europe?
Vincent J. Morales: Yet, John, if you look, the -- I wouldn't call it a recovery, we're seeing less negativity and some improvement in a few markets, but it is broad. I mean, every one of our businesses in the quarter did better than the quarter or 2 quarters prior and the quarter prior. So it's more broad than just exports. I do agree with you, there's some additional exports, but this is more of a broad issue. Frank, you want to...
Frank S. Sklarsky: Yes. It's like if you look at the local GDPs in Western Europe, for instance, going from modestly negative to forecast to being modestly positive next year. And also, we're seeing some leading indicators showing that there is less of a decline in the leading indicators. So again, it's kind of mirroring the lower decline rates in the actual revenues. We do expect more of the growth to come from domestic consumption than export as -- now we'll certainly see, to the extent they're exporting to Asia and we see growth in Asia, that will continue. But the increase in the growth rate in Europe, we do expect a significant portion of that, going forward, to have to come from the domestic consumption. If that's a 2 percentage points from negative 1% to positive 1% GDP, that's where that's going to come from.
John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And then secondly, for TRANSITIONS, will we see that as, again, discontinued beginning first quarter 2014 and it'll still be consolidated in the fourth quarter 2013 results?
Frank S. Sklarsky: Yes. We would expect to see it consolidated in the fourth quarter. It would move to continuing operations once regulatory approvals are received. That would be the triggering event to move it over to disc ops.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli from Gabelli & Company.
Rosemarie J. Morbelli - G. Research, Inc.: If I -- if we look at TiO2, does it make a difference to you, for your use of the TiO2, whether it is a sulfate-based or chloride-based process?
Vincent J. Morales: Rosemarie, we use both. It depends on a variety of factors, including location and geography. It depends on end markets. It depends on whether it's slurry or not. So we use a variety of different -- we use both grades in a variety of different ways. And what I would tell you with respect to TiO2 is we are, and we have been continuing to progress along our efficiency programs. And we announced a target a couple of years ago, and we continue to work on that. And we also continue to use more sulfate around the world than we've had in the past. So those are 2 trends that are continuing. But again, we do use both grades.
Rosemarie J. Morbelli - G. Research, Inc.: Okay. So am I correct in thinking that sulfate, there is plenty of capacity and, therefore, you are less likely to get price increases than the -- from the chloride process?
Vincent J. Morales: I would -- there's probably a little more to the algorithm than that. But what I would tell you is that there is certainly excess capacity, in our view, in sulfate, especially in Asia. And again, where we can use sulfate around the world, we're adding to our capabilities there. I would say, in terms of total global dynamics on TiO2 pricing, it's not a simple as what you described.
Rosemarie J. Morbelli - G. Research, Inc.: Okay, that would have been too easy. If I could ask one quick question regarding consumer electronics. You said that demand was weak. This is what everyone else says. Have you seen any sign of a change in trends for consumer electronics?
Frank S. Sklarsky: Not significantly in the recent couple of quarters, no. We really haven't -- not a huge portion of our business, but we haven't seen any major changes in trends.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude the question-and-answer portion of today's conference. I would now like to turn the call back over to Vince Morales for closing remarks.
Vincent J. Morales: Thank you, Philip. And again, I just want to thank everybody for their time today. And if there's any further questions regarding the quarter, please contact me and Investor Relations. Thank you.
Frank S. Sklarsky: Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the PPG Industries Second Quarter 2013 Conference. My name is Shaquana, and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Vince Morales. Please proceed, sir.
Vincent J. Morales: Thank you. This is Vince Morales. Good afternoon. Welcome to PPG Second Quarter 2013 Financial Teleconference. Joining me from PPG today on the call is Chuck Bunch, PPG's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Dave Navikas, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Sklarsky, Executive Vice President, Finance. Our comments relate to the financial information released today, Thursday, July 28, 2013. I will remind everybody that approximately 1 hour ago, we posted detailed commentary and relating presentation slides on the Investor Center at ppg.com. These slides are also available on the webcast site for this call, and they provide additional support to the opening comments that Chuck will make momentarily. Following Chuck's perspective on the company's results for the quarter, we will move directly to Q&A. Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company's current view about future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. Our presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial metrics. The company has provided in the appendix in the presentation materials, which are also available on our website, reconciliation of these non-financial -- non-GAAP financial metrics to the most comparable GAAP financial metrics. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC. Now let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch.
Charles E. Bunch: Thank you, Vince, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG. For the past several years under a variety of different economic circumstances, we have delivered consistent earnings growth. We are pleased to continue this trend as the second quarter financial results included all-time records for both sales and adjusted earnings per share. Our adjusted earnings per share of $2.45 from continuing operations exceeds our prior record set last year. Of equal importance this quarter, we more than fully replaced the earnings per share reduction stemming from separating our former Commodity Chemicals business. This record performance was achieved despite continued divergence in the level of economic activity in the major regions of the world. During the quarter, we benefited from generally modest but consistent growth in most North American end-use markets. Solid growth also continued for all our Asian businesses, except the marine coatings market. Yet again, demand in Europe was lower year-over-year, although we are experiencing a fairly consistent pace of business in the region and a few of our businesses did achieve volume growth in that region this past quarter. The major factors in our improved financial results were continued sales and earnings growth in several of our businesses, including automotive OEM, aerospace and automotive refinish; proactive and aggressive cost actions in all of our businesses, including stringent discretionary cost management and continued benefit from our 2012 restructuring program; and higher sales and earnings benefits from cash deployed on recent coatings acquisitions. As a result of these and other factors, we delivered coatings segment earnings growth of 25% versus last year's record level. Additionally, each major region achieved higher earnings with North America more than 20% higher, emerging regions growth of about 15% and higher European earnings of 8% despite the continued economic challenges in that region. At the outset of the quarter, we completed the acquisition of AkzoNobel's North American architectural coatings business. Results for the acquired business were incorporated into our Performance Coatings segment, along with PPG's companion legacy architectural business. We were pleased with the business performance in this initial quarter, as it is pacing slightly ahead of our target. The business had sales of approximately $475 million and delivered an earnings return on sales of mid-single-digit percentages. We realized $60 million of lower annual cost when the transaction closed, benefiting this quarter by about $15 million. In addition, we achieved some other initial acquisition-related synergies. We still have a great deal of work to do but remain confident that we will deliver our 3-year synergy target of $200 million annually. To that end, our Board of Directors just approved a $102 million restructuring program focused primarily on the synergy capture for the acquisition. The program also includes targeted actions for certain businesses, which continue to face challenging market conditions such as protective and marine coatings and certain European businesses, including architectural coatings and fiberglass. This restructuring program reflects the continued focus on operating and cost excellence, which is what you have come to expect from PPG. We anticipate the majority of the restructuring actions will be completed by the end of 2014. One final comment on the second quarter is that it is typically our largest quarter from a seasonal perspective, and we generally experience normal season trends in most businesses and regions. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we remain optimistic about our earnings growth momentum, driven by many of the same factors that we experienced in the first half of the year. This includes benefits from our recent acquisitions and proactive cost management. We anticipate normal seasonal trends in our businesses and regions and expect several businesses such as automotive OEM and aerospace to remain growth drivers. Our balance sheet remains very strong with about $1.8 billion of cash and short-term investments at quarter end. We continue to analyze prudent cash deployment opportunities focused on growing our earnings and rewarding our shareholders. Overall, we continue to face mixed economic conditions, and we were pleased to have delivered record results for our shareholders. Thank you for your attention. This concludes our prepared remarks. Now operator, would you please give instructions and open the phone lines for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy representing Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Question for you on the growth you're experiencing in Coatings. I think you referenced to 25% growth on a year-over-year basis. Just trying to parse how much was organic versus Akzo. I think you threw out a sales number of $475 million times mid-single digit. Would it be fair to say Akzo contributed $25 million or so in the quarter?
Vincent J. Morales: Yes, Kevin, I think -- this is Vince. I think that's a fair number.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. Very good. And then on the new restructuring initiative of $102 million, is that exclusively part of your $200 million synergy goal looking out to 2015? Or are there other areas of the company where you're taking additional cost actions at this point?
David B. Navikas: Kevin, this is Dave Navikas. Of the charge that we took, about 60% of it relates to the Akzo North American integration, and the remainder relates to other actions in some of our other businesses where there are still weak demand conditions.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay, great. And then a final question I had was on Europe. I guess you're running minus 4% there according to one of your slides versus minus 7% or minus 8% in the prior couple of quarters. Chuck, I think you mentioned in your prepared comments that you were seeing certain businesses that were actually growing, and I was wondering if you could elaborate on that, and maybe talk about where you might be seeing growth in the region.
Charles E. Bunch: Well, growth, I would say, in the region is very challenged right now, Kevin. If you look at several of our businesses like aerospace and packaging, we still have growth in those businesses. However, if you look at the automotive markets or the architectural markets, those are businesses where, from an overall market standpoint, we're still seeing negative growth.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter.
Ramanan Sivalingam - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: This is Ram Sivalingam sitting in for David. Just a quick question on ROS given that we're past the height of the paint production season. How are you thinking about TiO2 pricing in the back half of the year? And also, any update you can give on your use and [ph] reductions of TiO2 would be helpful.
Charles E. Bunch: TiO2 pricing for the second half, we're in discussions now, so it would be too early. We're -- to comment, we're looking overall at stable raw material pricing in the second half of the year. We continue to have success in terms of improving our productivity in our formulations for TiO2 usage. We hit our targets last year in the 4% to 5% range. And this year, we're on track for hitting those targets, which we defined this year as closer to 2% to 3%.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Robert Koort representing Goldman Sachs.
Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Chuck, the decremental margins in glass were pretty ugly, and sales looked like they changed by $4 million and profits by $15 million. Is there something in the near term that can reverse that? Or should we expect that same kind of pain from the fixed cost leverage? Or what exactly do you think is causing that?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, we had -- it was a disappointing quarter for actually both business units in glass for slightly different reasons. In our flat glass business, we had a poor quarter from a, let's call it, manufacturing and supply chain performance. We also saw some volume declines as we looked at some of our end-use markets like solar that were lower, and we didn't get enough of a pickup on the commercial construction side, which is our biggest market for that business. We also saw some year-over-year licensing revenue that was lower. So I would expect that the third quarter, we're going to improve our operating performance. And so I expect the flat glass business to still be challenged but not to the same level that they were in the second quarter. On the fiberglass side, we had lower volumes, especially in Europe, and we had lower equity earnings out of our PFG joint venture in Asia, which is targeted at the electronics market. So I don't expect a significant improvement on the fiberglass side. We had pretty good results here in North America. But I would say that we are looking to improve slightly over what you saw in the second quarter, but certainly, I think we're going to face some of the same challenges here in the third quarter.
Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And if I might follow up on the U.S. architectural side, your same-store sales looked pretty strong in your stores but through the big box, less exciting. I know Sherwin, this morning, had a similar comment about its non-store business. So was there something that's not quite as exciting in the DIY markets? Was this a function of just a couple of lost business lines? Or what do you attribute to the less robust non-stores business in the U.S. architectural?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, in the 2 other channels, I would say you mentioned that we did lose price points at one of our major North American home center accounts. This was on the, let's call it, the legacy PPG side, so that accounted for some of the lower comps. We also have seen some weakness in what we would call the independent dealer channel, which is an important channel for both the PPG legacy business, plus the newly acquired business. And the dealers we found were a little cautious. We had, what I would call, a second quarter -- is a -- weather and some other factors were not helping us as much as they were last year. We still think there's good growth there, but right now the dealers were quite cautious in the second quarter as well. So that's why the numbers weren't as robust for us as we would have hoped outside of the store channel.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson representing Susquehanna.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Yes, Chuck, question, a couple of questions on restructuring and cash redeployment. First on Transitions, I know earlier this year, you indicated you were in some discussions with Essilor about future ownership structure of that business. Can you update us on that or give us a timeline and maybe indicate what the attractiveness of being in that business going forward is as opposed to be more of a coatings play? And then just if you could comment on the coatings acquisition pipeline, are you at a point where if you don't do any additional deals this year, you might up your share repurchase targets of $500 million to $750 million?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, Don, we are still in discussions with Essilor relating to the future of Transitions Optical, so at this point, we do not have any additional comments on that subject. As far as the redeployment of cash, we are working the acquisition pipeline actively. We were able to complete not only the Akzo North American architectural acquisition in April, but we completed in May, the Deft acquisition, smaller, bolt-on, but quite successful. We were really pleased that this was going to be a positive for our aerospace business. And we're actively working the acquisition pipeline. We have several, we think, good potential opportunities, but obviously, we're going to keep working them and hope to bring them in. And we're pleased with our integration activities here with the Akzo business. We do think that it is -- although a challenge, we are responding very well, lots of work but lots of progress. So we're optimistic with the results of these latest acquisitions, including Spraylat, which we announced at the end of last year. So we're more confident that we can continue to make acquisitions and successfully integrate them and achieve the targets that we set. And if we, however, are not able to consummate these deals, if you look at that the range of share buybacks between $500 million and $750 million, we would be looking to move that up into the upper end of the range if we can't bring in any new targets. And obviously, as we approached year end, if we don't feel as confident about the acquisition opportunities, we would certainly look at that overall target that we've set for ourselves in share buybacks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar representing Citi.
P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: You had talked about a potential rebranding strategy in architectural paint, particularly for the Glidden brand in different channels. Any update on that? And then secondly, you talked about load share. Was there any share loss at Home Depot for the Akzo business?
Charles E. Bunch: We are not in a position right now to announce any change in the branding strategy for the Akzo North American business. It's been little over 3 months. It all hands on deck trying to get through the integration and ensure that all the customers are being supplied and serviced in a way consistent or better than they were prior to the acquisition. So we're working on that, but we're not in a position to announce anything right now. And I think your second question, P.J., was it Home Depot? There was no shelf space or share loss at Home Depot on the acquired business.
P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And secondly, on automotive OEM, you are growing 2 to 3x the market. How long can that continue? I know a competitor that exited their business, sort of lost some share towards the end. So can you just talk about the competitive dynamic in that market?
Charles E. Bunch: Our competitive dynamics, it's always been a very competitive market. It's not a market however, that you see a lot of share gains or losses in the short term. These are usually longer-term decisions that the automotive manufacturers make typically around model years or when they are starting new production. I think we've been well positioned in the past few years with several new technologies that we've introduced that have been well received by our automotive customers. We have been also well placed with many of the plants that have continued in service as the industry is restructured. And we're very well positioned in the markets where we've seen either the largest recovery or the most growth. So if you look at the North American market, we are very well positioned. We're #1 in this market, and we are also #1 in the Chinese market. So if you look at, overall, where are you seeing the best performance from the automotive industry, we're well placed in the areas where it's really growing. We have good technologies. We had a consistent strategy, so we continued to do well. But I don't see these things as either short term in nature. These are longer-term trends. And if we continue to do the things that we've been doing and the markets continue to hold up well, then I think this is a level of performance that we expect to continue.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch representing Wells Fargo Securities.
Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I'm looking at -- very pleased to hear about the progress on the Akzo deal doing a bit better than anticipated. And you had raised your cost-reduction targets the last call from $160 million to $200 million. And looking at the math, you originally targeted 10% margin on that business, but with that upgrade, it's looking more like 12% or 13%. What are the chances that we might see you bring that all the way up a couple more points? And how confident are you and that $200 million -- in that $200 million number? And might we see some changes going on there in terms of synergy?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, Frank, we feel very good about the $200 million synergy number. We're ahead of our targets for realization of that, and I think we have a path forward. At this point, we're not raising the synergy targets for the acquisition, but there's a lot of hard work ahead of us. So we know that we haven't been -- we've just begun the capture all of those opportunities, but we feel increasingly confident. And -- but at this point, we still feel that $200 million is a good target.
Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: All right, great. And in terms of getting the margins up even higher than that 13% or so?
Charles E. Bunch: In the Performance Coatings segment or...
Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: The Akzo business.
Charles E. Bunch: Oh, the Akzo business, well, I think that we're going to see how this thing plays out, and I'm sure we're going to share more information with the investors as the year goes on. This is -- we're 3 months into this, feel good, but there's a lot of heavy lifting. So at this point, we're not going to change any of the projections or targets that we have yet.
Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Fair enough. Now obviously, year to date, Mr. Navikas has a little bit been slow on this, on the share repurchase side given where you want to get to by the end of the year. And obviously, you are examining some other opportunities out there in terms of bolt-ons and so on. To that end, were you surprised to see the Mexican reject the Comex deal? And is that a business that might be interesting for you? And do you think you might have better luck going in after Comex?
Charles E. Bunch: We've been in a PPG board meeting this morning, so although I've heard those comments, I haven't seen any of the press releases, so I'm not really in a position to comment on what's transpired with that potential acquisition, and I wouldn't have any comment on our potential interest with that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi representing Baird.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Can you give us a rough estimate of the weather impact on your European architectural business? I think it was down 8% for the quarter. And do you think that some of that was delayed into the third quarter because of the weather? Or is it just sort of lost opportunity for the industry?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, I don't think the weather -- the weather hasn't been good the first half of the year. It wasn't good in the first quarter. It wasn't especially good in the second quarter either. We hope things are going to get better. Some of the weather impact in the second quarter was -- we have leading positions in many of the country markets in Eastern Europe, and they were heavily impacted by the flooding. And so I think there were some volume declines resulting in that. But I would say to blame most of this volume decline on Eastern European flooding would be a stretch or maybe a couple of percentage points, yes, but the rest of it was overall market weakness in many of the key market areas. And we're not seeing a recovery in any of the markets except the U.K. The U.K. trade market, I think, has been slightly improved, and I think the U.K. economic recovery is maybe just a step ahead of what we've seen so far in Europe. So I would say weather is sometimes a short-term factor, but we have, 2 quarters now, fairly weak activity in Europe. We think we've stabilized, and the comparables should get better. So -- but you've seen our performance. I mean, the thing that's most encouraging with our performance and our results is even despite the weak volume in the European architectural market, our teams are delivering. They're working really hard to execute on the restructuring plans and to drive our cost and productivity. So we feel pretty good about the overall earnings and the cash performance despite the weaker top line.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then on the marine build market, can you share your perspective on whether this market is closer to bottom maybe from talking to your customers? That would be helpful.
Charles E. Bunch: Well, the marine market, I think has surprised all of us with the level of weakness. When we looked at the marine new-build market in the second quarter, it was down a little over 30% in Asia, which is, as you know, the predominant region for marine newbuilds. So it has been probably a decline that even by historical standards was much sharper than anything that we'd experienced. Now as we look at our performance during this time, I think the comparables are going to start getting a little better, even though we're still going to see negative growth numbers. So I think the third quarter, we're going to still see some declines, maybe not as sharp as what I've just described here in the second quarter. And we are winning our share of new business that we hope we would see in -- by the middle of next year as they would start to rebuild from this very low level. So I would say that I'm more optimistic going forward that I think the second quarter will be our lowest point in terms of year-over-year comparables, especially for our sales. We'll start to see some improvement in this rate of decline over the next couple of quarters, not nearly as dramatic as what we've seen here especially by the time we get to the fourth quarter. And we may begin, then, to see some improvement as we move through 2014.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John McNulty representing Credit Suisse.
John P. McNulty - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: With regard to cash flow, your cash flows were up pretty significantly year-over-year despite maybe not having the cash machine, which was your commodity platform. So can you walk us through some of the changes? You highlighted working capital in the prepared remarks. Can you kind of walk us through kind of what's happened there and then also, if you think that's sustainable going forward?
David B. Navikas: John, this is Dave Navikas. If we look at the working capital results, particularly in our coatings businesses, we certainly saw the result of some concerted effort really over the last several quarters that board approved here for us in Q2, good inventory performance from a reduction perspective in all of the businesses. The improvement that we saw in working capital, both inventory and receivables, was spread through all of the businesses. So I think it's a positive that this was an across-the-board kind of improvement, good performance from a receivable collection perspective so percent current in good shape. So we're pleased to see the results here in the second quarter, and certainly, our expectations will be to keep the focus on this area and hopefully be able to retain the improvements that we see here.
John P. McNulty - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And then just with regard to M&A and the opportunities that you see out there, you're in the middle of putting Akzo into your current portfolio. How much more bandwidth do you have in terms of the size and scale of potential acquisitions out there? And then maybe just one quick follow-up, if you comment as to whether or not you have architectural exposure down in Mexico?
Charles E. Bunch: Bandwidth in terms of size of capabilities, financial -- let's just look at the capabilities of the organization. Obviously, this is a big deal for us with Akzo North America here for our North American architectural business. I think we're stepping up. I'm quite pleased. We've made a couple of acquisitions, including SigmaKalon 5 years ago that were even bigger in terms of size or scale. So I think we've proven that we can take on some of the largest businesses out there. So there are few -- there were fewer large top 10 kind of companies that would still be considered for sale in play. So I would say that the opportunities are still out there for the small and mid-sized companies. We certainly have the financial resources to -- and the borrowing capacity to step up from there. So I feel quite confident that we'll be able to, both in terms of the integration and the financial capacity, we certainly have capabilities to do whatever we would like to do in the coatings space. And then Mexico I think, John, the other part of your question, we have a very good business in Mexico in our automotive and industrial businesses, smaller positions on the other coatings side but a very what I would call, a small position in architectural coatings in Mexico.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander representing Jefferies.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Two quick questions. First, do you expect your automotive sales to grow sequentially in Q3? And in Europe, how far out do you feel you'd be to look to feel comfortable that you should get back to flat to slightly positive year-over-year comparisons?
Charles E. Bunch: Sequential sales for automotive OEMs are -- in the third quarter, are usually down. So if you look -- they have in Western Europe or in Europe, they have August shutdowns, which I think we'll see again this year given the weakness of the market. Here, there is a usually a July shutdown. And I think we're seeing more traditional seasonal or third quarter pattern here in North America for the auto build. Last year, we didn't have as much of an effect because they were still recovering from the effects of the Japanese tsunami and the strength of the market that began to really recover in -- early in last year. So I think we're going to have more seasonal patterns in the third quarter both here and in Europe, and that would indicate that it would be typically lower than the second quarter sales. And the second part of that was?
David B. Navikas: What's your second question, Laurence, I'm sorry?
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Sorry, just on Europe, how far out do you need to look to see positive comparisons? I mean, do you have any confidence on that?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, I would -- yes, if you look at -- we've been probably a little surprised by the weakness of the European economy and some of the key markets. So we've been very encouraged by our performance, of course, and we've been delivering on the bottom line and in cash flow. If you look in the year-over-year comparisons, I'd say to turn positive, certainly not for the balance of this year. I think we're still going to see 2 quarters coming up here in the second half that'll continue to be negative from a European auto build standpoint. I'm not talking about our performance because we still feel good about that, but if you look at the overall market, certainly, in the next 2 quarters, I think it's going to be down. Now when you look this year, the first quarter was abnormally weak. So could you start to see more stability when we go into 2014? I certainly hope so. And that's my feeling. Although when we'll see positive upturn from that, the market is still fairly pessimistic when you talk to a lot of the participants. But what happened here in North America, as this -- the crisis rolled through the automotive industry, there was no optimism at all. In fact, many of the so-called experts were saying we'd never get to 9 million or 10 million builds again, and the whole market had forever moved away. But now you see us moving past 15 million builds, sales getting into the 16 million range here in North America. So my hope is that even if we don't have a sharper recovery in Europe, at some point, we will stabilize and see some growth. And that could start happening next year, but in the near term, I'm not looking for that recovery.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts representing UBS.
John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: The latest deep dive that you did with investors was on packaging coatings, and it had an okay quarter. It was low single digit kind of everywhere. But it sounded like from that deep dive, that's a business that should be accelerating over the next year, maybe not longer than 2 years and that it has the potential to get to be a high single, low double-digit grower for a period at least through the BPA conversion?
Charles E. Bunch: Right. And we're still pleased with our packaging business unit. The best opportunities in terms of overall demand and consumption is in Asia. So the business is still quite strong in Asia. And I think that's where you're going to see those types of demand or growth numbers. Obviously, the other opportunity that they talked about was these development, as you mentioned, of the BPA non-intent, and we're actively working on our formulations, qualifications. We're seeing the market gradually turn. And we're seeing a number of food companies, not only in the baby food, but recently Coca-Cola in France, as an example, is introducing the BPA non-intent coatings in those markets. And that should give us an opportunity for further growth. So based on increasing consumption in the developing world led by Asia, but also Eastern Europe and Central Europe, and the technology advances associated with BPA non-intent, as an example, give us optimism that we will continue to see good growth in the packaging coatings business.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Ivan Marcuse representing KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Real quick on the European architectural business. The improvement in EBITDA, how much of that was -- was that all cost savings or did you have some benefit from price cost raw materials?
Vincent J. Morales: Ivan, almost every single penny and more was cost savings. Volumes were down, as we articulated, and we overcame that with what I would call, discretionary cost management, as well as the 2002 restructuring program savings that we're still implementing.
Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Is the restructuring in Europe -- is this is almost done, and are all the cost savings through there, or will that continue for another couple of quarters?
Vincent J. Morales: If you look at our 2002 program, Ivan -- I'm so sorry, 2012 program, the 2012 program targeted $140 million of savings. We were about $30 million away from that, so we'll see some savings in the back half of the year, still. But they're starting to diminish as we anniversary some of the actions because we still have some savings in the back half of the year related to that original program that we initiated last year.
Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then, last question. You mentioned that the dealer network in the U.S. was -- or the independent dealer for architectural was fairly cautious. The weather, I guess, has improved at least the past couple of weeks. So would you expect, then, to have -- that segment to be a lot stronger in the third quarter? Or is there a reason that they would remain cautious, especially with housing being as strong as it is?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, we feel that the independent dealer channel will improve here in the third quarter from what we've been seeing. We've been, I guess, a little surprised that it hasn't been stronger. Some markets though, kind of, the independent dealers, don't participate in as much. So if you look at the store growth, the comp store growth that we talked about, you have some different markets that company-owned stores service, including a new homebuilders and the like. And the independent dealers, typically, don't go after some of those markets where we've probably seen the strongest growth as new home construction, up over 20%, as an example. So I think the dealers are being somewhat cautious here. And I think that the third quarter, assuming that they've been cautious on their buying patterns, we'd see a little -- a better performance in the third quarter because, overall, we still see the market as good. Yes, you can say some segments are a little better than others. Commercial is not -- it's improving, but at lower growth rates. So we still think that this is going to be a good year for us in architectural. And I think the dealers will participate in that improvement, and I just don't think we've seen it is as much. And of course, this is true two-step distribution in the case of the dealers. So many times, they buy during window periods and then, either hold less or more inventories where, in the store network, you're almost direct-to-customer. So I would -- although we don't track it directly, I think the dealers are sitting on fairly conservative inventories. So if we have continued improvement, we should see for next quarter some improved comps.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nils Wallin, representing CLSA.
Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division: A couple here on the marine industry, just curious, one, if your business in the marine segment is still generating positive cash flow? And then, also, given how much weakness we've seen over the last couple of quarters, what you're seeing in terms of competitors whether you expect any type of shakeout from -- because of the weak market?
Charles E. Bunch: So the first question is the marine results for protective -- well, we have a broader business unit, it's Protective and Marine Coatings. So we -- in that business unit, we're also supplying power plants, industrial complexes, infrastructure and the like. But if you just look at the marine business, it's still profitable, both on an EBIT or EBITDA and has positive cash flow. So at this point, I would not say that -- we are certainly not looking to get out of the marine coatings business. This is a sharper cycle, but we plan to ride it through. And I'm not aware, at this point, of any of the global marine players that is planning on exiting the market. The market is much more consolidated today than it has been in the past. There are 4 or 5 major global players. And at this point, I think that we are just planning to ride it out. But we have profitable sales and cash flow right now. But it is, certainly, off of the levels that we were seeing in 2011 or in the early 2000 -- first half of 2012.
Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division: Understood. Do you think that in this process of returning to more normal that it normalizes at a lower level? Or can it get back to the previous peak?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, I would say that, yes, there was probably, like in some global industries, there was probably a little bit of a marine new build bubble. And so I think if you look at what was happening, if we go back to 2000 -- let's say, from second half of 2010 to the first half -- through the first half of 2012, that 2-year period was probably, in retrospect or hindsight, maybe a little bit of a bubble. There was a view that all these ships were going to service this growing global trade and that the market was going to be able to absorb all these new fuel-efficient ships. And I think that some of that will play out in the longer-term, but I think as we saw here in the U.S. housing market bubble and the subsequent bust, sometimes when -- you're going to have to endure this period, and the strongest players survive. And we feel that there's nothing in the market, longer-term, that's discouraged us. These are the types of, let's say, more challenging, technologically, for our customers and our chemistry problems and issues to solve for our customers. So this is a market that we belong in. I mean, we paint cars, boats, planes. And the tougher, the better for us. So we feel that this is a market we're going to bring a lot of value to over the years and okay, we're going to have to ride out this lower end of the cycle. But long-term, we feel good about the business.
Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division: So just, if I may, just follow-on. I mean, do you think you can do in marine or replicate in marine what you've done so far and create results in auto OEM in terms of bringing that technology to that market on the downturn?
Charles E. Bunch: Yes, well, we are continuing, because the problems are the same. In fact, if you look at -- one of the biggest issues in the marine coatings industry or the marine industry is fuel efficiency. This is a cost and an environmental issue for the large ship builders or any of the owners, and both the ship owners and the shipping company. So they're looking for solutions all the time. Better products, better technology, and this is an area that we thrive in, in our businesses. So we think that we can bring a lot of solutions over time. When you have a downturn of -- this steep, you're going to have to, I think, take corrective action. The reason we've been able to stay as profitable and positive from a cash flow standpoint is -- and as we've talked about in our European businesses, we've been taking cost out, getting more productive, focusing on the right customers and the right business. The Korean business has held up better than the Chinese markets because these are more specific, higher purpose. These are also drilling ships that are going after oil and other natural resources. So the market hasn't been quite as tough as your more commodity-oriented just oceangoing container vessels. So I think these are areas where longer-term technology will prevail. We've got a lot of things that are going to help, not only improve the painting life, but get at this key driver around the fuel efficiency for these oceangoing vessels. So yes, we feel good about what we're bringing into market, and we're going to ride it out and things will be better. And I hope that in subsequent calls, we're going to be talking about, yes, this thing has started to turn. But this quarter wasn't our best, certainly, in terms of market performance.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Nocella, representing RBC Capital Markets.
Christopher J. Nocella - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Chuck, just as the raw material environment stabilize here, how are you seeing the pricing dynamics playing out across your coatings businesses?
Charles E. Bunch: In terms of -- we are looking for stability in terms of raw material pricing environment, as well as our pricing initiatives. So right now we see this as a stable period on both sides of the value chain.
Christopher J. Nocella - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then, within auto refinish, you mentioned solid growth outside of Europe. This has been somewhat of a slower growth business recently, so do you think we're seeing an inflection point here?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, the toughest market in auto refinish has been Europe. We've seen good growth in Asia-Pacific and in particular, China, that's the fastest growing auto park in the world. We're well positioned there. We're the leading player in automotive refinish in China. So we see good growth there. And then, the rest of the world, outside of Europe, we feel that we have a very strong position with the new water-based technologies for automotive refinish. That's positioned us well. And so where there is growth in the market, we're -- we feel we're doing well. In Europe, despite this leading water-based technology, things are weaker there. As I also mentioned in one of our other markets, automotive refinish, typically, is a two-step distribution process. And we saw this during the last, let's call it, economic crisis 3 or 4 years ago in Europe, even though automotive refinish is a very stable market, sometimes, our customers, these two-step distributors, will take inventories down in the near term and try to run tighter and get through these periods. So sometimes, we can have a little stronger -- a little more of a cyclical effect there than you would see in the overall market. So Europe, yes, has been weaker. We think it will come back as the overall market, it is still going to be there. And outside of Europe, we feel pretty good about what's going on.
Christopher J. Nocella - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: All right. And are you gaining share on refinish, like OEM, or is it a little bit more competitive?
Charles E. Bunch: It's harder to track. I would say, we feel good about the position that we're in. Certainly, I wouldn't say that there has been any major share shifts, but usually, it takes a while for any data to get out there. It's not tracked as well or as easily as the OEM side.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Hocevar, representing Northcoast Research.
Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research: Most of my questions have been answered at this point, but I was wondering if you could comment on the silica demand. It seems like that improved a bit during the quarter, and I've noticed that there's been a nice uptick in tire shipment data that's come back out the last couple of months. So I'm just wondering if you're seeing a commensurate increase in the tire production side of things and if that's what's driving demand for silica?
Charles E. Bunch: For precipitated silica, the tire market is the biggest end-use market, and we think we're well-positioned in the broader precipitated silica industry to serve the needs of the, let's say, let's call it the green tire movement that we see in the tire companies, where they're trying to improve mileage. Precipitated silica gives improved rolling resistance, so we can actually improve the mileage of the cars. And with CAFE standards in this country or what's happening around the world, we're seeing an uptick in demand for our products. And I think over and above the growth that we've seen in tires. So we feel good about that market and well-positioned, and yes, we had a good quarter in the second quarter.
Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research: Okay. And then, a final question just on the synergy targets for Akzo, just to follow-up on that. I believe, in the past, you stated that $30 million to $40 million in incremental savings, over and above the $60 million of savings realized upon closing, are expected to be realized in the first 12 months. Now you say $102 million by the end of 2014. Does that $30 million to $40 million increase at all over the first 12 months of owning Akzo?
Vincent J. Morales: No, Kevin. If you look of the restructuring charge that we just announced, the $102 million, that's the charge, that's not the savings, first of all. The majority of that, as Dave mentioned, is earmarked to the Akzo business we acquired and our legacy business and are embedded in that synergy number. There is a piece of that, that's not -- that would be what I would call new restructuring savings. The $30 million to $40 million hasn't moved. From April of this year until April of next year, we're still targeting $30 million to $40 million of cost synergies. And again, that's on top of the day one synergies.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas, representing JPMorgan.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Can you tell us what organic pro forma change in revenues was for the acquired AkzoNobel business?
Vincent J. Morales: Jeff, it was right around flat.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: It's right around flat?
Vincent J. Morales: Correct.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: All right. In general, do you see the do-it-yourself market in the United States really slowing down and the do-it-for-me market really accelerating in the current environment?
Charles E. Bunch: I would say we haven't -- this trend, we haven't seen any changes. It's -- and I would say, if you look at the market, although we did well in our stores channel relative to our national account position, I wouldn't say that there's any -- you wouldn't see, I think, in this shorter term any change. And the one comment I would make on just your question around Akzo North America business, the Canadian market was a little weaker in -- this second quarter, our first quarter of ownership for the business. They are, I think, they've been challenged by the same weather conditions. It's been pretty cold up there, short season. And their housing cycle is maybe a little different than ours. They're not -- they don't have the same kind of growth from this very low level. They maintained pretty stable position in terms of overall housing starts and overall construction market during the crisis. So right now, I would say, the market up there is more stable. And they had a rougher second quarter, I think, in terms of the weather than even we had down here.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then lastly, was there much sequential change in coatings raw materials in the quarter?
Vincent J. Morales: No, Jeff. If you look, the raw material pricing has been fairly consistent. As we came into Q2, we felt it would be it and remained that way. And then, it will remain that way heading into Q3, as Chuck mentioned earlier.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Are there any more charges to come with Akzo after the one you're taking?
David B. Navikas: No, Jeff. There are not.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Young, representing Chemspeak.
William Young: My question relates to, any changes in your long-term procurement strategy for raw materials? And along those lines, where do you stand on your licensing agreement with Billions?
Charles E. Bunch: Long-term procurement strategy for us, we've been trying -- we've had centralized global purchasing of raw materials for many years. And we continue to operate that with the same type of organization and strategy. As we've seen all of this growth for our coatings businesses in Asia and in Europe over the last few years, we think it's going to be a continuation of the same. And the opportunity and the agreement with Billions will give us, we think, as they continue their commitment to continue to grow their position in the global TiO2 industry, we think we have a good opportunity with them and with a number of our other suppliers to continue to grow with them, participate. We've talked -- we had an announcement recently about our Argex commercial development agreement. This is a startup company in Canada, as an example. So we continue to expand as we globalize and expanded our coatings business, expand our relationships with both the traditional and conventional sources of supply, but also new and emerging sources of supply or suppliers in Asia or other startup businesses around the world. So we're pretty confident that our strategy remains the same but we're going to take advantage of some of the new opportunities that we see developing, especially in the emerging regions.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer, representing Barclays.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Two quick questions. One, on the optical business in Asia and China in particular. I've seen a few things written that looked like they're a little bit cryptic but would give you the sense that maybe you don't have the perfect positioning as far as price points go there with the Transitions business because there's a lower quality, lower price that seems to be taking some share. Can you comment how you think you're set up for the Asia and the China market with Transitions?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, in Asia, in general, the Transitions product lines are traditionally premium products that service high-valued customers that look for the features and benefits that you get from Transitions lens. And we do very well in Asian markets, like Australia, New Zealand, like the key city states, the Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Singapore. But a big part of the market in these emerging regions is the, let's call it, the mid-tier of that pure consumer pyramid from kind of low to low-tier to high-value add. And so we are trying to differentiate our offerings in Transitions so that we would not just try to service the very high end of that pyramid. And I think that we've seen progress that we've made with some of our product introductions in the region, where we're trying to capture more of that growth in the mid-tier price points.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then, just lastly, on Axalta, have you seen any difference in their behavior as they would face customers in the change of ownership?
Charles E. Bunch: We haven't really seen that. It's been just a few months in the marketplace. And so both from an OEM standpoint or refinish, I wouldn't comment on anything that we've seen from them over the last few months. I think it's too early to make any commentary on what we're seeing.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn, representing Longbow Research.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: Couple of questions, if I may. When you were talking about mid-single digit profitability for the Akzo business, was that on the EBITDA line or the EBIT line?
Vincent J. Morales: It was EBIT.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. So all right, I got it. So that includes the $15 million incremental that you got from not picking up the liabilities?
Vincent J. Morales: Includes the $60 million day one synergies or about $15 million a quarter, plus some additional synergies, yes.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: Got it. Second question, your gross margin, if you look at sort of over year-over-year on the company overall, obviously, because you don't break it down by segments. It was up about 1 point and your operating margin was down by about 1 point. So the incremental SG&A expense, as it relates to offsetting the gross margin, sort of what were the key drivers in terms of either business units or divisions that accounted for that?
Vincent J. Morales: Dmitry, the main driver, by far, was the Akzo business, which is a distribution-oriented business, including the stores and other selling costs associated with the distribution business. And if you look at our traditional distribution businesses of that nature, they carry a heavier SG&A component.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: So it sounds like Akzo was a contributor to the gross margin, but a detractor from the operating margin?
Vincent J. Morales: Yes, it has a much lower, obviously, has a much lower, at this point, EBIT return on sales. So it's definitely a detractor to the corporation at this point.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: But I think it's interesting, if I may observe this, that the gross margin profitability does not seem to be all that onerous compared to your other coating businesses or other people's coatings businesses. Is it fair to say that the margin issues that Akzo has been facing forever is related to SG&A, and that's something that you guys can get your hands around fairly quickly?
Vincent J. Morales: No, again, I think if you look at, traditionally, an architectural business, it has a heavy distribution component. It typically has a lot more SG&A, which is, again, all the cost of the stores.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: But a high...
Vincent J. Morales: But a high gross margin. It has store cost, promotional costs, all the stuff that goes into selling to frontline consumers.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: Got it. And then, final question on the automotive aftermarket, we've had several quarters going back to the end of 2012 when this segment and this industry was identified as a problem when it came to growth and something that impacted your Performance Coatings business. This quarter, you obviously talked about this being a contributor to the growth that you've seen in the quarter. The carpark didn't get younger, and certainly, not in North America over the last year to sort of justify increased repairs. Is it the weather being slicker out there and more collisions I mean, sort of, what -- did something change in the industry or some sense on these trends in -- and we just have to be conscious of?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, let's be clear. The automotive refinish business has never been a problem for PPG. And I would say that the growth that we're seeing this year, probably on the flip side of -- some of this weather discussion on architectural -- actually, bad weather, especially in the wintertime or the spring actually helps this business. So you may have some increment of business that comes from all the snow and inclement weather we had in North America. And oftentimes, what you see as the economy isn't improving as it is now, is that people -- during the recession, many people were getting the cash-outs from the insurance companies but not having their cars repaired. And so they were just putting that in their pocket and then, waiting until they felt more confident in the economy or their jobs. And I think that's what you're seeing here is that, yes, the economy, overall, is doing better. People are more confident. And regardless of what we've seen even with all these new car builds, hasn't really affected, overall, the average age of the carpark. I think what you're seeing is some positive weather, more usage with the water-based technology and the opportunities that, that's giving us. And I think there's more of a propensity to repair cars that have been in collisions because the economy, overall, is better.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Charles Dan, representing Morgan Stanley.
Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I just wanted to clarify all the sort of comments you've talked about, the trends for your U.S. architectural business. And it was down a bit year-over-year on a revenue basis, excluding Akzo, it sounded like this quarter. Your expectation is for lower, sequentially, next quarter. Would you -- does that also translate into down on a year-over-year basis next quarter? Or are you -- because I don't recall that it was a particularly tough comp this quarter, so could you just clarify that?
Vincent J. Morales: Charlie, if you look at our volume performance in Q2, we were down very modestly year-over-year. And up in stores and down in national accounts and dealers, as Chuck mentioned. The dealer, we hope, has some recovery next quarter. Stores has been a very consistent performer for us and we expect that to continue. And the dislocation in the national accounts has come from the product, the 2 price points we discussed earlier that we lost in the national accounts, and that's not going to change in Q3.
Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. So putting all that together, you're still expecting revenue growth on an organic basis in the third quarter?
Vincent J. Morales: I think we're -- it's a fine line of whether we're positive or negative, but we're not -- it's just if we could predict the future, we would tell you that but it's not -- we were not very negative in Q2 and we would hope to be positive in Q3 EBIT [ph] .
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard O'Reilly, representing Revere Associates.
Richard O'Reilly: Two quick questions. One is, I want to follow-up with the marine. Typically or historically, what part of your marine coatings is new build versus maintenance, refinish?
Charles E. Bunch: 25% of the marine and coatings -- the Marine and Protective Coatings business is new builds. And if you just isolate it on marine itself, it's about half and half between OEM, new builds and aftermarket.
Richard O'Reilly: Okay, fine. Is there a mothballing of existing ships? And if so, would they come out first before the new builds pick up and therefore, some ships would have to be recoated quickly or early on?
Charles E. Bunch: That's an interesting question because there is -- there are ships that are just parked. If you go to Singapore, you have dozens of ships in the harbor that are -- don't have anything to ship right now. So they're just sitting there. But you've seen it in the commercial airline industry. If you look at the success we've seen from Boeing and Airbus, there's a lot of mothballed planes, but they keep building new ones because they're more fuel-efficient, they have higher technology. So you're still going to see some of this. So I think some of these ships that are parked around the world, waiting for cargo to go somewhere, they may never come back in service. But there will be some demand for ships that are either more fuel-efficient, easier from a maintenance standpoint or they're serving specific needs.
Richard O'Reilly: Second question on the prepared comments for the Industrial Coatings product line. There was a statement that said overall results by general industrial end-use markets remain mixed, and I assume it means -- you don't mean geographic, you mean custom or application end markets. Can you elaborate a little more on what's negative or what's positive?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, within the, let's call it, the general industrial or what -- we have an industrial strategic business unit and an Industrial Coatings segment.
Richard O'Reilly: I mean, the product line. Yes.
Charles E. Bunch: And within that Industrial Coatings business unit, we have different end-use markets. So if you look -- probably the strongest component is automotive parts for PPG. That business is in Industrial Coatings. That's not serving -- supplying coatings to General Motors or Mercedes and the like. That's for all the parts, either under the hood, in the chassis or some of the parts that get assembled later. That's the strongest end-use market right now in that general industrial business. The coil and extrusion coatings, that hasn't been very strong because that's been tied again as steel industry and some of the commercial construction, not as strong. Electronics, if you look within electronics, personal computers that take a lot of coatings. That's been down. Coatings on smartphones up, but surface area, that hasn't been as good. Appliance Coatings, good here in North America because we have a nice construction and housing recovery. Poor in Europe because overall construction markets are weak. So it's really a broad market business unit, lots of different end-use plays. So that gives you an idea of kind of some of the puts and takes within the business by end-use market and by region.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Stafford, representing Morningstar.
Jeffrey Stafford - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: With lower TiO2 prices, this is maybe less of a concern, but could you update us on your progress and targets to reduce TiO2 consumption in Coatings?
Charles E. Bunch: I think we commented on that earlier, but last year, we said our target was 4% to 6% productivity or within our formulations of usage, not taking TiO2 out of the formulas, but using it more effectively. We said that we were in the range of 4% to 5% last year in terms of improving that productivity use of TiO2. This year, lesser target. We've gotten some of those savings last year, and we've said it's going to be probably closer to 3% in the range of improved usage given the same type of end-use applications in the formula. And a lot of this is also using other high-value added chemical molecules in our formulations and actually improving the overall performance of the coating, even if we use less TiO2 and substitute it with some of the newer developed molecules we've seen from some of our suppliers. And they're really doing good work here and we're incorporating a lot of these new technologies in our formulations. So we really feel good about the performance of our suppliers in helping us achieve these targets.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Morales for closing remarks.
Vincent J. Morales: Again, I'd like to thank everybody for their time and interest this quarter. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me directly and our Investor Relations. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Quarter 1 2013 PPG Industries Earnings Conference Call. My name is Angela, and I'm your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I'd now like to hand the call over to Mr. Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Vincent J. Morales: Thank you, Angela, and good afternoon, everybody. Again, this is Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations for PPG Industries. Welcome to PPG's First Quarter 2013 Financial Teleconference. Joining me from PPG on the call today is Chuck Bunch, PPG's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Michael McGarry, Executive Vice President; Dave Navikas, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer; and I'd like to introduce Frank Sklarsky, Executive Vice President, Finance, who just joined PPG this week, and welcome, Frank. Our comments relate to the financial information released on Thursday, April 18, 2013. I will remind everybody that approximately 1 hour ago, we posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on our Investor Center at our website at ppg.com. These slides are also available on the webcast site for this call and provide additional support to our opening comments that Chuck will make momentarily. Following Chuck's perspective on the company's results for the quarter, we will move to a Q&A session. Both our prepared commentary and discussion during the Q&A may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company's current view about future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which again are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC. Now let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch.
Charles E. Bunch: Thank you, Vince, and welcome, everyone. We delivered another strong earnings performance in the first quarter with adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.58, up 12% versus the prior year. We achieved these results despite notable differences in demand levels by region, with strong North American demand continuing, growth resuming in most Asian end-use markets and broadly weaker activity in Europe. We were able to deliver higher earnings due principally to our proactive cost management actions, coupled with continued strength of several end-use markets, including automotive OEM, aerospace and U.S. construction. A few key business highlights from the quarter were the aggregate coatings segment earnings growth we achieved of 13%. In addition, our coatings earnings grew in each region, including Europe, despite the persistent economic weakness in that region. This performance was delivered despite volumes that were down about 3% versus the prior year although the prior-year period included 2 additional sales days which impacted comparisons in several of our businesses. From a strategic standpoint, we have also been very active. We completed the Commodity Chemicals business separation transaction in late January. As a result of that transaction, we received about $900 million of cash, reduced our share count by 10.8 million shares or about 7%, and recorded a nonrecurring gain relating to the business separation of about $2.2 billion in the quarter. Additionally, on April 1, we completed the acquisition of AkzoNobel's North American Architectural Coatings business. Since the acquisition was announced in December 2012, we have been very focused on a seamless integration for our customers and to ensure we are creating shareholder value. As a result of our progress to date, we have identified further synergy opportunities and have increased our 3-year synergy target for the acquisition to $200 million, up 25% versus our initial target. This target includes $60 million of cost reductions that we realized when the transaction closed. Results for the acquired business will be incorporated into our second quarter financials and we look forward to updating you on the integration process in upcoming quarters. Looking ahead, we plan to continue to build on our strong first quarter performance. We remain optimistic about growth prospects in several of our businesses. This includes many of our businesses serving North America where demand remains solid and consistent, such as the U.S. construction market where we have more than doubled the size of our U.S. Architectural Coatings business with the addition of the acquired AkzoNobel business. Additionally, automotive OEM and aerospace remain global growth platforms in the coming quarters. Also, many of our businesses in Asia and specifically, China, are expected to continue to grow as our products are focused primarily on serving local consumption and general industrial activities and have only minor exposure to weaker end-use markets such as construction. Demand in Europe is likely to remain challenging and we expect that the implementation of our restructuring program and our focus on aggressive cost management will continue to offset the impacts of these weak market conditions. Our balance sheet remains very strong with about $2.4 billion of cash and short-term investments at quarter end. One thing to note is that we paid just over $900 million on April 1 for the acquired AkzoNobel business, which will be reflected in our second quarter financial statements. During the first quarter, we repaid $600 million of term debt that matured near the end of the quarter and was carrying a high interest rate based on current rates. And we spent about $140 million on share repurchases, primarily in the months of February and March after the Commodity Chemicals separation was completed. We continue to analyze prudent cash deployment opportunities, focused on growing our earnings and rewarding our shareholders, including today, as our Board of Directors approved a $0.02 dividend increase, raising the quarterly dividend to $0.61. Overall, I was pleased with our first quarter financial performance in the face of somewhat difficult and mixed economic conditions and in comparison to a tough period last year. However, given these diverse market conditions will remain -- will likely remain, we will continue to demand operating and cost excellence from our businesses and apply the same focus on our customers as we had demonstrated in the past. Thank you for your attention. This concludes our prepared remarks. Now operator, would you please give instructions and open the phone lines for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Please stand by for your first question which comes from the line of David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Chuck, can you update us on your discussions with Essilor on the Transitions joint venture?
Charles E. Bunch: No, we have no update today on the discussions, other than the disclosure that we made early in the first quarter.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Very good. And just as a follow-up, in terms of the Akzo business, talk about some of the -- some profitability metric you might look at for 2013, given these initial cost savings in there?
Michael H. McGarry: David, this is Michael McGarry. In regard to that, the most challenging aspect of the Akzo business is the stores network so that will be where we focus. Obviously, we have some synergy levels in a lot of the places overhead, as well as other locations as far as how we operate the business versus there, we have a lot more rigor that I think -- in our business so it will be where we're focused.
Operator: Next question comes from John McNulty from Credit Suisse.
John P. McNulty - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: With regard to the synergy target, you've obviously -- you've had some chance, a little bit of time, to actually look at them and obviously, it's a pretty big increase to the $200 million. So I guess if you -- I was wondering if you could give us some clarity as to which of the kind of major buckets you're seeing the biggest changes in. And then as the follow-up, if you can give us any color as to maybe any working capital opportunities you may see in the assets as well now that you've got a chance to dig into them?
Michael H. McGarry: John, this is Michael again. The West Coast is an opportunity for us. As you know, we had a nice store network on the West Coast so we'll be shifting volume from their plants into our Reno network, so that will be one. We have a deeper understanding of the logistics across both networks, that will be one. I talked already about the stores opportunity in -- and SG&A, so those will be the other ones.
John P. McNulty - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And on the working capital side?
Michael H. McGarry: Working capital, I would say they're fairly decent. And so that's clearly an area of focus for the entire company and not just for architectural.
Operator: Next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Securities.
Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I admit, Chuck, I'm a little bit lost if I can't ask a question about caustic or chlorine?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, you know where the -- I'm sure you'll be asking those questions at [indiscernible] and some of the other market participants but...
Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I will get my fix elsewhere. You started on that share buyback in February. You guys are targeting like $500 million to $750 million in 2013. I'm wondering if you could update on uses of cash, whether it -- whether you think you'll proceed at that pace that you had in the first quarter on the share buyback side or what you're looking at in terms of M&A opportunities?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, I would say that, that target range for the full year is still appropriate. Obviously, it's going to depend somewhat on acquisition opportunities and other potential uses of cash. And right now, as you saw, with our recent announcement concerning Deft, we are still active in the marketplace. We did announce, as you know, at the end of the fourth quarter, the Spraylat. So we're continuing to actively look at acquisition opportunities and we will have some further news as we go through the year.
Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay, great. And the -- your performance in auto OEM, particularly in Europe, with the industry down and yet -- down double-digits, and yet you reported a volume increase there, how did you do it? What can we expect there because that was somewhat surprising?
Charles E. Bunch: It was an excellent performance overall for the business unit and especially in Europe. And as you know, in automotive OEM, these are longer-term commitments but we have several new products, what we call our compact process for the full coatings materials on an automobile, as well as our new electrocoat product that have been helping us to gain new business. We also had what I would call a good customer mix. So we were with the right customers and the right plants that really helped us, in Europe, offset some of the declines. But we're very well-positioned here and in China, as an example. So I think it was an across-the-board excellent performance from the business unit, in addition to very good cost management. And we benefited, obviously, there from some of the restructuring activities that we started last year and actually during the previous recession in '08 and '09.
Operator: Next question comes from Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Chuck, I was wondering if you might give us some more granularity on the comments you made in the prepared comments about channel differentials in U.S. architectural. It seems like you had different growth rates across the different channels. Could you give us maybe some explanation of what was going on there?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, we had what we felt were good growth rates in the stores channel, this is the PPG stores channel here in the U.S., as well as the home center channel. Where we saw more weakness was in what we would call the independent dealer channel. And there, because you're going through a 2-step distribution process on occasion, especially when you straddle a quarter like this and the seasonality as it's changing and some of the weather patterns, I think we saw some of our dealers just move purchases or inventory over the last month or 2. But that was definitely the channel that we saw some weakness to, but I don't know that it's a longer-term trend. We'll have to wait as we go through the second quarter to make sure that we're seeing a consistent pattern. And I think that the dealers are well-positioned, should be able to take advantage of this improving market. So at this point, I wouldn't take too many conclusions from the weakness of that 1 channel, especially because of the 2-step nature of distribution.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And I think you just provided some commentary about the admirable results in your auto OEM and being on the right platforms and/or, in some cases, geographies. Should we expect -- you gave commentary that you'll continue to outpace the industry, but should we expect a more modest out-performance versus the industry going forward?
Charles E. Bunch: I think the second quarter, some of those trends should still be in place. Obviously, the European market was very weak, and we're seeing the lowest auto builds there in a generation. But I would say that, if you look ahead to the next quarter or 2, the U.S. and North American markets, very healthy. And I think the production levels should be sustained versus prior year, if not slightly higher. And the China automotive market, very strong. We're looking for 10% growth now in the Chinese automotive and we're well-positioned, again, with many of the best customers, best plants, new technology. So we're looking to continue the momentum that you saw in the first quarter.
Operator: The next question comes from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Chuck, a question on gross margin, you had a strong gross margin. I'm just wondering how much of that was better than expected raw particularly with propylene coming down, which I know you have a big exposure to, versus how much of that was productivity? And then maybe if you could comment on your sort of raw material outlook for the year for coatings and whether that's changed?
Charles E. Bunch: I would say the margin improvement was largely the result of the cost and restructuring activities. Raw materials were just down slightly. Overall our inflation index, if you take all the transportation and distribution costs, was slightly up. And so I would say most of the improvement was, again, kind of mix and productivity and restructuring. Raw materials, for us, again, down slightly in the first quarter, primarily in Europe. Europe has been, as you know from our results here, was by far our weakest region. Volumes were down in almost every business. And we saw some raw material price weakness in Europe that did help. Our overall outlook for this year is flat to slightly negative raw material pricing. What we are seeing, however, over the last few weeks, some more weakness in commodity prices, with the exception of natural gas. But in -- as you know, propylene for us is -- we're not usually buying it except in resin formulations. And so we don't usually see the immediate benefit of declines in propylene prices. So we may see that later in the year if these trends continue but certainly, we're not looking for it here in the near term.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: And just as a follow-up, given your view that raw materials might come down, obviously, some of your large customers in coatings track that as well. Do you see any pressure to reduce Coatings prices from the big boxes?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, as I said, most of the raw material weakness was in Europe. The raw material here, the raw material basket here in North America and actually in Asia as well, is just slightly down. It was close to 0 but low single-digit numbers so at this point, our pricing is stable.
Operator: Next question comes from John Roberts from UBS.
John Roberts: I was a little surprised that the packaging business also, I think, was strong in Europe. And then as a follow-up, were you a little surprised that the Industrial Coatings business in North America wasn't strong, given there's fair amount of auto and other related things over in your Industrial Coatings area in North America?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, you asked about a couple of businesses. I would say in packaging, the strongest regional market for us has been in Asia Pacific. I would say that volumes in North America and Europe for packaging are stable but the growth that we did experience was in Asia. And in Industrial Coatings, it is, what I would call, a mix story by both region and end-use markets, automotive parts being one of the strongest. We've seen some weakness in consumer electronics, although it was moderated, I guess, on our Industrial Coatings side. Heavy duty equipment was, I would say, flat and some of the construction-related -- the industrial markets that serve the commercial construction still -- it's still early days in any recovery and Europe overall was somewhat weak. So I think it's really a mix story. But we've done well overall in industrial, again, good restructuring, good support in Europe through productivity. Some help in Europe on the raw materials, but it's been a mixed bag.
John Roberts: And the 4-quarter seasonal breakdown for the Glidden business that you gave in your handout, does that imply, the first quarter, which wasn't included in your results, was a pretty normal seasonal quarter for them?
Vincent J. Morales: Yes, John, this is Vince. We saw normal seasonality in all of our businesses essentially, including that business based on what we have exposure to.
Operator: Next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I went to my local Lowe's and I saw sort of shelves of Valspar's new propane and I saw very little Olympic. Is it the case that your share at Lowe's is decreasing? And is it perhaps the result of the AkzoNobel acquisition? And will losses of share at Lowe's offset the increased productivity that you see in buying the AkzoNobel business?
Charles E. Bunch: The new prop program at Lowe's is being supplied by Valspar. So that was a competitive situation that PPG did not win. That decision was made prior to the Akzo announcement so it was based on the merits of the bidding process and the decisions of the customer at that time. So it's -- in our case with the Akzo acquisition, we're looking at that as an opportunity. We have again had good discussions with all channels, all customers. And we're confident that we will be able to perform well in the integration of these businesses, thus the increase in the synergy targets that you saw today.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then secondly, can you talk about the weakness in the domestic optical business in a bit more detail?
Charles E. Bunch: The optical business in North America from all our customer and at-market data, so it was not just in our Transitions business but broader, whether that was due to changes in insurance reimbursement plans, weather, less the falling of Easter. It's not sure but there was more weakness in the first quarter in the at-market sales of all the products in the optical industry, not just Transitions. So at this point, we're going to see how that performance manifests itself here in the second quarter going forward before we can really say that this is a longer-term trend.
Operator: Next question comes from Kevin McCarthy, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Chuck, I thought your commentary on the Asian coatings market was perhaps more positive than I might have anticipated. I think you described notably improved activity in the region, mid to high single-digit growth, x marine. Can you comment on what is driving that and what is your degree of confidence that Asia will continue to grow at that sort of pace or a different pace?
Charles E. Bunch: Kevin, if you look at the Chinese market in particular, obviously, with the exception -- well, let's say the -- by far, the weakest market is the marine new-build market and that affects our business in China and also Korea. The first quarter was no exception. We've been talking about this for the last year or so. Those trends continued. We think the comparable data in the second half of the year will improve there. But right now, we're still experiencing notable declines in the business. In China, the construction market, let's call it the residential construction market, was also somewhat weaker. Although we have a relatively small business there. We actually gained slightly in terms of volume but off a very small base. The big businesses for us in China, automotive OEM, they had an excellent quarter, a lot of momentum as we've talked about. Automotive refinish, good volume growth as the carpark continues to expand in China. The Industrial business was also solid. Again, the -- for the most part, the strengths that we saw in automotive parts, actually, our customer mix in consumer electronics, was not too bad and the packaging business, as I've referenced was also solid in China. So if you look at our biggest market there, we had, on balance, good support, again led by automotive OEM builds which are going to be up some 10% and again, with some of the -- our new product introductions, our customer mix, we're poised to continue to deliver in Asia more broadly but specifically, in China.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: As a follow-up, Chuck, when do you expect the marine business to hit a cyclical trough?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, I think the second half of this year, we're expecting this -- let's call it, this precipitous decline to level off. You haven't seen more broadly the industry start to recover. China went down for -- earliest, I guess, in this new-build cycle and Korea sustained its new-builds longer. Now we've seen a little bit of more weakness in Korea as well but I think the second half is going to moderate in terms of the market declines. But in terms of an upturn, we're probably at least a year away from seeing these things increase build rates in -- for new oceangoing vessels in Asia. Now the half of that business is protective coatings. So despite the weakness in new-builds in Asia, protective Coatings is growing. It's doing well here in North America. It is also growing in Asia. And we're doing a good job in Europe from a restructuring and productivity standpoint. So I don't want to paint a too gloomy picture of the strategic business unit because it does include -- half of that market is doing well but we have seen a sharp decline in marine new-builds. We're, again, leveling off second half of this year but probably won't start an upturn until next year.
Operator: Next question comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citibank.
P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: If I look at Slide 16, Akzo had Glidden brand in pretty much every channel. Is there potential brand repositioning you can do to avoid any channel conflicts?
Charles E. Bunch: We're going to look at our brand positioning and I think we'll have an opportunity. It was -- it's really early days, and I think these -- the first thing that we're trying to do with this integration is make sure that all the current customers are being supported and supplied and so we think that we're not going to make any quick changes in terms of brand or channel but it's certainly something that we're going to look at and there'd be maybe some opportunities to provide more clarity among the channels in the future. But right now, we're moving forward to protect all of the customers that we have in those channels.
P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then your optical sales were down 6%. Is there more competition for Transitions coming in at the low-end from competitors like Zeiss or Hoya?
Charles E. Bunch: We have been competing with Zeiss and Hoya in photochromics, in Hoya's case, for several years. Zeiss started early in 2012 and actually, in 2011. And so I don't think that there is any new product introductions here. We do see the Chinese market growing. That's an opportunity for all the optical manufacturers, although there is a manufacturing base in China that we will watch as -- in the coming years as they develop their capability.
Operator: Next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi from Robert W. Baird.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Akzo this morning was calling out a trade-down effect in architectural paints in Europe. Can you just give us some color on what you're seeing at the region there?
Michael H. McGarry: Ghansham, this is Michael. The -- our numbers in Europe were negatively impacted by our trade business. The trade guys react very quickly to weather. And as you know, over in Europe, we had the worst weather in a couple of decades, and so we were right in that minus 10% to 12% downrange.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay, so most of the weakness was just weather-related versus any sort of trade-down then?
Michael H. McGarry: Yes, we don't think we lost any share.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then just can you give us some more color on the Deft acquisition, too? What was the attraction there? Was it technology, customer alignment, et cetera?
Charles E. Bunch: This -- the Deft acquisition, about 75% of Deft sales are in the aerospace industry, and that's one. And we are the industry leader in aerospace coatings so we felt it fit nicely, and not only from a position, but they have some excellent products, especially water-based primers. And so we felt that it filled some product niche opportunities for us, expanded our presence in the space. And so we look forward to what we feel is going to be an excellent acquisition, not only for the aerospace but we also have some industrial and architectural products that are part of that acquisition. But the primary driver was product opportunities in aerospace.
Operator: Next question comes from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.
Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: This is Rob Walker on for Laurence. I guess, as you think about volume trends this quarter U.S. had a tough comp because of weather. Europe had a tough comp because activity didn't fall off until Q2 last year. So I guess, shouldn't the comp get easier notably in Q2 and do you expect coatings volumes overall to be solidly up year-over-year in Q2?
Charles E. Bunch: Yes, we think that we should face some easier comparables in the second quarter. And I would say that in Europe, and we feel that the business will get better overall in Europe. And the first quarter was very weak, but we don't feel that this trend is going to accelerate here in the second quarter and the comp should be favorable here and in Europe as well.
Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: And then I guess could you update us on what you're seeing in the TiO2 market and your progress on the various initiatives you're doing there to continue to improve the situation?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, we hit our target last year of more efficiently using TiO2 in our formulas between 4% and 6%, so we were within the range on the lower end of that. We saw some continued improvement but not at the same pace here in the first quarter so we're continuing to derive some benefits for more efficiently using the raw material. Pricing right now in TiO2, I would say that, as I indicated earlier, Europe has been the weakest market. We don't know exactly the trend for TiO2 in the second half of the year, and we're discussing right now second quarter pricing. So I would say that the trends at this point seem to be slightly -- slight moderate or on a slight moderate decline on a global basis, again, mostly in Europe. And I would say flat to overall in raw materials for the first half of the year.
Operator: Next question comes from Andy Cash from SunTrust.
Andrew W. Cash - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Just couple of things. You mentioned in your release about how aerospace and the Performance Coatings was doing well, solid demand. Yesterday, Textron had mentioned the business jet market is weak right now. I'm just curious if you're just really a small supplier to the business jet market or is it more big jets? I mean, why the difference there?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, I think there are several different market segments within business for general aviation. And of that segment, it's continued to do well for us. Again, some of our products are concentrated in, let's call it, the bigger iron in that bizjet market. And overall, we did see a slight improvement in volume overall for our business. And so commercial aviation has continued to be a strength for the business over -- it's been now on a 1 to 2-year upcycle and that continued despite some of the qualification issues around the 787. So we're still seeing good support there in commercial aviation and business aviation. We're not probably as big a player overall and I think the market segments that we participate in are doing a little better.
Vincent J. Morales: And Andy, this is Vince. We also have a very big aftermarket presence that is much more stable.
Andrew W. Cash - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Okay, so that outweighs that. Just one other question, if I could. I know you're just still integrating Akzo, you're early days there. But if you look at your overall store count, and perhaps you're going to rationalize some stores. But if you think about your company-owned stores over the next few years, what kind of sort of growth rate should we anticipate there?
Michael H. McGarry: Andy, this is Michael. If you look at it, they have a very good network in Canada so we'll be adding stores in Canada. The overlap was primarily in the southeast and southwest where we have the Porter stores and the Monarch stores so that's where we'll be looking to optimize the network there.
Andrew W. Cash - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Yes, do you have a sort of a growth rate in mind? Do you know how many new stores you want to add once you sort of get things to sort of a steady state?
Michael H. McGarry: We don't have a figure that we're willing to share right now, but we're certainly looking to improve this store network that we've gone from 400 stores now to 1,000, so that will be a focus area for us.
Operator: Next question comes from Nils Wallin from CLSA.
Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: Quick one on architectural coatings. It look likes year-on-year, your revenues were down $60 million and depending on how we do the cost savings numbers and allocation, cost savings I don't think explains all of that improved or excuse me, the stability in the EBITDA part of that segment. So would you help me understand what the other offsets might be in the architectural EMEA business that's contributing to this pretty good result despite very tough headwinds?
Michael H. McGarry: I'll take that one. Yes, if you look at Europe, we had very strong cost down performance. We also had the restructuring gains. In North America, we also had a wee bit of price. And if you look in other markets, we did pretty well in that regard. So cost is certainly a significant driver.
Vincent J. Morales: And then -- and Nil, the cost, again, as Michael mentioned, is really 2 buckets. It's the restructuring savings that we've been implementing over the past 12 months. And we haven't anniversary-ed last year's savings as of yet, as well as what I would call discretionary costs that -- some of that, given the volume drop that Chuck mentioned earlier, more than 10%, we were able to pull the lever on some of that discretionary cost.
Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: Got it. And just on the architectural in the U.S., I mean, mid to high single-digit in company-owned stores, that sounds like some share gains compared to competitors. Are you taking share in the company-owned store business or is there something else going on there?
Michael H. McGarry: I don't believe we're taking share in that segment.
Operator: Next question comes from Charles Dan from Morgan Stanley.
Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: First, could you give some sense to the magnitude of the increase in your U.S. architectural business? I know you mentioned that it was up, but sometimes you give a little more detail there?
Vincent J. Morales: Magnitude of the -- in sales? We were up collectively in the U.S. business about 3%, which included higher growth in stores, comparable growth in our national accounts, and, as Chuck mentioned earlier, our dealer network was down.
Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And in your general industrial business, could you give us a sense for the breakdown sort of by geography in terms of the trends?
Vincent J. Morales: Well, as Chuck mentioned, Asia was up mid to high single-digits. Europe was down mid to high single-digits and U.S. was essentially neutral.
Operator: Next question comes from Ivan Marcuse from KeyBanc.
Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Just had a quick question. On U.S. commercial, where -- which one of your businesses do you typically see is a leading indicator and it gives you a sign that it's coming back and are you seeing any signs that commercial construction or nonresidential construction is coming back in some way in the U.S.?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, the business unit that is the -- has the clearest indicator of commercial construction activity is the flat glass business. It actually reports to Michael. And there we've seen what I would call early signs that we are seeing improvement in U.S. commercial construction, it's because of the business -- our business is primarily focused here in the U.S. If you look at the Architectural Billing Index, that's up slightly but I would say that it's still lagging the recovery that we're seeing here in the U.S. in residential but we believe it's coming. So we think that this commercial construction activity is building, it was the last to go into the recession. It probably went in maybe 1.5 to 2 years later than the -- than residential in the previous decade. So we think it's following a similar pattern, but we're seeing early signs of improvement.
Operator: Next question comes from Kevin Hocevar from Northcoast Research.
Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research: Could you give a little more color on the introduction of the next-generation Transitions lenses in Europe? Could you kind of elaborate on how that's been going compared to your expectations, better or worse or maybe compared to prior next-generation lenses? And also, when is kind of a rollout date for the U.S. with that product?
Charles E. Bunch: The performance in the first quarter for our gen 7 Transitions in Europe was actually encouraging. The overall European market for many of our other businesses as you've heard on the call was very weak. So we were pleased that we saw strength in Europe from the introduction of gen 7. We have better transmission, gets darker, better clarity and less temperature sensitivity. So we feel that the product has real features and benefits that we are encouraged that the market is recognizing. The introduction in North America is scheduled for late this year. So you will see -- we feel a good growth opportunities towards the latter half of the second half. So we're talking about the fourth quarter where we should see some improvement from the introduction of gen 7 here in North America. So we're encouraged with what we see.
Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research: Okay, and then just one quick follow-up. The -- you expect to save as part of your couple year $140 million I believe is the number of cost savings. You expected another $70 million to $80 million of incremental savings this year. I just wonder if you could comment on how you have progressed toward that number. And is there any additional possibilities especially given the -- kind of the prolonged outlook for European weakness to maybe even come at the high-end or maybe even higher than those levels?
Vincent J. Morales: Kevin, this is Vince again. There's a couple of different numbers you threw out. The $70 million to $80 million was the remainder we had on our restructuring program and that was a full year 2013 number. We got just under $30 million of that in the first quarter. We expect similar but slightly larger amount in the second quarter. And then we're going to start to anniversary some of our savings from last year, so we'll see lesser amounts later in the year and even a little minor spillover into next year. The number you didn't mention was the $60 million of annual synergies we get as we close the Akzo acquisition. Those were primarily fixed cost so they break out evenly per quarter. So that would be roughly $15 million a quarter beginning immediately. And then we have $140 million of first 3-year synergies from the Akzo acquisition. As you can imagine, we'll get very modest amounts in the next quarter or certainly 4 or 5 months as we begin the integration process. Then we expect those to ramp up thereafter. So hopefully, that's what you were looking for.
Operator: Next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn from Longbow Research.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: A couple of questions. If you look at the cost savings -- if you could just look at the restructuring cost savings that you talked about that's benefiting a number of your businesses. Vince, you mentioned that it's going to anniversary sometime this year. Sort of what is the run rate once it anniversaries that we should be looking forward to carry over into 2014?
Vincent J. Morales: Well, from the time that we started the process, we'll be looking at a run rate of about $140 million a year. As you could see, this past quarter, it was about $30 million so that would be about a $120 million run rate. So we still have a little bit more accretion per quarter. But from beginning of last year, using that as the index, it would be about $140 million of savings once we get to, let's say, 2014.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: Okay, all right. So there's still several tens of millions of dollars on a year-over-year basis in restructuring benefits that you'll see in 2014?
Vincent J. Morales: Yes, we'll see some mild spillover into 2014.
Charles E. Bunch: Dmitry, it's in the remaining quarters of 2013 that we'll see that incremental benefit. But by the time we get to the first quarter of 2014, there'll be only a small portion of that $140 million cumulative savings yet to be realized for the first time.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: Okay, I was coming up with about $25 million, but okay. All right, maybe it's smaller than that. If you look at your -- the acquisition of Akzo, have you and maybe you've already shared but I just don't remember. Can you talk about what the incremental depreciation amortization is going to be for you guys that were -- put it differently what's the D&A for the year, including this business?
David B. Navikas: We expected -- we're still working through the numbers, Dmitry. We won't have those finalized until later this year, but if you look the business we're looking at about $40 million to $50 million of D&A for the business on an annual basis.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: After all the write-ups and everything, so that's going to be the net adder?
David B. Navikas: The net D&A -- gross and net D&A.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: Okay, very good. And then you also mentioned some share gains in Europe in discussing your Industrial Coatings business. So can you talk a little bit about that? And also have you seen any issues with heavy equipment or the ag equipment business that one of your competitors referred to seeing in the January quarter?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, the Industrial Coatings segment that we referenced, the sales growth and the share gain has been in automotive OEM coatings. And again, as we discussed, it was focused on new product introductions being with the right customers and the right plants. So I would say that the sales growth momentum that we're seeing in the segment is primarily being driven by the automotive OEM segment. Heavy-duty equipment, that has been, let's call it, modest or flat growth, so we've seen some weakness overall in the market. In some regions, Asia, a little bit stronger, Europe, a little bit weaker, very flat here in North America. So again, not seeing that same kind of overall growth for the market that we're talking about in automotive in heavy-duty equipment. And we hope that that's a trend that reverses itself or we see a recovery of growth as the year goes on.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: But you're not seeing a significant decline in demand in heavy equipment particularly in Asia. You mentioned Asia was actually a little bit stronger for you?
Charles E. Bunch: Yes, we're not seeing a big decline. There's been some discussions in the marketplace about will the mining or commodity segment be hurt by what we've seen over the last couple of months in the market for commodities or mining stocks. The ag guys, to me, feel pretty strong right now. But there's probably been a little more weakness compared to the ag guys in, let's call it, construction and mining equipment.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We have a question from Richard O'Reilly from Revere Associates.
Richard O'Reilly: To help some of us with our commodity taxes, can you talk about how much exposure you have now to natural gas without the chlorine business?
Michael H. McGarry: This is Michael, Richard. Our exposure is down 75% and that leaves, what's remaining, the 75% of that is actually in our glass businesses, both glass and fiberglass. And that's becoming a less and lesser important commodity to us.
Richard O'Reilly: Sure. How would natural gas compare with, let's say, the pie of stuff in the coatings business? Would it be as big as pigments or what would it be like?
Michael H. McGarry: It's a much smaller number than pigments.
Richard O'Reilly: Okay, fine, okay. And second quick or just a math question. I thought the Akzo business was acquired for $1.05 billion, yet you talked about cash of $900 million plus. Am I wrong or what's the difference?
David B. Navikas: Richard, the value of the deal was announced at $1.05 billion. The expected cash had originally been $875 million because of some deductions related to the pension plans in Canada that were being assumed, so that would be the difference. We ended up -- they put some additional cash into the plan before we closed. So we ended up with an overall cash out for the acquisition of about $950 million.
Operator: I'd now like to hand the call back to Vince Morales for closing remarks.
Vincent J. Morales: Just want to thank everybody again for their time. And if there's any further questions, please feel free to contact me at Investor Relations. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes your call for today. You may now disconnect. Thank you for joining and have a good day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q4 2012 PPG Industries Earnings Conference Call. My name is Martine, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Vincent J. Morales: Thank you, Martine, and good morning. Again, my name is Vince Morales. I'm the Vice President of Investor Relations for PPG Industries. Welcome to PPG's Fourth Quarter 2012 Financial Teleconference. Joining me on the call today from PPG is Chuck Bunch, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Dave Navikas, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Our comments relate to the financial information released on Monday, January 14, 2013. I will remind everyone that approximately 1 hour ago, we posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on the Investor Center at our website, ppg.com. Those slides are also available on the webcast site for this call, and they provide additional support to the opening comments Chuck will make momentarily. Following Chuck's perspective on the company's results for the quarter, we'll move to a Q&A session. Both the prepared commentary and discussion during the Q&A may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company's current view about future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. Today's presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures the company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which, again, are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC. Now let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch.
Charles E. Bunch: Thank you, Vince, and welcome, everyone. Our record fourth quarter results capped off what has been an exceptional year for the company, driven by excellent operating performance and the announcement of several significant strategic transactions that accelerate the pace of our portfolio transformation. Record fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.53 are 10% higher than last year and marked 10 consecutive quarters of adjusted earnings per share records. We achieved these results despite continued variation in regional economic performance and mixed end-use market demand levels. A few business highlights from the quarter were the aggregate coatings segment earnings growth of 30% and Optical and Specialty Materials segment results, which were similar. Commodity Chemicals also grew earnings versus last year despite 2 unplanned outages during the quarter. Full year commodity chemical results eclipsed last year's record level. Geographically, the United States remained our strongest region, with most businesses delivering top line growth. Emerging markets growth remained modest, but trends improved in several businesses versus the prior 2 quarters. European demand continued to be negative, but the trend there also improved slightly versus the last few quarters. A key element of our success in the quarter and overall for the year was the company's strong operating execution. We continued to aggressively manage our businesses, and fourth quarter results also benefited from the restructuring actions, which we proactively initiated early in 2012. For the full year, we achieved a record adjusted EPS figure of $7.94, which is up 16% from last year's record. Worth mentioning is earnings results improved in each region, including Europe. Also, our full year return on sales percentage was higher in each segment except Glass. For the year, we delivered a record level of cash from operations, up 25% versus last year, and continued our long legacy of returning cash to shareholders by increasing our dividend for the 41st consecutive year. In addition, the announced strategic actions reflect the continued execution on our vision to remain a global leader in coatings and Specialty Materials. Progress is well under way to finalize these actions. We begin 2013 well positioned. Our expectations are for continued variations in economic conditions. We expect a growth bias to remain for the United States, improvement in growth prospects in Asia and European activity to remain subdued. As a result of these mixed economic conditions, we will remain diligent in managing our businesses. Operationally, we expect an incremental $70 million to $80 million of savings from the finalization of our restructuring programs, and we will implement targeted price increases in our coatings businesses to fully offset the inflation from the past 2 years. Finally, even before considering any impact from 2013 free cash flow, we have excellent financial flexibility, with cash and short-term investments of $2.4 billion. A primary focus for the corporation in 2013 will be to analyze prudent cash deployment opportunities focused on profitable earnings growth. Overall, I am pleased with the financial performance we achieved in 2012, and we remain focused as we begin 2013 on profitably growing the company and creating additional shareholder value. Thank you for your attention. This concludes our prepared remarks. Now, operator, would you please give instructions and open the phone lines for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Chuck, just on today's announcement on the Optical JV and the potential sale or purchase, can you give us a little more detail on your thinking on this business? Is it core? Is it not core? If you sold it, what's the tax base if you bought it? How much will it cost you? A little more detail will be great.
Charles E. Bunch: Well, David, we're not really going to give a lot more color on our -- on the press release, we did that for our disclosure obligations. And we're not going to get into a -- providing a lot of additional details on the press release regarding Transitions.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Understood. Just one more thing, Chuck. If you look at your coatings margins. They were roughly 13.1% for the entire coatings businesses. Should they be up or down next year? And if up, by how much, do you think?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, we feel we have an opportunity to improve on our coatings margins. So we think, in general, economic conditions and volumes should improve globally. It depends, again, on the regions and markets. But we feel that, that is going to be an overall benefit. Plus we have -- as you know, we'll be calendarizing the full restructuring benefits as we go through 2013. So those 2 events, I think, or those 2 conditions give us an opportunity to improve on our coatings margins.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division: You mentioned that you still want to get prices in the coming year to catch up with raw mats. How much more price do you need to kind of breakeven on raw mats overall?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, Duffy, we had some inflation as we look even at the fourth quarter. Even as the raw material basket was coming in balance, we still had a slight inflation overall in our costs. And so as we look to 2013, yes, we're seeing some -- a difference in trends overall for raw materials. We have some of our raw materials, especially on the inorganic side, that we have some modest declines. Although now, what we're seeing here as we start the year is some increases, especially in commodities here in North America, like propylene or ethylene. So I would say that we're looking for a more balanced raw material outlook as we go through -- as we open here in 2013, and we will have other inflationary costs. And we will have more than likely some targeted price increases for -- to address those or in businesses, regions, where we haven't fully recaptured the inflationary pressure that we saw over the last 2 years.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Fair enough. And then on your goal, I think you've talked several times about more than 10% that you'd like to de-content TiO2 from your can of paint. How much of that did you get accomplished in '12? And then how much more can we get done in '13?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, when we looked -- when we made the announcements regarding our targets for improvements in using TiO2 more efficiently, we said 4% to 6% during 2012. We accomplished that at the lower end of the range, and we think we still have in 2013 an opportunity to improve our utilization, again in the lower single-digit target levels for 2013.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities.
Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Chuck, you strike me as a somewhat loquacious individual. The press release on Essilor today, you're talking about the discussions there. And yet you, when you answered David's question, you talked about disclosure obligations. Now I would have thought that you would have discussions with them ongoing over the years. Has anything changed with respect to the discussions that you would have had of a strategic nature with Essilor?
Charles E. Bunch: No. I would say that, Frank, as you know, we are involved in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction with the Georgia Gulf. We are in the exchange period, and we are aware of our disclosure obligations around the transaction. And we felt that, yes, it was appropriate for us to issue the press release that we did.
Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. All right. So it has changed somewhat, but it's really more of the RMT than perhaps something heating up today versus what it would have been 1 year or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 years ago?
Vincent J. Morales: Yes. I think, Frank, the focus again is the fact that we're in this tender period, and we want to make sure we adhere to our disclosure obligations.
Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: And where are we on the -- what inning are we in, in terms of the restructuring? And what should we realistically expect? I think you'd indicated you had $70 million to $80 million left on the current program, a lot of it European-based. And you've got -- in terms of Akzo, you got $60 million when that closes, I think another $30 million in year one. So I mean, you can kind of get to $0.75, $0.80 of EPS benefit from restructuring in 2013. Is that how we should be thinking about that?
David B. Navikas: Frank, this is Dave. The $70 million to $80 million coming from the 2012 program is still a good estimate of what we're anticipating, and that would more likely come in the first half of the year. Certainly, the first year synergies that we're expecting following the Akzo acquisition will come later on and be impacted by when we're able to close that transaction.
Eugene Fedotoff - Longbow Research LLC: So you're still on track for a second quarter close. Correct?
David B. Navikas: That's what we're targeting.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Chuck, just wanted a little more granularity on a couple of end markets you discussed in your release and commentary. On the Architectural side, you mentioned lower sales in emerging regions. I wonder if you can just give us a little more color if there's been any trend change and how long we might expect these negative comps to continue?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, I would say the biggest influence on our emerging region Architectural performance was actions that we took, Bob, in Chile and Argentina to scale back our operations in those 2 markets in light of the economic conditions so that, overall, I would say that the trends for emerging markets were not nearly as negative if you looked at it overall, excluding those 2 markets where we took company specific actions.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then on your Industrial side, you mentioned that packaging coatings were strong in all regions. And I guess, I was looking at what Alcoa had to say about beverage can volumes, and it wasn't consistent across regions. So is there something you guys are doing differently that's giving you growth in the developed markets when it seems like most of the growth for those applications are in the emerging regions?
Charles E. Bunch: I would say that the strongest volume was in the emerging regions. But overall, we did see some volume growth in the developed regions, whether this was a restocking or emerging opportunities, plus also the BPA-free. The beginnings of those products now coming into the market may have had an influence. But certainly, we saw some volume growth in all of the markets, but strongest in the Asia-Pacific region.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Did you have any reflections on titanium dioxide prices? Are they holding flat? Are they going down a little bit? Are they going up? Just sort of how are they acting and how do you see them in 2013?
Charles E. Bunch: We have seen declines in the trends since the beginning of the second quarter of 2012, so where they hit a peak. These are different by region, so we've seen more weakness in Europe in light of, we think, overall economic conditions. And as I said in my earlier comments, we're looking at a more balanced, flat raw material basket as we go into 2013, with probably modest declining trends in TiO2 overall, offset by what appears to be, at least here in the first quarter, some pressure on the petrochemical or organic side of the raw material basket.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. In the -- in 2012, your restructuring efforts were to pull out, I think, $40 million to $50 million pretax in costs. Did you achieve that? And how would you look allocate those cost savings across your segments?
David B. Navikas: Jeff, this is Dave. We did achieve the $40 million of savings in 2012. And from a segment point of view, we had provided information in our April call that had identified by segment where we were anticipating getting those savings in 2012. And our actual performance was very much in line with that expectation.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Buckingham Research.
John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Was the high single-digit growth in U.S. Architectural sales more price or more volume?
Charles E. Bunch: Actually, it was fairly even but I would say probably biased to the volume side in the market.
John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: And could you help us understand what performance -- excuse me, Specialty Materials and Optical would have done without the Thailand sort of dip in benefit comp and without the channel filling this? What would be a trend line in that segment because it had sort of 2 major things going on, both the easy comps against Thailand disruptions and the channel filling?
Charles E. Bunch: Yes, John. If you look at the Optical business in the fourth quarter, we benefited year-over-year on the bottom line by about $5 million due to the absence of Thailand flooding impacts. The top line, we certainly were glad to see what I would call a full fill of the inventory build for Transition VII, but that still wasn't the major driver there. We did see some -- as you know, the last 2 quarters, we had some de-stocking in the channel. We saw a little bit of overall inventory re-stocking, as well as the benefit of the Transition VII build. I'd say taking the 2 quarters in aggregate, third and fourth quarter, we're seeing, I'd call it, solid mid-single-digit trend gains.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Merrill Lynch.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Chuck, if TiO2 pigment prices do continue to erode, would all of that benefit flow into your gross margin for coatings? Or might you have any contracts whereby you'd be obligated to share in that benefit with your customers?
Charles E. Bunch: For the most part, our contracts don't have material price indexes. And as I mentioned in my comments, even though we're seeing a declining trend in the TiO2 pricing, it's being offset by either other inflation or some continued inflation on the organic side. But also on the inorganic side, we're seeing some non-TiO2 pigment prices that are increasing.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay, understood. And then as a follow-up, I thought I might try for a clarification on your Optical press release. There's a sentence in there that begins "Under certain circumstances, which PPG does not yet believe have occurred, either PPG or Essilor may have the right to specify a price." It wasn't clear to me exactly what the trigger might be. I'm not sure if you can comment on it. But if you could perhaps address what circumstances might need to arise for either party to specify a price, that might help?
Charles E. Bunch: Kevin, we're not prepared to go into the -- all of the specific details of the joint venture agreement, so we're not going to provide any more clarity other than what you've seen in the press release.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: All right. And then final one, if I'm may, Chuck. I think you cited improving growth prospects as part of your outlook for Asia. Can you talk about what is driving that? Is it macro or company specific or both and which product lines you're feeling better about regionally within Asia?
Charles E. Bunch: For us, the -- let's call it the general industrial activity, was improving as we move through the second half and into the fourth quarter. Automotive builds have also continued to grow. We have seen some, as you know, slowdown on the electronics side, and some of the construction-related end-use markets were still slow. Although here, as we've been talking about with the leadership -- with the new leadership in place in China, we think that we're going to see now incentives for growth. And we have seen some signs of strengthening in some of these other markets, although right now it is not quite evident on the electronics side.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John McNulty with Credit Suisse.
Abhiram Rajendran - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: This is calling Abhi Rajendran calling in for John. So a quick question on M&A. So looking past the Akzo deal, could you touch on roughly how much cash you expect to have to put towards further M&A, as well as some of the main areas of focus within a business and regional basis?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, if you look at our cash at the end of the fourth quarter, so we had some close to $2.5 billion. So we will receive, at the conclusion of the Georgia Gulf transaction, around $900 million. That will be our outlay more or less later in the year with the closing of the Akzo transaction. So that would put you at relatively the same position that we have finished the quarter in, which we have previously announced that our -- what we need to run the company is under $500 million. So it would give us, we think, considerable resources to deploy for shareholder value-creating initiatives.
Abhiram Rajendran - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Got it. And then just some of the main areas of focus that you might be looking at, both on a -- either on a business or a geographic basis?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, we would continue to look for opportunities, as we talked about, in our coatings businesses. Geographically, we've made 2 announcements. We completed the Spraylat acquisition about 2 weeks ago. That was a North American-focused company in Industrial Coatings, although they had operations in China and in Europe. Akzo is predominantly or almost all North American, including the Caribbean, Canada and the U.S. And we continue to look for opportunities in other geographic areas, so that would be one of the areas in which we would continue to look for opportunities. But we have other segments of our business or our company that we think if there are appropriate opportunities, so we would continue to look for acquisitions in those areas as well if they will create shareholder value.
Abhiram Rajendran - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, got it. And then just a quick follow-up on the auto area. Could you touch on some of the share gains that you're continuing to see in auto OEM, just in terms of what's driving this and are they skewed towards any perching particular geographic regions, or anything else you could share?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, if you look at our automotive OEM business in 2012, 2 of the strongest growth areas globally for the industry were here in North America and in China. We are well positioned in both of those markets, and we think that we had a very good year in terms of participating in the industry growth, plus the customers that we were working with. And some of our new product introductions were very successful in each of those markets, and that was beneficial to driving the overall growth in our automotive coatings business globally.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: So post Akzo acquisition announcement, have you had a chance to talk to your retail partners, Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, to see their reaction in any potential channel conflict issues?
Charles E. Bunch: Yes, we have. We, as PPG, we visit the major customers in all channels on a regular basis. We did follow up with the customers in all of the channels. And we announced our strategy in which we were going to continue to support all of our existing businesses, plus those of the acquired company. And I would say that the interaction with the customers in the channels was very positive.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then on automotive OEM, you just talked about share gains. I know a competitor was selling its business and that sold, but they probably lost share. Are the shared gains done now? Or do you expect the shared gains to continue in 2013?
Charles E. Bunch: I would say that it's difficult to determine actual share in this industry on a short-term basis. Many of the -- when you look at awards, oftentimes you're awarded business for several years, different models, different plans. And I would say at this point, I would not say that we see significant share shifts. We're trying to continue to support all our customers, and we have been fortunate to work with a number of them that have done very well in their markets, as we talked about, here in North America, in China and Asia more broadly. And probably most importantly, we just continue to work on execution, keeping our costs in line and especially focused on the weakness that we've seen in Europe overall. So we focus there not as much on shared gains, but more on execution and driving our operations.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And just quickly lastly, I think earlier you said that you got strong volume growth in Architectural. Can you compare your volume growth in your own stores versus big boxes and where it's coming from? I just want to compare qualitatively.
Charles E. Bunch: I think I indicated that the performance by channel was similar for us. We had high single-digit overall sales growth, probably more on the volume side than on the pricing side. And I would say the performance overall by channel was positive in both channels.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA.
Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: With regard Europe, it seems like that -- or excuse me, Architectural Europe, it seems like that business you've been able to enjoy price increases much more than some of your other coatings businesses. So I'm wondering -- and, of course, this is a mid or fairly weak macroenvironment. So I'm wondering what you're able to do there that allows you to generate a higher price increase year-over-year than in some of your other coatings segments?
Charles E. Bunch: I would say that the majority of the improvement in Europe has been driven by our cost and execution actions. And we did focus, as you know, in the overall corporate restructuring on Europe. And obviously, that segment, the Architectural EMEA segment, was the focal point for our restructuring activities in the overall Architectural business globally. So I think that's where you're seeing most of the improvement, would be on the cost side for that business.
Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: Got it. And then if -- it sounds like in your prepared remarks, you expect OEM volumes to be roughly flat year-over-year in 2013. Does that mean that you really have to see a lot more heavy lifting coming from the packaging and general industrial in order to see volume growth? Or is there something else in there to assume that you're going to see continued volume growth in general in the Industrial Coatings business in 2013?
Vincent J. Morales: Nils, this is Vince. The reference in the prepared remarks was really toward 1Q, not the full year for 2013. We do expect full year growth in global automotive, again, with European weakness as a partially offset. So again, the 1Q saw very strong results in the first quarter 2012. And the year-over-year growth will be tempered by those first quarter results last year.
Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: Got it. Got it.
Charles E. Bunch: That was the tsunami effect. So that you had in the first quarter, a lot of inventory rebuilding because the supply chains were depleted, especially among the Japanese-based manufacturers as a result of the tsunami in 2011.
Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: Got it. And then just finally, if more of a strategic question. With the Akzo transaction, as well as sure wins, it seems like, I mean, in just about every end market for coatings, you're going to be #1 or #2. Is there much more you can do in terms of M&A to -- I mean, it seems like there aren't too many more big companies out there that you can do or you can acquire. So going forward, are we going to see, if in terms of your acquisition strategy, just more bolt-ons?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, I think if you look at the coatings industry globally, it is still not a highly consolidated industry compared to many other global manufacturing industries. So we think that there will be opportunities for more consolidation on a global basis, but the regional mix of acquisitions may change. But if you look at the industry in most other regions in Asia, in Europe, Latin America, these are areas of continuing opportunity for further consolidation in coatings.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.
Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: This is Rob Walker on for Laurence. I guess just to follow up a little on raw materials. So propylene contract looks to set to increase about $0.15 in January. Does your forecast for -- the comment you made on relatively flat pricing in 2013, does that imply that propylene prices will soften later in the year as they did in the last year? Or I guess, are you planning to increase prices to fully cover the proposed January increase?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, I think our comment were -- was in relation to this balance in the raw material basket between, let's call them, the inorganic raw materials and the organic or petrochemical-based raw materials with these increases that we're seeing in propylene and ethylene here as we start the year and that potential impact on raw material price escalation in those raw materials offsetting any negative trends that we may see in the rest of the basket. That's what we are saying is, right now, we're looking at something more balanced. But obviously, we're going to look at the trends in the entire basket and the different raw materials that are going in. And if we see further spikes in propylene or those get pushed through into the propylene based or raw materials that we're buying, then we're going to certainly open up discussions with our customers if we see those escalating much more than what we've seen currently.
Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay. So if the prices go up further than the January increase and they get passed through the derivatives, I guess, is there a price level where you would hit a point where you couldn't pass through the price in the current year and have a situation where you have to recoup it over 2 years?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, typically, as we talked about with the price increases in the past, typically, there is a period when we're trying -- we're certainly trying to push back on any price increases that we would be receiving in the short term. But then as we absorb this raw material inflation on our side, typically, as we talked in the past, it can take a quarter or 2 for us to try and get those increases reflected in our pricing with our customers. So I think that's, in general, how we've described the timing on raw material and pricing increases.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: A couple of questions. One, on U.S. Architectural, where you're going to have a much bigger exposure, obviously, post the Akzo acquisition, what do you think that overall growth was for the full year from an industry standpoint for 2012? And if you exceed that growth -- the numbers I've seen suggest about 4% industry growth. So I guess it would be the first increase in a number of years.
Charles E. Bunch: That would be around what we were saying would have been the growth in 2012, Don. So that's consistent, and it's certainly the first increase in several years. We're still nowhere near where we were before the crisis. So if you go back to 2006 or 2007, we're still much below that. We think that 2013 is going to be a good year for the U.S. construction industry. The first quarter last year was pretty good because we had some seasonally good weather. It's still a little early to kind of forecast what's going to be the outlook for the weather in the first quarter. These first couple of weeks have been more normal. But I would say, overall, for the full year, yes, we're optimistic that these trends that we saw, these first positive trends, are going to continue in 2013. The data, the housing data, the construction data, overall has been -- continued to be, for the most part, positive. You're seeing a lot of anecdotal information about -- in certain markets, the housing resale market strengthening. We've seen increases in new home construction permits and starts. So overall, I would say we're fairly optimistic. We've gotten through the fiscal cliff. Do we have some problems in a few months with a debt ceiling and other things that could derail this? Mortgage rates continue to be very positive. So we're optimistic, and we think we're going to have a good year in 2013 and in North America in Architectural.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: For 2012, did you grow above the industry rate? Did you do take share? And would do you expect to grow above the industry rate in -- on a pro forma basis in 2013?
Charles E. Bunch: I would say, in general, we were in line with industry trends in 2012. And in 2013, obviously, we'll get a bump from the acquisition activity that -- with Akzo North America. And I think we're well positioned to take advantage of the growth that we see overall for 2013.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: And just a follow-up on your share repurchase intentions. You've talked about $500 million to $700 million once the Reverse Morris Trust is done. Is it your intention to get most of that done in the first half and then depending on what acquisitions are in the pipeline, increase that level of share repurchase in the second half of 2013?
David B. Navikas: I would say, Don, this is Dave, that the expectations there or that we would spread that activity, the share repurchase activity, out over the remainder of our 2013. So I would not envision it being loaded into the front half of the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Goodnight with UBS.
Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Modeling questions for Dave. First, cash contributions to pension in '13, do you expect them to be about what they were in '12 or...
David B. Navikas: Yes, Gregg. In 2012, our only cash contributions were to our non-U.S. plants, and we would expect the same situation in 2013. And in terms of amount, 2013 would be in line with 2012.
Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Also, on cash, the asbestos settlement has been in abeyance for quite a while. Would you expect any cash requirements for potential settlement in 2013 at all?
David B. Navikas: It's certainly a possibility, Gregg, I would say. If it is, it would likely be in the back half of the year.
Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Last question, if I could. The -- your portfolio transformation has gone well. It seems to be near completion. The obvious element in your portfolio that doesn't seem to fit with the rest is, obviously, the Glass component. Does Glass fill some long-term strategic niche in your portfolio? Or is that an area that might require some additional looking at by the company?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, as we talked about, the businesses in that segment are businesses that aren't in our core but have been contributors over the years, but we are -- we would be open to look at opportunities to create shareholder value. We think that we have begun to see the improvement in the flat glass business. This is tied more specifically from an end-use market to the commercial construction industry here in North America. We're seeing some of the early signs of improvement. We do have what we think is a good position in that business, good brand, as well as market position. So we think that there's an opportunity for further improvement in that business. Fiberglass, as we mentioned in the release, we have had some challenges tied to some global weakness in the business. In Europe, we are tied, as well in Asia, to the electronics industry, which has been weaker. So right now, we think that we're focused on the right things in the business, which are continuing to improve our operations and if opportunities present themselves in -- as we move forward, we'll continue to look at it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: For the 2 more profitable coatings end markets, aerospace and auto refinishing, how should we think about the outlook for the full year? And also was auto refinish a bit weaker than you initially thought it would be for the fourth quarter?
Charles E. Bunch: I would say for -- if we look at those, first, the Aerospace business, we had a very strong year in 2012. And we think that the industry on a global basis looks good in 2013. So we're looking for further improvement in our aerospace business. Military will probably not be as strong in terms of the end-use markets. But what we've seen here is commercial aviation continues to be strong. There is more -- better airline profitability globally, so we think the aerospace business looks good. In the refinish business, we had some weakness in the European market in light of the overall economic conditions there. But it is tied in the longer-term trends to global industry builds and the global car parts, which are growing. The automotive industry globally is a growth industry, and we're seeing that play out. So the longer-term trends are good for automotive refinish. We think we'll have a good year here in 2013. But Europe, obviously, was part of the story in 2012, with the weakness that we saw there.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then last quarter, your auto OEM production chart for the EMEA region is estimated at that 11% decline, I think, for the fourth quarter, do have a sense as to what the estimate is for the first quarter for that region?
Charles E. Bunch: Yes, it's going to be negative but not at that level because I think now we're seeing some -- we're still seeing negative trends in Europe but not an acceleration of the declines that we've really been experiencing now for 6 quarters.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Charles Dan with Morgan Stanley.
Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Just looking at your geographic split, it seemed like North America was very strong. I was wondering if looking at your regional split, if you could see any impacts, positive or negative, from Hurricane Sandy?
Charles E. Bunch: No, I wouldn't say that any of the trends that we saw here in the fourth quarter could we attribute to that. Obviously, the 2 things that are probably going to play out here in 2013 will be the rebuilding or reconstruction activity that should help construction industry in the Northeast, as well as what happened to -- there were a lot of vehicles that were damaged or destroyed. And that should be a boost to the automotive industry, both in terms of the OEM and the refinish industry here in 2013. But I wouldn't say it's going to be the driving force, and it was really too early in the fourth quarter of 2012 to really see a trend there.
Operator: Your next question comes from James Sheehan of SunTrust.
James Sheehan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Chuck, I was just wondering if you could comment on the licensing deal with the Chinese company on TiO2. How big a portion of the overall reformulation effort is that now and how big do you think it could be in the future?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, the overall licensing agreement with Billions, I would say, is quite small so that -- and it really doesn't figure into the targets that we talk about for improving TiO2 productivity or usage in our formulas. I would say that neither the licensing revenue or the impact were -- on meeting our metrics were in any way significant. They are a supplier to PPG, but the things that we're talking about there are more long term in nature. There's no immediate benefit in terms of starting up the chloride production, and I think these things are events that will take place in the future.
James Sheehan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just on the situation with housing starts and some of the macro data that you referred to earlier. I was wondering if you could comment on some of the PPG store inventory levels. Are you seeing any changes there that are reflecting some of this macro data? Or just what are you seeing in the inventories now?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, we try to keep our inventories in balance with the level of demand. And so as we get into the first quarter, we typically have inventory build in our Architectural business as we prepare for the busy season. And I would say even though the volume trends were positive for us in the fourth quarter in our own stores, it was nothing that we could -- we were having to make, let's say, unusual adjustments to inventory levels to meet what we saw out there. But obviously, positive trends, something that we're watching so that we feel we'll be fully prepared as we go into the season this year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Hocevar with Northcoast Research.
Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research: This is Saul in for Kevin today. A couple of specifics, if you could. Your total company had $57 million worth of sales improvement due to price. How much of that was in coatings? And what was the raw material dollar change, either up or down, in coatings in the fourth quarter?
Charles E. Bunch: Saul, if you look, I think we said in our prepared comments, that both glass and chemicals had negative pricing in the quarter. So all the coatings gains were primarily coatings -- or excuse me, all the pricing gains, primarily coatings oriented. We did see still inflation in the quarter. And for the full year, we saw inflation. So we're still trying to work through, Chuck mentioned earlier, a full offset of inflation over not only this year, but over the past 24 months.
Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research: But in the quarter, Vince, was the inflation more or less than what you got in pricing?
Vincent J. Morales: It was -- they were fairly close. As Chuck mentioned, we're trying to get more -- they're fairly balanced now, but we do see more inflation coming early in the first quarter of 2013.
Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research: Okay. And then a second question on Glass. How much of the earnings are equity income? And what was the equity income component this year versus last year, so we could separate what you earned from your operating businesses versus your equity contribution?
Charles E. Bunch: Even in a good year, Saul, the equity earnings don't account for more than 15% of Glass total earnings. They are more volatile because they're -- there's no sales impact or we don't control the costs. We were down several million dollars this year, primarily due to the fiberglass JVs, which are focused on the electronic market, which, as we mentioned earlier, remained weak. But that's the biggest JV structure we have in our glass segment.
Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research: Of the $9 million that you earned, how much was the equity income, just a couple million dollars?
Charles E. Bunch: At best. And the fourth quarter, it was seasonally light just by nature.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Richie O'Reilly, Revere Associates.
Richard O'Reilly: A couple of follow-up questions, the first one in Glass. Do you still own the 40% in the auto glass business? And what's the status of that longer term?
Charles E. Bunch: We do own -- we've maintained our minority interest. It's actually 38%, and that is in our portfolio. We continue to have a good relationship with our -- the majority owners of the Kohlberg company. And right now, it's an ongoing business in our portfolio.
Richard O'Reilly: Okay. So you would need to have the other owners decide if they wanted to acquire the rest of the stake? Is that -- would it be their option?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, as we stated earlier, we're not going to go into all the details of our specific joint venture contracts. But right now, the business is operating successfully and continues in our portfolio.
Richard O'Reilly: Okay. Second, I'm going to try the Transitions announcement again, And Kevin earlier had started reading a sentence. But near the end of it, it talks about interest at one or more of the joint venture companies. Can you give us an idea what that is referring to? Is that regional or is it product line? Or I guess could you keep your overall interest in the -- your overall venture at 51% but change ownership of these sub-ventures?
Vincent J. Morales: Rich, as we mentioned earlier, I think everything we're going to say today on that is in the release.
Operator: And we have a follow-up question from the line of John Roberts with Buckingham Research.
John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Chuck, you mentioned U.S. automotive OEM in 2013 might benefit from the destroyed cars from the hurricane. Would most of that really be in the first quarter here? And you've already said that, I guess, it will be offset by the difficult comps against the Japanese tsunami effect.
Charles E. Bunch: I would say that we're not exactly sure when we're going to see the impact from that hurricane. The OEM business, it goes through several distribution layers. I would think that we're going to see more of that in the first half. I would think that by the middle of the year, any effects on at least in automotive from Hurricane Sandy should be evident. Now, it may take a little longer on the construction side of the equation. You may take, let's say, the full year to see all of the impact of the reconstruction activity. But I'm not sure that in the automotive side, you're going to see that all in the first quarter. But I would say most of that should be in the first half.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.
Vincent J. Morales: This is Vince Morales. I just like to thank everybody for your participation today. If there any further questions, please feel free to contact me in Investor Relations. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect and have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2012 PPG Industries Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shaquana, and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Vince Morales, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Vincent J. Morales: Thank you, Shaquana. Good afternoon. This is Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations for PPG Industries. Welcome to PPG's third quarter 2012 financial teleconference. Joining me from PPG on the call today is Chuck Bunch, Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer; and Dave Navikas, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Our comments relate to the financial information released on Thursday, October 18, 2012. I will remind everyone that approximately one hour ago we posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on the Investor Center at our website, ppg.com. Those slides are also available on the webcast site for this call. They provide additional support to the opening comments Chuck will make momentarily. Following Chuck's perspective on the company's results for the quarter, we will move directly to Q&A. Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company's current view about future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures the company has provided in the Appendix of the presentation materials, which are also available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the mostly -- most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC. Now, let me introduce PPG Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch.
Charles E. Bunch: Thank you, Vince, and welcome, everyone. Our earnings growth continued during the third quarter as we posted our ninth consecutive quarterly earnings record. Our adjusted earnings per share of $2.24 were up 14% versus last year and were up despite continued variation in regional economic performance. North America remained our strongest region with improved demand in most businesses, led by automotive OEM coatings gains. European volumes declined versus the prior year. However, the trend improved in comparison with the second quarter year-over-year results due to less customer inventory destocking. Emerging region demand was mixed by end-use market, ending flat in the aggregate. Currency translation remained a negative to sales and earnings. We were pleased to deliver higher earnings in each region for the quarter and year-to-date despite the mixed regional economic performance and negative currency translation impact. This was aided by our total coatings segment earnings, which grew by 20% versus the prior year as local currency sales growth was supplemented by continued operational execution. Earnings in our remaining segments were lower year-over-year, including the impact from lower optical product sales due to customer inventory management initiatives, stemming from the upcoming introduction of our new Transitions Generation VII product and lower optical consumer end-market growth rates. We also delivered strong cash performance, with year-to-date cash generation up over 33% and cash and short-term investments totaled $2 billion at the end of the quarter. Our excellent financial performance in the quarter and year-to-date is a direct result of our aggressive operational execution and further illustrates the benefits of our broad global business portfolio and the effectiveness of our ongoing cash deployment. Looking to the fourth quarter, we are heading into a seasonally slower period in most end-use markets and expect little change in the inconsistent performance of economies outside North America. We also anticipate measured economic growth in North America and expect we will continue to benefit from some of the highest growth sectors this year such as automotive OEM and aerospace. We will remain focused on aggressive management within the regions to maximize our financial performance and we expect to benefit further from the continued implementation of restructuring actions. In addition, we have considerable financial flexibility, and we continue to pursue acquisitions in a disciplined manner as a primary means of deploying our strong cash position for earnings accretion. Finally, we remain on schedule to complete the separation of our Commodity Chemicals business and the merger of that business with Georgia Gulf, with closing expected to occur by early next year. That concludes our prepared remarks. Now, operator, would you please give instructions and open the phone lines for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy, representing Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I was wondering if you could provide us with an update on both the timing of the transaction with Georgia Gulf as well as your latest thoughts on the relative merits of split-off versus spinoff?
Charles E. Bunch: Yes, I can, Kevin. It's good to have you on the line. Right now, as I'd described in my notes, we anticipate a closing by the first quarter of 2013. We have several items that are still in process. And we have completed one antitrust review here in the U.S. We're waiting for final SEC filings to be completed by both companies. We're waiting for an IRS tax ruling and similarly in Canada. We have also the Georgia Gulf shareholder vote, which we anticipate later in the fourth quarter, November or December. So we're still on pace, we think. We haven't had any surprises so far and -- as we've moved through these items, so I would say we're still on schedule. Our thinking is still in favor of the split and that would be our recommendation today. We are obviously monitoring the financial markets as we go through and we continue to be, I think, buoyed by the strength overall in the response to the potential transaction, the performance of ours, as well as Georgia Gulf shares. So at this point, we are still pointing towards a split and believe that is the best avenue for PPG and our shareholders.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Great. As a second and final question, would you provide an update on your outlook for raw material costs and perhaps touch on TiO2 pigment, as well as acrylics where it looks like there could be some nascent upward pressure following an outage in Japan? Just would appreciate your updated thoughts on that for the end of the year here.
Charles E. Bunch: TiO2 costs, as we look at them in the third quarter of 2012, we're still up versus the third quarter of 2011, although the trend here in 2012 as we've moved through the years, has been for lower prices for TiO2 in all the regions. Pricing for the fourth quarter is still under discussion. But the overall inflationary trends for raw materials, I'd say, have been very moderate here this year. And I would say that in the acrylic chain, although there was a lot of publicity around the explosion in Japan and the plant outage, we've been watching the acrylic chain. Propylene pricing, that has been, I would say, moderate. We haven't returned to some of the higher prices in propylene that we've seen earlier this year. So I would say that, right now, we are not seeing any price spikes in the acrylic chain at this point here for the second half of 2012.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter, representing Deutsche Bank.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Chuck, on the same track, can you talk about your pricing discipline in the face of some lower raw material costs? Have you been forced to lower any prices? And can you actually quantify the gap that expanded -- that occurred or benefited you guys in Q3, as well as the drop in your selling prices that did not?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, I would say that we're still facing raw material inflationary pressure over certainly the last 18 months or a little longer. We haven't fully recaptured that. So as I described in TiO2, we've seen a moderation of the increases; in fact, some modest decreases here this year. But overall, we've seen more stability in terms of our raw material input costs, and pricing has remained stable during the course of this year. Vince, did you want...
Vincent J. Morales: Yes, Dave, I just wanted to add, that in several of our businesses in 2011, we absorbed a lot of inflation without the ability to push through price until this year. So over the last 18 or 20 months, as Chuck has mentioned, we're still in a recapture mode and that recapture continues into the fourth quarter.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: That's helpful. And Chuck, can you discuss your efforts to reduce your usage of TiO2? I believe you had a 4% to 6% target for this year.
Charles E. Bunch: Yes, and we're still on track. Through the first 3 quarters of this year, we were tracking at a little over 3%. So we feel that for the full year, we will be into certainly the 4% to 6% range. Probably as we roll up all the numbers, it'll be kind of on the low end of that range or a little over 4%, but certainly within our target. And we feel we still have opportunities as we go into 2013 and beyond to continue the more productive use of TiO2 in our formulation.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And lastly, can you discuss potential share buybacks with the $2 billion of cash on the balance sheet? How much of that cash is trapped overseas, Chuck? How much do you need to run the company, something on that track?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, we anticipate, as you see, the -- our cash balance was around $2 billion here at the end of the third quarter. Fourth quarter is usually a cash generator for us plus we have the $900 million that will be coming over the next few months from the split off of the Commodity Chemicals business. So if you think that we need $400 million to $500 million to run the company, we are probably sitting on in excess of $2 billion in terms of opportunity to either engage in share buybacks or also M&A activity. We're currently out of the share buyback market because of this Reverse Morris Trust transaction. We would intend to initiate modest share buybacks at the conclusion of the transaction. But we are keeping some of our balance sheet strength, let's call it, as we look at the acquisition opportunities. We announced one yesterday, as you saw, in our Industrial Coatings space, Spraylat. But as we go through 2013 and beyond, if we cannot find attractive acquisition candidates to deploy this, let's say, excess cash, we will become more aggressive in share buybacks. And we have a good portion of this $2.5 billion in cash here in North America. We have -- all of the cash from the Georgia Gulf transaction will be here. And so we think that, I think, 3/4 of the cash balance that we have is here in North America and available for any of our uses, not only share buybacks and M&A, but also dividend payments or other payments here to any of our constituencies in North America.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of John Nulty (sic) [McNulty], representing Credit Suisse.
Abhiram Rajendran - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: This is Abhi Rajendran calling in for John. A couple of quick questions. So auto has been a relative bright spot for you guys. How should we think about trends in the auto OEM business on a regional basis looking to 4Q, and are there any customer shutdowns or any other factors that we need to consider?
Charles E. Bunch: The global trends for automotive OEM production are still good. And I think you will see, I think, a continuation of the trends that we've outlined here in the first 3 quarters of this year. One is continued strength in North America. We have good sales momentum. Inventory levels are moderate. And even the numbers in September, good sales levels, more production coming to North America from outside, so less imports into the North American market. So I would expect the North American market to stay positive, especially on the production side. Although I think you will see over the next year or more as the effects of the Japanese tsunami are moderated, you're not going to see this 20% necessarily growth rate during 2013 that we've seen this year. Europe remains quite weak. The first 9 months in 2012, we've had high single-digit declines in production in Europe. We had, I think, a similar, if not quite as negative production in the third quarter, but it's usually a difficult quarter in Europe to determine actual trends because of the vacation period. But right now, we haven't seen a turnaround in Europe and we're not expecting one as we move into 2013. Chinese market, a big one for us, has remained quite positive, 7% kinds of growth rates, still healthy. And India, which has struggled over the last few quarters with growth rates, now in the low single digits. We think there, we -- there's more time needed to turn the -- some of those economic headwinds in India. So at this point, as we look to the first half of next year, I would say a continuation of some of the same trends overall. Despite the weakness in Europe, this is a very positive story. I think we're doing quite well in our business and I think you're also seeing from PPG here is well positioned in leadership positions with all of the major car manufacturers, good regional strength, benefiting from some of the restructuring that we announced earlier this year. And also, I think a story that we haven't emphasized as much is what I would call improved localization of our production. We have -- the coatings businesses, as you know, are not highly capital intensive. Our capital expenditures have actually been modest over the last few years, but they've been pointed at positioning us, especially in automotive and in our Industrial Coatings market to localize our production capacity. So the investments that we've made over the last couple of years in China, in South Korea, in Mexico, which are still strong markets, we are really benefiting from the investments that we've made where we've localized resin production or waterborne coatings as examples. So we're benefiting there as well from I would call some of these strategic capital expenditures of the last couple of years and that's driving very good performance in our Industrial Coatings segment even though, overall, growth rates are moderate.
Abhiram Rajendran - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Got it. And then a quick follow-up on the Spraylat acquisition. How should we think about the margins of the addition versus your Industrial Coatings segment margins, and then how should we think about potential incremental earnings looking out to 2013?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, we would hope certainly the business today that we acquired does not have -- that it is a positive in terms of earnings and cash flow. But margins, return on sales are not at our overall average for our Industrial Coatings segment. So we feel with -- it will be an accretive acquisition in 2013. We expect to close by the end of 2012. So we are looking for accretion in 2013, but I would say we probably need 18 months or so to get the full benefit and to see those margins being comparable to what we have in our Industrial Coatings segment.
Abhiram Rajendran - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, got it. And then last quick one, if I may. In the optical parts, so there's several moving parts in the business in the fourth quarter, including the year-ago flooding effect, some continued inventory management and maybe some new product pipeline fill. I guess after the last few quarters of decline in this business, can we expect some growth on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter?
Charles E. Bunch: What we're going to see in the fourth quarter is, I would say, a modest growth in our Optical business. If we -- when we looked at our retail sales out the door, this is not our direct sales to customers but the sales of Transitions at the retail level, they were still positive in the third quarter at, let's call it, lower single-digit growth. So we did have at-market growth for Transitions. There was, as we discussed in our note, inventory management and destocking on the part of our customers. We think that this will be the quarter with the largest impact from that, but I'm not sure that it is entirely finished because there's still inventory of our current generation product that's out there and we'll start to see it -- towards the end of this quarter and certainly in the first quarter of next year some -- the start of shipments for our Generation VII product.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch, representing Wells Fargo Securities.
Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I wanted to follow up on the whole auto thing because I think even more importantly than what the market's doing is you seem to be articulating a viewpoint that you're gaining a fair amount of market share here. And Chuck, I heard you talk about localization of production. You mentioned technology. I was wondering what exactly are you attributing that market share gains to? And to some extent, could it be a side benefit, if you will, of the DuPont performance coatings sales process that may have driven a bit more into your arms?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, I would attribute our performance to, I think, good work over the last few years. We do have a new-generation electrocoat product, which has been very well received by our customers. We've been well positioned with what our -- some of our new waterborne basecoats and some of our new, more efficient total coatings systems. So in China, as an example, we're doing very well. We've been fortunate to be positioned with some of the strongest customers here in North America. And so I would attribute it to good strong execution. Obviously, the earnings are benefiting from the localization and some of the restructuring. And I think some of these decisions, especially on the OEM side, are longer-term, but I think we've been consistent. We’ve -- this is our core business. We're committed to it and I think our customers are giving us, I think, a strong sense of commitment in return. So we feel pretty good about our current position and certainly the results speak for themselves. They've been great.
Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay, great. And if I could just ask on the restructuring charge -- I'm sorry, the savings that you're seeing. You indicated that in the back half of the year, you anticipate $40 million to $50 million in savings, the back half. Half of the back half of the year is over with the third quarter. So where do you think we -- where do you think you stand with respect to expectations on Q4? And I believe we're going to get the whole $140 million by the -- or at least beyond that run rate by the middle of next year. Where do you stand on that? Could there be upside? Could there be downside, et cetera? If you could just expand upon that, that'd be great.
David B. Navikas: Yes, Frank, this is Dave. I would tell you that in the third quarter, we got maybe 35% to 40% of the back-half savings, so the rest we would be anticipating coming in the fourth quarter.
Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: All right. And then...
David B. Navikas: And then in next year, the $70 million to $80 million that we had indicated previously, we're still good with that forecast. Our actions are generally on schedule. The things that we need to get done are being accomplished and we expect to see those savings next year as well.
Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: All right, terrific. So you're talking about a delta of about $15 million sequentially, Q3 to Q4, in terms of savings strictly due to that. And then given the aforementioned comments with respect to raw materials versus selling prices, it looks like we're going to see 10 in a row.
David B. Navikas: We hope. We don't give guidance, Frank.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Don Carson, representing Susquehanna Financial.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Chuck, a couple of questions on U.S. architectural. You talked about the overall volumes being up, but particular strength in your company stores and is that reflecting a shift away from big boxes back to the contractor channel in general, or is that just dynamics related to your own sort of store location areas?
Charles E. Bunch: I would say the third quarter sales growth was moderate and I would say the volumes were up slightly, lower single digits. Again, stronger in the stores -- in our stores network. But I would say that we did see on what I would call the national account or big box side, they're watching inventories closely. We don't know exactly how that is -- that's going to be positioned here for the fourth quarter or into 2013. But certainly, our customers there are mindful of inventory conditions. We've been tracking -- or it's a little less clear on the out-the-door sales. We get a – we have a better visibility with our own stores. But I would say there seems to be some inventory management going on with some of our customers there. But I would say that at this point, the volume trends are positive and we would say that for all the channels, but it may be more on the inventory side that you're seeing the differences.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. And speaking of inventory, we've seen about a $0.13 per pound price drop in TiO2. Are you -- admittedly, it's a slow seasonal quarter for architectural paint, but are you drawing down your TiO2 inventories further in anticipation of more price reductions next year? And then a just clarification on your TiO2 reduction comment of 4% to 6%. Is that total TiO2 or is that high-quality chloride product and part of what you're doing is substituting the low-grade Chinese TiO2 into your formulation?
Charles E. Bunch: No, that’s -- that would be total TiO2. That's not substitution of sulfate for chloride. That's not in that calculation. And as I mentioned in an earlier question, we still are going to hit at least the low end of that target, which is a 4% productivity improvement in the usage for our overall TiO2, our formulations. And on the inventory destocking, we probably had more inventory relative to sales early in the year. But as we've seen supply loosen up and the pricing stabilized, we've worked down that inventory. So I would say now heading into this fourth quarter and into 2013, we have what I would call normal inventory levels for TiO2, so we're not trying to further destock from this level.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bob Koort, representing Goldman Sachs.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Chuck, I seem to recall in the past on Transition rollouts, they were more staggered globally. Is that the same plan this time, or is the whole world moving over to the next-gen at the same time?
Charles E. Bunch: No, we're -- this is still going to be staggered. We're beginning in Europe. And so this one is not a -- your recollection is correct in that we're still going to stage this regionally beginning in Europe in the first quarter.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And then if you could hazard a guess, what do you think in Asia or in China, specifically, industrial growth has been in the last 6 months and what might it be the next 6 months?
Charles E. Bunch: Industrial growth, I would -- if you look at the overall GDP, they're talking about 7% to 8%, probably in industrial production, 5% or so. And I would say that we're looking for a similar trend going forward. There was concern as we looked at some of the end-use markets in the second quarter and even beginning in the third quarter. But here at the end of the third quarter, September, was a more solid quarter for us in China. And we think that some of the end-use markets like consumer electronics haven't been that strong. Most of the construction businesses in China have been weaker than those overall averages. But in general, I would say we saw some pretty solid growth, automotive, automotive parts, automotive aftermarket, those were all still quite solid. And so we think that as you go through this transition at the government level and they get their decisions made on -- the economic stimulus packages and the fact that they've had a little less inflation over some of these latest measuring periods. So that's going to give them, we think, a little more flexibility. So I would say that we're looking for a more of the same. So solid growth, but certainly not at the levels that we saw in 2010 or 2011.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi, representing Robert W. Baird.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: On the Architectural Coatings-EMEA business, volumes down 3% during the quarter, quite a bit of an improvement versus 2Q and I guess in line with your guidance, but your competitor in the Netherlands has really shown the reverse of that profile with 3Q much worse, particularly in Europe and it doesn't look like the trend line has changed into the fourth quarter as well. Can you help us understand the deviation? Is it a geographic distribution or something else?
Charles E. Bunch: I'm not sure. I know Akzo was reporting this morning and we have our board meeting today, so I haven't been able to analyze completely what they have been saying. There is, obviously, a difference in terms of -- in growth rates or growth declines, depending on what regions that you are -- you're competing in. And we have very little exposure in the South, which has been -- that Mediterranean region has been the weakest. So that I would say that their profile, a little bit different than ours and maybe that is what's causing their volume declines to be greater than ours, although, certainly, you know, we feel good about the results in light of the volume declines, but there is not a lot of strength in the European market anywhere at this time and -- but certainly in the South, much weaker.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then just going on -- back to the European auto production on Slide 8 where you have the forecast by region, et cetera, I think it was down 11% forecasted for the fourth quarter, basically in line with the trend line for 3Q on a year-over-year basis. But over the last couple of months, we have seen weakness out of Germany in auto sales, et cetera, that seems to be spreading across Europe. Chuck, just based on your conversations with customers, how should we think about the first part of 2013?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, right now, we're starting to come up here. You saw it in the third quarter, this third quarter, and again, now in the fourth quarter of 2012, we're starting to come up against some weaker comparables from 2011. And the market started weakening in the third quarter of last year. Fourth quarter was quite weak. So kind of the year-over-year comparisons, although still negative, are somewhat easier to make. The Germans were quite strong, at least the export-oriented German luxury manufacturers were still strong through the first quarter. We haven't seen -- they haven't fallen off a cliff. The biggest weakness we've seen is in kind of that middle market, the middle market manufacturers. We haven't seen a turnaround yet. I think the beginning of 2013 is going to be -- in the first half looks to be still weak. We're going to see if there are government actions that could try to, let's say, try to make that trend a little less negative. But we're hunkered down and you've seen our results. And despite the weakness there, we continue to do well and we're hunkered down. We're watching everything, every expense, every discretionary item. We're hitting on all the restructuring targets that -- and automotive was a big part of that. So we're aware of the conditions and we're responding appropriately.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander, representing Jefferies.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Two quick questions. First, could you give an update on your thinking about alternative TiO2 supplies in the sense of either encouraging technology distribution in China or the projects up in Canada with, I believe, it was Argex?
Charles E. Bunch: Yes, we're continuing to pursue these initiatives and opportunities. As I mentioned earlier, the TiO2 pricing, although moderating now, is still up year-over-year if you look at the third quarter of 2011 and not insignificantly. So that I think that the trends would say that we're not going to back off our initiatives either on productivity or expanding our supply base or in trying to use our history in manufacturing in the TiO2 business to enable current TiO2 suppliers to improve their capabilities. We're not backing off any of those initiatives because we've had a few months of stable to slightly lower pricing. So those are continuing and we feel that they will help to position ourselves and hopefully the entire industry to be in a better supply-demand balance going forward.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: And secondly, could you give a update on whether you're seeing any share shifts in the BPA -- due to the shift to BPA-free coatings inside cans? And if share is starting to shift, do you have a sense for what timeframe it might be material?
Charles E. Bunch: Right now, all of the – the major suppliers are all trying to qualify BPA-free coatings. We have seen a lot of activity over the last 18 months, more so than -- we've been preparing for this for quite some time. You're starting to see approvals for PPG and some of the other participants in the market. We've seen a little bit of a slowdown in terms of our end-use customer schedules for when they would convert to BPA-free coatings. And I think we're trying to gauge right now when they would be ready to really launch more products into the metal packaging industries. So right now, I would say, looks like everyone's -- is ready from a coatings supplier standpoint, lots of approvals. We're saying we're ready to go. And we're waiting now for confirmation on when these products will actually be used in the marketplace.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas, representing JPMorgan.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: When I look at your Industrial Coatings operating income year-over-year, it's up a little bit more than $50 million, and that's what your sales are up. So can you sort of help us understand why the incremental margins are so high and why the incremental performance is so much better in Industrial Coatings than it is in any of your other divisions?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, Jeff, it's good to hear from you. I think what I indicated in some of my earlier comments, one, we have focused many of our restructuring actions on our Industrial Coatings businesses, so you're seeing the benefit there of our restructuring actions and higher volumes as we've seen them in most of the regions. So our efficiency is improved. But I think if you recall these comments around localization, the single biggest capital spending project last year for PPG was the construction of an electrical resin facility in Zhangjiagang, China. This benefited our Industrial Coatings businesses, both automotive and industrial and potentially packaging. And this really localized resin supply in China. That helps us to not only meet local demand, but avoid tariffs, duties, freight, all of these incidental costs. The plant came up beautifully. It's been performing. We're at capacity there. And so we are seeing more, let's say, financial benefits from that investment. So that's in the emerging markets. And I think I mentioned that we've done similar things in South Korea, in Mexico. So we have, I think, positioned our assets in these emerging regions where we've been driving a lot of our growth over the last few years to now be self-sufficient at a lower cost basis. And it's timely because the U.S. business, as an example, was supporting many of these other emerging regions. So now as the U.S. and North American growth are coming back, our assets here are able to support those businesses and we're more efficient and lower cost in supporting the businesses around the world. So if you take the effects of restructuring, localization and productivity and overall expense controls, that's why you're seeing such a nice improvement in terms of earnings going to the bottom line from the sales growth.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then lastly, is it fair to say that going into the fourth quarter, there's no business of yours that will have higher sequential pricing?
Charles E. Bunch: From the third quarter?
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: From the third to the fourth.
David B. Navikas: There's pockets, Jeff, where we try to get different price at different times of the year. I would say, in general, you're accurate. I wouldn't say exclusively that's correct.
Charles E. Bunch: Yes, overall, I would say that probably is the case.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ivan Marcuse, representing KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Most of them have been answered. I just have a couple quick ones. In the -- once the commodity business is divested, where would you expect your tax rate to be going forward in 2013?
David B. Navikas: The tax rate is going to be in the range of, I would say, 23% to 24%.
Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Got you. And then if raw materials sort of stay where they're at today and then going forward into next year, would your raw material total basket be still up on pricing year-over-year or would it be -- or would it essentially be flat to down?
David B. Navikas: 2013 if they stay where they at -- where they were at, it'd be close to flat, Ivan. Little bit up to close to flat. And we did see inflation through the first 6 months of this year.
Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Great. And then the last question I have is you've mentioned that, and I understand there's a big seasonality in your European business, but then you also called out Europe being a little bit worse. Is there going to be a significant impact on the year-over-year or on profitability, or would you still sort of eke out a little bit of a profit like you typically do, like a 1% or 2% type of margin?
David B. Navikas: Ivan, if you look at the Dura business, it is more seasonal than the architectural business because of the product array. So we'll see -- that part of our earnings growth in that segment year-to-date have been this business. So we'll see some of that benefit. Some of that benefit will be absent in the fourth quarter. So we'll see a more decided seasonality impact.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn, representing Longbow Research.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: A couple of questions and a lot of them have been answered. Just revisiting the Optical for a second. After you get the customers drawing down the inventory and then relaunching with the Generation VII, what's your sense of the sort of the underlying market strength, particularly since you're starting out in Europe where customers don't have as much a disposable income as they did a couple of years ago. Should we expect sort of a single-digit ramp-up or something stronger as you get through at least the first couple of quarters of channel sales?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, I would say because of the European market is positive but not strong, that certainly a single-digit ramp-up is probably a more appropriate growth rate.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. And then on the other part of the specialty part of the Optical and Specialty, can you just talk a little bit about these other businesses, the silanes businesses, the stuff that's going into the tire market and the automotive market? What's going on there in terms of demand and pricing and any raw material pressures or lack thereof?
Charles E. Bunch: The silicas business continues to perform well. We've seen this year a few regional differences by quarter. So Europe, as we've discussed, in the automotive market has been weaker. North America, a little bit better. But you have in the tire business probably more of an aftermarket. That's bigger than the OEM side. So we've seen some differences. But overall, we're -- there's a solid growth. There's not a lot of raw material pressure in the precipitated silica business. This is sand, soda ash, natural gas. And we have been adding capacity both in Europe and here in North America. And so we think the business is well positioned in North America. The OEM business has a lot of momentum. The aftermarket, not quite as strong with miles driven or not quite as strong and the aftermarket has probably not been quite as robust here. But we think the business is well positioned and poised for continuation of moderate growth if you look at the combination of Europe and North America.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: No raw material shocks for us to watch out for; everything is more or less stable in that area.
David B. Navikas: No raw material shocks. We think natural gas is going to be stable. And if you look at the value that -- the biggest value that precipitated silicas bring to the automotive tires is improved rolling resistance and therefore improved mileage or miles per gallon for the vehicles. And that's still a longer-term trend. So we think that's very positive with the CAFE standards for the automotive industry here or similar trends in Europe. So we think there is solid fundamentals for continued improvement in the precipitated silica business. And right now, no, we don't see any raw material spikes that would threaten kind of the short-term margins on the business.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: Very good. And switching gears to your Performance Coatings business, particularly the 2 sort of longer-cycle businesses that you have there, the aerospace business and the marine business. From the marine business point of view, I know you have an order book to look forward to and we knew that this year was not going to be a good year for that business. As you look out into 2013 and maybe even the second half of 2013, is there sort of a light at the end of the tunnel there? Are we starting to see some positive comps coming our way?
Charles E. Bunch: Certainly, in the first half of 2013, we think the current trends of these double-digit declines in marine OEM builds are going to continue. In the second half of 2013, we start to see some moderation of that possibly. We are trying to fill the order book with what I would say would be more of the drilling ships and the natural resource vessels that are under construction in South Korea more than the kind of the ocean-going containerships that are lower value in China. That's been the more effective sector. And we're trying to push for what we would call the protective side of protective and marine coatings. And we think with all the infrastructure spend that's going on around the world, the protective markets offer some good opportunities to kind of mitigate the negatives that we see continuing for a while here in the marine business.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: Very good. And then final question on aerospace, can you give us an idea of what your lead times are relative to aircraft deliverables? Obviously, 787 is now starting to ramp up production and I know you have a big component of -- per plane of your products going in there from window coatings to structural adhesive and coatings on the body. The carbon market has, from what I remember, about an 18-month lead time, but obviously yours is a little bit more downstream and close to the completion. So are we looking at 6 to 9 months or sort of a 12-month lead time for your product sales going into the Airbus and Boeing-type markets?
Charles E. Bunch: Right now, we feel that certainly, over the next 12 months, there's good visibility in terms of commercial aviation completion or construction. It's a longer lead item. They don't like to change production schedules in the short term. So I would say that we still feel good on the commercial aviation side, with Boeing and Airbus, that the current trends will continue into 2013. If you start to see declines in the order book going forward, you tend to see them making adjustments later in the cycle. So I would say that if there is more weakness, you may see that in 2014, but certainly not in the near term. There has been -- in some of the other markets, they tend to react maybe a little more quickly, in some cases, general or business aviation. But we, again, haven't seen any strong trends there. Military, which is not a big component of -- or market segment for us, has been already declining. But both the OEM and the aftermarket on the commercial side have stayed what we would say is strong.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar, representing Citi.
Daniel Jester - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: This is Dan Jester sitting in for P.J. Just one quick question. Now that we’re seeing better construction and housing data, how should we be thinking about new U.S. paint store openings over the next couple of years?
Charles E. Bunch: For us, we feel that going forward, our store count will increase. So we are now trying to do our planning for 2013 and beyond. And I think as you know, we've stabilized over the last couple of years in this recessionary environment at around 400 stores. So I would -- I view that as now a floor for us, and you will see a higher store count going forward as we continue to see improvement. And I think that the improvement that we've seen so far has been certainly encouraging, but I wouldn't say it's going to be a rocket ride up here. I think this year, certainly the first quarter, was very strong with some of the improved weather. It stayed positive and I think that trend will continue, although we don't see the growth rates just gearing up and really requiring an acceleration of our plans for store openings at this point.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer, representing Barclays.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division: When I read through the press release on your use of cash, the sentence, primary means of deploying our strong cash is going to acquisitions, which seems like a more aggressive way you guys are talking about acquisitions now than 3 or 4 years ago. 1, is that true? And then 2, if it is, what are you seeing differently now that you would be more aggressive with acquisitions? Are more people raising their hand and willing to sell businesses today? Have multiples come down? Can you kind of just talk about what you're seeing in the acquisition front and maybe across your businesses where you see more fertile ground?
Charles E. Bunch: Duffy, well, if you go back 3 or 4 years ago, you're talking about 2009 or end of 2008 and we were just starting the Great Recession and we were focused on pretty much hunkering down and getting through this. So since that time, probably as we've come out in 2010 and beyond, we've been more optimistic about and also talking more about acquisitions. We haven't made as many. We did in the fourth quarter of 2010, we bought Bairun in China. We closed on 2 earlier this year, Dyrup and Colpisa. And now we've announced this acquisition at Spraylat. So I would say that -- I think we've been talking about it probably for last 1.5 years or so. We haven't executed as many, but I think now is what you're seeing, and especially in some parts of the world where the growth rates aren't as attractive as they were a few years ago and I think probably in many regions whether it was in the emerging regions where, for a while, they thought these growth rates were going to continue for years or maybe in Europe where they thought the growth declines would be short term and then they'd return to growth, and I think you can tell from our comments that it's a more challenging environment. If you're well positioned, you can do well as we're doing. But I think there's a little more realism on the part of many of these coatings companies or maybe companies more broadly that this reality may be with us for another year or 2 where it's not so easy to be successful. And I think we've seen a little more realism in terms of what their expectations are on the selling prices. So I think you're seeing better dialogue between potential buyers and sellers.
Operator: We have time for one final question. Your question comes from the line of Kevin Hovar (sic) [Hocevar], representing Northcoast Research.
Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research: I wanted to -- with the split option, I know -- I think the initial goal was to get 12.5 million to 13 million share count reduction using the split option. And based on the current dynamics of the market, the stock price of PPG and Georgia Gulf, is that still the goal? Is that still the -- attainable or would it might be a little less than that?
David B. Navikas: Yes, I would say that it's a little bit less than that. I would put more in the 11 million, 11.5 million share kind of range. But obviously, that's a function of the price of the 2 companies' stock.
Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research: Sure. And then just another real quick one. What -- in terms of the packaging coatings, it sounds like the emerging markets was strong, developed markets were a little weak, could you put -- give a little bit color on that and what's driving the emerging markets strength? And then also, how does that – how does kind of the volume compare to the developed markets?
David B. Navikas: Yes, Kevin, I'll add some color there. The growth in the emerging markets really is driven on a move to more recyclables in those markets away from items such as glass containers, which are heavy in energy intensity and there's a shift again to those recyclable cans and a growing middle class in those emerging markets, so the consumer requirements and consumer desires for more recyclables. If you look at our delta in terms of volume, we were up very solidly in the emerging markets, Latin America and Asia, and we were down modestly in U.S. and Europe, similar to Q2.
Vincent J. Morales: I would like to conclude the call. Thank you for everybody's time, and we appreciate your interest in PPG. And also if there's any further questions, please get in contact with Investor Relations. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q2 2012 PPG Industries Earnings Conference Call. My name is Andrew, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Vincent J. Morales: Thank you, and good afternoon, everybody. Again, my name is Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations for PPG Industries. Welcome to PPG's second quarter 2012 financial teleconference. Joining me on the call today from PPG are Chuck Bunch, our Chairman and CEO; Dave Navikas, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer; and Michael McGarry, Senior Vice President, Commodity Chemicals. Our comments relate to the financial information released on Thursday, July 19, 2012. As a reminder, based on our modified quarterly earnings call process, about 1 hour ago, we posted the detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on our Investor Center at www.ppg.com. Those slides are also available on the webcast site for this call. We do not read those prepared remarks during the call. However, during the call, Chuck will share his perspective on the results for the quarter, and then we will move directly to Q&A. Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements, reflecting the company's current view about future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. The presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided, in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC. Now let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch.
Charles E. Bunch: Thank you, Vince, and welcome, everyone. PPG continued our earnings growth momentum during the second quarter, posting our highest earnings in the company's history. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.36 per share were up 11% versus last year and marked the eighth consecutive quarterly record for the company. We delivered these record results despite weakened European economic conditions and sizable negative impacts from weakening foreign currencies in Europe and Latin America. Continued organic growth in our coatings businesses in the United States and emerging regions, along with the favorable impact from our recent acquisitions, offset the reduced European sales results. As a result, aggregate coatings segment earnings grew by more than 10% versus last year. The primary region for volume improvement was the United States, where our volume growth was fairly consistent with the first quarter. Sales growth in local currencies continued in the emerging regions, but was mixed by end-use market. Our effective cash deployment over the past year, including the performance of our recent acquisitions and a reduction of 5 million shares from our diluted share count, also contributed to the improved earnings. To summarize our performance, PPG's record results in the quarter and over the past 2 years continue to provide measurable evidence of the strength of our global business portfolio, strong cash generation and the effective deployment of our cash. Looking ahead, we expect European demand to remain challenging. As such, we are aggressively implementing our previously announced restructuring programs, focused primarily in this region. Targeted savings from these programs is between $40 million and $50 million in the second half of this year. We expect growth in North America and Asia to continue but to remain inconsistent by end-use market. Finally, we absorbed similar coatings input cost inflation in the first and second quarters, but we expect to offset the negative effects of this inflation in the second half of the year with selectively higher pricing and lower commodity input costs. That concludes our prepared remarks. Now operator, would you please give instructions and open the phone lines for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Chuck, I was wondering if you could amplify your thoughts on raw material cost trends in the back half of the year. Is it the case that the rate of inflation is decelerating or do you expect costs to actually come down sequentially in the back half? And then related to that, Chuck, if you could provide an update on the TiO2 pigment cost trends, please.
Charles E. Bunch: Okay, Kevin. What we expect in the second half of this year -- we have absorbed a higher raw material cost in the first and second quarters. In the second half, we expect this trend to now stabilize with some declines in raw material prices by region and by commodity that will offset some of the price increases that we received in raw materials in the first half. In regards to the TiO2 pricing, we continue to see more favorable supply-demand environment and depending on the region, some changes in pricing for TiO2. In Asia, as we've commented in earlier calls, we have actually seen price declines in Asia in TiO2 pricing. That's versus not only the first half but also, in 2011. In Europe, we're seeing now not only stability, but some declines in the second half that we're anticipating even though we may be paying more in the second half of this year than we paid in the second half of 2011. And in North America, we're seeing stability around price trends going forward into the second half, albeit we are paying more today than we were in the second half of 2011, and prices for the second half in North America are still under discussion with our suppliers.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And then as a second question, Chuck, if I may, with regard to cash deployment, you've indicated that repurchases will be on hold, pending completion of the Georgia Gulf deal. Can you speak though to M&A and what prospects you would see for acquisitions perhaps in the Architectural or Industrial Coatings arenas around the world?
Charles E. Bunch: We're still pursuing acquisitions in all regions and in all segments of the business, and we think that it is a more fertile opportunity for us in these changing economic conditions. But at this point, we do not have any imminent announcements for transactions. But we are continuing to pursue those across the board in our businesses.
Operator: And the next question comes from Bob Koort, Goldman Sachs.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Chuck, I think you talked a little bit about some uneven growth rates in Asia. I'm wondering if you can give us a little more granularity around that. What businesses there are still growing nicely, and which ones maybe have fallen off a bit from where you entered the year?
Charles E. Bunch: If you look at Asia, but in particular, our biggest market there is China. The strongest growth rates that we have seen have been in the automotive OEM coatings. Auto refinish has also been strong, as has packaging coatings. We're still seeing growth in our Industrial Coatings segment, although there are some end-use markets in Industrial Coatings that are not as strong. And in particular, I think the weakness that we have seen in China, but we've also seen it elsewhere in Asia. The Construction markets have slowed down there, and so both in Architectural but also, Industrial or other segments -- subsegments that are tied to the construction businesses, we have seen a slowdown in volume in China and more broadly, in Asia.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then on Transitions, you talked a little bit about some customer inventory management. Is that something that can have a duration of more than a couple of months? And does this speak to general anxiety about consumer spend? Or where do you attribute the weakness there to?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, we think, in part, there was a strong restocking trend in the first quarter that we talked about that really boosted our results there, and I think what you're seeing now in the second quarter, and it could have a little longer duration, is a weakness in some of the consumer markets, especially in Europe, especially in markets in southern Europe. And I think some caution on the part of our customers in Optical business to carry inventories with their concern over economic conditions over the next few quarters.
Operator: The next question comes from John McNulty, Credit Suisse.
John P. McNulty - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just a couple of quick ones. On the Architectural EMEA business, the earnings were up nicely despite currency maybe impacting them in kind of the difficult economic environment. So I guess, I'm wondering how much, if any, of this improvement was tied to some of the early cost cuts and if some of the -- and the restructuring. And if some of that's coming in early, do you have any expectations for having a better number than what you originally were looking for the, for the year-end?
Charles E. Bunch: John, I would say that we are working on the restructuring program that we identified or outlined in the first quarter. I would say that we're on pace there. But by and large, the benefits that we're seeing here in the second quarter in our European architectural businesses are, I think, coming from good operations, no volume growth but slightly improved pricing and good operating discipline. We are starting to see the impact of some of the cost reduction, and that will be a little larger in the second half and into next year. But I would say it's too early, certainly, in the second quarter to have that really be measurable.
John P. McNulty - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, great. And then just as a follow-up, on the auto coatings side in the U.S., it sounded like you had a lot of strength. How much of that is tied to just the overall industry? And how much of it, would you say, if any, is tied to to maybe share gains that you're starting to see?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, the North American volume gains for our automotive coatings business have been very strong, and I would say that you have 2 effects. You have the market recovery. So we're seeing and we have been seeing this year 15% to 20% volume improvements in North America in overall builds. Some of that being helped by a year-earlier comparisons. Remember, we had the effect of the Japanese earthquake and tsunami that really restricted some of the production in the second quarter of last year. But I would say that our strength in North America has been across the board. Yes, a recovery with the Japanese-based OEM manufacturers, but clearly we're seeing, I think, a general improvement in the overall automotive OEM market, the tsunami recovery. And actually something that we've talked about in a number of earlier calls where you're seeing more production moved here to North America, both on the part of the Japanese-based manufacturers, but the Koreans are now producing here. And we've seen solid growth in North American manufacturing for the European-based companies, such as the Germans, the BMWs, Mercedes, VW, they're all here now and ramping up production. So I think you have the effect -- all 3 of those effects. I would say our improvement is more tied to those improvements. We think we'll get share, certainly our share and probably more as we move through this cycle. But I think it is the overall improvement in the business that we're benefiting from in North America.
Operator: And the next question we have comes from David Begleiter, Deutsche Bank. .
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Chuck, just in terms of U.S. demand trends, have you seen any weakening in the last few weeks or towards the end of June?
Charles E. Bunch: In our businesses?
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Yes, generally speaking, given some of the macro headlines and any sense the U.S. is beginning to slow down at all.
Charles E. Bunch: Our view is that, obviously, the first quarter had strong growth year-over-year. We talked about some of the seasonality, the better weather, the caution at the end of last year around inventories. So the first quarter was stronger in terms of overall volume growth. But we've seen volume growth here in North America in the second quarter, and I would say we haven't seen any pullback or correction over the last few weeks or the last month. I would say it's been pretty steady growth even if it's not at the same level that we saw in a year-over-year basis in the first quarter.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And just on TiO2, Chuck, you talk about your target reduced consumption by 5% this year and 10% next year. Are you on track? Are you ahead of schedule?
Charles E. Bunch: We said we identified for this year a 4% to 6% reduction in TiO2 consumption on a similar-volume basis. Over the first half, we were a little over 2% in terms of our more efficient use of TiO2 in our formulation, so we're on track. We're still focused on this area even if the supply-demand and pricing environment has stabilized, but we're still focused. And these projects are still delivering, so so we think that we'll be within that range in terms of overall improvement in productivity for our use of TiO2.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And last, Chuck -- last thing, Chuck, given TiO2 prices rolling over in Europe and Asia, I would think you would be asking your guys to push for price decreases in the U.S. Are you and do you expect U.S. prices to be down for TiO2 in the back half of the year versus the first half of the year?
Charles E. Bunch: We're -- as I said in my earlier comments, we're in discussion right now on TiO2 pricing here in North America with our suppliers. And at this point, I don't have any further commentary on the outcomes. They're still undecided.
Operator: And the next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas, JPMorgan.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Are there any constraints on share repurchase following Reverse Morris Trust transaction? And if there are, do they last for, I don't know, 2 years? Or are there no constraints?
David B. Navikas: Jeff, this is Dave Navikas. So there are -- Jeff, because of the need that we have to maintain the tax-free status of the transaction and the distribution of at least 50.1% of the newly merged company stock to PPG shareholders, there are some complicated tax rules for dealing with equity transactions during the 2-year period leading up to the closing of this transaction. And given that we're starting at the 50.5% threshold, we've got a very small cushion for any of our shares to be taken out of this calculation. So on advice of counsel because of that close margin, we won't be engaging any share repurchase from now until we close the transaction, either late this year or in the first quarter of next.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I don't think I perfectly followed you. So over the next 2-year period, does this transaction mean that you're really inhibited in what you can repurchase further?
David B. Navikas: There's only an issue, Jeff, between now and when the transaction closes. Once the transaction closes, we'll be able to continue to buy back stock at that time.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then, lastly, your sales were flat to down year-over-year. And your cost of sales was also flat to down, and your volumes overall didn't grow. So does that mean that there really wasn't much raw material inflation that you felt in the quarter since your cost of goods sold went down a little bit?
Charles E. Bunch: The other complicating factor in there, Jeff, is currency conversion, and cost of sales went down in part because the weakened currencies abroad, and we brought those back. And then that affected, basically, every line of the income statement. We did still see, on an inflationary perspective, somewhere in the 3% to 5% inflation range versus last year, which was fairly consistent with the first quarter for coatings raw material input costs.
Operator: And the next question we have comes from Don Carson, Susquehanna Financial.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Chuck, in the first quarter, your strong U.S. architectural volumes suggested that you were taking share, particularly at the big box, and I know you had some tough comps given the ramp-up of Olympic ONE. But is that a correct observation that you're taking share at the big box? And maybe you can just comment on trends in your other architectural distribution channels in the U.S.
Charles E. Bunch: Well, Don, as you said, in the second quarter of last year, we did have a pipeline fill for Olympic ONE. So I would say that it is difficult for us to determine exactly what the share position has been for us in the channels. We haven't seen all of the reports out. I would say that as we looked -- this year, we've had a very strong exterior stain year. We've seen volume recovery in every channel. So we're up mid-single digits in terms of volume in our channels -- all our channels, if you exclude this pipeline fill for Olympic ONE in -- at Lowe's or in the national account channel. So we feel we had good volume growth. We haven't seen everything out there yet in terms of our customers and some of our competitors. So I would say it's too early for us to comment, but we have seen a nice volume improvement. The business is, I think, showing some good momentum, and we're pleased with the pace of our performance here in the architectural business.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: And how big a part has Olympic ONE been? What percentage would that be of your Lowe's business now? And do you think, in this market, there's still a shift down in price point and that, that's benefiting an Olympic ONE given how it's positioned versus some of those competitors?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, we wouldn't comment on how volume is going between price points or we just feel that Olympic ONE has been well received by both our direct customers and the consumers. They're seeing the value in the product and the way it's been positioned and marketed. We think it's a great can of paint, and so I would say that, right now, it's clearly a strong positive for our business.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: And then just switching to one of your smaller businesses, on packaging. We've heard of some weakness in Europe. If you can just comment how that business is there. And are you gaining share in your North American packaging business given some of the new products you've come out with?
Charles E. Bunch: For us, again, share, on a short-term basis, is harder for us to track in this business. I would say that if you looked at regionally for packaging coatings, the strongest region, by far, is the Asian, so our Asian business, in particular China. Europe overall has not been as strong. We haven't seen volume growth there. But again, one of the big development opportunities is the BPA non-intend or BPA-free coatings in our food and beverage can businesses. And here, we think we're making excellent progress in terms of our products and their qualification, and I think this will be an opportunity for us to grow the packaging coatings space here in the near term and in the years to come because we're really providing a solution now for our customers because many of the consumers are more concerned about BPA in food and beverage coatings. And we are providing a real technological solution, which is one of the hallmarks for PPG and one of the things that we feel we do best.
Operator: The next question comes from Duffy Fischer of Barclays.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division: If you look at your 3 coatings businesses, can you talk about the relative differences in those businesses, what we should expect kind of from incremental margins on a new dollar of volume-based sales growth?
David B. Navikas: Let me try to answer that, Duffy. The businesses that have, right now, the heavier fixed costs load would be the architectural businesses. They have store network. That's a bigger fixed cost as opposed to some of our industrial businesses. Obviously, some of our best businesses, which, we have said historically, have been aerospace, auto refinish, they're higher margins. We continue to argue for a solid incremental margin on that additional sales dollar. So those would be the -- right now, those would be the businesses with the most opportunity for incremental sales.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then could you comment on the strength or weakness you're seeing in the European auto industry in particular?
Charles E. Bunch: For us, European OEM production was the weakest end-use market or region. It's both the weakest end-use market in Europe, but it was also the weakest region and really the biggest decline. So we were looking at mid- to high-single digit declines in automotive production in Europe. That wasn't in every country or among every producer, and clearly, the Germans had showed more strength than the non-German-based producers. We had some markets in addition to Germany that were stronger, Russia and the U.K. But we saw weakness in what we would call southern Europe, and the majority of the declines in the OEM build rates were among, let's call them, the mid-tier or the middle market producers in Europe. But certainly, it was a very weak market in the first and second quarter of this year.
David B. Navikas: If I could just append to that even though Europe was weak for auto OEM, globally, that was one of our strongest markets for the company because of the strong growth in the U.S. and strong growth that Chuck mentioned in Asia. So those 2 have more than offset the European weakness.
Operator: The next question we have comes from Nils Wallin, CLSA.
Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: First is really on Europe. It seems like volumes are -- volume declines are accelerating, and I'm curious to know whether you believe, in the third or fourth quarter, we will see that acceleration continue or you -- we're kind of at the bottom here, and it will abate. But what are you seeing so far this quarter? And what is your expectation for the remainder of the year in terms of European volumes?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, we saw, in many of our markets, including the auto OEM market that we just talked about, that the second quarter was as weak or actually slightly weaker than the first quarter. The third quarter is a little more problematic, especially at this time of the summer, to determine what are the actual trends. You got vacation season in July and August, can be difficult months to gauge volume trends. So right now, we feel it's too early to say. But we do not feel, with the information that we have, that these volume declines are accelerating from what we saw in a fairly weak second quarter. But we'll be in a better position to follow these trends in Europe as we get into September and October. But we have not seen any change for the worse in this early part of the third quarter.
Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: Okay. In terms of volumes in your architectural business, I don't -- I apologize if I missed this. Did you say that across all the channels it was relatively the same in North America, your company stores, your independent distributors and in the third -- and in the big box? Is that true?
Charles E. Bunch: Yes, we said that, with the exception of the pipeline fill we had last year with the new product introduction in the national accounts channel. But excluding that, volume trends were similar across the channels.
Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: Okay. Now kind of more of a strategic question. Obviously, this nice acquisition that you announced today, when you look at the reconstituted PPG in the future, how do you -- one of the areas relative to some of your competitors seems to be as much of a greater exposure on the retail side in architectural. Is there any interest in bulking that up once the transaction is complete or at least, changing the mix there?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, I should clarify what we announced was actually more of a divestiture than an acquisition.
Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: Sorry, sorry. My apologies.
Charles E. Bunch: In terms of our channel strategy, if you look on a global basis, we have a strong store and dealer network in Europe. And there with volume trends -- we're committed to the channel. It's been as you've seen. Our results have been, we think, very good under what have been difficult economic circumstances, so good performance there. So we're still committed to the -- to that store channel and our relationships with the independent dealers here in North America. We are participating in all 3 channels. We think that there are customers that are best served in each one of these channels that we participate in and that we would -- we expect to continue our participation and growth in all 3 channels here in North America.
Operator: And that's the end of today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call...
Vincent J. Morales: No, no, Andrew. We still have time.
Operator: The next question that we have is from Ghansham Panjabi of Robert W. Baird.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Going back to the architectural EMEA business, did the wet weather in Europe have any impact on your business, any measurable impact? I know it's affected other industries, and apparently, it has been a very, very wet summer across northern Europe. Just curious if it had any impact on you.
Charles E. Bunch: Well, we think that the weather in Europe has kind of been the reverse of what we've experienced here with all this hot, dry weather here. They have had a colder, rainier summer. We think it may have had some impact, although, arguably, we've probably seen more of an impact in Europe from just the challenging economic conditions. But weather may have been a factor in terms of some of the volume weakness that we have. But it's really difficult for us to determine that.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then, in your prepared comments, you cited the Argentinian import policy change by the government there. Can you just expand on that and how it impacted your auto refinish business?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, in Argentina, for those of you who haven't followed it, they have changed a number of their economic policies. And in fact, if you're bringing in material into Argentina now, you need an import license. Previously, you had that southern cone of South America that was operating as a free-trade zone, so in our businesses, we had focused many of our production and manufacturing activities in Brazil. And we were, let's call it, a net importer into Argentina across many of our businesses. We have one manufacturing facility in Argentina, but by and large, in refinish in particular, we were a net importer. And with these new government policies, then you had to apply for an import license, so that had the effect in the second quarter of really slowing things down because you had to take the additional step then of asking for, in effect, permission to bring in goods from outside of Argentina, whether it was Brazil or outside of South America. And that delay in approvals, especially with the rapid change of the policy, I think a lot of manufacturers were caught offguard. And I think the government was initially not prepared to handle the volume of requests. So we saw, in the second quarter, our volumes declined, especially in those businesses like refinish, where we were bringing in most of the material from outside the country. What has happened subsequently here in July, over the last few weeks, I think the government is catching up now with a lot of the permitting requests. We are getting approvals now, and we see that balancing out over the coming quarters. So we think that it will not have the same negative impact that we certainly saw in the second quarter for our Argentinian business.
Operator: And the next question comes from Ivan Marcuse, KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Most of them have been answered, and you may have already answered this one. But in the second quarter, what were your raw materials up on a year-over-year basis?
Charles E. Bunch: Ivan, they were up between 3% and 5%, which, again, was a trend that we saw in the first quarter.
Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay. Great, and then if you -- looking at your China business. I know it's relatively small on the architectural side. Did you see -- is construction over there getting worse or is it about the same as it has been, on a sequential basis, the last couple of quarters? Or has there been any sort of maybe signs that it is getting better?
Charles E. Bunch: We have not seen -- again, we're a very small player through a joint venture in Italy. You're saying, that was China or...
Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Yes, China, sorry.
Charles E. Bunch: In China, we are, again, a small player. We saw things stabilize for our business, but because we are relatively small, I'm not sure that you can take trends in our business to be an overall indicator. But what we see generally is that there's not any significant improvement in volumes in the construction industry in China. In fact, as we look at some of our other industrial businesses that touch on construction markets, those have been -- they continued weak in the second quarter, and we did not see any improvement as we went through that first half of the year.
Operator: And the next question we have comes from John Roberts, Buckingham Research.
John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: The glass segment had up 4% volume, and since fiberglass was down, was the flat glass business up upper-single digits?
Charles E. Bunch: The flat glass business did improve over the second quarter of last year. We saw, however, weakness in our fiberglass business now in 2 specific areas. Remember, this is more of a global business than our flat glass business, which is North American commercial construction-related. So we had some weakness in fiberglass in our European region. And also, we participate in a joint venture in Asia that is primarily a printed circuit board into the electronics market, and there, we did see weakness in the electronics or consumer electronics space that affected our fiberglass business, in addition to that European weakness.
John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Still on that, Chuck, I'm just thinking if flat glass had volume that was up, let's say, upper-single digits perhaps, and natural gas costs were down a lot year-over-year for the flat glass business, I would have thought it would have had more earnings leverage to offset the fiberglass weakness.
Michael H. McGarry: John, the volumes -- just to finish the volume story. Part of those volume gains for our flat glass business were selling into solar, and that is a jagged type of -- still a jagged type of end market. There's inventory fleshed out and then picked up. We did have more solar sales, part of that's a little bit of market share gain. The gas cost was fairly comparable sequentially, down a little bit year-over-year, but they're not as big as a gas consumer as our commodity chemical businesses. So that would have -- did have a positive impact, but not as, much as you would expect from like our chemical business.
Operator: The next question we have is from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.
Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: This is Rob Walker on for Laurence. I guess, first, have you seen any indication of slowing in auto OEM globally? And just broadly, can you talk to your level of confidence in growth in that end market?
Charles E. Bunch: We're still seeing growth globally. Again, we were up some 5% globally. We still see good strength here in North America, as we've been talking about. Japan is rebounding from the tsunami effects of the second quarter of last year. China, although it's not the double-digit growth that we've seen over the last few years, we're up 5% to 7%, and sales have been solid in China. Europe is the weakest link, and we've talked about mid- to higher-single digit declines in the European automotive production. And I would -- we haven't seen any deterioration from what's arguably a fairly weak level. And in South America, the volumes have weakened there as well. That's not the biggest market. And if you look at Mexico, they're up significantly because they're more tied to the North American production, and they're really participating in this plus-20% kind of growth that we've seen. So I would say, overall, we still feel good about the automotive OEM market, with the caveat that we've got a couple of weak regions.
Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Great. And then just broadly to the segment Industrial Coatings, can you talk about your visibility there in terms of how are customers feeling about their backlogs?
Charles E. Bunch: I would say, in general, Industrial Coatings is a fairly broad-based reporting segment in terms of end-use markets. So automotive, we've -- automotive parts that are part of industrial, they will track what we've just talked about in OEM production. We see some recovery in kind of the industrial production indicators and some markets, though tied to construction outside of North America. So all the construction-related markets for -- including coil and extrusion for industrial in North America, are pretty solid, but outside, fairly weak. Consumer electronics has been weaker in Asia. That's primarily an Asian story. So it is a mix with, again, more of a regional flavor, with things in North America working pretty well to varying degrees across the different end-use markets. And outside of North America then, you get into just about everything, and Europe is weaker to some degree. Asia, it's mixed by end-use market, so it just depends. And industrial probably touches almost every end-use market that we participate in. And so I would say those trends are confirmed for that business, as well as overall for the company.
Operator: And the next question we have comes from Dmitry Silversteyn from Longbow Research.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: A couple of questions in the businesses that haven't been talked about yet. You mentioned in your press release and in your prepared remarks about inventory correction in the Optical segment causing that division to deliver not quite a strong result as it has in the past. Has that inventory correction run its base? And what do you expect for growth on the other side of the correction? Usually, when people correct inventories, it's because they overestimated the growth rate of their markets and now they're trying to rightsize it. Should we expect growth in the other side of the correction, assuming it's over this quarter, to be somewhat slower than it's been in the recent quarters?
Charles E. Bunch: Yes, if we -- I would just clarify the question in the terms that we didn't see as much sales growth in that business unit. But from an overall profitability and margin performance, they had a very strong second quarter in Optical and Specialty Materials. In the Optical business, again, some weaker volume and currency trends were working against the business in markets like Europe or even in South America. We think that there is caution in the customer base, again, focused on Europe and some of the other markets where the volume trends probably are going to -- the growth, we think, will be lower as we try to get through some of these more challenging economic conditions in some of the regions. So I would say that we may continue to have, for a short period of time, maybe another quarter or so of reduced growth expectations. But we still feel good about the business and the other segments in specialty materials, including our precipitated silica business. The optical materials business and the Teslin inorganic printing material business had very solid quarters as well, so they were key contributors to the overall performance of that segment.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: That's helpful, Chuck. Thanks a lot for the color. Second question. On the automotive market -- automotive OEM market, particularly in the U.S., there have been some headlines about manufacturers perhaps taking shorter downtimes this summer or in some cases, may be eliminating them in certain plants to keep up with what you've described and what, certainly, we're seeing as a pretty robust demand in the market. Will that result in sort of diminished seasonality that you would typically see between the second and third quarter? Or is kind of the European deceleration going to overwhelm that and we should expect sort of a normal seasonality second to third quarter?
Charles E. Bunch: I think we should -- you should expect normal seasonality. I think you described it correctly. We're going to see more strength here in North America, probably a little less strength, just from a seasonal standpoint not from an overall market standpoint, in Europe because of the vacation shutdowns. But I don't think you're going to see a marked deviation in trend in the business.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: Fair enough. And then finally, in your comments about the Industrial Coatings business -- or actually, I think it was about coatings in general for the second half of the year. You talked about seeing some raw material environment being more benign, and then, you referred to selective price increases. I'm just trying to understand, given that demand is not particularly robust with the exception of 1 or 2 channels and geographies and you don't experience the raw material pressure, what would be the justification and how do you think customers will receive price increase announcement in the second half of the year? Or is this going to be just in markets that are roaring and the supply is tight and you just have sort of the power to raise prices?
Charles E. Bunch: I would think that my remarks are more tied to price increases that have -- that reflect the earlier raw material inflation that we experienced. And again, as we've commented, our prices today, here in the third quarter, our raw material prices, are higher on average than they were at the beginning of the year. So that there is still -- we see some stability there, and we are still trying to recapture, in some markets or regions, the raw material price increases that we experienced in 2011 or before and also, in the first half of this year.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: But is it reasonable to expect these price actions to be successful given that your customers are looking at the propylene price chart same as you are and the TiO2 price chart same as you are and maybe dragging their feet for another month and then maybe they don't have to pay those prices?
David B. Navikas: I think, Dmitry, that's -- we certainly call them selective pricing, and again, there -- I think, you described it right. There are markets where we feel there is opportunity to recapture some of this inflation.
Operator: The next question comes from Gregg Goodnight, UBS.
Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Your currency headwind in the second quarter, how is it looking thus far in third quarter? What is your expectation?
David B. Navikas: Well, part of the headwind in the second quarter, Gregg, really reflects the strength of the euro and Latin American currencies last year, so the comparable period was extremely difficult. And then I think the euro -- our euro conversion rate in the second quarter of 2011 was 1.44. I think we ended this quarter like 1.28. The conversion in the third quarter came down last year, so the comparable period is not as difficult. That will lessen, if all things were equal, that will lessen the impact on a year-over-year basis. Sequentially, it's fairly comparable.
Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Got you. Second question, I saw where you recently got approval from Indian authorities to expand this -- your JV, Asian Paints Limited. Could you give us some help in terms of sizing the opportunity and what would be the timing of an expansion if you decided to move forward with it?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, we've had a long-term joint venture with Asian Paints. It's called Asian PPG. That is primarily participates in the automotive OEM refinish and selected segments of the industrial business. The announcement with Asian Paints is now we're going to have 2 joint ventures: one a majority-owned or controlled venture of PPG, primarily with the automotive refinish and industrial segment; and another a majority-owned and controlled Asian Paints joint venture that'll be more in the distribution of protective and marine coatings and light industrial. But what you're going to see different is we will begin this quarter, the third quarter, in consolidating the sales from the newly formed or majority-owned PPG joint venture. It won't have a material effect on the earnings because we've been reporting 50% of the earnings from the joint ventures in previous years. But you'll see some growth in our sales line now as we consolidate those sales of the new joint venture.
Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. Last question, if I could. True to your word on investor day, you have stepped up your activity in licensing TiO2 technology with Argex in Canada and your recent Chinese announcement. My question to you is, what do you think the likelihood is that a new grassroots TiO2 plant based on your technology will happen in the next 5 years? Not naming any specific potential licensors, but what do you think the probability of that is?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, I'd hate to speculate on what the probability is. But obviously, in the case of Argex, we think they have a viable technology. We've been working with them to validate the technology, and it's used on our products. They have already access to the mining rights for these materials. I would say given a longer time frame, like 5 years, I would say that is -- I would give that a higher level of probability. In the case of potential Chinese TiO2 producers, I would say that these plants require a lot of investment, a lot of technology. But I would -- as we've seen over -- the growth in China across a broad array of industrial commodities and we participated in what we think is a tremendous growth story in China in industrial markets. But I would not discount the probability of -- what are now a number of TiO2 producers in China, albeit primarily in the sulfate grades. But I would not discount their ability to develop the chloride technology in the coming years and get into production within the kind of time frame that you're talking.
Operator: The next question we have comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citi.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Chuck, what kind of same-store sales growth are you seeing in your stores business? And how does that compare -- how does that volume growth compare with your big boxes business?
Charles E. Bunch: Yes, as I said earlier, P.J., our volume growth in the second quarter was comparable across all 3 channels. We've talked about mid-single digit kind of growth with the exception of the, let's call it, the pipeline fill last year in the second quarter in the national accounts channel. So I would say we saw a fairly consistent growth across the channels here in North America.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: So you're not seeing the contractor business growing faster than the DIY business currently?
Charles E. Bunch: I would say as I -- again, we saw comparable volume growth across the channels. It's still -- I would say I haven't seen a significant deviation in the trends. Obviously, we go through -- we go to market in all the end-use markets and the channels, and so I would say it's been fairly consistent.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, fair enough. And lastly, how much Chinese TiO2 are you currently buying?
Michael H. McGarry: Our total spend, P.J., it's high-single and low-double digit percentages.
Operator: The next question comes from Saul Ludwig, North Coast Research.
Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research: Which segments will benefit from the $40 million to $50 million in cost savings in the second half of the year?
David B. Navikas: Saul, we had, in our last quarterly call, a schedule that broke that out for the second half of 2012 and also, for all of 2013. We didn't replicate that here, but it's available on our website.
Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research: Okay. Looking at this sequentially, normally, you have lower earnings in your third quarter than you do in the second quarter, and that's been a pattern for most years. And you've talked about the sort of volume trends that you're expecting in the third quarter to be comparable to what you've seen in the second quarter. But when we look toward the back end of the year, it sounds like a, you're going to have the cost savings in the back end of the year that you didn't really have in the second quarter, and that your price-to-raws relationship, because of stability in pricing and in -- stability in raws and increases in pricing, should be somewhat more favorable in the back end of the year than it was in the first half of the year. So would that suggest that the seasonal pattern of earnings might be a little different, maybe more favorable than what it has been on a historical basis?
David B. Navikas: So the most pronounced impact on earnings is just the volume movements among the quarters. So if we're not buying product, regardless of the price as it is, we're not getting the benefit. So I agree with the general theory that you outlined that we should see some more favorable economics in the second half versus the first half, but we still need volume to apply to those economics.
Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research: Okay, and then finally, Dyrup contributed about $60 million in revenue in the quarter, and we are earlier discussing about the improvement in earnings in EMEA in the second quarter. Did Dyrup contribute $6 million, $7 million, $8 million of EBIT in the quarter that obviously you didn't have a year ago?
David B. Navikas: Yes, that's a good round number, so...
Operator: The next question comes from Bill Young, Chemspeak.
William Young: Many of the economists and certainly, the data collectors have indicated that the housing market seems to have bottomed here in the U.S. and starts are improving. And I realize an awful lot of the architectural goes into existing units. But are there any signs on the horizon from your perspective that would be consistent with these observations? Or how long would it take for PPG to see the impact?
Charles E. Bunch: I'm not sure I understand exactly, Bill. But as you referenced, the repair and the remodeling part of the paint market in architectural is, by far, the biggest share of the overall volume, and I think you are seeing some improvements there. The indicators have been, by and large, positive, and they've stayed that way most of the year. I think initially, in the first quarter, we said, "Well, there is some weather impact," but most of the indicators have still stayed positive. The biggest indicator is sales of existing homes or existing home resales. Those have been positive, so I think that is a good indicator for the architectural market here. We've seen some year-over-year growth in new home construction, albeit on some very low levels, so that's a positive. Commercial construction, on the new OE -- let's call it new commercial construction, it's been a weaker market. We participate in that, both on the coatings side and also, in our flat glass business. So that has not really ramped up as much, but overall commercial construction, we think, is going to lag a little bit this improvement in residential. So I would agree with you, most of the signs are favorable. And it should be a good news for us, and that's the way we feel, although it's not -- this is not a straight line up for us. And I think we're going to see slow but steady improvement over the next few years in this business.
Operator: And I would now like to turn the call back over to Chuck Bunch for closing remarks.
Vincent J. Morales: Andrew, I'm doing the closing remarks. I just want to thank everybody for their time in the call today. And if you'll need further questions, please contact me in Investor Relations. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2012 PPG Industries Earnings Conference Call. My name is Jasmine, and I'll be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's conference to Mr. Vince Morales, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may proceed.
Vincent J. Morales: Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. This is Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations for PPG Industries. Welcome to PPG's first quarter 2012 financial teleconference. Joining me on the call today from PPG are Chuck Bunch, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Dave Navikas, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Our comments relate to the financial information released on Thursday, April 19, 2012. As a reminder, based on our modified quarterly earnings call process, approximately 1 hour ago, we posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on our Investor Center at ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call. We do not read those prepared remarks during this call. During the call, Chuck will share his perspectives on the company's results for the quarter, and then we will move directly to Q&A. Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements, reflecting the company's current view about future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC. And now let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch.
Charles E. Bunch: Thank you, Vince, and welcome, everyone. PPG continued our earnings growth momentum during the first quarter, posting record adjusted earnings of $1.81 per share. This marks the seventh consecutive quarterly record for the company. This 30% increase in our earnings was driven by strengthening sales in the combined Coatings and Optical and Specialty Materials segments, with earnings growth in these segments averaging about 25% versus the prior year. In addition, the Commodity Chemicals segment matched its excellent 2011 performance. Excluding acquisition and currency impacts, Coatings and Optical sales improved by more than $200 million versus the prior year's first quarter. The primary region of improvement was the United States, where all of our Coatings businesses delivered higher volumes. Growth continued in the emerging regions, but was at lower rates and with less consistency throughout the quarter than in the recent past. European activity levels were weaker in most end-use markets.  Our improved sales also reflected higher selling prices in each Coatings business as we continued efforts to recover inflation absorbed during 2011 and additional, more modest inflation in the first quarter. Our strong focus on cost management also continued during the quarter. And operating margins in all segments, except Glass, improved versus the prior year, aided by our sales performance and our continued operational discipline. Lastly, we purchased 1 million shares of stock during the quarter and ended the quarter with about $1 billion of cash, well above our historical first quarter cash balance. In summary, our record results in the quarter and excellent performance over the past 2 years reflect the benefits from our broad and global business portfolio and effective deployment of cash. Looking ahead, we have further growth opportunities as demand in some of our larger end-use markets such as Automotive OEM and Architectural Coatings continues to recover. The second quarter is typically our best quarter seasonally, and we expect year-over-year growth in the United States to be similar with the first quarter, coupled with lower regional natural gas input costs.  We anticipate that growth in emerging regions will accelerate, supported by higher Chinese industrial activity. We expect European demand to remain muted. However, we remain proactive in dealing with these mixed market conditions and are implementing restructuring actions focused mainly in Europe with anticipated cost savings of $0.20 to $0.25 per share in the second half of this year and larger cost savings in 2013. Finally, we already have a strong cash position. And based on the seasonality of our businesses, our strongest cash generation quarters are later in the year. We expect to continue to deploy cash throughout the year with earnings accretion remaining the focus.  That concludes our prepared remarks. Now operator, would you please give instructions and open the phone lines for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of John McNulty with Credit Suisse.
John P. McNulty - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: A quick question. With regard to TiO2, I know you started the year expecting to be able to reduce your consumption by 4% to 6%, and I guess I'd love an update as to where you stand on that right now. And then as a follow-up, you had mentioned -- I guess you had put out a release recently with a venture with Argex, and was curious as to -- I know in the release, you said it was going to be limited capital intensity for you guys. But can you -- if you can quantify that a bit, that would be great.
Charles E. Bunch: Well, the first question on the metrics around our targets for reducing TiO2 consumption on a per-gallon basis, we said 4% to 6% for this year. If you looked at the first quarter, John, we're between 1% and 2%, so on target with what we're looking for, for a full year reduction or productivity improvement in TiO2 usage. But we're where we said we would be, we obviously have focus teams, a big commitment from our R&D organization and all of our Coatings businesses to accomplish this. So we're on track there. And yes, we did make a announcement with our collaboration with Argex. At this point, we have not made a decision on what will be the full extent of our participation with them. And that could include, among other things, an investment on our part. But we're working closely with them now as they continue to advance the opportunity that they see in TiO2 production.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities.
Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Chuck, you made the comment that you're expecting the pace of business in the U.S. to show a similar type of increase in the second quarter as it did in the first quarter. And I guess there's a fair amount of speculation out there that the first quarter saw a material benefit from the warm weather, and that was one of the reasons why you saw Architectural Coatings being as strong as it was. And so then that begs the question, was there some move from the second quarter into the first quarter because of weather? But your commentary that -- about pace of growth would indicate that you don't think so. Can you elaborate on that?
Charles E. Bunch: We still feel optimistic, Frank, about the recovery here in the United States. It's a little bit uneven, and I think we continue to receive a collection of data points and not all of which are kind of straight positive. But if you look at some of our markets, our important end-use markets like Aerospace or Automotive OEM, these markets have been very strong here in the U.S., and they continue that way. And I'm looking for a very good year in automotive production here in North America in 2012. On the architectural side, I think we've been open about the fact that we had a very mild winter; that, that probably contributed to some of the improvement that we saw in our architectural or construction-related businesses. I would say that I think there is underlying strength, though, in the market. We've seen the new home, on average, continue to tick-up over 10% from arguably a very low level. The home improvement area, apartments and some of those other end-use markets for Architectural Coatings continue to show, I would say, improvement. So I don't think it's just weather-related. We've argued here about what we think the pull-forward may have been. Most of our guys say, "Hey, it's probably about 2/3 or 3/4 of actual improvement, and the rest is weather." I can tell you as we look at the first few weeks of April, weather has continued to be pretty good, and I said we -- I would say we're off to a good start, continuing what I talked about in Automotive or Aerospace or Heavy-Duty Equipment, but also I think we're seeing more, more consistent strength on the architectural side.
Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: All right. Terrific. And you mentioned in the release the fact that you've got lower natural gas pricing, that it's been helping parts of the company. I was wondering if there was a way that you might be able to quantify what your expectations are there in terms of this gift of lower natural gas pricing.
Charles E. Bunch: This has been the gift that keeps on giving. Normally, we say with our usage that $1 of natural gas cost will benefit us anywhere from $50 million to $60 million, and we have as now burned off all of the hedges after the first quarter of this year where we had a very low couple of percent of the older hedges, the $6 to $8. We're virtually unhedged now, and so we have full exposure here in our North American Commodity Chemicals and Glass businesses to these lower natural gas costs. Now we're not sure that they can continue indefinitely at this. I saw it touching $1.90 today -- an MCF. So those are -- that's a great value for us. It's still in the kind of the middle of the month. So it doesn't -- it's not the final numbers for May or June, but certainly these are attractive, and that's kind of upside earnings potential we see. Vince, did you want to add something?
Vincent J. Morales: Yes, just for everybody's benchmark number, we paid just over $3 in the first quarter all-in for our natural gas. And again, as Chuck mentioned, that included a couple percent of some aged hedges, and those hedges have burned off so that we're naked at this point.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Actually, just a follow-on on that natural gas, Chuck. With the $1.90, have you thought of hedging again or you've had your fill of hedging given the recent history?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, we still talk a lot about it, Don. But yes, we've had mixed results in hedging, certainly. And over the last 3 years, since all the shale gas came on the market, we've -- I think, we've been burned a little bit. Earlier in the last decade, we did benefit when the hedges or the prices ran up. So I think we think about it. We look at the forward months. So it makes some sense in the next 3 to 6 months if you wanted to lock it in. But you do start paying a premium if you go out 4 quarters or more. And I think to some extent, the market still seems to be -- have a high supply-demand ratio. There's talk of the inventories are full. There's not any more storage. But we did benefit, obviously, this year from a very mild winter. So we didn't get much of a drawdown. So I think as we get through the second into the third quarter, we're going to probably talk about this some more and look at it. Now, in the past, as you remember, Don, you'd also try to hedge around the hurricane season because most of that natural gas production came out of the Gulf. That's not the case as much now, but we still have to be sensitive around the winter usage, I think. And longer term, I think you will probably see some gas getting shut in. So we're not sure $1.90 is a going-forward assumption for the next 3 to 5 years. So I think your question is a good one, and we're going to continue to look at it.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: On Chlor-alkali pricing, do you think it's peaked here? We've seen a few initiatives on the caustic side. They haven't gotten much traction. I guess even the chlorine one didn't. And rates are below where they were a year ago with soft Chlorovinyls exports. Is your sense that the next move in ECU pricing could be down here?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, right now, yes, we're seeing the same things that you just talked about. There have been pricing initiatives on both the caustic and chlorine here over the last month up, but I would say that here in the near term, it looks like pricing is stable. We are attempting to get the increases that have been announced, but I would say going into the second quarter here, we're looking at stable prices. If you look at what's going to be happening later this year, I think there are a few variables. So right now, it's a little too early in the year to say how the second half's going to shape up. But certainly, I would say your comments are accurate around stable pricing here in the second quarter, although, I think ourselves and maybe other producers are trying to get some of those increased.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just wanted to talk a little bit about Optical. Obviously, you had a meaningful disruption in Thailand in 4Q. You've bounced back strongly from that episode. How much, if any, restocking benefit was there in the first quarter? And maybe you can elaborate on your expectations for how the year could play out there from a penetration -- market penetration and a profit perspective, please?
Charles E. Bunch: For us, I think there was at the end of 2011, both with some of the uncertainty in the market in the fourth quarter, as well as some of the Thailand situation, I think there was some de-stocking. So in the first quarter of this year, we have benefited, I think, from a return to more normal inventory levels. But as we look especially here in the U.S. and the European markets where we get better and faster market data, I would say there's been a nice recovery. I think the consumer is healthier here in the U.S. market, which is our strongest for Transitions. But we saw good at-market sales improvement in Transitions, and that was encouraging. So it certainly wasn't a case of just a restocking after the fourth quarter. We think that the second quarter is going to be another good one. We think that the consumer is getting healthier here in the U.S., and we're continuing to support the brand and the business at the same level. So we're looking for a good year this year.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then on Coatings, Chuck, you touched upon TiO2 briefly earlier. But if I look at the broader basket of raw materials for Coatings, what would be your updated outlook for cost inflation in 2012 versus 2011?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, we've been saying that we've thought that we may see raw material, full basket, 3% to 5% kind of increases, and that would have included TiO2. And we came in for the year or we finished 2011, I would say, with a little more muted inflation on some of the organic raw materials. We've seen those -- some of those prices move up here in the first quarter on the spot side. Now you look at propylene pricing, ethylene, which we're not quite as sensitive to in some of our Coatings businesses, but you've seen some of the run-up in those costs here in the first quarter on the spot side. So that could lead to some pressure, continuing pressure on the organic side as we go through the year. Right now, I don't know that it's going to get any worse than I told you in terms of our forecast in the second quarter. But the second half, we'll have to see. You see oil prices coming down, but you do have some spot costs here on some of these building block chemicals moving up at least in this market. Now Asia and China, a little different story. Some of these raw materials have come down, including TiO2 in China is lower now. So I think we have -- you're going to have to look at the broad geographic picture here, and you're going to have some puts and takes. But certainly, Asia, with the growth rates a little lower than they have been and prices coming down, Europe with some of the weakness there, you're not seeing as much pressure. So it just depends on the geographic area, but I think overall, the percentages that I gave you are probably in the range.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Now housing starts were pulled forward in 1Q. So 6 months later when that house is ready, you're going to need to paint again, right? So if that's the case, what are your expectations for spring and summer selling season for this year? And last year, Chuck, you've gained some share with your Olympic ONE paint. I mean, do you expect that momentum to continue this year?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, I would say what we're seeing, I think, we're all concerned that maybe how much did we pull-forward into the first quarter. I've described here in the U.S., anyway, that we're off to a decent start here in April. And I'm optimistic that we're going to see some continuing strength here in the housing market in the -- and in the home improvement area as well. I think that's been a pretty consistent story for us. As far as our share gains, we had good volume across all channels and combined with the pricing. We felt pretty good about all of the markets here in the U.S. Commercial construction, at least, the new commercial construction, hasn't been as strong, and that's been impacting our flat glass business. But we feel pretty good through the balance of the year. The new home construction is not the biggest part of the residential market, as you know. It's more tied to home improvement, anyway, both at the DIY and at the contractor level. So we feel pretty good about that, and we're pleased with what we've been able to accomplish with the new product introductions. You mentioned Olympic ONE. We had a very nice start for that product launch in 2011 in the middle of the year. That success appears to be carrying through here in 2012. So we're quite pleased with that introduction and where we are generally in the market and in the channels.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Chuck, you've been vocal about potentially selling the remaining part of your Glass business. Now I was wondering if you have -- if you were to expect any actions in 2012.
Charles E. Bunch: Well, if you look at the first quarter results, they were, I think, for us disappointing in the Glass segment. We have -- I felt, at least, in the case of the flat glass business, here have been fairly patient with the recovery that we're looking for eventually in the broader construction markets here in the U.S. and in the commercial construction market. So absent a really attractive offer that creates value, we're going to be patient and wait for what we think is good timing. We don't need the cash right now, but we are open to listen to opportunities if there are really interested parties in the business -- in either of the businesses in our Glass segment.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Chuck, I guess -- the Street normally has a pretty high regard for your ability to keep costs in check. I was a little surprised by the scale of your restructuring savings that you've lined out. Can you give us a little more granularity on where those savings specifically come from? And then also the high component that's in the SigmaKalon Architectural business, I would have thought that was pretty scrubbed down. So maybe a little bit more detail there as well?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, I would say, Bob, that as we've looked at all our businesses in Europe, especially with the weakening conditions -- if you were to go back in time a few years, we bought SigmaKalon at the beginning of 2008. And at that time, the markets were, I would say, relatively stronger at that time, and certainly stronger than what we were seeing in the U.S. They didn't go into the recession as deeply. They didn't have some of the banking problems. And so we felt that we were well-positioned. Yes, we did take some costs out in those restructuring announcements at the -- in the third quarter of '08 or the beginning of '09. They weren't necessarily focused on SigmaKalon. Now with what we see overall in the market, I would say that that's -- there's an opportunity there in that business, in particular, to consolidate further in many of the functional areas to integrate further with the rest of our PPG businesses in Europe. And with the outlook in the market being as weak as it is, we thought it was better to move forward now and do the restructuring that we can do now in -- I wouldn't say in advance of the downturn because we're experiencing that now, but try to get our cost position even better to withstand and hopefully improve on the earnings that you're seeing in this weak market. But if things do deteriorate further, which we're not seeing -- I mean, we're seeing weakness, but we're not seeing a free fall in the businesses there. We felt that we would be better positioned going forward.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: For my follow-up, Chuck, you -- I'm just curious from a board level how you guys think about the stock price and valuation. I mean, it seems like your margins in paint are superior to your paint rivals, yet your multiple's substantially lower. And I recognize there's a commodity chemical element in there, but frankly, your multiples' not much higher than some of those commodity chemical guys. So do you think about this? Do you worry about this at all? And if you do, what's the path to rectifying the problem?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, I've talked about this over the years, and I think that was one of the goals as we focused the portfolio more over the last 4 or 5 years to make sure that we were getting recognized as a coatings and specialty company. And I think by and large, if you looked at the years after the SigmaKalon acquisition and the divestiture of half the Glass business that was at the -- in 2008, I thought that we made significant progress. And we're being, I think, viewed more closely aligned, let's say, to coatings and specialty peers. That gap's opened up a little bit again. We're aware of that. Is it the Commodity Chemicals? I'm not sure because the business is performing quite well. We do have more European exposure than some of our peers. So I would say that we're aware of it. We tried not to look at this thing on a short-term basis and react. I try to let the analyst community, you and your peers, kind of try to educate and guide the market in terms of our company and what we're doing, and -- but we're not unaware, I would say. And I think if it persists, we have opportunities, whether it's share buybacks or further focusing on the portfolio, which we are prepared to do. We've shown we will make acquisitions. We will pursue organic growth in Coatings and specialties, and we are willing to make divestitures when we feel that we have a good opportunity to create shareholder value. But I note -- duly noted, I'm not going to go on a value rant, Bob, but we're aware of the opportunity for us and maybe it's that we have to do a better job here for making sure people understand our company and what we're doing. And I think our performance has been very strong, and we're going to just try to keep delivering and hopefully, that will be recognized.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ivan Marcuse with KeyBanc.
Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: When you look at your architectural business and you compare your DIY to the stores -- to your stores, was either one of those groups stronger than the other? Significantly, that gives you some sort of optimism towards housing or just the construction markets in general? Or was it just -- were they equal, I guess, in their year-over-year growth?
Charles E. Bunch: I would say we had, as I mentioned earlier, we had good growth, both overall sales growth and volume growth in all 3 of the channels. That's the DIY, the -- our store network and our independent dealer channel. I would say DIY may have been slightly stronger. But it's hard for us to say this early in the season if that -- what was happening out the door versus some elements of de-stocking and the like. But I would say that foot traffic on all the stores and including the ones that I visit both on our own or our local Lowe's stores, foot traffic's been up consistently, and so we're encouraged that it's broader-based.
Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Great, and then on the acquisition front, I saw that your -- I mean, you know that your cash position is about as high as it's ever been in the first quarter and your share buybacks were lower at least on a year-over-year basis. So does this imply that you have some acquisitions that you expect to complete over the next 6 to 9 months? And if not, would you see a pretty substantial acceleration in your buyback?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, at this point, we are -- we're continuing to look at acquisitions as we historically have. I really can't comment if anything is imminent, but we continue to work the pipeline that we have. We've tried to remain a disciplined buyer and find the right valuations. And I would say obviously, as I have in the past, if we can't find those acquisitions with the cash that we have on the balance sheet, we would accelerate share buybacks through the course of the year. If you look last year, we were around $900 million in terms of share buybacks. We were certainly well below that rate in the first quarter, and so we have some dry powder if, in fact, acquisitions don't materialize. And our organic capital spending, we're not seeing anything out of the ordinary here. So I think we're prudently funding the businesses. Our biggest projects, which were 2 that we did in China last year, the Zhangjiagang resin plant plus the Tianjin automotive coatings and industrial coatings plant in China. Those were our biggest projects last year. They're -- the resin plant up and running, successful. So we think that it's -- we're going to have what I would call a modest organic capital spending profile this year. So we will have some flexibility if we can't find the acquisitions.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division: In Performance Coatings, 2 of the SBUs there, one auto refinish and the other marine. Marine, just because of what's happening in the boat business itself, was down. Can you kind of comment? Do you think we're at the trough as far as your inputs go into Marine with where shipbuilding is? And then in auto refinish, when your competitors was talking about auto refinish being a little bit weaker, are you seeing that as well? And are you seeing kind of any degradation, I guess, in the quality of that very good business?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, if you looked at the components of -- or the SBU components of the Performance Coatings, I would say for us, the biggest SBU in there, automotive refinish, had a good -- it had a solid first quarter. It wasn't a shoot-the-lights-out quarter. We had pretty good growth here in North America, actually, in Asia-Pacific also quite well. Europe, on the auto refinish side, was a little weaker. But overall, it was -- there was volume growth, and it was a fairly solid quarter, I would say. And on the protective and Marine side, Marine has been one of the businesses we've talked a lot about, especially the Chinese OEM marine building. The first quarter actually wasn't quite as weak as it had been here in the second half. Korea was a little better. The protective side for us here in North America and actually in Europe kind of took up some of the slack. So I would say the protective and marine market was okay. But the real strength in our Performance Coatings, Aerospace had a really excellent quarter, and they are doing very well across all their product lines. And with our inroads into -- with some of these new products in the commercial aviation and the strength of some of our customers like Boeing and Airbus, those guys are doing really well, and doing really well in terms of an operational excellence strategy. So we're really pleased with that business. And also the architectural business in North America is in that Performance Coatings segment. And as we've been describing, they had a very solid first quarter. So it's kind of -- it was kind of mixed, but I would say, overall, there weren't any really weak stories, but some certainly a little stronger than others.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Right. And then if you just think about kind of the seasonal or normal seasonal progression, January to February to March to April and you look across all your businesses and geographies, are there any that weren't following kind of the normal progression of getting better as each month gets towards summer?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, are you talking about architectural or more broadly?
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division: No, across the whole business. So across all your businesses, all your geographies, is there just anywhere that's not following kind of the seasonal pattern of improving as we go along into the summer?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, let's just talk about the regions. I think you've heard from my comments, we're optimistic on the North American market and the U.S. across all of the end-use markets. We're not seeing anything here in the U.S. that's particularly weak. Yes, some are stronger, like Aerospace or Automotive OEM, but Architectural's been good, and a lot of the other industrial activity is also good here. In Europe, there's a couple of markets that are a little better. Aerospace there is quite good. The packaging business has been good, but Europe is weaker in auto OEM, slightly weaker in auto refinish. And our volumes were down slightly in European architectural. They were offset with productivity and some pricing action. So overall, you saw our architectural earnings grow, and the margins were up slightly in kind of an off -- in this first quarter, which is the off season. So Europe was weaker with a couple of segments that weren't quite as bad. In China, a slightly different story. And usually, what we've seen, Duffy, is you come out of January and February, depending on where Chinese New Year falls, then you really see -- you things roar back in after Chinese New Year and in -- certainly in March. In China today, I would say the construction markets are weaker than they've been, so we didn't see that pick up. We thought that consumer electronics, which affects our -- both our fiberglass and our Industrial Coatings segment, those were weaker through the first quarter even given that Chinese New Year effect. Now there's some other segments that we think are okay, Packaging. Automotive refinish was a good business in China, and now we have a little more optimism on China here in the second quarter. We don't think that -- we think that the -- the Automotive OEM market is going to be a little better. We're not looking for a pick-up on the construction side. But we're starting to see some improvement also in consumer electronics. So it's a little out of the seasonal patterns over there. But we do have a leadership change in China later this year. Usually, the government has an impact on economic activity over there, whether it's trying to provide incentives around the infrastructure building or incentives for buying more fuel-efficient cars and the like. And we think we'll see some of that as we go through the year. They're trying to manage this inflationary pressure that they're feeling. You saw some of the movements on the currency as well. So I think China, we're going to continue to watch, but we didn't see anything that was really alarming in the first quarter. Out of season, yes. Second quarter, actually, we're thinking things are going to be a little better, although, the growth rates aren't as high as they have been in the last few years.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Chuck, a couple of things. First, on European architectural, do you expect volumes to be down year-over-year in Q2 and Q3? Or should it be more flattish?
Charles E. Bunch: I think the overall market will be down slightly. If you look at -- and then it's going to just depend on the country or the market. But right now, I would say there's probably more countries that are weaker than stronger. So you still have the problems in the Mediterranean countries, where we don't have a lot of participation. Eastern Europe, with the exception of Poland, has been weak. You see markets like France and Germany and the Benelux, which have held up relatively well, I would say, over the first quarter. And we're not seeing anything that's dramatically different as we go into the second quarter.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And just on your European restructuring for Coatings, are you walking away from any lower margin business in that process?
Charles E. Bunch: Lower margin business in any of our Coatings businesses or...
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Well, it's tied to the restructuring announcement.
Charles E. Bunch: No, we're not closing. There are no plant closings in Coatings in Europe with this restructuring. And so at this point, we are using this as productivity improvements. We're not trying to shed unprofitable business. If you remember last year, we did lose one customer; not to something that we did, but they -- this was in the U.K. where we had a large customer declare bankruptcy in the second quarter. So that volume went away, and we had a charge in the second quarter of last year, which we don't expect to repeat here in 2012.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And just lastly, Chuck, on this Argex collaboration, can you -- what percent of your U.S. TiO2 needs will it satisfy? And can you just frame a potential savings versus current market prices you might realize?
Charles E. Bunch: David, it's really too early in our collaboration. And they're in the early stages. They have ore -- access to ore supplies. They have the beginnings of a process, but I would say we're some time away from having a good assessment on what the volumes or what our relationship is going to be. You're probably, at this point, better asking those questions at the Argex team rather than us at this point.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And lastly, do you expect any impact on auto builds from this Nylon 12 disruption?
Charles E. Bunch: This is an emerging issue for us. We're just starting to talk about it this week with some of the publicity and with some of the things that the auto companies are doing. We had this experience last year around with the Japanese earthquake and tsunami. So it's -- and this is a -- it's not part of our supply chain. So we're not fully aware of all the impacts that this is going to have. I'm a little -- I think I'm learning about it as many of you are and I'm concerned. But at this point, we have no information on what the impact would be and we're following events closely.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Saul Ludwig with North Coast Research.
Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research: In the Coatings businesses, what was the net price versus raw material less spread in the first quarter? Did you get 100%? Where were you? And if you were short, how many dollars short were you? And then how do you see the price ROS ratio looking ahead?
Vincent J. Morales: Saul, this is Vince. For the first quarter, we were very close to parity. Price ROS, I'd tell you, we still absorbed a tremendous amount of inflation last year. And although we were parity for the company, some of our businesses still have some room in order to get pricing to match raw inflation. As we look ahead, as Chuck mentioned, we expect moderate inflation. We are getting select pricing in a few of our businesses in Q2. So I expect we'll again be close to parity, and in some businesses, offsetting some of that absorbed inflation from last year.
Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research: And so just to clarify what you said earlier about ROS, you think for the full year, ROS are going to be up by 3% to 5%?
Vincent J. Morales: That was our first half, and it's probably little too early to predict the second half at this point.
Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research: And then finally, on the cost savings that you're going to be achieving in Europe, will we see the lion's share of that flow into the EMEA segment?
Vincent J. Morales: Saul, in the presentation we had on our website today, it had a detail by segment for the second half of 2012, as well as all of 2013. So we broke our projected savings down by segment for you and your peers.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: Couple of questions; a lot of them have been answered. But on the Optical business and -- the Optical and Specialty, I should say, business, the strong margin you've delivered, I mean, it's been a strong margin business all along. But I think this is the first time you've seen north of 30% margin there. Was it largely a sort of a clawback from the fourth quarter on the Optical side? Or did you see better demand from automotive and better pricing in volumes on the silicate side? Can you take us through sort of what drove that business performance in the first quarter? And also what -- how should we be thinking about margins in that business, is 30% plus sustainable?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, we would say if you looked within the segment, the Optical business was stronger than precipitated silica business and the Teslin business. Precipitated silica and Teslin had very good quarters. But I would say that if you looked at the improvement, it was driven more by the recovery in the improvement in Optical. And those margins, I would say, have been fairly consistent over the last few years. We had a couple of quarters last year where they weren't quite as strong in Optical, but they were picked up by Silica. So I think in general, we're going to see margins around what we've talked about here. Going forward, I think I described that the second quarter looks solid for both segments. And so I would say we're looking to sustain margins around that 30% level over time, which -- and I think we've been fairly consistent these last few years.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: Okay, very good. To follow-up on the comment that you made on packaging Coatings business, I thought -- if I remember correctly, you said that it was a pretty strong business in the quarter. Can you update us on what's going on with Bisphenol-A-free coatings? I know there's been some rulings or postponement of rulings in the U.S. Is there a customer pull developing for this technology? Or customers are still holding off until they get the official ruling from the regulatory bodies?
Charles E. Bunch: I think what we're seeing -- we've been actively developing these products for a number of years. In fact, this is a trend that we've been preparing for, for some time. The regulatory environment is, I think, still favorable for changes, but I think what we're seeing now is more of a pull from the consumers. And the consumer packaged goods companies are more aware of this. I think they view it as an opportunity to engage with their consumers and drive value and positioning in the market. So some of the -- what I would say some of the inertia in supply chain or the value chain over the years has now, I think, changed. And you see the end users -- or in packaging parlance, the fillers -- actively engaged in the qualification and -- of these new BPA-free or BPA non-intend products. And I think it'll be an opportunity for all of the packaging coatings companies to provide solutions, create additional value that will have benefits for the consumer. So I think right now, this is actually a more favorable environment than over the years when we've been developing the products, but really didn't know when or where they were going to be introduced or qualified.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: Do you expect any sales this year from this product or not?
Charles E. Bunch: Oh, yes, we have sales right now. In fact, we had sales last year of these initial sales. Obviously, still modest, but we see that picking up. So this is -- these are not just future potentials. We're seeing it right now. And, in fact, many of the exporters in Asia or some of the food producers that bring food into the developed markets as well or -- whether it's in tuna fish or whatever, they're also actively working on programs here. So it is, I would say, it's more broad-based and yes, the sales are there right now.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Goodnight with UBS.
Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: The -- you mentioned titanium dioxide price increases have slowed down. Presumably, you meant the implementation of the increases, because the announcements sure have not slowed down. Could you comment on the -- how you see the trajectory of that market? I mean, we're hearing that January, February's a bit slow. March has picked up. I mean, Coating volumes are certainly up. Is -- are prices for TiO2 going to reaccelerate?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, that's hard for me to comment on, I think, fully. You'd -- I think the better source is the TiO2 producers. I think earlier in the Q&A, I commented that, obviously, the market here in North America is stronger, including the architectural market. But Europe, as I've been talking about, is actually a bigger TiO2 market and that's been weaker, and the volumes have been lower. And also in Asia and particularly in China, where the volumes are lower we have the Chinese -- albeit sulfate producers for TiO2, quite active. So I would say the pricing dynamics for TiO2 are -- appear to be different depending on the region of the world, and there have been a lot of announcements. We have said that there are probably some increases that we will have to accept in certain regions from certain suppliers. But we are actively in discussions now to try and minimize the impact to our company of what's going on in the TiO2 market.
Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. You mentioned your cash balance and your interest in deploying your cash in accretive efforts. I would assume you consider share buybacks sufficiently accretive at these prices that you would support that. Could you comment on the level of share buyback you're looking at this year? I mean, last year, $1 billion was effectively 100% of your free cash flow. Is it going to be to those sort of levels? Or do you see substantially lower share buyback this year?
David B. Navikas: Gregg, this is Dave Navikas. At the latter part of last year, in December, we had indicated an expectation of cash deployment for share buyback in 2012 in the range of $250 million to $500 million, and that was putting some focus on the acquisitions that we're hoping will develop. And we also indicated that we would see that may be more back-end loaded in 2012 than in the first part of the year. So we're still evaluating acquisition possibilities. And I would still say that, that $250 million to $500 million kind of figure is a good one relative to our expected share buyback activity.
Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay, great. That shapes it. Could you comment just generally on the environment for M&A? Are the evaluations reasonable? Are there sufficient targets out there that seem interesting enough to pursue?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, I would characterize it as there are -- if you look at the 2 acquisitions that we made in Coatings that we closed on in January, one in Europe and a smaller company in South America, now, I would say those are more typical of the opportunities that we see right now. I think there is still more consolidation to take place in Europe. So I think there's potentially more opportunities. But again, as we've been talking about on the call, growth rates are not as good. It's a very weak economic environment over there. So if you do make acquisitions in Europe, you're going to have to extract synergies and the like to justify the acquisition. So again, opportunities over there, but I think you have to be selective because the overall economic environment is so weak. In Asia, I think that things are changing a little bit. Growth rates are coming down overall for the economy and some of these end-use markets, but I'm not sure yet that the kind of the expectations of the companies that could be for sale have changed in view of the lower growth assumption. So I think there may be some give-and-take here if we're going to see completed acquisitions in Asia that we're all going to have to come together on what we think the expected future growth rates are going to be and what that's going to do in earnings. We haven't seen as much activity here in North America. There's not as many available properties, so it's difficult for to me to say. But I'd say Europe because it's weak and Asia because it has been strong, and the people may be a little -- still trying to get some of those values, are going to be where you see more activity.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.
Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: This is Rob Walker, on for Laurence. I guess, first -- most of my questions have been answered. But just a quick question on what's your expectations for the tax rate going forward?
David B. Navikas: Tax rate is held at 25% in the first quarter as we look out for the year. And I would say that, that continues to be a good value to use as you think about the remainder of 2012.
Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: And then just on your raw material expectation, I think you said 3% to 5% for the first half of the year year-over-year including TiO2. I mean, with TiO2 prices coming up pretty dramatically, depending on what you guys are seeing, it's somewhere in the range of 20%, 30% or so, I'd imagine -- and with a large portion of your ROS coming from TiO2. I guess what portion of -- what are you seeing falling year-over-year to get to that 3% to 5%?
Vincent J. Morales: Rob, just a quick -- because our architectural business is about 30% of our total Coatings business, architectural is where majority of our TiO2 is consumed. So a smaller profile there helps us relative to some of the peers. We've seen some of the organics come down year-over-year. Inflation, as Chuck mentioned earlier, has been spotty in those organics with oil. That would be the biggest decline.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA.
Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: I had a question. On Protective and Marine, was that a drag on earnings or was it flat?
Vincent J. Morales: It was a 0. As Chuck mentioned, our activity was a little better than we expected in the quarter. So it wasn't a drag or it wasn't a benefit either.
Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: Okay. So from what I take from the comments, it sounds like Protective offset Marine a little bit. And when you think of Protective, it seems like a kind of a lumpy business. So do you expect that ability to offset Marine to continue? Or is it -- or maybe I'm wrong, maybe it's not lumpy.
Charles E. Bunch: Well, the way we look at the global market, it's about half Protective, which is big infrastructure projects or maintenance spending and manufacturing locations, and about half Marine. But that half of Marine is split between the OEM or new builds and the aftermarket. And I would say that the longer-term trends on the Protective side, I wouldn't describe as lumpy. Typically, the most cyclicality that you would get on these segments would be the Marine new build segment, and this is the one that we probably highlighted more over the last 1.5 years because we have -- we were working off a very big backlog. And then after the big recession and some of the declines in global trade and what was happening in the shipping industry, you saw them working through that backlog, and that will -- that's still coming down. And we've seen some of that -- some of those freight, the freighters or -- being replaced by, let's call it, the drillships and things that are more tied to oil and gas exploration and the like. So I would say that protective should have an opportunity if there's a global upturn in infrastructure spending. And certainly, some of the governments like China are spending a lot as is Brazil, as is the recovery here, this whole manufacturing and industrial recovery in the U.S. So all these, I think, are positive signs on the Protective side. And that's going to be a positive and stable growth as opposed to what we still see as some continuing weakness on the Marine new build.
Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. In your Architectural Coatings in Europe now, you don't have much exposure to Spain and Portugal, which I'm sure you're probably glad about. But I'm just curious if -- and clearly you -- Chuck, you spoke of earlier that you had to have very compelling reasons to look at a property there. But I'm wondering if things have turned there yet to make distressed properties or any properties get so distressed that they are compelling.
Charles E. Bunch: Well, I guess -- I think we're starting to see prices come down in Europe for some of the properties. But again, it's -- you have to make some assumptions about when you're going to see an upturn. Even our Dyrup acquisition, which we think will be a positive one, our expectations for top line growth are limited in that business, and we are trying to develop good plans for synergies and integration with the rest of the business. So we're -- there's a lot of maybe, and could be especially in these Mediterranean markets, distressed properties. And yes, I think we talked earlier on the call about even though -- we think we've demonstrated that our European business is, even in this weaker economic environment, is fine. I mean, we have our earnings growth in our EMEA architectural business, albeit modest, but -- so we think we're going to be fine. But I think some people have been waiting to see how we will perform with the European business that we have. So we're not afraid of Europe. We'll make additional acquisitions if we think any fit. But right now, we are also focused on executing and getting our cost lower. So we'll be fine, regardless of whether things continue weaker or yes, we see an eventual upturn.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Gaji Balakaneshan with Buckingham Research Group.
Gaji Balakaneshan - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: First off, I was just wondering if your thinking has changed at all regarding the chemical business. So is that something that you would consider possibly monetizing or either expanding?
Vincent J. Morales: I think, Gaji, we've said all along that our core business is our Coating and Optical. That hasn't changed in certainly the 7 years Chuck's been CEO, and that's been our strategy: to grow in Coating and Optical.
Gaji Balakaneshan - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Okay. And then secondly, kind of an open-ending question, but from the prepared remarks, it sounds like the emerging regions were a little bit uneven in Performance and Industrial Coatings? Can you just elaborate on what you're seeing there?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, I think we've seen some variability in the numbers of the markets. We've talked -- I think we talked about some of the end-use markets in China, and some were pretty good. Others, we saw some more weakness. So I think I commented that Poland was pretty good in Eastern Europe, but some of the other Eastern European countries were weaker. South Africa, not a really big market for us, but we do we have a decent-sized business there. That's been weaker. So it is, I guess, spotty in terms of how the -- these emerging markets or even what you describe as emerging markets. And arguably one of the situations we're watching, although, we don't again have a huge exposure, is Argentina where there's a lot of interaction now going on at the government level with economic policy, and it's one where we do have some concerns as an example. So these would be 4 or 5 examples of yes, things are in general good, but we can find markets, either countries or end-use markets, that have some stress in them or not as consistent growth as we've seen in the past.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, the Q&A session has ended. And I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Vince Morales for closing remarks.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2011 PPG Industries Inc. Conference Call. My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator for today. [Operator Instructions] Today’s conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Vince Morales, Vice President, Investor Relations.
Vincent J. Morales: Thank you, Regina. This is Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations for PPG Industries. Welcome to PPG's Fourth Quarter 2011 Financial Teleconference. Joining me on the call today from PPG is Chuck Bunch, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Dave Navikas, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Our comments relate to the financial information released on Thursday, January 19, 2012. As a reminder to everyone, based on our modified quarterly earnings call process, about 1 hour ago, we posted detailed commentary and the accompanying presentation slides on our Investor Center at ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call. We don't read those prepared remarks during the call. However, during the call, Chuck will make some opening comments reviewing the company's results and then we will move directly to Q&A. Both the prepared commentary and discussion during the call may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company's current view about future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on the website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. For additional information, please refer to our filings with the SEC. Now let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch.
Charles E. Bunch: Thank you, Vince, and welcome, everyone. Today, we announced fourth quarter 2011 sales of $3.5 billion, up 4% versus the fourth quarter of 2010. Our fourth quarter earnings per share of $1.39 established a new fourth quarter record for the company and was achieved despite moderating global growth rates during the quarter. We delivered record earnings per share of $6.87 in 2011, with new records established each quarter despite persistent raw material inflation, uneven economic conditions globally and continued anemic construction activity in developed regions. Our continued record financial performance reflects strong execution by our global businesses, aggressive cost management and our amplified deployment of cash. Also, our end-use market and geographic diversity remained an important benefit during the year. During the fourth quarter, overall sales volumes were flat as some customers curtailed inventory and remained cautious with their ordering patterns. This was most evident in our Commodity Chemicals segment where volumes declined 3%, and also in Europe, where we experienced a 1% volume drop. Emerging region volume growth continued, but was modest and tempered by lower Marine and Architectural Coatings volumes, along with the negative impacts resulting from the Thailand flooding which reduced our Optical Products activity levels. We continued to benefit from improving global demand in Aerospace, Automotive OEM and several general industrial markets, and we supplemented this growth with PPG market share gains. Also aiding our sales was higher pricing with improvements in each business segment, marking the seventh consecutive quarter where the company has delivered higher pricing. The higher pricing offset raw material cost inflation as inflation rates stabilized during the quarter. We are implementing further pricing in 2012 to offset inflation we absorbed in 2011. Lastly, cash generation remained strong and was about $1.4 billion for the full year, up nearly 10%. Throughout the year, we deployed our cash with a focus on earnings accretion and continuing our heritage of returning cash to shareholders. We purchased 2.7 million shares of stock in the fourth quarter and 10.2 million shares during the year. We also raised our dividend, marking 40 consecutive years of annual dividend increases. In total, dividend and share repurchases equaled $1.2 billion or 85% of the cash we generated from operations. We ended the year with about $1.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. Looking ahead, we anticipate first quarter 2012 growth to remain uneven by region and vary by industry, similar to the fourth quarter of 2011. We expect Europe to remain the most challenging region. We anticipate moderate strengthening in the U.S. economic recovery, supported by an enhanced global cost position in the industrial sector due to lower natural gas prices. Aggregate emerging region growth rates are expected to remain high compared to developed regions, but more moderate and erratic that they have been in the past. As a result, we will be very proactive in managing our businesses as we deal with these uncertain market conditions. Also, we intend to continue to prudently deploy our strong cash position towards earnings accretion and rewarding shareholders, and are targeting to end 2012 with a cash balance below $1 billion. That concludes our prepared remarks. Now operator, would you please give instructions and open the phone lines for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question today comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.
Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: This is Rob Walker on for Laurence. I guess, in terms of -- just kind of get your thoughts, between automotive and construction end markets, I guess, which do you expect to see a larger increase in volumes, just kind in order trends in Q1 and kind of what you've seen so far?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, we see good momentum in the Automotive OEM markets around the world, with the exception of Europe. So we're looking forward to a -- good growth rates continuing in North America and Asia in particular. Construction activity, however, I think there's some early signs in North America, but still, I would say modest growth as we start up here in 2012. And Europe, we finished on what I would say would be a very modest growth rate. We're all concerned with the macroeconomic environment in Europe. Right now, we haven't seen any significant downturns, but we do not expect Europe to be strong in the construction markets nor do we think they're going to be particularly strong in Automotive OEM. That Automotive OEM business will be stronger in regions outside of Europe.
Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then if you could update us on kind of consolidation pipeline, kind of and do you expect to use a larger portion of cash in 2012 for M&A than you did in 2011?
Charles E. Bunch: You said consolidation pipeline. You meant acquisition pipeline?
Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Correct.
Charles E. Bunch: We closed this month on 2 acquisitions that we have previously announced, that was Dyrup in Europe, Architectural and Colpisa which is a Colombian, South America, Automotive OEM and refinish coatings company. So we are actively pursuing a number of small- to medium-sized bolt-on acquisitions. The pipeline, we think, is solid. But we have to make further progress to bring them along to closure here in 2012.
Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay, thanks. And then just kind of, overall, in terms of the chlor-alkali kind of outlook in Q1. And then just if you can touch on sort of whether you see further risk there, that pricing and costs, it won't keep up with the price declines in chlorine? And whether you think that the restocking will come or in Q2 versus Q1 in terms of just more of a general industrial -- in terms of your general industrial outlook going forward?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, why don't we answer your -- we'll answer the chlor-alkali question and then we'll open it up to some of the other questioners. But in chlor-alkali, we expect a seasonal upturn here in the first quarter from what were some lower operating rates in the fourth quarter. We do expect price increases to move the average cost of pricing up in the first quarter. Although as you commented, chlorine prices remain weak, but overall, we think it'll be slight positive for the first quarter. So I think we're looking forward to some return to more typical seasonal patterns here in the first quarter. And obviously, we're watching the natural gas markets, which are, right now, encouraging for us.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo.
Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Chuck, you talked about pushing through price increases because of the inflation that you faced in 2011. Can you talk about, starting from January 1, how you see that price versus raw material balance playing out? If you say raws are kind of in balance right now, it would suggest that you should see some margin improvement there. Can you talk a little bit about that?
Charles E. Bunch: Right. We've been chasing, let's say, the raw material inflation really for about the last 18 months or so. And that continued through 2011, but started to moderate in the second half of the year and the fourth quarter, Frank, with the exception, as we've talked about in the past, of the TiO2 pricing. So overall, we think here as we went into the latter half of 2011, we have a moderating inflation outlook and we're still catching up in terms of raw -- or pricing for our product. So we think that we still have some catch-up to do. We didn't fully offset inflation from raw materials in our Coatings businesses and we are trying to now complete that catch-up process because we really haven't completely offset those inflationary impacts. And so I think there is an opportunity for us if we continue to see this moderating trend in raw materials, to show some margin improvement in Coatings as we go through the year. Some of that will also depend on volumes, but if we continue to see overall economic growth, we think that will aid the margin improvement opportunities.
Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: All right, great. And speaking of TiO2, it was just over a month ago, I guess, that you talked about your ability to take 46% of TiO2 out in 2012. Now that we're 1 month further along, do your R&D people still feel confident in that regard?
Charles E. Bunch: Yes, they still feel -- we have a -- this is not a challenge that we threw out lightly to our organization. We have all of the goals and objectives, metrics by function, by business unit and we still feel that's an appropriate target level for us in our formulations, and it's still early in the year, but we are tracking it. And we feel that we will hit those targets.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America.
Aleksey V. Yefremov - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: This is Aleks Yefremov for Kevin. Chuck, what is your outlook, overall, for your raw material costs in the Coatings business given higher TiO2 and lower petrochemical-based raw materials?
Charles E. Bunch: We think that the overall outlook is flat. We think that what we've seen, in terms of the declines in the organic side of the raw material basket will offset what appears to be some continued increases on the TiO2 side, especially here in -- among the Western chloride producers.
Aleksey V. Yefremov - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And then moving to Architectural Coatings. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned that volumes in Asia were weaker. Do you think this is a function of sort of where you are in China geographically? Some sort of a share shift mix, share shift, or this is a sign of sort of cyclical problems in the Chinese construction market that might persist?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, we think, overall, that the Chinese construction growth will be moderating, and we've seen that here in the latter half of 2011. We think that will continue at least here in the near term in 2012. We have a relatively small business in Architectural in China. We are focused more in the Eastern half of the country where growth rates are probably even more modest. More of the growth has been in the second- and third-tier cities, and in the West. But I do think that there is a moderation of growth rates in the construction industry in China and certainly we felt that effect here in the latter half of 2011, in our business.
Aleksey V. Yefremov - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And a final question, if I may, on transitions and the rollout of Vantage (sic) [HomeVantage]. With increased sales cost, do you think you can still increase margins year-over-year in 2012 or hold them flat or down?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, for us, the Vantage product launch, which for those of you who aren't familiar, this is our clear-to-polarized, new-to-the-world technology. This will be the first time you've ever seen a product launch that will darken and darken to a polarized state in -- and so we're very excited about it. But it is, at this point, a rather limited launch. Limited geographically, limited by channel. We are quite excited about it but I would say, overall, even though the margins here will be very attractive for us, we don't think that we'll have, overall, an effect that would lift up our margins more than what you've seen just because of the -- at this point, it represents a relatively smaller volume for our Transitions business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Chuck, 2 questions. One is on the anticipated level of share repurchase in 2012. Do you think it'll be as large as last year or do you have a specific amount targeted at this time?
Charles E. Bunch: We talked, at our Investor Day in December, we had close to $1 billion in share repurchases in 2011. Our target for this year, I would put in -- more in the range of $250 million to $500 million. That would be what I would project. Obviously, it depends on successfully finding additional uses of cash for bolt-on acquisitions. But I would expect that we're going to be aggressive with the share repurchases, but not quite at the targeted -- at this point, targeting that level from 2011. So little -- half of that rate would be, I think, a good Benchmark.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: And a follow-up on chlor-alkali. What was your all-in natural gas acquisition cost in calendar 2011, including the hedge you had, I think you had 12% of your needs hedged at about $7.25?
Charles E. Bunch: It all in was around – it was a little under $5. And so this represents, I think, an opportunity as we've -- here in the first quarter of 2012, will be the last of those earlier kind of pre-shale gas hedges. So we were under a little under all-in costs of $5 and obviously we're going to start out in 2012, here in the first quarter, below $4. We did put some additional hedges on, but only over the last few months, at relatively modest level. So it does represent a nice opportunity for us especially with further reductions we've seen over the last week to 10 days in the market.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Chuck, you made some comments in the notes here, about the refinished demand suffering from some of the inventory management. And I guess I was a little bit surprised, I didn't think that particular customer segment was as sensitive to those inventory and working capital adjustments, nor was the pricing volatile enough where they might be trying to gain some advantage in buying later. So am I wrong and that does tend to be a much more volatile purchasing decision there? Or what happened in the refinished market?
Charles E. Bunch: I think we -- typically, it's not as volatile. We saw some inventory management. If you go back over the last few years, there were inventory reductions, certainly, as we went into the recession in 2009, more so than we had typically seen. And I would say, here in the fourth quarter, there was probably some -- if you look at some of the markets in Europe, as an example or even in some markets in Asia where there's some economic uncertainty, I think the distributors and the overall customer base were somewhat cautious, I would say, in terms of ordering patterns. So I wouldn't think it's anything -- a noticeable trend but it is something we felt we needed to comment on.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And is there something structurally different in the European markets that, in a weaker environment, DIY would go down instead of going up as it's done in the U.S. or was it just the jarring economic anxiety there that stifled demand?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, I think in Europe, you have also some customer issues. And I think the big retailers are also being quite conservative about inventory levels and their outlook, especially the ones in the U.K. I think we saw, earlier this week, I think it was Asda in the U.K. or Tesco and some of the home improvement chains. I think they have been somewhat concerned about the economic environment in the U.K. and been, I think, quite cautious, of inventory levels. But I wouldn't say it's a pronounced trend difference between here and the U.S. at this point. It's still a little too early to tell, Bob.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Saul Ludwig with Northcoast.
Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research: How much did FX help you in 2011? And what type of headwind are you, at least, thinking about as you put your 2012 plan together?
Vincent J. Morales: Saul, it's Vince. On the sales line, it was -- we provide that each quarter, as you know, in our distributed slides. But it was up around, let's say, $400 million year-over-year on the sales line. On the earnings line, we typically drop, say 7% to 10% of that to the bottom line.
Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research: Okay. So call it about $30 million. Now does that become a headwind this year?
Vincent J. Morales: We're not currency traders, we'll leave that up to you. But based on today's rate it's going to be a headwind. We -- primarily, the rate we're talking about is the euro.
Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research: Right, right, right. Okay. In the U.S., you commented that your Architectural volume was flat, which I guess it was pretty decent. Did the flat volume and price cost give you better earnings or lower earnings in that segment of the Architectural business?
Charles E. Bunch: North America and Architectural earnings were slightly lower in the fourth quarter on flat volumes, so.
Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research: Okay. And then, when you think about the dividend and your dividend payout policies, it's been pretty consistent for a lot of years now. With the sharp increase that you have in earnings, is the dividend going to move more commensurate with the earnings growth or will the modest rate of dividend growth likely to continue, and thus, be a lower percentage of your earnings?
Vincent J. Morales: Well, I think what you've seen us do, Saul, over the past couple of cycles, is we've actually reduced the amount of time between dividend increases. So I think the last 3 increases were either 6 or 9 months. So we've been trying to keep in lockstep with the earnings accretion.
Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research: I was asking about the payout ratio.
Charles E. Bunch: Well, I think, we're committed to increasing the dividend and to be in line with what we think is our -- we're already positioned at the high end of our peer group in terms of overall yield, dividend increases and payout ratio. Obviously, our cash flow has improved over the last few years as we've continued to move the portfolio. So our view is that we're going to continue to, I think, be consistent with the dividend, increase the dividend and increase it commensurate with overall earnings growth and cash flow. So if this is sustainable as we feel it is, you'll see us continue to increase that dividend and maybe at a rate that's higher than we've seen over, let's say, kind of coming out of this recessionary period where we did try to be a little more conservative.
Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research: And my final question, Chuck. As you look at the stable of plants that you have around the world, are you kind of finished with the restructuring and -- or is there going to be any further need for restructuring activity? And if so, how should we think about the cost of that as we put our model together for 2012?
Charles E. Bunch: As we look at 2012, it's obvious from our comments and how we saw the end of the year playing out, that we have more concern over the course of the European recovery and we have made, recently, a couple of acquisitions. So we're going to be reviewing here as we go into the first quarter what we think we're going to need going forward. Are there any synergies, especially in Europe, with the acquisition that we've made and our overall ray of facilities across our businesses. With some, I would say, some additional focus on Europe if, in fact, growth trends or some of the concerns that have been talked about, externally, play out and we're dealing with a low or 0 or potentially negative growth in Europe.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
James Sheehan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: This is Jim Sheehan in for Dave. Chuck, just wondering about, do you have any update on the situation in Thailand as far as when you think some of your suppliers will be up and running again? I know that you didn't have a lot of clarity on that back at the Investor Day.
Charles E. Bunch: Right now, our operations are in good shape, both on the Optical Materials side, as well as Transitions. Some of our customers there were -- or are a little slower in getting up to speed. But we think, now that there’s been good recovery across the optical industry in Thailand -- so if there are some lingering effects here in the first quarter, we think they're going to be minimal.
James Sheehan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And just as far as caustic availability is concerned, I know that that's an issue in the fourth quarter. How much longer will caustic availability be an issue and where do you think operating rates will play out in Q1?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, caustic availability is a concern, right now, because of where the industry finished or operated in the fourth quarter. So you had lower operating rates, very low caustic inventories. Now things are tight, and that's why I think I commented that the pricing for caustic is moving up in the first quarter. So I think we're going to see higher operating rates for the industry and that's a seasonal factor that may alleviate some of what's, obviously, now a tougher supply-demand situation. But if we can get the operating rates to come up and stay here in the first quarter, I think we'll be in, as an industry, in pretty good shape. You still have this Japanese DCM planned outage that is affecting caustic supply globally. So there’s a few other short-term effects that are, I think, serving to keep the market tight.
James Sheehan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then just with Architectural Coatings volumes declining a couple percent in the quarter and volumes seeming to be weak across the board on a regional basis. Did you see any substantial inventory build of TiO2 in the quarter?
Charles E. Bunch: I can't really comment on what was happening with TiO2 inventories. I think I've commented, in the past, that probably many customers in Coatings or elsewhere were probably keeping inventory levels higher because of concerns over price initiatives from the producers. So at this point I'm not aware of, certainly, any shortages or any supply concerns in TiO2. But overall inventory levels, I really don't have any basis to give an opinion.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: A couple of questions. First of all, the decline in operating margins in the Performance Coatings business, I mean you've been running at 15%, 16% pretty much for the past 6, 7 quarters and now we're down to just about just a shade over 12%. Was that just a mix issue or were there some onetime costs that have flown through the quarter, that impacted the profitability of Performance Coatings?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, I think we indicated in our notes, we had -- there are 4 businesses in that segment, 2 of them performed well; Aerospace being one of them, extremely well. Refinish had a solid quarter. Protective & Marine Coatings had a weaker quarter, and again, that was focused on the Marine side of the business. And the Marine business in Asia, this is China and Korea, volumes were down on the OEM build side of the Marine sector. Price did not keep pace with inflation in that business. And in the Marine segment, we have a slightly different raw material basket. We also include some metals that go into Marine OEM Coatings, notably zinc and copper. So they had a higher run-up during the year. We were still working off higher-cost inventories in that business and we had same activity in Marine. So that was one of the business units that had lower earnings, the other one was in Architectural. Now within Performance Coatings, we have the Americas and Asia/Pacific together in the Performance Coatings segment. So the European Architectural is in its own separate reporting segment. And there, in the Americas and Asia/Pacific Architectural business, we had lower earnings. This was, I mentioned slightly lower in North America, but lower in the smaller business in South America, in Brazil and Chile. Again, primarily price not keeping up with inflation. And in Asia/Pacific, similar challenges. I commented earlier on the China Architectural, so that had lower earnings; again, price not keeping up with inflation. And the volumes moderating in Australia, similar story, price and inflation. TiO2 is more important in these Architectural businesses. So there is, let's say, more inflationary pressure there. So if you have markets where the price initiatives aren't keeping up with what's been happening in TiO2, in particular, you're going to see some margin deterioration. So that's where I would focus your attention in terms of the Performance Coatings segment.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: Got it. That's very helpful, Chuck. You also, in your prepared remarks, said something intriguing that I want to follow up on. When you're talking about growing in some select segments or seeing good growth in some select segments of Industrial Coatings business, can you give us a little bit more detail on what those segments are, what's driving them and what the outlook for 2012 is?
Charles E. Bunch: There are some good segments in the Industrial or General Industrial business outside of Automotive OEM, and 2 examples would be Heavy-Duty Equipment. So you've seen some of the results of some of the big players that are out in ag and construction equipment. These guys are, I think, are booming in some respects and so that Heavy-Duty Equipment segment is a very attractive one. Consumer Electronics as well. Even if Consumer Electronics overall, in the second half, as an end-use market, was maybe -- the growth rates weren't as attractive. We're seeing increased paint and Coatings usage for a number of these devices, more devices being painted, color and design, more important. So that would be another example of an end-use market in Industrial or General Industrial that's growing in addition to Automotive OEM.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: Okay, that's very helpful color. And then just a couple of bookkeeping questions. Your Commodity Chemicals business, I understand that you sell a lot of your chlorine as not chlorine but some sort of a -- this or another. Can you give us a rough idea of how much of your chlorine business, if you will, is sold as non-chlorine?
Vincent J. Morales: Dmitry, this is Vince. That's going to fluctuate based on what's happening in the virgin chlorine market itself.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: For 2011, what was it?
Vincent J. Morales: I'll have to get back to you on the number. I don't have it at hand. But I would consider it just – chlorine’s just a pass-through to those derivatives.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: Right, right, I understand that. But my point is that you're not really shipping chlorine in a lot of cases. So I just wanted to understand what the percentage of the non-chlorine business was. So that's fine. We can take it offline. And then the last question. What kind of a tax rate should we be using for 2012? It's been coming down pretty significantly every year. Should we be looking at neighborhood of 25% or something lower than that?
David B. Navikas: Yes, Dmitry, this is Dave Navikas. The 25% rate that we achieved in 2011 would be the rate we're looking to maintain in 2012.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Ivan Marcuse with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: I just have a couple of them real quick. On Optical businesses, will you see some pent-up volume, do you think, in the first quarter from the orders and shipments that got delayed from the fourth quarter? Or do you expect it to just get back to more of a normalized type of business level?
Charles E. Bunch: I would say it's still early to tell. I would say that we're only 2 weeks into this. So I would say, at this point, we're not seeing any negative signs. So I would say, at normal activity levels, maybe a little bit higher as there's a little catch-up from some lower inventory levels and customer kind of, little bit of de-stocking there in the fourth quarter also tied to the Thailand floods.
Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Great. And then I think I missed it earlier in the call, your estimate [ph] on your 2012 outlook for raw materials. Did you expect them flat from where they are right now to go across or flat for on a year-over-year basis?
Charles E. Bunch: Flat from where we are now, yes.
Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: So where would you think about it on a year-over-year basis for 2012?
Vincent J. Morales: From a year-over-year basis, Ivan, that would be mid-single digits in terms of inflation rate. Collated all last year.
Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: All right. And then my last question is the Architectural Coatings in emerging markets, was it just in China where you saw a decline in demand or was it in other regions and what regions were there? And then in China are you just primarily in the Tier 1 cities? Could you just tell me on the scale of about how big is that business and where do you mainly sell into?
Charles E. Bunch: Okay. Well, you had about 3 questions in there. But I would say that China was -- and I would say that what I described was moderating growth rates. And that would be the case in China, as well as Brazil as an example. So growth rates were being lowered in our China business, Relatively small business, so less than $100 million. And again, more concentrated, as I explained to the earlier questioner. In the Eastern half of the country, more in the bigger cities and the growth rates have been higher in the tier 2, 3 cities and in the Western region.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: You talked about share gains in Coatings. Can you discuss sort of which segments you gained share? Was it in Autos, Aerospace? And secondly, with your paint plus primer product at Lowe's, were you able to gain share there?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, as you saw from our Industrial Coatings segment, we thought we did well in that overall segment in Auto OEM, in General Industrial Refinish, even if the market is, let's call it, a more mature market, we felt we were well positioned globally. And that's a more difficult market to get a, especially a near-term share picture, but we felt we've been doing well in that market. And Olympic ONE for us was a very good launch. We certainly exceeded our initial targets in Olympic ONE and we consider it a successful launch for us. And I think our customer for Olympic ONE, Lowe's, was also pleased with the performance of our product, both at the quality and the level of support that we were giving it, plus the reception on the part of the customers.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then secondly, quickly on TiO2. How much of the TiO2 that you buy is sulfate versus chloride-based? And are you using more Chinese -- can you just qualitatively talk about what are you doing with the Chinese TiO2 to counter the Western producers?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, the overwhelming use of our products, especially in North America and Western Europe, is chloride. We have introduced sulfate grades in those markets now and that's part of the targets that we have for improving our utilization of TiO2 in the formulas. I would say that, where you see much more sulfate usage for us is in the Asia/Pacific region, most of the Chinese-domestic producers are sulfate producers. And both through acquisitions and our own activities, we have learned how to work with those grades of TiO2 much more effectively, so we have a higher usage of sulfate TiO2 in Asia/Pacific and in the developing or emerging region.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just would you say that sulfate is maybe 10% of your overall purchases?
Charles E. Bunch: Yes, that's probably -- maybe higher than that, P.J.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA.
Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: One question about housing starts. They've had a fairly nice year, and probably up low-single digits, and you've seen in the back half of the year some acceleration. Yet Architectural volumes are kind of flat and chlor-alkali is negative. So are we seeing some sort of delay in order patterns? Has the overall picture of seasonality somehow changed? Or was there may be a pickup in demand that was in 2010, that was really pulled forward from 2011? What's going on here? Why aren't we seeing higher volumes given where housing starts are?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, housing starts, in our view, are still very depressed. And we started to see, over the last quarter or the last few months of 2011, a little more encouraging signs, but off some very low volumes from previous years. So I would say that we're still in the very early stages of a housing recovery. And so it wouldn't be significant enough at this point to really see big volume increases, especially at this time of year where we're still in the winter and this is not a seasonally strong quarter. So I think if this kind of nascent recovery continues, we'll probably see more volume improvements as we go through the year. And I think all of us have been waiting for a housing recovery for a few years. I've predicted it incorrectly to have happened certainly last year, probably the year before. It hasn't. I'd like to be encouraged here, as we see a few of these signs, but I'm going to probably wait until we get a little further into this thing before I declare that, yes, we're in the early stages. And we have to remember that these levels of housing starts and things are still very, very low. I think they'll come back. We talked about automotive people said, “Hey, automotive’s never going to come back, 8 million or 9 million builds is the new normal.” I think now everyone believes we'll get back to the old levels in the automotive industry. And I think we'll make more of those cars here. And I think eventually housing will correct. I think it'll improve a little bit, but at this point, we're still at very low levels. So even if the increases are, let's say, a little more than they have been, we're still increasing off some very, very low levels. So we won't -- if you look at it, overall in the industry, probably not yet significant.
Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: Okay. On your Architectural EMEA share gains, would you kind of give a little bit more qualification around what were the regions or particular end markets? And then given that even with Dyrup, you're still perhaps somewhat underrepresented in Germany. Is there any interest in growing there? I mean, given that you still are seeing very, very nice rises in German housing prices?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, for us, most of the European market, and our business in Europe as well, is in what we would call the Maintenance segment, both Residential and Commercial Maintenance. There's not as much of a new build or new construction market in Europe. So the improvements that we've seen have been in that segment. And we have some of our stronger businesses in countries that have held up better economically and the construction businesses have held up a little better. So that would be France and the Benelux countries. As we've described, we don't have much exposure at all to the Southern Mediterranean countries. We have a business in the U.K. that I would say is weaker than these Western European countries. And we’ve still been seeing some, I would say, some slight growth in markets where we're pretty strong, like Poland, as an example, in Eastern Europe, that haven't been affected too dramatically yet by all this weakness in the rest of Europe. In the German market, we have a relatively small position. I don't follow the housing prices in Germany, but overall, the economy’s been better there. They're well served in Germany. They have a number of small- to medium-sized German paint manufacturers. It's a competitive market. We'll pick up a little more sales in Germany from the Dyrup acquisition and I think, longer term, it does present a growth opportunity for us. But we're looking in Europe although we're cognizant of the fact that growth rates, right now, aren't that exciting. And so to the extent that we can find the right acquisition at the right of value, we'll be interested. But we're in that market, so we know growth is not going to be the big driver for earnings over the next year or so. So we're being, I would say, cautious and discriminating as we look at acquisition opportunities. And there are some of it there because the market is less consolidated than it is in North America, as an example.
Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: That’s helpful. And just one final one, if I may. On Olympic ONE, with the introduction of that product, obviously, there was some advertising costs. Are those costs going to continue through 2012 or do you have an opportunity to help some margins on that side of the business?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, we obviously supported Olympic ONE in the second of the year and then wanted to support the launch, and I think that went well. We want to continue that, I think there's some momentum in the brand. Our customer has encouraged us to continue to support it. So at this point, we would like to keep that momentum going and we're just not going to strip out all the costs in order to drive some, let's say, near-term margin improvement, although all of us realize the pressures in the Architectural business. But we're going to try to stay the course here.
Operator: Next question is from the line of Gregg Goodnight with UBS.
Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Your Industrial Coatings margins, you mentioned were up 200 basis points, and you mentioned a couple of things. Number one is lower gas prices and you implied that you've also taken some actions in that segment. My question is, which was the bigger effect there? And if natural gas prices decide to go up, are you going to be able to keep most of that margin improvement?
Vincent J. Morales: Gregg, I think the factors in Industrial, we cited, were higher volumes.
Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Yes, 4% volumes.
Vincent J. Morales: Yes. Natural gas was not a factor in that. We got higher volume and higher price versus prior period.
David B. Navikas: And then manufacturing costs, Gregg.
Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Manufacturing costs. So it was some fundamental improvement that contributed to that also?
David B. Navikas: Right.
Charles E. Bunch: But natural gas has a bigger impact on our Commodity Chemicals and our Glass segments. It's not a direct raw material for our Coatings business.
Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. That make sense, appreciate the clarification. In the Performance Coatings area, you mentioned in Marine Coatings, there was some increase in customer claims. Would you characterize that as low- to mid-single-digit-type impacts and will this continue?
Charles E. Bunch: Yes, I would characterize it as low-single-digit kind of numbers and we wouldn't expect that to continue. You have this happen periodically in the Marine Coatings industry. These are products that are working in harsh environments and that fourth quarter item was triggered more to a resolution of a longer-standing claim. So you would expect that this is not a continuing quarterly item but you do get that from time to time in Marine Coatings.
Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Got it. Last question, if I could. The $1 billion end of year cash target. What is the assumption on your asbestos settlement? And if the asbestos settlement happens, does that impact your share repurchase targets that you mentioned a little while ago?
David B. Navikas: Well, it would. It's a factor, Gregg. It goes into the calculus of how we're going to deploy the cash that we have available to us. So we're not trying to predict when that is going to occur, but certainly, would that to occur and we have that use of cash in 2012, it would tend to push down what we spend on share repurchase. But then the other dynamic is the extent to which we're able to bring acquisitions to a conclusion. So we're really trying to balance those 3 factors as the year unfolds.
Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And what is your best guess in terms of the settlement? Will it happen this year or is this no way to tell?
Vincent J. Morales: No way to tell, Gregg.
Operator: Your next questions come from the line of John Roberts of Buckingham Research.
Gaji Balakaneshan - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: This is Gaji Balakaneshan on for John. Maybe start off with a clarification. Are you guys thinking that the first quarter of 2012 is going to be sort of equivalent to the fourth quarter? Plus the seasonal change in demand or is it maybe a little better than that?
David B. Navikas: I think what we articulated was the macro-environment feels the same, with some seasonal uptick.
Gaji Balakaneshan - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay, I got it. And then given the de-stocking that you saw in the second half of 2011, have you seen an end to de-stocking or maybe any restocking or possibly expecting that to occur in the near future?
Charles E. Bunch: It's still early in the quarter. We're only a couple of weeks into this. I would say, in Europe, we're asking because we're trying to be very mindful of the situation over there. Right now, we have not seen any significant movements of de-stocking or restocking in Europe on top of what we saw in the fourth quarter. Chinese New Year for the Asia/Pacific region is early this year, it's coming up this week. So that's kind of -- it's going to throw off a little bit of our calculations, so we're going to have to wait until we move through the Chinese New Year and get further into the first quarter to see how activity and inventory levels are going to be in Asia. And I would say, here in North America, most of the activity that we're seeing is normal seasonal activity. And that means that there is some seasonal uptick in a normal pattern. So we have not seen anything that is out of the ordinary in terms of the trends that we finished the year with.
Gaji Balakaneshan - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: And then lastly, are there any businesses or geographies that have irrational levels of inventories? So maybe certain levels are too low given the end demand that you're seeing?
Charles E. Bunch: Irrational levels of inventory, no. We don't have any irrational levels of inventories. We're watching it. I would say, from what I can see at our customers’ inventory levels or suppliers’, I think everyone has been fairly cautious but not overly so. So there is no either outright pessimism or unbridled optimism out there in inventories and I think it's more steady-as-she-goes.
Operator: Our final question today is from the line of John McNulty with Credit Suisse.
John P. McNulty - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just with regard to the pricing that you're going to be putting through in the Coating space to catch up to the 2011 gross margin moves that you saw. Does that make any assumptions for the TiO2 prices that are currently -- the hikes that are currently on the table or would that need more incremental pricing from you?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, I would say at this point, we're still discussing TiO2 prices and trying to determine what's going to happen with the rest of our raw material basket. So we're still operating, at this point, off of the increases that we saw in the fourth quarter for TiO2, depending on where things go. Overall, for our basket, we'll have to develop our strategies once we see the general direction, it's not strictly from a TiO2 standpoint, and we're still under discussion for impacts in 2012.
John P. McNulty - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, fair enough. And just on your comments on the demand environment from the housing space. Do you think the demand is actually strong enough there to warrant or support the TiO2 hikes that are out in the industry or is that up for debate at this point?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, I made some comments on that in the past. Overall, we haven't seen a big improvement in demand in the housing sector. It's still early in the season. Certainly, we haven't seen a lot of strength over the last couple years. I've described today, moderating growth in markets like China or Brazil, concern about weakness in Europe. So I would say, overall, the construction markets are still tepid overall. And we may see a little bit of improvement as we go through the year. But I think there’s been, maybe a lot written about these nascent signs of improvement here in the U.S., but from a volume standpoint, we haven't seen dramatic improvements here, just early here in January.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer portion of today's event. I'd like to turn the call back over to management for some closing remarks.
Vincent J. Morales: Thanks, Regina. I just want to thank everybody for your time. Please feel free to contact the Investor Relations function and we'll answer any questions you have. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for your participation today. This does conclude the presentation and you may now disconnect. Have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2011 PPG Industries Earnings Conference Call. My name is Lacey, and I'll be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Vincent J. Morales: Thank you, Lacey. Good afternoon, everybody. This is Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations for PPG Industries. Welcome to our third quarter 2011 financial teleconference. Joining me on the call today from PPG are Chuck Bunch, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Dave Navikas, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Our comments relate to the financial information we released today, October 20, 2011. As a reminder to everyone, based on our modified quarterly earnings call process, approximately 1 hour ago, we posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on our Investor Center at our website at ppg.com. These slides are also available on the webcast site for this call. We do not read these prepared remarks during the call, however, Chuck will share his perspective during the call on the company's results for the quarter and then we will move directly to Q&A. Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company's view about future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC. Lastly, and before we discuss the third quarter results, I will remind everyone that PPG's Capital Markets Day will be December 5 in New York City. We will provide a strategic and financial update for our businesses and also discuss our coatings technologies. Please contact PPG's Investor Relations for additional details. And now let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch.
Charles E. Bunch: Thank you, Vince, and welcome, everyone. Today we announced third quarter sales of $3.8 billion, up 11% versus the third quarter of 2010. Our third quarter earnings per share of $1.96 were a record for any quarter in the company's history and up 24% versus the prior year. This represents 5 consecutive quarters in which we have eclipsed our prior quarterly earnings record, including last quarter where our earnings were also up more than 20%. This consistent improvement in performance, especially in light of today's economic backdrop, demonstrates our management's aggressive focus on operations and the continuing benefit of structural changes that we have made to the company the past few years, including a lower cost base and expansion in emerging regions. In addition, these results reflect the continuing benefits of our disciplined deployment of our strong cash position. Our third quarter sales improved by about $400 million versus the prior year. Year-over-year volumes for the company were flat for the quarter, with differing results by region and end-use market. Demand in North America was up about 1% versus last year, consistent with our second quarter volume change. However, these results included a large negative volume impact from several unplanned production outages in our Commodity Chemical business early in the quarter, which reduced the North American percentage volume change for the company by a few hundred basis points. Emerging region volume growth continued, driven by higher industrial and automotive OEM activity levels. These results were tempered by expected declines in shipbuilding activity as the lower production reflects a smaller marine original equipment order backlog. Most other emerging region and market growth remained consistent with the prior quarter. The higher emerging region results offset declines in European volumes, principally due to lower activity levels in several consumer-oriented businesses, including Optical products and Architectural Coatings. Aiding our sales and record earnings performance was higher pricing in all 13 of our businesses, led by our Commodity Chemical business. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter where the company has delivered higher pricing, reflecting our efforts to recover inflation we have already absorbed and counter flattening raw material inflation rates. Earnings were also assisted by the benefit from higher global industry activity, including improving global auto production, along with continued strong performance in some of our top performing businesses such as Aerospace and Automotive Refinish as we continue to benefit from our leading technologies. Lastly, cash generation remains a key accountability, and we have lowered our working capital as a percentage of sales versus last year's third quarter by over 100 basis points. Our year-to-date cash from operations is up 10% versus 2010, driven by gains in the third quarter. Also, we have continued our legacy of returning cash to shareholders as dividends and share repurchases combined have totaled over $900 million year-to-date, including $350 million this past quarter. Looking ahead, we anticipate current macro and regional economic trends to continue, supported to date by October activity levels in most of our businesses. The fourth quarter is traditionally our slowest quarter seasonally for several of our businesses and, in general, we anticipate normal seasonal fourth quarter patterns to occur. Raw material inflation rates are flattening, and we are in the process of implementing additional pricing in several businesses to counter the prior inflation impacts we have absorbed. We ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash and intend to continue to deploy our cash with a focus on driving earnings growth. Finally, we are keeping a watchful eye on the global economy and are prepared to adapt to changing conditions. That concludes our prepared remarks. Now operator, would you please give instructions and open the phone lines for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Chuck, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the European Optical business. It seems like it was maybe a larger-than-normal erosion, and even if we look back to the recession, so is there something specific to healthcare spending? Or what caused that sort of anomalous decline?
Charles E. Bunch: No, we haven't -- there's been no overall change in healthcare remuneration systems in Europe. It has been weaker, however, for us in this past quarter. We have one new competitor entry in Europe in the German market principally. This is Zeiss. But overall, we think that the impact in Europe for volume is minimal, and we should be recovering, we think, over the coming few quarters, our momentum in terms of positive volume.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And could you touch on chlor-alkali? It seems like the depth of chlor-alkali has been greatly exaggerated, but there's still concern out there about new capacity and, obviously, flowing chlorine demand. What's your crystal ball say for chlor-alkali in 2012?
Charles E. Bunch: In 2012, Bob, we're still optimistic for our chlor-alkali business. We are seeing, as we begin the fourth quarter, lower seasonal demand. Some of that is anticipated. But we also have seen some weakness on the chlorine side, a little lower export activity in the PBC chain, a little lower activity in a number of our chemicals end-use markets like MDI, TDI. Pulp and paper, however, has maintained its momentum, and we think that the offset of stronger pricing on the caustic side, which we're seeing here in the fourth quarter and is being supported globally by what we see as price improvements in caustic soda globally, we remain optimistic for our chlor-alkali business in 2012.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And my last one, Chuck. The Dyrup acquisition, can you just sort of explain to us again the strategic rationale in getting bigger in Europe and/or wood coatings, why that shouldn't be more daunting to hear about? What are the positive reasons to get into that business?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, we have what we think is a strong Architectural Coatings business in Europe today. The market has been weaker over the last 2 years than we anticipated, but we're trying to build on what we think are already strong positions for our Coatings businesses there, including the Continental Western Europe, even though the growth rates aren't, I would say, attractive here in the short term. We think we're going to get excellent synergies, position ourselves with what we think a great brand in the wood care market. And I think this will allow us to improve our overall competitive position, our offering in the market. And even if the growth rates aren't exciting, at this point, we think, overall, with the attractive purchase price, this is going to be an excellent acquisition for us.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo.
Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Transitions, Europe, what percent of your Transition sales are in Europe?
Charles E. Bunch: About 20% to 25%, Frank.
Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: All right. And that's really the only area that you've seen the consumer slowdown, is that correct?
Charles E. Bunch: Yes.
Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: All right, great. And then on chlor-alkali, obviously, you gave us some details in terms of the capacity utilization impact to the unplanned outages and some volumes, but you also mentioned that there were some added cost. Could you give us a sense as to what was the financial impact of all the outages taken together in the quarter on chlor-alkali?
David B. Navikas: Yes, Frank, this is Dave Navikas. The higher maintenance cost associated with those outages was about $10 million.
Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Right. So potentially, you guys could have posted something like $114 million of EBIT if everything had gone smoothly, is that correct? Or it would've been higher than that, given that you would have also had more products to sell?
David B. Navikas: Frank, the $114 million is a good number.
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets: All right, great. And then Chuck, you mentioned that you see raws moderating. I was wondering if you could add a little more color to that. Do you -- I mean, it's not a secret that propylene prices have been cratering here of late, and that obviously feeds into the acrylics chain. At what point would you anticipate that you would see your raws actually -- instead of just moderating, actually moving down? And does that suggest that you could see some margin expansion in your Coatings business?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, I think right now we're starting to see in a number of the raw materials some price declines. And those have been primarily in the organic or petrochemical value chain. We are encouraged by what we're seeing on the pricing for propylene and ethylene. I think that will -- I think that foretells that we're going to see some further declines in those parts of our value chain. What's been offsetting that has been the inorganic chain, specifically pigments and TiO2. Right now, I think those 2, the inorganics and the organics are balancing each other off. But we have seen some price declines now in the TiO2 market in China. We've seen price decreases there. The Western or developed market producers are still announcing price increases and attempting to get further price increases in TiO2, and that's the offset right now. But I would say that we are encouraged over the nearer term that what's happening in Asia may also order for improved pricing in terms of the coatings manufacturers anyway in TiO2 and other pigments.
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets: All right, very, very interesting on the inorganic side. And then lastly, obviously, you did a good job buying your stock. In the third quarter, you mentioned that you're looking to target $250 million in Q4 in a combination of share buyback and M&A. Can you comment on the current M&A environment? Obviously, you're going to complete a deal early next year. Should we expect that there's some more things teed up at PPG?
Charles E. Bunch: We have the one other deal that we announced in Colombia, Colpisa, which has not closed yet, and that will probably close also in the first quarter. We are working on a number of deals in the pipeline, but I would say it is unlikely that we will be able to close any of the deals that we are working on, either the announced deals or the other ones that we're active on in the fourth quarter. So therefore, I would say that our shareholder value creation will come more from the share buybacks here in the fourth quarter.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: So can you talk to us about how much volumes are down in your stores versus DIY? You said they're down slightly. Can you quantify that?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, I would say very low single digits. So we're talking 1% to 2% here.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And in the DIY business, have you seen any trading down by consumers while buying paints similar to, I guess, what your European competitor is saying today?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, what we saw on the DIY side is -- for us, the most important event in the third quarter was the successful launch of our Olympic ONE product. So we've been very pleased with what's happened there. And I would tell you that, that's not the lowest-priced product. It is a very high value but mid-priced product in Lowe's, and it's had excellent reception by the consumer. So I would say that the consumers are still going to be value-oriented. So they're going to look for the best product at the right value, but they are not trading completely on price alone. We've seen in other markets maybe a little more movement to lower-priced products. But I would say, here in North America, that certainly hasn't been the case. We've positioned, we think, Olympic ONE nicely in the middle of the price range, and it's doing very well.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: All right. And just lastly, you mentioned TiO2 prices declining in China. Do you actually -- how much of your TiO2 is purchased in China? And how much of the U.S. paint industry buy this TiO2 from China? Do you have a comment for PPG and the industry?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, what I would say, P.J., is that as the market tightened up over the last 18 months, I would say the opportunity to purchase TiO2 from China, either in the Chinese market or in our North American or European regions, the delta in terms of pricing when you included shipping costs and the like probably wasn't as attractive. We've talked about it on other call, so that we were at one time, it was a very attractive trade to bring that product in, less so, over certainly the first 2 quarters of this year. But I think with the gap that you're seeing opening up now, I think you're going to see more Chinese product available globally, and I think you'll see more demand from the paint companies for the value that those products now in the current environment are offering.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Saul Ludwig, please proceed, with Northcoast Research.
Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research: In the quarter, you have got $216 million of benefit from price. What was your raw material cost hit? Meaning so we want to see what was the recovery or what percentage did you cover raw material costs? And then looking into the fourth quarter, how would you see that gap playing out?
Vincent J. Morales: Saul, we recover between 85% and 90% of our raw materials in the quarter, and we have more pricing coming in Q4 with this flattening inflation trend. So we'd hope to narrow that even further.
Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research: Could you think you could be sort of a neutral in the fourth quarter, Vince?
Vincent J. Morales: We'll see how the quarter plays out. We're still negotiating some pricing on the raw material side.
Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research: Okay. And then, Chuck, you guys have done a fabulous job of building up your business in Asia, and it's been very, very successful. And I'm sure with that, you've built out a good infrastructure in terms of based costs. We keep reading about slowing in Asia, slowing in China. You mentioned earlier that you would take action to mitigate that if it were to actually develop more severely. What are some of the steps that you could take to do that? And do you see -- is what we're reading in the paper represented by what you guys see in your business in Asia?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, I would say, first of all, that the Asian markets for us are slowing, but it is a moderation of a very high growth rate. So we've been talking about growth rates or GDP growth of 12% to 15% in China as an example. So I think sometimes now when we look at growth rates that may be now in the kind of 6% to 9% kind of range that people say, "Well, this is going to really require a lot of retrenchment." But for us, one, we don't see that moderation of growth rates in Asia triggering a, let's say, an aggressive cost response from our standpoint. If it comes there, the labor force, the cost structure in Asia is very flexible, so that, typically, we can react quickly. It's not as costly a process as it is in Europe or here in North America. So I would say that we are not overly concerned with one, a moderation of the growth rates to the level that we've seen now. And if it happens, at least in Asia, we think we'll be able to respond quickly. I think what you see, however, in a market like Europe, where there is a lot of concern especially with the sovereign debt crisis, and will that spill over into some of the consumer markets in the rest of Europe, and there it does, restructuring actions or cost reductions in Europe in particular, take a little longer to develop or more costly to implement, and that's where I think we're being most vigilant right now in making sure that our businesses and the end-use markets for our products are staying up. Typically, for us, the automotive market is one of the first places where we see weakness. Historically, that's when we saw it at the end of '08 and '09. But right now, the automotive market here and in Europe has stayed up. We haven't seen any pronounced weaknesses, but this is one where we are watching, and I think we will react quickly in Europe when we see signs developing that this crisis is really affecting end-use markets.
Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research: Just a quickie. What's the latest estimate for cap spending this year or next year?
Vincent J. Morales: Saul, this year, 2% to 3% of sales. We're running right now right at 2%. But 2% to 3% of sales this year and 2.5% to 3.5% next year.
Charles E. Bunch: So that's $300 million more or less.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Chuck, you talked about spending $250 million this quarter or redeploying that amount of cash principally on share repurchase. What might we expect as we go forward into 2012? I know you've talked in the past that you really only need a cash balance about $800 million to -- is what you're comfortable with. So just wondering if we can expect more or perhaps even accelerated redeployment next year, above and beyond closing on the Dyrup acquisition.
Charles E. Bunch: Well, I would say that actually, we feel that we probably only need $300 million to $400 million in cash to operate the company now. You have to have it in the right regions, and we do have some seasonality in our cash flow. So I would say that right now, the 2 announcements that we have made that will probably close in the first quarter are the only firm announcements that we have. So, obviously, if we don't develop an initial or additional prospects, you're going to see similar levels of buyback activity for PPG as we move into 2012.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: So basically, you've got EBIT on this cash balance which, of course, will grow with free cash flow generation, you've got almost $1 billion more cash to redeploy then. Is that...
Charles E. Bunch: Yes.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. And then just a question on Architectural Coatings in the U.S. and the scope for price increase. I believe you've announced about 3 price increases totaling 15%. It looks like you've got about 10% of that so far. How much more do you need to restore gross margins in Architectural to where they might have been a year ago? And would you anticipate more pricing actions on the U.S. architectural front?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, right now, Don, we haven't recaptured all of the impact of price increases, and in architectural, as you know, that's been one of the hardest hit businesses or markets for us with the preponderance of TiO2 and the reliance on the propylene molecule. So I would say that we would -- we are not, at this point, working on broad price increase announcements. We are in a market that I think is becoming somewhat frustrated with the raw material situation, both on the part of our customers, and I think we have to be mindful of what we're doing with demand and actions by our competitors. So at this point, we are waiting to see what happens to the direction of the raw material increases and what's happening competitively in the marketplace.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: And one final question, just so you can clarify something on chlor-alkali. The industry operating rate was about 86% in July, August. And since you were below that, does this mean that the normal seasonal Q4 decline in volumes will be fairly muted this year or that you could even have flat volumes in chlor-alkali sequentially in Q4?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, I think what we saw from higher operating rates that we somewhat missed there in the third quarter, I think we're going to have the same sort of seasonal drop-off for the industry as a whole. And I think what happens from here till the end of the quarter is still somewhat in question. The export activities if we can get some lower spot ethylene pricing for the industry, we may get to see more activity over the course of the quarter. But right now, I think you're still going to see, for the industry anyway, a traditional seasonal drop off. And for us, I think it's just too early to tell.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of John McNulty with Crédit Suisse.
John P. McNulty - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just a few questions. First, with regard to pensions. We've seen -- the market's been relatively soft, the discount rates relatively low. How should we think about your cash use going toward potentially firming up any underfunding in the pension? And then how should be thinking about the potential earnings hit for next year as well?
David B. Navikas: Well, you're correct, John, that with where interest rates are today and where the equity markets have been year-to-date, we would be looking at some need for cash contribution in 2012. I think you can take that into something in the range of $100 million, $150 million at this point in time. And certainly, that would have some upward pressure on our pension expense in 2012, and we'll be working on finalizing those estimates as we get additional information between now and the end of the year.
Vincent J. Morales: John, I'll remind you, we expect to put in about $125 million into our pension plans in 2011 this year.
John P. McNulty - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, great. And then just one follow-up question with regard to, Chuck, your comments on there's being a lot of frustration in the industry, both from the -- I guess from your side as well as your customer side with regard to pricing, it sounded like you may have been implying that there may have been some lapses in discipline in the industry. Is that the case in terms of what you're seeing and how you have to react to maybe what your customer -- or what your competitors are doing? And then also, can you give us any color as to whether you've seen really any demand destruction tied to some of the necessary price hikes, or if it's still kind of relatively inelastic in terms of how we think about demand?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, I think the frustration level is -- traditionally, in our industry, we have had pricing that was more stable, annual pricing or pricing for the paint season. And I think this is how traditionally the industry operated with our customers. And I think in this environment, where we've had to go out multiple times to our customers across all end-use markets and say, "We're sorry, but there's so much cost inflation in our raw material chain that we're going to have to go out of step with our historical practices and ask for additional pricing kind of in-season or after they've set some of their annual pricing." So I think this is the frustration that many of us feel. And our customers, I think they're seeing in many markets that demand is still relatively weak, volumes are low as we've been talking about. And so there is, I would say, frustration on the part of the customer saying, "Well, wait, if the market's so weak, why are we getting additional pricing requests?" So I think that's the frustration that we feel and that our customers feel. Obviously, in some of the commodities that we've talked about on this call, we're doing everything we can to improve our productivity to better utilize those products in our formulation so that we limit any increases in consumption for our products, and we're working hard. And now instead of working on a lot of new product developments or new technologies that will help our markets stimulate demand, help our customers, we're working on formulations that will just minimize the impact of some of these price increases on the raw material side. So I think that's the frustration that I think -- that certainly I feel and that people in our company and I am assuming that others in the paint industry would feel as well. Demand destruction, hard to say at this point. That's a longer-term issue, but they are probably for any product in today's world, including paints and coatings, there are product substitutions, and you can do things differently. And we don't want to see our products, obviously, substituted in the marketplace, or people trading down to lower-priced or cheaper products because that will reflect on the image and the value that we historically or typically create for our customers. So I think that's the level of frustration that certainly we feel right now.
John P. McNulty - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And if I can just ask one last question. With regard to autos and industrial coatings, can you give us some color as to how far out your visibility is there?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, traditionally, it's been a market that has reacted to sharp downturns in the economy. And certainly, I think what we saw at this time 3 years ago, we saw the impact of the recession and the credit crisis first in the automotive market, especially here in North America. Now right now, what we're seeing is somewhat different in the sense that we're still, as an industry, recovering from the Japanese earthquake and tsunami. We see a little out of traditional seasonal patterns here in North America with the improvement in production levels for the Japanese-based manufacturers. Overall, demand and sales have been good I think, in part because the market was so weak 3 years ago. And if you really get into some of the discussion about what happened in the leasing market when some of the financing dried up, there is now a little more strength than you would assume with the overall, let's say, dampened demand overall in the consumer economy. The car market here in North America is pretty good. And in China, it's still been good. Even though the sales levels have come down, it's still solid. And in Europe, volumes have been relatively flat, but we have not seen any declines. So I think, overall, we're encouraged by what we've seen in the automotive market. But it is typically one that will react if things get -- if the consumer sentiment turns negative. So we're very watchful here. But right now, in the near term, we're encouraged. We do get some visibility and typically, if they do start cutting back on production levels, they don't do it immediately next week. It will be at the time of a traditional shutdown. But you usually have a couple of months to see that, and you'll see probably the impact before that in sales levels and the like.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Ivan Marcuse with KeyBanc.
Ivan Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: The first question I have is on your chlor-alkali. Do you have any planned shutdowns or costs for the fourth quarter? And how does that compare to the fourth quarter last year?
Charles E. Bunch: We do have -- typically, in any given quarter, we do have outages scheduled. We have one scheduled here in the fourth quarter, so that will have an impact. But that is something that normally we do have. We will have normally scheduled outages. We don't try to focus them in the summertime or at any particular season. So we'll have something. But we had something -- I'm trying to remember if we had something in the fourth quarter last year, but there is one outage scheduled here in the fourth quarter for our chlor-alkali business.
Ivan Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And my last question is on the DIY. Do you think that it was more of an industry shift, you saw the DIY as an industry as a whole increase through on a year-over-year basis? Or do you think that your product ONE and your other products are just -- it's more of a function of you gaining share?
Charles E. Bunch: I would say that we've reached a point in the housing market and in the home improvement that is we have reached stability. I don't think things are going to get -- go dramatically or any lower from this point. But it's too early for me to say that there's any strength building. We're obviously pleased, and we've benefited from the launch of Olympic ONE. So I would say it's just a little too early for me to see whether this is just a share gain on our part, or there's broader trends that DIY is going to pick up across the construction industry.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Chuck, just on TiO2. Do you expect the TiO2 price to be up in 2012 versus 2011? And if yes, by how much?
Charles E. Bunch: I don't know the answer to that, David. Obviously, we've absorbed price increases in 2010 and 2011, and we're discussing how things are going to end here in 2011. I would tell you, if the current economic situation continues, the demand side may not be there to support further increases and with the things that we're seeing in Asia where there's some easing off or actually, their prices are going down. I'm, let's say, hopeful that TiO2 prices stabilize. But I can't speculate on whether or not prices will be higher or not next year.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And Chuck, on your efforts to reduce TiO2 consumption, whether your own programs or the Dow Polymers, will there be material impacts in 2012? Or is it more like 2013 to begin to cut into how much TiO2 you guys do use?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, we've been working on this now for the better part of a year since this price trend started. And I think I've been very reluctant to say that it was going to have any meaningful impact this year, and maybe not initially next year. But I think our programs are developing. We're seeing elsewhere, you talked about some of the opaque polymers that are being developed. So I would say that by this time next year, we should start seeing some impact in terms of bending that demand curve. Some of that is going to depend also on how overall end-use market demand and new capacity that may come on, whether it's in Asia, whether it's sulfate or chloride, but we think that there will be -- we'll start to see some improvement in terms of the supply.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And Chuck, just lastly, as propylene prices drop, do you think you'll have to give back any pricing to your customers, either next year or the year thereafter?
Charles E. Bunch: It depends on where things develop. Obviously, we're not -- we buy very little propylene, the actual propylene molecule we do for some of our resins. Most of it we see through the acrylic chain. But if we see dramatic price decreases, we have obviously not even caught up as we've been discussing with all the raw material inflation that we've experienced over the last 1.5 years. So I think we would want to at least be in a position where we've recovered that inflation before we ever got into a discussion about where prices needed to go with our customers after that.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Chuck, would you comment on the volumes that you're seeing in Aerospace, Coatings, as well as your outlook there, especially on the OEM side now that the Dreamliners are rolling out?
Charles E. Bunch: Yes, volumes, we're encouraged overall by what's happening, Kevin. We're looking now for mid-single digit kind of volume increases overall across all our product lines as we go into the end of this year or into 2012, so I'm really encouraged by -- not every segment of Aerospace is moving up sharply. Military has flattened out. General aviation, I think, on the whole, is positive. But where we're really seeing strength is in the new products and our new wins in programs like the 787. So I would say mid-single digits is the right kind of volume increase that we'd be looking at.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then switching gears to Protective & Marine Coatings, Chuck, you referenced lower OEM volumes related to depressed shipbuilding activity in Asia. What does that trajectory look like over the next year or so? And when might we expect volumes to turn positive there?
Charles E. Bunch: We're not looking for an upturn in 2012. So I would say that if we have continued global economic recovery, even at modest levels, we would look to see improvement in 2013. But right now, in 2012, we're not looking for improvement in the OEM Marine side of the equation. The Protective side, which is still 1/2 of our business, we think has still continued opportunities. But certainly, the OEM Marine activity is going to be down next year.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then finally, if I may, what are your updated thoughts on potential timing of an asbestos settlement?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, at this point, we still have -- there are further hearings with the bankruptcy judge. We had several this summer, based on some of her direction over the first half of this year. We have another hearing scheduled towards the end of the year. So I would say that at this point, any actual settlement or payment is moved into 2012 certainly, and probably not in the early part of 2012.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: A lot of my questions have been answered, but I just want to follow up on a couple of things. First of all, the first half of the year, you saw some positive growth, albeit at lower single-digit levels in volumes in Europe, and then you've seen a decline in European paint business in the third quarter. Kind of what's the driver behind this inflection? And as you look out a couple of quarters, do you continue to see or expect to see European markets shrinking in terms of demand?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, for us, Dmitry, the weakest market in Europe has been the U.K. in both an overall market. We're there in both kind of the professional or trade segment, as well as DIY. So the overall market in the U.K. for the construction industry has been quite weak. So I think that's been one of the reasons why volume has declined. We also lost one of our DIY customers, and we commented on that, took a charge last quarter. This was Focus. And so that's impacted our volumes in the second quarter as well as here in the third quarter. And I would say that the -- we're not exposed or very little exposure to, let's call them, the Mediterranean markets that have been quite weak. So our volume has been stable but not growing in the Continental European market or even Eastern Europe. So right now, based on what we're seeing, is that we're not looking for any volume growth. Now whether or not we're going to see any additional volume declines, the market there in Europe has been fairly stable. And so I would say that because it is a market that's not driven by new home construction, that it is more a maintenance and repair market, we're looking for stability. Now that may mean that we see a couple of percentage points of decline, and we're not certainly anticipating growth, at least in what we're seeing in terms of the economic outlook in Europe.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: That's helpful, Chuck. Just one clarification on Europe. In your comments and your prepared remarks and the press release, did I understand you correctly that you expect foreign exchange to be a negative in European paints business in the fourth quarter? In other words...
Vincent J. Morales: Dmitry, right now, it will be down versus Q3.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: Oh, down versus Q3. So not year-over-year? Okay.
Vincent J. Morales: Yes, too early to make that call. But versus Q3, based on current rates, our Q3 conversion rate was 1.42. Q4 would be lower than that.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: Got it, okay. So this was just a sequential comment, not a year-over-year comment?
Vincent J. Morales: Correct.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. A question on Glass. I mean, you guys delivered 4 good quarters in a row of kind of double-digit operating margins in that business, and then they slipped back down to about a little bit over 8% in the September quarter. Was that entirely due to kind of volume declines and maintenance shutdowns that you have and we should expect you to return to double-digit operating profitability? Or has something changed in the industry, either from a demand side or the cost side where we should be looking at third quarter run rate as more typical?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, what you had in the third quarter in the glass industry or, in this case, in fiberglass in particular, we had, what we call, cold repairs or furnace repairs that we have to periodically take down the furnaces. We incur additional maintenance costs as well as loss production. So we had 2 of those in the third quarter that had more of an impact. So I would expect that we would improve seasonally in the fourth quarter versus what we saw seasonally in the third quarter of 2011. But I would say, overall, the volumes are probably not quite as strong either in the fiberglass market and more or less stable at a low level in the flat glass market. So I would say we're not going to -- we don't expect any volume improvements. We'll have better costs, but that necessarily won't -- that will mean that things are going to fall somewhere between what we have seasonally in the fourth quarter and some of the weakness that you saw in the third quarter, if that's clear.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: Yes, that is, Chuck. And then final question. On SG&A, just looking at the ramp-up in SG&A costs, it looks like it's going to be about 8% higher year-over-year in 2011 versus 2012, which is not as high as your revenue growth, which looks like it's going to be about 12%. But most of that, or at least half of that, is pricing. So it looks like if you exclude kind of pricing and foreign exchange, that your SG&A is growing significantly faster than your revenue. Is that in building out some kind of investing ahead of the market recoveries in some markets? Or maybe becoming a little bit less restrictive as far as travel or show attendance or anything like that? Or kind of what's behind the faster ramp-up in SG&A costs, almost back to 2008 levels?
David B. Navikas: Well, Dmitry, some of that increase would be in some areas like some brand building in the Architectural business. So some of that would be ahead of anticipated volume improvements in the future. But otherwise, as we would look at it, we've been working hard to keep the rate of growth of the overhead cost in line with the volume improvements that we have seen. And so where we have seen some of that growth and overhead cost in the third quarter, were in those businesses where we've also seen some recovery in their volumes as well.
Vincent J. Morales: I'll remind you, Dmitry, that those expenses are impacted by currency translation as well. Year-over-year, they're up 6% or 8%, just from translation perspective for those non-U.S. expenses.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: Oh, so they're up more than the 4% foreign exchange impact you're seeing in your sales then?
Vincent J. Morales: I'm sorry, it should be 4%. I misstated.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA.
Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: Question on Chinese TiO2. Obviously, it's becoming more attractive. Are there any issues in terms of requalification or specifications if you are going to use more of it? And what type of issues would you have in terms of your customers taking product that might have Chinese TiO2 versus TiO2 sourced in North America?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, in any of our formulations for our end-use markets, we will not introduce new suppliers or new types of raw materials without thorough testing. And so in these cases, we have been working for the past several years across a broad array of suppliers, not only in TiO2, but in a lot of commodities in Asia because we've been experienced, up until the last quarter or so, inflation across the board. So if we were to use more TiO2 from the non-Western sources, most of this is sulfate technology that requires differences in processing, qualification, testing. So that's the reasons why these things are not -- from month-to-month, you can't change the suppliers to these new products, new technologies, new suppliers. So that's why you haven't seen as much substitution short term in the industry. Plus, when things tightened up in the first half, there wasn't a financial incentive to utilize these products more broadly. Now I think you're going to -- that's opened up the opportunity, but it will still take some time in our formulations, in processing, in working with the customers where we do need broader discussions or approvals to change raw materials. So I think you'll see some of that coming because we've been working on it for a while, but it is not instantaneous.
Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: Okay, got it. On the M&A, a lot of the public valuations have certainly come down. We don't know whether private valuations have come down. Are you seeing anything that's particularly more attractive, either in particular end markets or particular regions that you weren't seeing maybe 6 months ago?
Charles E. Bunch: Not necessarily. I would say that, as we've discussed, a lot of the valuations in Asia have been quite high, and that's limited some of the acquisition activity, certainly on our part. And I don't think you've seen as much as historically in the industry, in the emerging regions. Now we're hopeful that if the growth rates do moderate, or if some of the opportunities for these smaller companies to go to the IPO or secondary exchanges at high valuations, we hope that this will open things up, and we'll have more attractive valuations in these markets. But right now, I would say we haven't seen a lot of acquisition activity in the industry. And we didn't see it as much in '08 and '09 either, because the industry actually held up fairly well. So it's unclear to me whether these moderating growth rates will cause a lot more M&A activity. I think you just have to work all of the possibilities and the companies and find situations where the owners feel that their longer-term are better off in part of a bigger company than going independently. But right now, haven't seen a big upswing in opportunities or a big change in valuations.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of John Roberts with Buckingham Research.
John E. Roberts - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Chuck, I think you had a weak April in North American architectural paint and then actually had up volumes in May and June and started this quarter with up volumes. Did it tail off late in the quarter so that you ended up more flat for the full quarter?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, I think we -- actually, we had -- we didn't have a strong start to the third quarter either. We had some -- there were some -- at least here in North America, weather patterns were a little bit unusual. There has been some inventory rebalancing on the part of a number of the channels. And so I would say that the volume was pretty choppy there in the third quarter, and we didn't start off great. I didn't think we'd finish great, but it probably wasn't as weak as what we saw in April, which on a one-month basis was certainly, on a year-over-year seasonal basis, was our weakest month.
John E. Roberts - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. And I got a little confused about the price cost discussion earlier. Do you need to actually announce more price to get caught up? Or do you need to just realize what's been announced to get you caught up?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, we have not caught up on -- we have not offset the impact of raw material inflation with our pricing. Now we're working on productivity costs, all these other things. So we're not there yet. But I express that at this point, we're not broadly having initiatives here in the marketplace on pricing until we see the direction of the economy and have further discussions with our customers.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Gregg Goodnight with UBS.
Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I noticed your tax rate continues to run below historic levels. Is this the new normal? Can you give us some updated guidance for 2011 and perhaps a peek at 2012?
David B. Navikas: Well, yes. It is down 1% from the tax rate in 2010. We've been holding constant as we continue to reestimate that rate for 2011. And I would say I feel pretty good about that rate for this year. Certainly, that is impacted by the regional mix of our earnings. And at this stage, as we look out into 2012, I think something in that 26% to 28% kind of range is still a reasonable estimate.
Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: A question. You've prepaid some of next year's debt. I noticed that there's like a $600 million tranche of 2013 debt. Is that -- would there be any penalty on prepaying that? Would you be disposed to prepaying that if you could? Or do you think your net debt to total capital is about where you want it?
David B. Navikas: There would be a penalty associated with prepaying that. And at this time, we're comfortable with leaving that ride and dealing with that as it comes due in 2013.
Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay, great. Last question, if I could. One of your competitors reported, and I noticed their margins for European architectural were down a bit more significantly than yours were on a year-over-year basis. So does a potential explanation of that pop out to you guys? Are you more aggressive in Europe on pricing? Or is there something else I might be missing?
Vincent J. Morales: Probably, Gregg, the thing I would look at is geographic mix is different for all the competitors we have in Europe. That would probably be the first place I'd look.
Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. No, that makes a lot of sense. In fact, their margins are a little bit higher on an absolute basis, so that fits.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer portion for today's call. I would now like to turn the call back over to Vince Morales for any closing remarks.
Vincent J. Morales: Just want to thank everybody for their interest again on our third quarter call and just remind everybody our Capital Markets Day is again December 5. Please contact me with any interest for that date. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes your presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day, everyone.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2011 PPG Industries Inc.'s Earnings Conference Call. My name is Carol, and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. It is now my pleasure to turn the presentation over to begin with to Mr. Vince Morales, Vice President, Investor Relations. Vince, you may begin.
Vincent Morales: Thank you, Carol. Good afternoon. This is Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations for PPG Industries. Welcome to PPG's Second Quarter 2011 Financial Teleconference. Joining me on the call today from PPG are Chuck Bunch, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Dave Navikas, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Our comments relate to the financial information released on Thursday, July 21, 2011. As a reminder to everyone, based on our modified quarterly earnings call process, about one hour ago, we posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on our Investor Center at our website at ppg.com. These slides are also available on the webcast site for this call.  We do not read these prepared remarks during the call. During the call, Chuck will share his overall perspective on the company's results for the quarter, and then we'll move directly to Q&A.  Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company's current view about future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For any additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC. Now let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch.
Charles Bunch: Thank you, Vince, and welcome, everyone. Today, PPG announced earnings per share, which are up 30% versus the prior year and a record for any quarter in the company's history. This represents 4 consecutive quarters in which we delivered record earnings, underscoring the benefits of our broad end-use market reach and the global business portfolio we have built.  Perhaps more importantly, our solid execution and operational excellence played a key role toward a strong performance in the quarter. We delivered higher pricing in every segment and continued our hallmark of aggressive cost management. This allowed us to overcome several transitory factors that impacted volumes in several of our businesses, including the full brunt of the automotive OEM industry production curtailments due to supplier disruptions related to the Japan crisis, scheduled and unscheduled production downtime in our Commodity Chemicals segment and poor weather conditions for architectural painting in the United States early in the quarter. The month of April was most heavily impacted by these factors, and our year-over-year volumes were negative in that month. Our volumes rebounded soundly in the remainder of the quarter to a growth rate comparable to the past several quarters. We posted positive volume growth in all regions, with Asia Pacific delivering the highest growth rate once again, driven by solid industrial gains in China.  Our coatings segments delivered excellent results. The Performance Coatings segment established a new earnings record, and the Industrial Coatings segment matched their second quarter earnings record. This was done despite operating margins for these segments that dropped modestly versus last year as a result of the weakened April volumes and a European architectural home center customer bankruptcy charge. Our coatings margins in the months of May and June were consistent with the prior year as volume growth resumed, and all 8 of our coatings businesses delivered higher pricing. Our Optical and Specialty Materials segment also achieved record quarterly sales and earnings. This performance was despite increased optical advertising costs as we broadened our geographic exposure by capitalizing on high growth opportunities in the emerging regions where we have delivered sales growth of 30% this quarter. Commodity Chemicals sales grew due to higher pricing, and earnings doubled despite increased maintenance costs and lower facility utilization due to extended downtime. Glass results also improved on strong fiberglass pricing. Lastly, we have continued to deploy cash on earnings-accretive initiatives. In doing so, we have remained mindful of our tradition of returning cash to our shareholders. Fully illustrating that tradition is that over the past 12 months, we generated $1.2 billion in cash from operations and have returned 100% of that cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.  This past quarter, we also finalized a few acquisitions and pre-paid $400 million of debt that was not due until 2012. In summary, I'm pleased that we were able to deliver record results despite some uncommon events this past quarter. We relied heavily on our strong execution, a PPG heritage and were aided by our portfolio balance. Looking ahead, we anticipate the global economic recovery will continue, although at its current uneven pace. The resumption of automotive OEM production in the second half of the year and our strong position in high-growth businesses and regions, such as Aerospace and Asia Pacific, will supplement our growth.  Also, although inflation pressures are moderating somewhat, we intend to secure additional pricing in businesses where we have not fully offset the inflated raw material costs. Finally, we intend to deploy between $500 million and $1 billion of cash in the second half of the year, with a focus on earnings accretion. That concludes our prepared remarks. Now, operator, would you please give instructions and open the phone lines for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Gentlemen, your first question will come to you from the line of John McNulty of Crédit Suisse.
John McNulty - Crédit Suisse AG: Just a couple of questions on the Architectural business. In the volume trends in the U.S., can you give us a breakdown of what you were seeing in the big box versus your own stores?
Charles Bunch: I would say those were roughly similar, John. I think, again, weakness early in the quarter, improvement as we went through the quarter. But I would say between our own stores and the big boxes, fairly similar trends.
John McNulty - Crédit Suisse AG: Okay. And then in the Olympic ONE brand that you launched, can you give us some color as to the type of premium that you're going to be getting relative to your current platform and then if you're going to be getting incremental shelf space or if this is something that should be eating into the regular Olympic brand? How should we be thinking about that?
Charles Bunch: Well, the price point for Olympic ONE, which is a -- one of the most exciting new product introductions that we've had in many years, it's now has been fully stocked in the Lowe's stores. Our price premium for Olympic ONE versus our current Olympic Premium line is on the order of 20% to 25%. We think from a value standpoint to the consumer, this will be one of the most -- one of the best value propositions, if not the best value proposition in terms of quality of paint in the can, the ability to use paint in primer, one-coat coverage. We think that this is going to be excellent value for the consumers at a premium price versus our current Olympic Premium. Olympic Premium will stay in the Lowe's stores. We are not getting a significant incremental shelf space with this, but we are now sharing the existing shelf space that we have with our current Olympic Premium. And we're getting displays, end caps, strong support in-store from our valued customer. And we're backing that up with a strong advertising push to get the message out on this exciting new product.
John McNulty - Crédit Suisse AG: Great. And if I can just ask one last question, on the European architectural business, it look likes volumes are actually finally starting to recover. And I guess I'm wondering what's driving that, if it's real demand, if it's share gains. Because I was a little bit surprised to see that up to 3% that you were highlighting.
Charles Bunch: Yes, we had a nice volume improvement in Europe. I would say that was in Continental Europe with a little more strength in the French market. We also though had volume improvements in the Benelux and Eastern Europe. The U.K. market continues to be the weakest market that we participate in, and there, we didn't experience the same volume growth.
Operator: Gentlemen, your next question comes to you from the line of Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Chuck, I made an observation that since the beginning of the year, your stock price is up about 7% or 8%, but the forward earnings estimates by TheStreet are up about 23%. So clearly, something's happened to value the stock. And I'm just curious on 2 fronts. One, does that seem unreasonable to you, and we can expect maybe a little bit more aggressive share repurchase? It looks like it curtailed a bit in the second quarter. And then two, as we look into the second half of '11 into '12, do you think we'll see a little bit more of the weight pulled by the coatings businesses to show some growth there as you get those prices and maybe some moderating of raw materials?
Charles Bunch: I would say on the share price to earnings multiple, I think, as most CEOs, we always feel that our company share price is undervalued. I'd say in this case, we continue to report excellent results. I think maybe there was some weakness out there because of some other announcements in the space that companies that may be weren't as confident about their performance. But we feel that there's excellent value in the share price. In the second half of the year, we have, as we discussed, plenty of cash that we intend to deploy. This is -- as you look at our cash flow through the year, it usually builds in our company through the second half of the year. So we will have additional opportunities for what we call value-accreting cash transactions concluding. I think more aggressive share buybacks. I think the second half of the year, also, from a raw materials standpoint, I see some moderation. If you look more specifically at the organic raw materials side, we've seen some price declines. You've seen overall lower prices in Asia and here in the propylene molecule and in some of the resins. So I think that's going to help moderate the price increases in the second half. We're still looking at inorganic raw materials, specifically the pigment and TiO2. We don't see the same price declines, but we think overall, we're going to see a flattening as we've been talking about in raw material prices that should allow us to recapture some of the margin that we've lost in the supply or value chain. And I think it will be a good opportunity for our Coatings businesses to demonstrate the earnings and margin power that we've been talking about for the last several years.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Terrific. And if I might add one follow up, I noticed in your regional variation that, obviously, Asia Pacific continuing to pull the greatest growth rate, but Latin America looked a little bit lighter. Is there something in one area particularly that made that a little bit skinnier this quarter at 1%?
Charles Bunch: I would say that the architectural business, this is not their strong season in the southern hemisphere. And I think you've seen some announcements about the architectural market in Brazil. I would say that it hasn't slowed down, but it is moderating. And there has been what I would call some pricing activity or market-share activity in Brazil, in particular, that probably moderated some of the, let's call it, the margins in that business in Brazil. So I would say that, that was probably the weakest market in South America or Latin America for us.
Operator: Gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch of Wells Fargo Securities.
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets: Chuck, in your commentary, you mentioned that in the auto refinish business that it's showing some good growth in Asia Pacific as well as U.S. market share gains. Can you provide some more color regarding that?
Charles Bunch: Well, we continue to be very pleased with the performance of our Asia Pacific refinish business. Those are the fastest-growing -- not only automotive OEM markets but also automotive aftermarkets. And the car park in China and India is growing at rates unlike anything that we see in the more mature markets in North America and in Western Europe. We have the number one automotive refinish business in China. We are very well positioned in automotive refinish in India. And those markets have continued to provide us with a good growth, and our teams are executing very well. Here in North America, the biggest difference for us has been in the success of our waterborne automotive refinish systems. We think we have an excellent-performing product, and even in areas where there are air quality compliance issues, we're seeing the customers in the body shops embrace our product. And even in areas that are not yet in-compliance regions, those distributors and automotive repair shops who are trying to get a little bit ahead of the curve in terms of conversion of water-based systems have been driving our growth in this market. So good performance in both regions for our refinish business.
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets: All right. So technology is a key factor then in your ability to pick up market share in the U.S.?
Charles Bunch: Yes.
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets: All right. And then obviously you're talking about spending $0.5 billion to $1 billion the balance of the year for earnings accretion either, I guess, share buyback or acquisitions. Can you talk about the pipeline that you see out there, the valuations that are out there and how confident are you that you're going to be able to execute on some of the M&A that you're targeting?
Charles Bunch: We have a robust pipeline. We've had, we continue to work our acquisition pipeline throughout the world. I would say that from a valuation standpoint, China is a little on the pricier side because as we talked in earlier conversation, there is an active IPO market in China, even for smaller companies on these secondary exchanges. So we are competing in some cases there with the opportunity for these companies to IPO. But I would say in Europe, in Eastern Europe, in other emerging regions in the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, we think we'll be able to execute several of these transactions that we've been working on, and we hope to announce several of them certainly as we go through the second half of the year.
Operator: Gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: Couple of questions on the commodity side. What did the outages and extra maintenance costs run in the quarter? What were your operating rates in the quarter? And you talked about, I guess, an outage at Lake Charles or plant maintenance turnaround this quarter. Just wondered what impact that will have? And Vince, can you give us the delta in pricing? I know you don't like to give the absolute number, but how much was ECU pricing up, sequentially?
Vincent Morales: Don, the maintenance was certainly more than $5 million year-over-year. Our operating rates were below 90 in the quarter, which is below industry rate, as you know. We don't give pricing, but we got our fair share of the price increases that were announced, and pricing was up sequentially and, obviously, year-over-year as well. In Q3, we do have a fairly -- our largest unit out, and that will probably result in a similar sequential production rate, but it will be down again year-over-year.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: Okay. And is there a maintenance charge associated with that? And then also, how about Equa-Chlor? Is that accretive in the quarter and should be accretive again this quarter?
Vincent Morales: Maintenance will be modestly lower in Q3 than Q2, Don, but still up year-over-year. And I'll let Chuck talk about Equa-Chlor.
Charles Bunch: Equa-Chlor has been accretive since day one, so we had 2 two months of Equa-Chlor operations. And the acquisition has performed well above expectations and accretive in May and June, the 2 months that we own the property. So went off to a great start.
Charles Bunch: And I'm sure Don you saw the gain we recognized in the quarter from -- and we bought the assets at below fair market value, so we had the accounting requirements required us to write those up to fair market value, so that was a gain in the quarter.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: And Chuck was that a one-off opportunistic acquisition? Or do you want to continue to grow your chlor-alkali business?
Charles Bunch: I would say it was a -- it certainly wasn't part of -- it is not part of our core strategy to make these types of bolt-ons. It made a lot of sense for us in terms of our overall operating footprint and the things that, from an asset value, that the transaction brought us. We are not, though -- we have not significantly changed our strategy in chlor-alkali. And we're not looking to make any significant acquisition plays in that business.
Operator: Gentlemen your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Kevin McCarthy: In terms of raw material costs, the frequency and magnitude of these titanium dioxide increases continues to escalate, can you talk about your raw material basket, how much you think it might rise and how the delta between your selling price realizations and that inflation is likely to trend in the back half of the year in the coatings businesses?
Charles Bunch: Well, our -- as I mentioned earlier, we think the overall basket of raw materials for PPG is going to flatten out here in the second half. We may see some increase on the inorganic side, but we think that is going to be balanced out by decreases on the organic side in both our resin solvents and the like. We've seen some of the building block chemicals going down in price here and in Asia. So we're looking for a moderation or flattening out in the second half of the year. And we think we've been capturing about 75% of the raw material impact in our prices. We still think that we're catching up with our prices. And as we go through the year, we think we're going to be able to offset more of that increase in the second half of the year than we've seen here in the first half, as we've been kind of chasing a moving target. And so I'm confident that our team is going to continue to execute on pricing where necessary, and we're continuing to focus on operational excellence, cost reduction, so we can try to minimize the impact of these increases on our own businesses and our customers.
Kevin McCarthy: Chuck, just a follow-up on that, of the 75% of cost inflation that you're capturing, would that number vary meaningfully by distribution channel? Maybe you can just talk a little bit about your experience in company-owned stores versus big boxes and smaller dealers?
Charles Bunch: I would say that it hasn't varied significantly by channel. I think the issues are -- that we're facing are also being -- we're participating in all 3 channels, so we're seeing similar issues that are facing our customers. In all of those channels, I think the competitors are facing similar issues. So I would say that recapture of the raw material price increase is probably similar by channel.
Vincent Morales: Kevin, the difference is by business. So architectural, it's similar by channel, but by business, some businesses are better equipped to offset it than others based on contracts, et cetera.
Kevin McCarthy: Understood. And then a final question if I may on U.S. architectural. I saw you characterize April as off 25% due to the adverse weather. And I understand it would have come back in May and June. So if I net all of that out, how would you characterize the net impact of weather on that business in the quarter?
Charles Bunch: Well, weather, I think you saw the -- maybe the weather impact in April. Overall, we were -- the volume was down just slightly on -- in the business in the second quarter, and I would say that it's low single-digits volume. And that's probably slightly better than what we have been seeing over the last several quarters in the business. So I think it's an indication that the market has bottomed and maybe starting to improve slightly. We had a stronger quarter in the second quarter of 2010, I think, because of that first-time buyers, mortgage credit and the like. But I see some still sporadic, and there's mixed data. But by and large I'd say the information around the housing market even though it's not, I would say, ecstatic is slightly positive. And so I continue to remain optimistic that we're not going to have a robust recovery. I, think we have seen the worst, and we're going to continue to see very modest volume improvements as we go through the year. The second half of last year was quite weak in the architectural market here. So I would expect that things will be slightly better. Although we haven't seen a significant change in the trends, they're not deteriorating, certainly.
Operator: Gentlemen your next question comes to you from the line of P.J. Juvekar of Citi.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc: AXA, today, talked about consumer trading down in paint. And given that you sell a lower price point paint at Lowe's, I'm wondering if you've seen any benefit from share gains there?
Charles Bunch: I would say we have not seen that trend significantly here in the North American market. In the European market where we have a good position, I would say it's not been significant. We feel like we don't have up-to-date share information on a quarterly basis, but we've held our own in Europe, if not slightly improved our share position. So I wouldn't think it is a significant trend for us. And obviously, as with many of our customers, we're trying to sell the highest-quality products even if sometimes we know that the consumers are looking in this economy to maximize value.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc: Okay. And can you give us any update on your efforts to reduce TiO2 intensity in paints? Have you had any success with any of your trials?
Charles Bunch: We feel pretty good about a couple of the initiatives that we've had to improve the productivity or the efficiency of TiO2 usage in our paint formulations. We think that the results look promising, although I would tell you that we don't expect a significant improvement in the second half of this year. We have a good inventory level of both TiO2 and paints, but I think it's going to be a 2012 and beyond number. But everyone in the industry, both, I think, the other coatings companies and the non-TiO2 producers in the chemical industry, everyone's working to either improve the substitute products or improve formulations or the productivity of those molecules in our formulations. So I think you will see a bending of that demand curve over time as we all try to use more efficiently this increasingly expensive raw material for coatings.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc: And finally, you said that trends at your own stores versus big boxes were similar, which I thought was surprising given that DI was gaining share from contractors. Is that not the case anymore?
Charles Bunch: Well, I would say that we haven't seen a big change in trends in the market this year. Obviously, share data is still -- it's still early in the paint season. We haven't seen the reporting from all of our retail customers. So I would say there's not a significant change in the trends from what we see.
Operator: Gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG: Back to TiO2. You mentioned bending the demand curve. Have you been able to use -- incorporate more Chinese TiO2? And in terms of your efforts in the lab, what are you most excited about? And could that be material in terms of TiO2 reduction in perhaps 3 or 4 years, or in the order magnitude, may be 15% to 20%?
Charles Bunch: I would say that we're -- we've been using more Chinese TiO2, both in Asia Pacific as well as in our developed markets. So that continues to be an opportunity for us, and as we've made acquisitions, including the most recent one in China, we found them using Chinese TiO2, effectively. There was an additional processing step. So we've been, I think, actively trying to improve our utilization of Chinese TiO2 and it is increasing. Now in terms of bending the demand curve, let's call it for TiO2 in any of the paint formulations, I would say that some of the numbers you were talking about are probably on the high end of 20% change in TiO2 loading or usage in our paint formulations is probably on the high end. I think traditionally, we've said it's going to be in the near term, somewhere in the order of mid-single digits, if we're all successful in some of these initiatives. And so I would still be targeting that over the near term, 3 or 4 years out. I think you should -- you could see some bigger changes. And I think we all are working hard to improve not only the quality of paint but the formulating around the raw material. So I think you're going to see a change over time, and -- but I don't know that in the near term, you're going to see changes to the magnitude that you're talking about, Dave.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG: And Chuck, one more thing. Just -- there's been a lot of M&A in chemical the last 6 months. In coatings, both and AXA have digested your recent large acquisitions. Are we coming to another point of large-scale M&A in coatings, from your perspective, in the next, perhaps, 1 to 2 years?
Charles Bunch: I mean, I'm not sure. I can't answer that specifically. There's been more consolidation, so there are fewer big players. I think you're still going to see a very active small- to medium-sized acquisition market. The bigger transactions are more complex in today's environment. But there are some opportunities. So I think it's possible, although I'm not sure that it is the most likely segment of the chemical industry to undergo some big M&A.
Operator: Gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn of Longbow Research.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: Nice quarter, and most of my questions have been answered. But I do want to follow-up on a couple of points. The Protective and Marine business, which was flat in the quarter, was there anything specific about year-over-year comps? Or is it an indication of perhaps that market just slowing down secularly?
Charles Bunch: There's some -- as we look at the cycle in new builds for Marine, we've said that this was going to be a flat to down year for new build activity in Asia Pacific. So I would say that the volumes that we report are more a reflection of that. I think the -- and that's more in the Marine segment. What we've seen in the Protective area, which is more infrastructure-related has been good. And the maintenance and repair side of the market has been solid. So it's more a reflection of new build in Marine in Asia Pacific.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: The first quarter we saw a little bit of a positive volume, I believe, in that business. Now it's flat in the second quarter. If you expect it to be flat to down for the year, should we expect the second half of the year then to be down for this business?
Charles Bunch: I would say that the volumes we're expecting would be, I think, somewhat flat here, Dmitry. I don't think we're looking for a dramatic change in either positive or negative, again with the balance of protective plus maintenance or repair being up, new builds being down and overall volumes being fairly flat.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: Got it. Second question, you mentioned that -- on the slides or at least there was a call out of that, the fact that you expect the fourth quarter 2011 to have a little bit of a catch up on the automotive OEM side from the softness we've seen in the second quarter after the earthquake. So how should we think about the kind of the seasonality in this business versus the typical seasonality where you have a significant tail-off in the fourth quarter?
Vincent Morales: Dmitry, we expect 3Q to be a very typical quarter. There is a -- we see the OEM assembly plants taking traditional downtime for the most part. And we expect the majority, if not all, of the lost sales we had in the second quarter to occur or we'll benefit from in the fourth quarter.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. So instead of taking kind of a Christmas shutdown, do you think that the plants will continue to work for another week or so to try to catch up with volumes they missed in the first half of the year?
Vincent Morales: Or accelerate their production pace, yes.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: Another question I have is on the Optical and Specialty business. You didn't give us any details on the breakdown of volume price mix, but if I'm just looking at the details that you did give us in the overall company-wide price volume mix, it looks like most of the optical growth came from currency. And it looked like volume actually had been down a little bit. I'm sorry, yes, pricing may have been down a little bit. Is that what happened?
Charles Bunch: No, pricing was relatively flat. Volume was positive, and there was a positive currency impact. So I would say that, that's the equation to get to those sales numbers in optical. The silica business was actually strong both from the volume, the pricing and currency standpoint.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. And then you also mentioned that the Silicas business would benefit from higher tire and battery markets. Is that a share gain situation? Or I mean -- or is it just the overall OEM -- kind of what's driving the higher tire and battery sales this year versus last year?
Charles Bunch: What's happening now, the tire market globally is very strong, especially here in the developed markets. So in North America, I think you have a situation where there was a lot of restructuring in the industry. There were some tariffs that were put up, and so the North American tire industry as an example is working full out. But the biggest reason behind this demand growth in Silicas is that Silicas is a specialty chemical additive in the tire manufacturing process, and it improves rolling resistance in tire performance. So what you're seeing today is the effect of what we would call the green tires. So you improve your miles per gallon performance with these higher silica-loaded tires. So I would say this is not a -- necessarily a share play. I think all the silica manufacturers are enjoying this improved volume. So it's more of a -- the performance attributes of silicas and the increased sensitivity for consumers, both at the OEM and the replacement market. Plus some of the CAFE standards and the other mileage standards that are being promulgated now, it is really requiring higher miles per gallon per vehicle. And one of the least expensive ways to get that better mileage is incorporate more silica into the tire formulation.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: Okay, I got it. That's very helpful. And final question, can you give us the relative sizes of the U.S. architectural business versus -- I guess, it's Asian that's the other part of the Performance Coatings, right?
Charles Bunch: What, the Asia architectural, you're talking about? Well, in architectural today represents about 25% of our Performance Coatings segment. And our North American business is the largest segment of that. We have a -- in Asia Pacific, we have a nice-sized business in Australia, New Zealand, a much smaller business in China. And those are the 2 main markets that we participate in, in Asia Pacific.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. So most of the 25% that's architectural paint is North American?
Charles Bunch: Yes, we have also South American business that's based in Brazil, but that's a part of that as well. But the North American architectural is the biggest business in that business unit within Performance Coatings.
Operator: Gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of John Roberts of Buckingham Research.
John Roberts - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: It sounds like you're pulsing the advertising and merchandising in Optical? Is there a follow-on acceleration in earnings? Because earnings growth was less than revenue growth, I think, during the segment.
Vincent Morales: John, the biggest factor there is we did spend a considerable amount more for that strong growth we realized in emerging regions. And the spend there modestly diluted the margins.
John Roberts - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: And does it now flip in the next quarter where we have earnings?
Vincent Morales: No, we think that, we see good opportunities abroad and our focus remains to secure higher growth rates and still have a very -- well, I'll call it a strong margin performance.
John Roberts - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Were you down in any of the developed markets in that segment in the...
Vincent Morales: No, volume growth, we had volume growth in all major regions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Gentlemen, you have a follow-up question from the line of Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs.
Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: It's actually Brian Maguire on for Bob. I think last quarter, you said that you thought you were confident that you'd be able to cover 90% of the raw material increase with price, and after another quarter where propylene went up and then came back down and TiO2 is up, we've seen some puts and takes there. But I was just wondering if you could update us on if you think that that's still a good number to use or if there's a different number you're comfortable that now?
Charles Bunch: I think that's a good target for us. We didn't make as much progress -- as we've said, we need one, to more typically two, quarters in order to fully offset the raw material price increases. Those were still coming in the second quarter. So we didn't have a significant catch up for our prices versus the impact of the raw materials. But as I've said in the second half, we're looking at flattening raw material cost. We expect now to realize more pricing here in the second half, so 90%, I think, over the next 2 quarters is a realistic target for us.
Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay. And just one housekeeping one. What do you expect the annualized interest expense savings to be on the $400 million of debt that you just repurchased?
Vincent Morales: That would be between $1 million to $2 million per quarter.
Operator: Gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Robert Reitzes of BroadArch Capital.
Robert Reitzes - Bear Stearns: Just one follow question on the caustic and chlorine. How long do you -- is the plant down, number one? And number two, what does it represent of your total productive capacity in the industries if you know that?
Vincent Morales: The plant will be down in Q3, you're talking about Bob, just to clarify?
Robert Reitzes - Bear Stearns: Yes.
Vincent Morales: Plant will be down -- we're talking a couple of weeks, so the impact on -- again, for PPG alone, the impact's similar to what we had experienced in Q2 and the number of tons. I would say for the industry, it's not significant other than inventories. Holistically in the inventory remain -- our inventories are very low. Let's put it that way.
Charles Bunch: The whole plant is not down. It's just one circuit.
Operator: Gentlemen, you have an additional follow-up question from P.J. Juvekar of Citibank.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc: Chuck, can you talk about your strategy with the paint stores? Are you going to invest significantly in this channel? Or is the focus going to be more on international markets?
Charles Bunch: Well, we think that the paint store channel for us has been stable in terms of store count. We're at 400 stores. We are waiting for signs of improvement in the market in order for us to add to that store count. But we remain committed to the channel and to the business. And I think there are good opportunities for us around the world. Globally, we're pursuing a growth in Architectural Coatings. The Dyrup acquisition that we announced, other initiatives in the emerging markets. We're committed to the Architectural business, and we think that it represents a good opportunity. As do other end-use markets for coatings in the emerging regions, but the store channel here, we think it's going to be a solid contributor. We'd like to see a little more market growth, and we think if we're patient, we will see improving trends in that channel and in the overall architectural market here in North America in the quarters and years to come.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc: Okay. So you're not looking to add anything in the near term to the store channels?
Charles Bunch: I think right now, we're continuing to evaluate opportunities, but I would say those would be incremental and tied to whether we see improving trends in given regions or markets. But I would say over time, we're going to add to our store count. But in the near term, we haven't seen enough strength that would lead us to say, "Hey, we need to continue to move up our store count," in what has been a relatively weak market.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer portion of today's conference. I will now turn the presentation back to Chuck Bunch for his closing remarks. Sir?
Charles Bunch: Well, I would just like to thank all of you for attending our second quarter 2011 conference call and Q&A. And we appreciate the dialogue, and we're very pleased with our performance and the results. And we look forward to talking with you in October when we announce our third quarter 2011 results. Thank you.
Vincent Morales: Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your participation in today's conference. This concludes your presentation, and you may now disconnect. Have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2011 PPG Industries Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Deanna, and I'll be the operator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Vince Morales, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Vincent Morales: Thank you. Good afternoon. This is Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations for PPG Industries. Welcome to PPG's first quarter 2011 financial teleconference. Joining me on the call today from PPG are Chuck Bunch, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Bob Dellinger, Senior Vice President, Finance, and Chief Financial Officer; and Dave Navikas, Vice President and Controller.  Our comments relate to the financial information released on Thursday, April 21, 2011. As a reminder to everyone, we have modified our quarterly earnings call process. Approximately 1 hour ago, we posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on the Investor Center of our website, ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call. We will not read those prepared remarks during the call. During the call, Chuck will share his perspective on the company's results in the quarter, and then we'll move directly to Q&A. This modified process allows substantially more time for Q&A, while providing a similar amount of data compared to our prior approach. Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company's current view about future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks, which may cause actual results to differ. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on our website, reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For any additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC. Now let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch.
Charles Bunch: Thank you, Vince, and welcome, everyone. PPG posted record earnings per share this quarter, marking the third consecutive quarterly record for the company. We have built on the strong performance and momentum from the second half of 2010. Our year-over-year sales improved 13% to $3.5 billion, with each major region posting double-digit percentage sales increases and higher sales in every PPG reporting segment.  Higher volumes accounted for about 1/2 of our sales growth, led once again by stronger global industrial activity, which aided many of our businesses. The global industrial recovery continues with solid growth in emerging regions and North America, and with strengthening conditions in Europe. The higher European activity levels outpaced our expectations of a few months ago. Excellent volume growth was also a key factor in the record earnings performance by our Optical and Specialty Materials segment. In construction end-used markets, activity levels remained low in the developed regions, as these markets have not demonstrated any convincing signs of imminent improvement.  Despite the market weakness, our volumes in businesses serving these markets were modestly positive in comparison with an already low prior-year base. Improved selling prices accounted for the majority of the company's remaining sales gains in the quarter. Every reporting segment posted higher year-over-year pricing, with the most significant percentage gains in Commodity Chemicals and Glass, resulting in substantial earnings recovery in these segments versus the recession-impacted first quarter of last year. In our Coatings businesses, higher selling prices partially offset persistent raw material cost inflation. Despite inflationary cost pressures, operating margins in each Coatings segment were essentially flat with the prior year, and our total Coatings operating earnings improved by nearly 12%. Volume and pricing gains were supplemented by continued aggressive cost management actions. We also expanded our product reformulation activities in an effort to utilize lower cost raw materials to limit inflationary impacts on our customers.  Lastly, another growth lever for us is the continued deployment of our cash for earnings accretion. While our recent acquisition activity has been minimal, we repurchased about $275 million of PPG stock during the quarter, bringing our total repurchases over the past 9 months to about $700 million at an average share price of $81. As a result, our share count has dropped nearly 3% versus last year's first quarter. In summary, our performance in the quarter was excellent. Despite persistent inflationary pressures, our overall segment margins improved by more than 300 basis points in comparison with last year, and 150 basis points sequentially versus the fourth quarter of 2010. We posted double-digit sales growth on strong volumes and higher pricing and achieved record first quarter earnings per share. We also returned about $375 million of cash to shareholders, including $90 million of dividend. Looking ahead, we remain optimistic as we anticipate similar economic trends in the second quarter, which is seasonally our strongest sales quarter. We remain focused on offsetting inflationary pressures with expected additional price gains in the second quarter in all our businesses.  Also, our aggressive cost management and execution focus remains. Finally, we continue to work on accretive initiatives to deploy our cash. We are applying our disciplined approach toward evaluating acquisitions and anticipate several small- to medium-sized bolt-on acquisitions over the next 6 to 9 months.  Lastly, as a reflection of our outlook and our continued strong cash prospects, we raised our quarterly dividend another $0.02 today to $0.57 per share, which is our second increase in the past 9 months. That concludes our prepared remarks. Now, operator, would you please give instructions and open the phone lines for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from the line of David Begleiter, Deutsche Bank.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG: Thank you. Chuck, you mentioned in -- to combat raw materials reformulation using more Chinese TiO2, how much have you been able to offset TiO2 usage with reformulation, new technologies and Chinese sulfates?
Charles Bunch: I would say that still -- those reformulation or additional sourcing options, it would still be less or in low single-digit percentages in terms of our overall raw material usage.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG: And just on Q2, would you expect margin in Coatings to be up in Q2 year-over-year?
Charles Bunch: I would say our Coatings margin should be comparable to the margins that you're seeing. I think you're going to have some improvement in our seasonally stronger businesses in the second quarter. But I would say that the margins would be comparable.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG: Thank you very much.
Charles Bunch: Thanks, David.
Operator: And the next question will come from the line of Bob Koort, Goldman Sachs.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Thanks. Chuck, I guess, we've heard sort of different accounts of pricing in U.S. architectural. Your European competitor talks about not really seeing price yet at the big boxes. We had Sherwin on today talking about their own stores really pushed through some -- a series of price hikes. Can you sort of give us an appraisal of the landscape by channel regarding pricing, specifically in the U.S. market?
Charles Bunch: Well, what I would say is that it is probably company specific. From a channel standpoint, we are -- obviously the products and formulations are similar with each channel. So I think the pressure, the raw material pressure exists across the board. We were able to implement price increases in the first quarter in all channels. Obviously, we are experiencing here in the second quarter additional raw material inflation on a year-over-year basis and sequential basis. So we're weighing our options and looking at the marketplace, talking with our customers. And so I would say we're evaluating additional actions as we move into the second quarter and through the rest of the paint season.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Could you address what's going on with the auto builds globally and the impact from Japan, and will we even notice it in your numbers? Or is that a small-enough piece auto OEM that's affected that it won't be that noticeable?
Charles Bunch: There was no real impact in the first quarter from the tragic events in Japan because it was just at the end of the first quarter. I would say there is going to be a small impact in the second quarter, minimal in terms of the overall PPG sales. I would say now, we're looking at something on the order of a 1% impact on overall PPG sales in the second quarter from what I would call lower build in the second quarter versus the initial forecast, probably concentrated more in the Japanese OEMs but affecting others more broadly. We do not participate directly in any automotive sales in Japan, but we do supply those customers outside of Japan, especially here in North America and in Europe. But our overall forecast, if we say we're going to -- it'll impact the total company to the order of maybe 1% of sales in the second quarter, we would anticipate making up those sales from an industry standpoint by the end of the year. So if you look at the full year impact, we don't see it as sustaining, and actually, we think there'll be some catch-up in the third and fourth quarters but an impact that's going to be concentrated in the second quarter.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Great. And 1 man's opinion, I like the new format. So I'll get back in line hopefully to have another question at the end.
Vincent Morales: Okay. Thank you, Bob.
Operator: And the next question will come from the line of Frank Mitsch, BB&T Capital Markets.
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets: Following up on the commentary, you're talking about looking at TiO2 substitutes in Chinese pigments and you were focused -- it looked in the commentary on the architectural EMEA, the European business. Can you comment on your progress in terms of that? I mean, have you fully looked at it across the entire PPG Coatings platform and decided that those sort of moves in utilizing less TiO2 was more germane to Europe rather than the rest of the region? Am I reading too much into that? Where exactly are you on that process?
Charles Bunch: No, I'd say we're doing this broadly. We use -- TiO2 probably has the highest concentration as you know, Frank, in the architectural businesses. But we do use TiO2 in our other Coatings businesses. So this is an across-the-board initiative on the part of PPG to expand our sourcing supplies. So every business has targets, has goals, has qualifying additional suppliers. But we are not trying to, in any way, take quality out of our formulations or products. So we're looking right now to just expand sources of supply to give us more opportunities and to look more globally at these suppliers, at these products. And we're obviously having some success in expanding our supply base.
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets: All right. Fine. So I read too much into the commentary that it was mostly -- that it was in the European side, it's really across the board as to what you're looking at?
Charles Bunch: Yes.
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets: All right. And then you made the comment that the volumes called 6% 7% up for the entire company, and across each region it was about roughly the same. So I was a little bit surprised by that moment of thought that you might have seen faster growth here or there. So basically, you're seeing as much growth in Europe and in Asia. And continuing on the volume side, you mentioned that pricing -- you're expecting pricing gains in the second quarter, which you also expect volume gains in the second quarter.
Charles Bunch: Well, first, on a regional basis, I would say that we experienced volume gains in all regions led by Asia Pacific, followed by Latin America and North America. And in Europe, we had volume gains, but they weren't to the extent that we saw, certainly in Asia and not as much here but there were certainly volume gains. And again, focused on those industrial -- on the industrial and automotive markets, so principally we had volume gains in Architectural in Europe but very modest.
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets: All right, and you would anticipate continued volume gains in the second quarter as well?
Charles Bunch: Yes, we think that this is continuing. With the point that Bob Koort brought up in the last question about we will see in the second quarter the impact on the supply chain in Automotive OEM, especially with the Japanese manufacturers. But aside from that, we still see growth continuing in our markets and broad in terms of the end-use markets and the regions.
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets: All right. Terrific. Thank you.
Vincent Morales: Thank you, Frank.
Operator: And the next question will come from the line of P.J. Juvekar, Citi.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc: So several questions on this Chinese TiO2. But isn't that mostly lower quality sulfide production? And is that good enough for European paints?
Charles Bunch: Well, we continue to work on our processing initiatives. As you know, we have built a very large business in every end-use market in coatings in China. We have now close to $1 billion in sales there. So we have extensive experience now with local or domestic production. And we've learned, in many cases, how to work more successfully with these products. So I wouldn't say it represents any sacrifice in terms of the quality of products or processes that we're using.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc: And typically, how cheaper is that pigment compared to pigment that you would -- TiO2 that you would buy in U.S. and Europe?
Charles Bunch: At this point I would say it is less expensive. Modestly so, but it is less expensive and represents a good opportunity for us in both supply security and economic value.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc: Okay. And just lastly, you look at European architectural margins, you're still about less than half of that of U.S. performance businesses. So as you improve manufacturing there and use less-expensive TiO2 and all that, where do you think you can take those margins to?
Charles Bunch: Well, we have 2 points. 1, in the first quarter is a seasonally low quarter for any, let's call it Northern Hemisphere Architectural business. So those margins in Europe in architectural will move up in the second and third quarters, and they have done a good job so far on very limited volume improvement in offsetting the inflationary increases. And also, you have to remember that we still have purchase price accounting at work in our EBIT reported segment earnings for architectural EMEA. So if you look at it on an EBITDA basis, our full year returns on an EBITDA basis are into the low teens. And so we think that the ability to sustain those margins to have excellent cash flow in this level of construction market activity in Europe has been successful. And we think there'll be more gains in the future, both as the market improves and as we continue to work on supply chain and cost improvements.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc: Thank you. And Vince, your natural gas hedge is completely off now, the higher cost ranges that you had?
Vincent Morales: No, P.J. Just to refresh everybody, we have higher pre-2010 hedges in, primarily in our Commodity Chemical business but also a small portion in our Glass business. We have -- they're in the range of between $7.50 and $8 depending on the quarter. We had about just under 20% in the first quarter hedged. And that bleeds off, P.J., at about 1% per month. For the full year, we're about 12% hedged at $7.50. So we're continuing to experience that as a tailwind as we go throughout the year based on current market price.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc: Thank you.
Vincent Morales: Thank you.
Operator: And the next question will come from the line of Kevin McCarthy, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Kevin McCarthy: Question on chlor-alkali. It seems as though the market's tightened a fair amount in the wake of the crises in Japan. Can you talk a little bit about your price realizations there? How much is flowing through? And then secondly, I understand you declared force majeure at Natrium 2 days ago. Maybe you could comment on whether that's just going to be a brief interruption or whether you would anticipate any meaningful impact on 2Q there.
Charles Bunch: First, I'll take the pricing discussion for chlor-alkali. Of the supply demand for caustic soda and for chlor-alkali more broadly has tightened up with the -- in light of the events in Japan. They were a large exporter of air production to other areas of Asia Pacific. So we have now -- we haven't seen and we didn't see an impact in the first quarter. Second quarter demand will remain high. Pricing has solidified. We have, on the chlorine side, we have a $60 increase that is currently being implemented here at the beginning of the second quarter. We have, on the caustic side, a $40-a-ton increase that has already been implemented at the end of the first quarter. And an additional $60-a-ton increase that is being, has been announced and is in the process of being implemented here in the second quarter. So the pricing environment has strengthened in chlor-alkali, and we see that continuing now for certainly through the next couple of quarters. On the force majeure declaration at our Natrium plant a couple of days ago, that was at the end of a scheduled outage. And as we started up the plant, we ran into a couple of equipment issues. We are making good progress now in bringing that equipment back, and now we're talking, let's say on the order of days for this force majeure and the outage rather than any additional outage, let's say rather than weeks or something more serious. So there was no catastrophic event, but we just did have some equipment issues as we started back up from that outage, but we're confident that this thing is -- it's positive here and we should have some good news in the coming days.
Kevin McCarthy: Okay, that's good to hear. And then just as a follow-up, Chuck, what is the status of the pending bolt-on acquisition that you have in the Pacific Northwest on chlor-alkali? And maybe you can comment on kind of the background of that deal, how it helps you.
Charles Bunch: Equa-Chlor, we expect to close on that deal on the 2nd of May. So it is in process. And for us, this was an attractive bolt-on acquisition. It actually fit strategically with the rest of our footprint here in North America. We thought that there was excellent synergies for PPG, both in terms of our operations. And we have not been a major player for a number of years on the West Coast. And actually, the acquisition has been welcomed I think by the market and some of our customers as increasing our flexibility and our ability to support them. So for us, it's a small bolt-on. I think the timing is good with the improvements we're seeing in the Chlor-Alkali business here in North America. It has a solid customer base, and we think this is a logical and very nice acquisition opportunity and clearly a bolt-on for us in this business.
Kevin McCarthy: Okay. Thank you, Chuck.
Operator: The next question will come from the line of John McNulty, Crédit Suisse.
John McNulty - Crédit Suisse AG: Just a couple of questions. In the Optical business, you noted that there was going to be some higher growth focus and some incremental advertising and selling costs, is that something that -- how should that be hitting the margin? Is it something where it'll be an incremental hit, or does it just offset some of the positive leverage with sales going higher?
Charles Bunch: I think what you'll see John is, we think that it will improve our growth trajectory in the business. We have some exciting new product developments on the Transition side, which is the biggest single business in that Optical and Specialty Materials segment. And I would look to see those margins sustain themselves but bring us a little stronger top line growth and comparable bottom line margins.
Vincent Morales: I'll remind you, John, the business has some seasonality to it, as well.
John McNulty - Crédit Suisse AG: Okay, sure. Thanks a lot. And then with regard to your TiO2 supplies, it sounds like you're looking for a broader supplier platform. In terms of the contracts that you're looking for, are you setting things up for longer term in the event that there may be supply issues that the market actually starts to further tighten here with the U.S. or European markets getting better on the housing front?
Charles Bunch: Well, I would say that the -- I wouldn't say our contract practices or policies have changed. We do try to contract to the extent that we can with most of our major suppliers. So we have contracts in place now with TiO2 and with other major raw materials. And we try to the extent possible, to protect our interest going forward with these contracts in the event that there are supply disruptions or issues.
John McNulty - Crédit Suisse AG: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: And the next question will come from the line of Bill Young, Chemspeak.
William Young - Longbow Capital: You mentioned maybe switching to some other polymer technologies in order to mitigate raw material costs. Could you expand a little bit on that, please?
Charles Bunch: Well, I think the entire industry, the entire coatings industry is faced with the increasing cost pressures that we've talked about in TiO2 and other commodities. TiO2 does provide -- as you know, the principal benefit of TiO2 is its hiding powers in paint formulation. So all of the industry, not only the coatings companies, but I think all of the broader non-TiO2 chemical suppliers are looking and working on initiatives -- research initiatives to develop either new formulations or new products that can go into our paint formulations that will minimize the amount of TiO2. And some of those projects, and for those of us who have been around for many years, we can remember when we had a lot of these substitute type of products that were actively in development. Some of those continued through the years, but maybe without the same emphasis. And I think you've seen from everyone in the industry now a focus on research and development to help offset what has been, obviously, 1 of the most inflationary raw materials in our basket.
William Young - Longbow Capital: Well, I think, I don't know, 10, 15 years ago, Rohm and Haas introduced what they called ropaque, and do you think that had any meaningful impact? And how about the second generation types of products along these lines?
Charles Bunch: Why, yes, I remember the days of the ropaque polymers from Rohm and Haas. And I think they had some general acceptance in the industry and were used. And I don't know that those uses were growing over time, but certainly, now, with the Rohm and Haas assets being in Dow's portfolio, we've seen a number of initiatives and announcements from Dow that they're putting more emphasis and more research behind those products. So they haven't gone away. And I think in many cases now, the non-TiO2 producers are working hard to come up with products that they feel will help the coatings companies with this raw materials supply and pricing issue.
William Young - Longbow Capital: Okay. Thank you.
Vincent Morales: Thanks, Bill.
Operator: And the next question will come from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn, Longbow Research.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: A couple of questions as most of mine have been answered. First of all, when you talk about up to maybe 1/2 dozen acquisitions of the bolt-on nature that you're getting ready to complete over the next 6 to 9 months, are they likely to be -- can you give us an idea of where they would be geographically? And business-wise, are you looking to take advantage of some opportunities in the chlor-alkali land perhaps to expand your footprint, or is it going to be confined to the coatings market?
Charles Bunch: Our focus is, although not exclusively so, it's going to be primarily in the coatings space. And geographically, we have talked in the past that we wanted to improve our position in the emerging regions or the developing regions. Those have, in some cases, proved to be somewhat challenging. The 1 acquisition that we made in the fourth quarter of last year, which was Bairun in China, was 1 that we were able to complete there. But I would say geographically, we've broadened the search now. We've also included Latin America. We're also looking at Europe where maybe the growth prospects aren't as strong, but where we have already a very well-established position and that would give us an opportunity for more cost synergies to get us through what has been a lower growth environment here for the past couple of years, but strengthen our position where we are already well situated.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: All right. That's helpful. And on the second question I just want to make sure I understand the volume in foreign exchange impacts in the EMEA decorative coatings, as well as volume growth in Commodity Chemicals.
Vincent Morales: What's the question, Dmitry?
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: The question is, what's the volume in foreign exchange contributions to the European Coating Paint business? And what is the volume contribution to the commodity, and if there is any foreign exchange in there as well?
Vincent Morales: In the Architectural Europe business, currency was negligible less than 1%. And in Commodity Chemicals, currency was -- make sure I got the right number here, again, virtually negligible, rounding to 1%.
Robert Dellinger: Chuck mentioned in Architectural Coatings EMEA, it's pretty well split between volume and price.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. So about 3 1/2% to 4% in each then? And [indiscernible] chemicals of the 27%, 28% growth that you saw, I would imagine it's mostly price but was there any positive volume?
Charles Bunch: Yes, there was positive volume, but you're right, the bulk is price.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: All single-digit volume?
Charles Bunch: Yes.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. That's all I have. Thank you.
Operator: And the next question will come from the line of John Roberts, Buckingham.
Gaji Balakaneshan - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: This is Gaji Balakaneshan sitting in for John. First question, aside from nat gas prices and maybe the random force majeure, is there anything you see that could affect commodity chemical profitability for the rest of the year?
Vincent Morales: Well, again, I the biggest driver there, Gaji, is demand. Demand remained strong. Chuck mentioned the unfortunate events in Japan have constrained supply, at least temporarily. So we've said since the beginning, or the end of the year, we remained bullish on this segment and that still holds true today. That we feel good about the supply-demand economics. We do have that tailwind from natural gas, so we feel good about the segment.
Gaji Balakaneshan - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. And then with the constant rising inflation for commodities, at what point do you start getting concerned about demand destruction? Maybe not with your customers but from the economic activity in general?
Charles Bunch: I would say that it's a concern for, I think, not only our company but every company. I mean we went through, as we all know, in 2008 -- in the first half of 2008, we had very solid global growth, a lot of inflation especially on the oil and petrochemical side. And it ended badly with a financial crisis, Lehman and the like in the second half of the year. So I think inflation is a concern for any business, but in terms of where we see economic growth or the macroeconomic conditions, we think it's still solid. Now we're going to have probably more inflation, and I think as you see companies that are in the middle of the supply chain like we are in many of our products as we push through the inflation that we're receiving on a lot of these raw materials or metals and we push them through to our customers, it will lead to more inflation at the consumer level where you really haven't seen it as much here in this country. But we have a weak dollar and you have strong growth outside, so I think the risk here is that inflation heightens, especially in the U.S. And that crimps the buying power of the consumers and threatens some of the nice recovery we've had in end-use markets like automotive.
Gaji Balakaneshan - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Would you say that -- just to follow-up on that, would you say that your margins are higher than back in '08 when we last saw these price levels in commodities? So maybe that -- it seems like everybody has higher margins this time around, so maybe that demand destruction started happening earlier that it would have in '08 if we didn't have the price shock $140-barrel oil.
Vincent Morales: Gaji, I think that if you look at our margins, 2 big deltas versus '08. 1, we took a tremendous amount of cost out during the recession in coatings. I don't have that specific number in front of me, but hundreds of millions. And secondarily, were still down close to 10% in volume. Now we've worked hard to offset price in raws. But volume and cost are the 2 big deltas versus '08. And one's positive, obviously, and one's negative to margins.
Gaji Balakaneshan - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay, Great. Thanks for to help.
Operator: And the next question will come from the line of Don Carson, Susquehanna.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: Thank you. A follow-up on chlor-alkali, Vince, what was the sequential increase in ECU pricing and the roughly $170 of ECU increases on the board? What do you think the sequential progression could be in Q2 and Q3?
Vincent Morales: We don't give specific pricing, Don, for obvious reasons, commercial reasons. But we did get our fair share of the caustic increase. Chlorine held fairly stable throughout the quarter. And as Chuck mentioned earlier, we have 2 price nominations for Q2 that, based on recent market events, I think, he would feel good about them or emboldened about them.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: So do you expect what, to give out half of those in Q2, maybe, and the balance in Q3?
Vincent Morales: Historically, based on historical perspective, that's probably accurate.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: Okay. And Chuck, back in '08, chlor-alkali was a nice hedge against rising coatings raws, and that business should be up nicely this year. I mean, how much of the increase in your coatings raw materials do you think the improved chlor-alkali earnings this year could potentially offset?
Charles Bunch: Well, it's going to be a significant assist to us on this, and we have appreciated in the past the offset that we get sometimes in these really inflationary periods. So we're going to see, we think, in the improvement year-over-year in chlor-alkali. We're going to offset quite a lot of that coatings raw material increase. On an overall corporate basis, we don't tend to look at it like that but from an external standpoint, we're certainly there. We try to evaluate these businesses on their own.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: Okay. And then just a follow-up on Coatings, you mentioned that America's and Asia's architectural volumes were up. Was that all in Asia? What did your U.S. architectural volumes do this quarter and...
Charles Bunch: U.S. -- okay go ahead.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: And then just wondering if you'd sort of segregate that by channel and make any market share comments whether you're up or down.
Charles Bunch: The volume improvements in Architectural Coatings were modest. We're talking low single-digits. We had more improvement in terms of top line sales from pricing initiatives. And we're obviously facing lots of raw material initiatives there. So we had some modest volume improvements. And I would say that it was, from a channel perspective, I would say it was about even. We have a slightly different quarter here, Easter is later this year, the weather has been a little slower. So there are a few little offsets, so I think the real trends will probably be more evident after the end of the second quarter. But we certainly think we've come up slightly off the bottom. And most of the things that I've seen out there in terms of some of the commentary around commercial construction or even residential is that maybe were going to have modest improvement and that was the case in Europe as well. So a little bit of volume, mostly more price and I would say I'm not -- I haven't seen other announcements and I think it's too early to say there'll be any significant share change for PPG right now.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: Thank you.
Vincent Morales: Thanks, Don.
Operator: And the next question is a follow-up question from the line of Frank Mitsch, BB&T Capital Markets.
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets: Yes, just a couple follow-ups, on the chlor-alkali side, I'm trying to figure out here that you're going to lose some volumes with the force majeure and the turnaround. But it seems like pricing in the second quarter is going to be higher, significantly higher than what you had. And so my question is, as I look at the calculus there, are we looking at a second quarter that could be slight to up from the first quarter?
Vincent Morales: Commodity chemical, second quarter, Frank?
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets: Correct, yes. I mean, you've got -- obviously you're taking a volume hit but your margins are going to be -- your margin per ton is going to be higher.
Vincent Morales: 3 moving parts there, Frank. 1, the downtime. So a fewer tons. The second would be the maintenance costs will be higher, which is multimillion dollar shifts higher in maintenance costs. And you're exactly right, we do expect stronger pricing to compensate, if not more than compensate for that.
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets: All right. And then as we look at it in the third quarter, you're just going to start the quarter at a higher level and then you'll get the tonnage back. All right, fair. And then Bob, you mentioned that you bought back, or Chuck mentioned in his speech, you guys bought back $275 million worth of stock. And you also mentioned that you feel very good about adding some bolt-ons on the M&A front over the next 6 to 9 months, does that preclude any additional actions on share repurchase? How are you thinking about that?
Robert Dellinger: It doesn't preclude any additional action. But we have been certainly saying we're looking for activities that are earnings accretive, which should be share repurchases and acquisitions, to the extent acquisitions are running at a higher level, we'll dial down the share repurchases. And we still feel very good about the stock price. It's still at a point where share repurchases are attractive.
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets: All right. And now you're paying a higher dividend on it, so that helps you as well. Thanks a lot.
Vincent Morales: Thank you, Frank.
Operator: And the next question will come from the line of Brian Maguire, Goldman Sachs.
Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Thanks for taking my question. Obviously, an admirable job keeping margins flat at the Coatings businesses, and I noticed in the press release some commentary about aggressive cost management. And given that you guys did a great job of pulling costs out during the downturn and were kind of at the point of the business cycle where companies are usually adding them. Just wondering if you could expand on where you're seeing those opportunities, and if that could continue throughout 2011 to keep offsetting, continuing higher raws?
Charles Bunch: Well, I would say that we haven't been able to completely offset raw material increases with pricing. But we have continued to get favorable volume, which is helping us. And cost initiatives, we're always working on these. We haven't had any announced restructurings since 2009. But we continue to try to look for ways to run our businesses more efficiently. But I wouldn't say that we have significant new cost initiatives outside of what we're trying to do on a regular basis.
Robert Dellinger: I'd say that as the volume comes back, we're being very disciplined on controlling corporate overhead. And therefore, we're seeing overhead as a percent of that incremental volume growth at much lower levels.
Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay, that makes sense. And then if I think about your business in terms of incremental margins, thought about it being in a range of 30% to 40% and you were kind of in that range this quarter. Obviously that gets tougher to do as you go on and as we get closer back to prior peak levels. But given that we're still -- volumes are still maybe in the order of high single-digit percentages below prior peaks, can we still get in that range on that volume growth and still get that kind of leverage? Or are we maybe moving it down a decile here?
Robert Dellinger: We're comfortable with that range well into this year, Brian.
Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay. Great. And then just 1 housekeeping thing, could you tell us what the quarter-ending share count was?
Charles Bunch: It's in the press release.
Robert Dellinger: 160.5, I think.
Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Got you.
Charles Bunch: Diluted.
Robert Dellinger: Diluted.
Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: All right. Thanks very much.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We do have another question, it is a follow-up from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn, Longbow Research.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: Quick question, excuse me, on a comment that was made earlier in answer to 1 of the questions. When you talked about margins, you said that they should be comparable in the second quarter to what we see. I just want to make sure, comparable to what we saw in the first quarter or comparable to what we saw a year ago?
Robert Dellinger: Dmitry, our business is very seasonal...
Charles Bunch: So it would be year-over-year.
Robert Dellinger: So it would be year-over-year.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC: Year-over-year. Okay, that's what I wanted to make sure, because otherwise it was really scary. Okay, thank you.
Robert Dellinger: Thanks for the clarification.
Operator: And there are no more questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Chuck Bunch for closing remarks. Please proceed.
Charles Bunch: Thank you very much for your attention, and all the good questions that we had. And we look forward to talking to you again at the end of our second quarter. So thank you very much.
Operator: And thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation. This concludes today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2010 PPG Industries Earnings Conference Call. My name is Tuwanda and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Vince Morales, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Vincent Morales: Thank you, Tuwanda. Good afternoon. This is Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations for PPG Industries. Welcome to PPG's Fourth Quarter 2010 Financial Teleconference. Joining me on the call today from PPG is Chuck Bunch, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Bob Dellinger, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer; and Dave Navikas, Vice President and Controller.  Our comments relate to the financial information released on Thursday, January 20, 2011. As a reminder to everyone, and as we communicated last quarter, we have modified our quarterly earnings call process. Approximately one hour ago, we posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on our Investor Center at ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call. We will not read those prepared remarks during this call. During the call, Chuck will share his perspective on the company's results for the fourth quarter and full year, and then we will move directly to Q&A. The modified process will allow substantially more time for Q&A. Both the prepared commentary and discussion during this call may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company's current view about future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks which may cause actual results to differ from such forward-looking statements. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates to these forward-looking statements. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are also available under our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly-comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC. Lastly before we begin, I will remind you that we held a detailed Capital Markets Analyst Day in mid-December 2010. The presentation slides for that event contain further details about our industry, businesses and then news [ph] markets. And those slides again, are available on our website.  Now let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch.
Charles Bunch: Thank you, Vince, and welcome, everyone. PPG posted record sales and earnings per share this quarter, capping off an excellent 2010 full year performance. We achieved record fourth quarter sales on strong price and volume gains. And despite continued currency headwinds, our sales in local currencies grew by 10% year-over-year. Our broadening businesses in emerging regions once again delivered double-digit sales growth including in Asia, where our sales this quarter grew by more than 15%. Also, for the full year, I am very pleased to report that our Asia-Pacific region surpassed $2 billion in sales, up nearly 25% with strong earnings growth approaching 50%. We leveraged the higher sales, delivering record fourth quarter earnings per share. The global economic recovery began to gain traction during the fourth quarter of 2009, making this quarter's year-over-year comparison more relevant. So our 50% year-over-year earnings per share increase is meaningful. In addition to the volume gains, another factor in the fourth quarter was higher selling prices. In the quarter, every one of our segments delivered higher pricing versus last year. In looking at the year in total, the company's pricing has increased in each quarter during the year.  In our Coatings businesses, these higher prices offset or minimized margin compression from inflating raw material cost. Coatings' raw material inflation began to escalate in the middle of 2010 and remained at persistently high levels through the fourth quarter. In our Commodity Chemicals and Glass segments, pricing gains were a contributor to the segment earnings recovery trends and were driven by higher demand as the end-use markets continue to recover. Also, despite the ongoing recovery, we have continued aggressive management of our operations and overall cost structure. In 2010, our operating segments reduced cost by $100 million from our prior restructuring actions, plus an additional $50 million-plus from other manufacturing and cost management initiatives. This $150 million of savings is in addition to the $350 million we delivered in 2009, resulting in over $500 million of lower cost in comparison with 2008. Looking at our performance on a segment basis, we posted record fourth quarter segment earnings, easily eclipsing our prior record by more than 15%. Our combined Coatings and Optical and Specialty Materials segments also delivered both record sales and earnings in the quarter. Our broad geographic Coatings footprint enabled us to take advantage of continuing improvements in overall global industrial activity and continued expansion in aftermarket activity levels.  In Optical and Specialty Materials, we once again drove excellent top line growth and maintained our trend this year of expanding year-over-year margins. In what is typically a seasonally slow period, weak construction and maintenance markets continued to weigh on our Architectural Coatings business in Europe, although our Architectural Coatings volumes in our U.S. and Canada business were essentially flat with the prior year. Our Performance Coatings and Optical and Specialty Materials segments, both top margin performers for PPG, also delivered fourth quarter earnings records and have continued future growth prospects. Architectural Coatings' EMEA earnings declined due to weakness in market demand. Also, our Industrial Coatings segment results were lower as price, volumes and costs improved, but not sufficiently enough to fully offset inflation. As a benchmark in past inflationary cycles in Coatings, it has taken two to three quarters for our pricing initiatives to fully counter inflationary impacts. We have additional pricing increases being implemented in 2011, and I am confident we are on pace to fully counteract inflation in our Coatings businesses in the first half of 2011. Also, as in the past, our Commodity Chemicals segment is once again serving as a hedge to inflationary pressures impacting our Coatings businesses. Segment margins grew to over 19% this quarter as the earnings improvement trend continued due to higher pricing. In addition, our Glass segment earnings also improved substantially, driven by higher end-use market activity coupled with our continued cost management actions. In 2011, these businesses should continue to benefit from tight market conditions and lower natural gas cost as our prior year's higher cost hedges will roll off. Fourth quarter earnings for the Commodity Chemicals and Glass segments combined, improved by over $90 million versus last year. This performance, along with the combined record Coatings and Optical and Specialty Materials segment earnings were key factors in our record fourth quarter earnings per share. This is the second consecutive quarter that we delivered record earnings. Overall for 2010, I was very satisfied with our performance. We fully capitalized on the partial economic recovery, maintained our sharp focus on cost management and leveraged our global breadth and leadership positions in our businesses. Also, we extended our legacy of returning cash to shareholders by returning about 75% of our cash from operations, or nearly $1 billion, to shareholders in the form of an increased annual dividend payout and share repurchases. Our record second-half earnings performance and near-record full year earnings demonstrate how strongly we are emerging from the recession. This performance is despite full-year volumes that were still $1.2 billion below pre-recession 2008 levels, including continued anemic activity levels in construction markets in the mature regions. We are only now beginning to see the full earnings power of the company and we are carrying this momentum forward into 2011, when we anticipate recovery in the global economy to strengthen and broaden. This should drive volume increases for PPG, which we expect to leverage at high margins as we continue to manage our costs. We anticipate that our strong emerging regions penetration and several of our leading businesses, like Optical products and Aerospace, will continue to serve as significant growth drivers. Also, as I mentioned previously, at the outset of the year we are implementing a variety of selling price increases throughout our portfolio with the objective of offsetting Coatings margin compression and furthering our Commodity Chemicals earnings improvement trend. Finally, we are working on initiatives to deploy the nearly $2 billion we have in cash and short-term investments with a focus on growing earnings and increasing shareholder returns.  That concludes our prepared remarks. Now operator, would you please give instructions and open the phone lines for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Chuck, can you talk a little bit about the sequencing you see of raw material inflation? I know at the December event you talked about particularly in Coatings, the first half, some supply availability issues, and in the second half Ti02. But I guess here in recent weeks, we started to see oil reaching some new highs and maybe putting some more pressure on the raw materials slate as you go into '11. So can you just talk a little bit about the dynamics between price and cost as we go through the year?
Charles Bunch: On the cost of raw materials, we averaged in Coatings, mid-single digit increases for 2010, Bob. But obviously, that built, so that as we were ending the fourth quarter here in 2010, those were in the higher single digits and we, in terms of percentage increases -- and we saw it across a broad range of products. And we didn't see quite as many, although there were still some supply disruptions, but you had it on both the organic and inorganic sides, TiO2 being one of them. Other pigments, we had some of the metals which play a role in our formulations in Protective & Marine Coatings, they were also up. Now starting here in 2011, we're seeing a little additional raw material pressure. I would say at this point, this would be low-single digit increases, but on top of where we finished at the end of 2010. So we are still facing some headwinds here on the raw material inflation for Coatings. We have started raising our prices starting in mid-year of last year, working through some of them, but actually the inflationary numbers have continued to move. So in every one of our businesses today, we have additional pricing actions. In some we have formal price increase announcements out, in others we are actively negotiating with customers to pass these price increases on. And as I have mentioned in the remarks, typically it does take two to three quarters to fully capture all of these inflationary price increases. I think the fact that we have a little bit of a moving target means that we're still in price increase mode in our businesses. But we're looking, as we go through 2011, to fully capture those price increases. And we don't, in terms of the current forecast, we don't think things are going to accelerate as aggressively as they did last year, but we are seeing the same trends that you mentioned. Oil prices are up. And we've seen recent increases in commodities like TiO2 or propylene. But on the other hand, we haven't seen as much recent increases in natural gas, in ethylene as an example. So right now, we are expecting more inflation for our Coatings' raw materials, but not quite at the pace that we saw in the second half of last year.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: You had a slide in your deck that I thought was pretty compelling, showing how much earnings power there still is from a volume recovery, given you're still quite a bit below where you were before. Just curious, how do you internally measure cost versus that volume recovery as you look forward? And maybe you can talk a little bit about how you would size the margin opportunity in your businesses, some of which are already pretty darn high. But it looks like there's a lot of volume leverage still in the pipeline.
Charles Bunch: For us, our variable cost margins typically run between 40% and 50%, depending on the business unit and the geographic region. So certainly, we think that we have that kind of opportunity to improve as volume grows, but we don't think that we have significant cost to put back in to our supply chains and our businesses. We are still running in many businesses, especially in Coatings with the exception of where we are today in China. For the most part, we have capacity available in our Coatings businesses to fully capture the incremental margins at variable costs. So we're relatively optimistic that this can be done as volumes improve.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG: Chuck, on raws. Could you actually size the delta you think you might see in both Q1 and the first half of the year between raws and selling price increases you bring forth?
Charles Bunch: No. I would say obviously, if you look overall at PPG, we don't think there's an issue at all with the increases that we're seeing across the board in all of our business units. And we're obviously going to outpace inflation in businesses like fiberglass or chlor-alkali. I would say that for the Coatings businesses, we think it would be a relatively small number. We are obviously chasing some of the increases that we just talked about. But we feel fairly confident that as the year proceeds, we're going to be able to recapture a lot of these increases with pricing.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG: And Chuck, just on Glass, had a very strong back half of the year. Is that $60 million EBIT number in the back half, is that a run rate going forward for full year 2011?
Charles Bunch: I would say that typically, the fourth quarter is not the strongest quarter for the Glass segment. We think that the earnings improvement that we've seen, especially in fiberglass, should be sustainable as we go into 2011. We've talked a little bit about some of the pricing opportunities. We haven't seen the same kind of raw material inflation impacting those businesses. The flat glass business, performance glazings, as we've called it, has not had the same recovery yet because it is tied to the North American construction markets. But even there, I think we certainly view that we've hit bottom and we think there may be some modest upside. So I think the run rate is actually a good number as we start here in 2011.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rex Ryan with BB&T Capital Markets.
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets: This is Frank Mitsch sitting in for Rex Ryan. As PPG has progressed here, obviously the comps have gotten more difficult, then you start out with 12% volume growth earlier in the year, ending with 5% at the end of the year. So as you look out at 2011, the commentary in the release was fairly upbeat in terms of the global economic environment. What sort of volume forecasts is that -- are you looking at something mid-single digits in terms of volume increases off of a decent 2010? How would you characterize that environment out there?
Charles Bunch: I would say that's a good number, Frank, especially on the industrial production side. We're probably going to be here in North America at that level. Certainly in Asia, a little higher, maybe slightly lower on the industrial production side. So I'd say mid-single digits is a good number. The thing that's holding us back still has been the weakness in construction markets, both here in North America and in Europe. And I'm getting slightly more optimistic, although I've felt this way before and it hasn't followed through, but I think the North American businesses that have that construction exposure will actually, I think, begin to show some improvement as we go through the year. Europe, it's a little foggier over there. We haven't seen much volume improvement, so I'm a little less optimistic that Europe construction will help us. But overall, when I look across the board, in our Optical segment, when I look at even chlor-alkali on the volume side, I think those are good numbers across the board for PPG.
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets: With respect to Europe, you indicated that it was kind of stable in terms of the decline in volumes that you saw 2010 versus '09. Would you think that we've stabilized here? Or would you continue to see volume erosion in Europe?
Charles Bunch: I don't think things are getting, let's call it worse, in terms of kind of a rate of decline. But we still haven't seen this thing flatten out in terms of volume declines in Europe construction. We have in our other businesses in Europe, and in fact in some businesses like Automotive Refinish in Europe, we had an all-time record year. So I don't want to overstate our reliance on the Architectural EMEA business, it's an important business for us. It hasn't started turning yet, but I would say the rate of decline, I expect to improve in that business during the course of the year. And we are still seeing growth overall in businesses like Refinish or Aerospace, or even Protective Coatings in Europe. So it's not all gloom and doom over there, but certainly, that's the weakest region right now for us.
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets: Lastly, you did a transaction with Dominion recently at your Natrium in West Virginia facility. Can you comment on what the benefits are to PPG with that transaction? And then more broadly, what sort of transactions might you be looking at now that your balance sheet has really been shored up here?
Charles Bunch: Well the transaction with Dominion was really facilitating, I guess you would call it, their building of a natural gas liquid separation plant. And at the West Virginia Panhandle end of the Marcellus Shale, as many of you know, this is the wet natural gas, let's call it. And we're hoping that this is an overall stimulus, not only for the economy down there, but I think there are some real opportunities to build on the low-cost cheap natural gas in the region. We're going to get, I think, some small improvement in terms of providing services to them. We're going to sell some land that we no longer need. But we're also looking at other opportunities at that site, as is Behr, who is our neighbor in West Virginia, for opportunities to capitalize on this Marcellus Shale gas that sits underneath the region, including our plant.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi.
Daniel Jester - Citigroup Inc: This is Dan Jester sitting in for P.J. I was just wondering, architectural paint volumes were flat in the U.S. Are you seeing any differing trends in the contractor market versus DIY.
Charles Bunch: I would say at this point, no. The fourth quarter is the seasonally low period. It's hard to discern a lot of trends, I'd say. I wouldn't want to put too much on a segment by channel differentiation, but we are encouraged that overall the volumes were stable. And I actually think now that we may see some improvement in volume as we go through the year. Some of the housing data, although it's still mixed, is encouraging. The weather is going to be a little cold here starting off this year. But I'm getting a little more optimistic about the volume scenario right now.
Daniel Jester - Citigroup Inc: Would you expect your store count to be sort of flat for 2011? Or maybe up or a little bit down?
Charles Bunch: I would say that our store count is going to be flat or slightly higher, but it won't be lower. So we continue, I think, to right-size the footprint. And we think now going forward, especially as we get a little more confident that this housing market isn't going to get any worse, that we have the store count that will work for us as business improves.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Douglas with KeyBanc.
Douglas Chudy - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: First on the volumes, you mentioned that sales volumes still remain about $1.2 billion below, I guess, the 2008 peak levels. Can you give us a sense of how this breaks down by the various businesses? Maybe where you see the greatest near-term opportunities to recapture volumes?
Charles Bunch: Well the biggest opportunities would be in the developed regions in the Industrial and Performance Coatings segments. Although we feel good about the growth in automotive builds here in North America, we still only got up to about 12.5 million builds in 2010. That's still about 20% below what was the run rate for most of this decade here in North America. So that's an example of an industrial market where there is more growth opportunities. Similarly, in Europe, we didn't go quite as low there, but there is Automotive growth potential there, although we're not as optimistic in Europe in Automotive as we are here in North America. The other big sets of businesses would be those related to the construction markets. Obviously, we have exposure both here and in North America in both residential and commercial construction. And also in the, let's call it the residential repaint, or the aftermarkets for maintenance and repair, we're still below the volumes that we experienced just three years ago. So that would be another opportunity where we see the volumes improving. But in the short term, it's going to be in the more industrial markets, plus those Performance Coatings like Aerospace which is, I think, ramping up now; refinish, which experienced quite a sharp decline in 2009, is bouncing back. This winter weather that we're all experiencing these last six weeks should help us in terms of accident rates in the near term. So there are some things that give me confidence that we have plenty of opportunities, even here in 2011, to recapture some of this lost volume over the last three years.
Daniel Jester - Citigroup Inc: Secondly, did I hear you correctly? That the incremental margins are somewhere in the neighborhood of 40% to 50% depending on the businesses?
Charles Bunch: I would say that's a good benchmark. It does vary. But typically, most of our businesses are more what I would describe as material intensive. They're not as labor intensive so we don't have to add big increments of labor cost as we increase production.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: Question on the Commodity Chemical business, in chlor-alkali in particular. Just wondering if you can be more specific on what kind of price increase you had in the fourth quarter. In particular, how much of that last $50 industry price increase you realized? And what sort of price momentum you're expecting in the first quarter? And I guess, compared to your average gas acquisition cost of $5.50 in 2010, based on your current hedging position in the strip, where would you expect gas cost to come out in '11? That is, what kind of benefit do you think you get from being less hedged than last year?
Charles Bunch: First question, Don, on Commodity Chemical pricing. In particular, caustic, we were working through the last industry price increase of $50. We captured some of that in the fourth quarter, and we think we will finish capturing that here in the first quarter of 2011. And there's momentum in the marketplace. Volumes have been good, inventories are low, several of the key end-use markets like aluminum and pulp and paper, refining, have all been picking up activity levels. We haven't seen any additional pricing from the end of the year increases, well, one of the competitors announced. But certainly, the one that was the $50 that you referenced at the beginning of the fourth quarter is still moving through the system.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: And gas costs?
Robert Dellinger: Yes, our blended unit cost in the fourth quarter was about $5. If you look at our hedges for 2011, on average, we have about 12% of our need hedged and that's greater in the first half, lower in the second half. And that hedge position is about $7.25. So make your assumption on the market price and you get pretty close.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Kevin McCarthy: You made a comment in the transcript on the website that you'd anticipate returning cash and short-term investments back toward historical levels in 2011 versus the December 31 level approaching $2 billion. And I was wondering if you could just comment on, I guess A, what that historical level is. If I look back to the '06, '07 time frame you were running the balance sheet with about $500 million in cash, which would imply you could take it down $1.5 billion and then be -- as you proceed down that path, how are you thinking about M&A versus the pace of share repurchases?
Robert Dellinger: Kevin, I'll be happy to take that. I think $500 million is a pretty fair view of historical. That's what we'd like to get to over some period of time. Our first goal for deploying cash is obviously to drive earnings growth, and our preference would be mergers and acquisitions. And we've talked a lot in the past about bolt-on acquisitions in the, call it $50 million to $250 million range. And I think as we regularly evaluate the pipeline and probability of those deals closing and crossing the transom, we'll consider share repurchases if we don't see sufficient acquisition activity over time. We certainly don't have any pre-determined goal by quarter of the targeted cash balance or how quickly we're going to get back to historical levels. But that's the direction you should expect.
Kevin McCarthy: And then as a follow-up, with regard to capital expenditures, you spent $158 million in the first nine months of 2010 and then nearly that amount, or $150 million, just in the fourth quarter. You've always been somewhat back-end loaded there, but it strikes me as perhaps more pronounced seasonally than usual. Would you comment on what's driving that and what the outlook is for 2011 there?
Charles Bunch: I'll be happy to take the fourth quarter question. We've made some progress in spending in China. As you know, we've been working on a resin plant in Zhangjiagang. We have a production expansion going on in Wuhu, some transitions expenditures in China. And I think those are probably a pretty significant driver of the increase in CapEx in the fourth quarter. I think we've talked a fair amount at the December investor conference about our outlook for capital going forward, and I would expect we're still in that range.
Operator: And your next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research.
Eugene Fedotoff: This is Eugene Fedotoff sitting in for Dmitry. Could you comment on your outlook for your Marine business in 2011?
Charles Bunch: In Marine business for us, it's part of our Protective & Marine Coatings business unit. For us, the Marine OEM segment, which we're looking for what I would call the first decline in this kind of late cycle building would be in that 25% of the SBU that is exposed to the OEM builds. The other half of that Protective & Marine Coatings business is infrastructure or protective coatings-related. There, you're painting bridges, you're painting oil rigs and the like. We think that, that business is going to be good. And we also think the aftermarket business for Marine is going to be improved over last year. You have more of these ocean-going vessels in service now, they're requiring maintenance and painting. So I would say overall, we think that it's going to be a low growth environment in 2011 with the aftermarket and protective pieces overshadowing that Marine OEM build number.
Eugene Fedotoff: You commented that cost savings were $150 million for 2010. How much of that was in fourth quarter? And what are your expectations for cost savings in 2011?
Robert Dellinger: I'd be happy to get it. I think the easiest way to think about our cost savings is that if you compare full year 2010 to 2008, we would say our costs are down roughly $500 million. Half of that, so say $250 million, was driven by the restructuring projects, and that is permanent cost savings, so we'll experience that even as volume comes back. A part of the remaining $250 million are other actions consistent with the decline in market, a part of that will come back as volume returns, maybe in the neighborhood of a third to a half as volume returns to '08 levels, and that's what you should expect going forward. Most of the cost savings we had realized before we got to the fourth quarter this year, of 2010.
David Navikas: In the fourth quarter, Eugene, our cost savings were still approaching $30 million excluding a ramp-up we had of ad spending and advertising and selling we had in Transitions.
Eugene Fedotoff: So we shouldn't expect any cost savings in 2011, is that correct?
David Navikas: We expect further cost savings in 2011 as we do every year.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Buckingham Research.
John Roberts - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: The strong volume in Asia in Industrial Coatings, are there any initial fill effects of e-coat tanks? You've a lot of activity going on in terms of new auto build and stuff and are the new tanks being added? Or is that strictly a meter-click type sale, every time a car is coated?
Charles Bunch: I would say that the business in Asia in Industrial Coatings is fairly broad-based in terms of technologies or coatings layers. So it's not all driven by e-coat. We've had excellent growth in non-e-coat, or even automotive-related businesses like consumer electronics. And I would say that our success in the China Automotive Coatings market is broad-based. So it's not just e-coat, it includes the top coats and primers so that -- and this is not a kind of a one-time pipeline fill for e-coat tanks although we are doing that on a consistent basis in both Automotive and some of our industrial applications.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John McNulty with Credit Suisse.
John McNulty - Crédit Suisse AG: With regard to the M&A pipeline that you're looking at, has it gotten any bigger recently? Or how does it look relative to where it's been over the last, say, couple of quarters? And then with that in mind, if you can also speak to maybe the competitive environment for those assets? And how you're kind of thinking about that?
Charles Bunch: I would say that our list -- and we talked a little bit about this at our capital markets presentation last month. The list is probably a little broader or longer. And frankly, we were able to do one deal in the fourth quarter last year. We would have liked to have done a few more. It's taking a little longer. And I would say in regards to the list, it’s probably longer, but they're probably more weighted to the smaller end of the spectrum in terms of the overall size of the acquisition. So that if we're going to maintain our target level of use of cash for good M&A, we may have to do more deals. But these deals would be at smaller levels than maybe we originally thought as we started ramping up at the beginning of 2010.
John McNulty - Crédit Suisse AG: And with regard to the competitive environment for those acquisitions. With rates where they are, are you seeing more bidders for these assets? Or is that not the case yet?
Charles Bunch: There haven't been that many overall deals. If I look, all of the major coatings players look like they're interested in doing deals. There were only a few deals last year that were completed, and I think it's in some cases, it's the sellers waiting a little longer for things to get a little better, if they think that they have some earnings momentum. In other cases it's -- as you go to smaller companies in some cases, there is a longer time period to getting to certain stages in the deals, getting people comfortable with the process, whereas sometimes when we've done bigger deals, you have more sophisticated or experienced management teams on both sides of the table. And as you go into smaller opportunities, it is a longer process.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Wesley Brooks with Morgan Stanley.
Wesley Brooks - Morgan Stanley: I just had a question on the Optical business, just where you're thinking about margins for 2011. Obviously, they've ramped up quite significantly in the last couple of years. And just your thoughts on -- are they sustainable at this level? Do they go up from here? On 2011 and on sort of a more medium-term view.
Charles Bunch: The margins that we have now in the business we think are sustainable at these levels. We're not necessarily looking to expand these margins significantly from this point. It is a business, especially on the Optical side, where we have driven growth over the years in a combination of new technology, developments and branding activities, including a heavy component of advertising. So as we look to how we're going to grow the business, I would say that we want to keep a certain level of advertising and promotional spending but we have to support these new product development and commercialization activities. So we're not -- we feel the biggest opportunity for growth in the segment is growing that top line at the existing margin levels. But likewise, we don't see a significant risk to these margins declining. We have seen it be sustained over the last few years, and we think that the Specialty Materials component of that segment, the precipitated silicas and the Teslin inorganic printing sheet materials have improved their performance significantly over the last two years, but we think to a sustainable level.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And with no further questions, I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Chuck Bunch for closing remarks.
Charles Bunch: We want to thank all of you for listening in to our Fourth Quarter 2010 Earnings Call. I hope you feel as optimistic as we do about the performance that we turned in, in 2010, here in the fourth quarter and our optimism as we go into 2011. So thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's conference. That concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect and have a great day.

The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates on these forward-looking statements. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the company has provided in the appendix of the presentation material, reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The agenda for today’s discussion is noted on slide number three. And now, let me introduce PPG’s Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch, who will provide the opening remarks.
Chuck Bunch:  Thank you Vince and welcome everyone. This afternoon, I will provide a brief overview of our second quarter performance. Bob Dellinger will review details of our financial results. I will make a few closing remarks and then we will take questions. PPG’s strong results this quarter benefited largely from a 10% increase in volumes. The breadth of geographies and end use markets that we serve is enabling us to leverage continuing positive momentum in global industrial demand. The performance of our portfolio is being elevated by higher industrial activity and strong demand across Asia/Pacific and Latin America which is more than offsetting weak construction in North America and Europe. Our performance and growth occurred consistently through the quarter and all of the major regions contributed. Our earnings per share were close to 2008 pre-recession levels as we leveraged the volume growth with our now lower cost structure. Our earnings this quarter were aided by an improved sales mix in some of our top performing businesses such as Aerospace, Auto Refinish and our Optical and Specialty Materials segment.  As a matter of fact, both Optical and Specialty Materials and performance coating segments posted record earnings results. Our Optical segment posted sales growth rates approaching 20%, and it remained our top operating margin segment. Performance Coatings delivered record earnings as margins grew by over 200 basis points. Our auto refinish, aerospace and protective and marine coatings businesses, all delivered increased sales which more than offset the impact of lower volumes in our US Architectural Coatings business. Our Industrial Coatings segment continued to approach historical earnings levels. In the second quarter, the segment delivered 12% operating margins for the first time since 2006. Segment volume growth was more than 25% versus a recession-weakened prior year period. We achieved 40% growth in our automotive OEM Coatings business, easily outpacing the 25% year-over-year global industry growth and we continue to realize double-digit percent growth in our general industrial business in the emerging regions. In architectural coatings, EMEA, our volume performance was consistent with the past several quarters, declining about 5%. Currency conversion negatively impacted sales and accounted for half of the earnings drop. Results in our commodity chemical segment improved nicely versus last year on higher demand and lower input cost. Most notable was the $50 million improvement versus the first quarter of 2010 due to improving pricing, higher demand and lower natural gas costs. Our glass segment benefited from substantially improved performance in our Fiber Glass business, including improved equity earnings from our Asian joint ventures. The strong and continued improvement in the company’s financial performance this past quarter occurred despite demand that still remains more than 10% lower than 2008 pre-recession levels. Our strong performance clearly reflects the benefits from our improved business portfolio along with our lower cost structure. We are positioned for further earnings growth opportunities as the global economy continues to recover and through utilization of our strong balance sheet. Now, I’ll turn the call over to Bob to provide additional details on our financial performance for the quarter.
Bob Dellinger:  Thank you, Chuck. I will begin by reviewing the year-over-year bridge of our second quarter sales which is detailed in the accompanying slide pack on slide number four. Sales improved about $340 million or 11% versus the second quarter of 2009, which was negatively impacted by the global recession.  Overall pricing improved modestly, by about $20 million. Higher prices in our coatings segment offset lower pricing in the glass businesses and more specifically in our performance glazing business, which remained impacted by weak US construction markets.  Year-over-year pricing was also lower in commodity chemicals, however pricing levels in commodity chemicals this quarter have moved higher versus the first quarter of 2010. Compared to last year, currency conversion reduced sales by $9 million as the impact of a much weaker Europe was nearly offset by stronger currencies in Asia, Latin America and Canada.  As Chuck mentioned, we realized a strong increase in volumes. This improvement of more than $300 million was driven by higher global industrial activity in all regions of the world. Weaker construction markets in the mature regions of Europe and North America attracted somewhat from our volume growth.  As illustrated on the graphs, our year-over-year volume comparisons this quarter were similar to the first quarter despite a more difficult comparison period in 2009. As detailed on the lower right chart in comparison with 2008 pre-recession levels, we remained down more than 10%, also comparable to the first quarter. Further details on our sales are contained on the next slide. As you can see the emerging regions of Asia/Pacific and Latin America are continuing to grow faster than the developed regions of the world. Asia/Pacific continues to be a considerable growth platform for the company but primarily by our industrial businesses serving both exports from the region and local consumption within the region.  While there is concern regarding property value appreciation in China as detailed on the top right chart, only 3% of our total Asian sales stem from China architectural coatings. In the United States and Canada we continue to experience solid growth, again driven by higher industrial activity along with improving commodity chemical demand. However, our business selling into the construction markets declined versus the prior year due to the continued weakness in those markets.  Somewhere in the last quarter, our volumes in Europe increased slightly versus the prior year’s quarter and as we expected heading into the year, the region lags the other major global regions in overall pace of economic recovery. However volumes remain stable as our industrial businesses continue to benefit from higher activity levels including more exports from the region, which is offsetting the continuing modest weakness in the construction markets. Looking ahead for the company, the global economic recovery began to take hold in the second half of 2009, and as such, our second half comparable periods will be more difficult. Also the third quarter’s traditionally a slower quarter seasonally in several of our businesses and we expect this historic trend to continue this year. However for the second half of 2010 we do anticipate to benefit from the continuing of the macro trend of gradually improving global industrial activity and expect construction markets to remain sluggish.  Our adjusted earnings per share is presented on the next slide. A reconciliation of these amounts to our reported earnings per share is included in the appendix to today’s presentation materials, which is available at the Investor Center on our website at ppg.com. In the quarter, our adjusted earnings per share were $1.64 versus $0.91 last year. Clearly the largest contributor in our improvement was the benefit from higher sales volume. Traditionally, our lower cost structure including the savings from our prior restructuring actions and our lower tax rate contributed heavily.  While our selling prices were higher, they did not fully offset the impact of higher coatings raw material cost. Coatings raw materials began to inflate early in the year due to higher demand and several supplier outages and that inflation increased in the second quarter. In total for our coatings businesses, cost rose mid-single percent, although the rates differ by region and by business. Further inflation pressures have subsided and we are now working to offset the transitory margin compressions in several business units with additional pricing initiatives.  Currency conversion also negatively impacted our earnings. Stronger currencies in Asia, Latin America and Canada offset a weaker year within our business segments. However, our corporate costs were impacted by just over $10 million as our losses from converting balance sheet exposures this year compared with gains in the second quarter of 2009.  Lastly, we lowered our 2010 tax rate to 28% based on the geographic mix of projected full year results. When compared with the company’s previously estimated 2010 tax rate of 30%, the lower rate added $0.07 to our second quarter results, including $0.02 based on the catch up of reducing the rates for the first three months of 2010. Our second quarter 2009 tax rate was 33%.  Moving now to review our individual business segment, let me start on the next slide with Performance Coatings. In the quarter, sales exceeded $1.1 billion, growing by $45 million versus the period year’s period. Overall volumes were flat; however, the segment experienced positive currency conversion and delivered higher selling prices, which were focused on countering inflation. Earnings advanced by $32 million versus the prior year to a quarterly record of $190 million. Operating margins expanded 230 basis points as our continued strong cost controls supplemented the improved sales mix resulting from the performance of several of our top performing business units.  Our automotive refinish business continued to recover from last year’s recession and customer de-stocking. Aided by an improved general economic recovery and higher miles driven, the business accelerated to double-digit sales growth this quarter excluding modest favorable currency impact. Sales also grew in our protective and marine and aerospace business. These businesses both have a sizeable aftermarket component, serve late economic cycle industries and did not experience anywhere near the same degree of volume decline during the recession as most of our other businesses.  Combined sales for these businesses this past quarter were up low single digit percent versus last year, reversing the trend of very modest sales declines that we experienced in the past four quarters. We expect the stable nature of these businesses to go unchanged.  Volumes in our architectural coatings, America and Asia/Pacific business declined mid-single digit percentages versus last year but the trend was modestly improved versus the year-over-year results in the first quarter. Results in our national accounts or do-it-yourself channel once again outpaced our company-owned stores. US volumes continued to be hampered by restrained commercial construction activity and continued depressed levels of residential housing activity. However, selling price actions we initiated in the business earlier in the year had been successful, and we are selectively seeking additional price for the second half of the year in an effort to offset raw material inflation. Looking ahead, we expect the overall construction markets in the United States to remain at low historic levels for the foreseeable future. Overall, Performance Coatings has continued to deliver strong results that are being further enhanced because some of our top performing businesses are growing more rapidly. Also aiding the segment results is the size of our Asian business, which is now the second largest region for the segment and it’s delivering the highest growth rate. We expect the improved business and geographic mix to continue to aid the second half results. The Industrial Coatings segment results are on the next slide. As you can see, the segment’s financial performance has continued to strengthen. In the quarter, sales grew 27% or about $200 million to $939 million, with nearly the entire gain coming from volume growth when compared with last year’s recession impacted results. All regions participated in the strong year-over-year growth, and importantly sales levels in each region were consistent with or higher than first quarter 2010 levels. Earnings improved by $84 million to $112 million and our operating margin is right below 12%. In addition to the higher volumes, lower costs from both cost management and restructuring related initiatives also contributed. Higher raw material costs somewhat tempered these earnings improvements. Automotive Coatings, our largest individual business in this segment experienced 40% volume growth in comparison with last year’s very low level. Our growth outpaced the overall global auto industry production figures, which grew by more than 25% versus weak prior year global production figures. Sequentially, industry production advanced about 6% versus the first quarter of 2010. In general, the industry continues to match production with sales and inventories remained at low levels from a historical perspective. Sales for this business in each region reflect strong year-over-year sales growth led by our US region which posted 75% growth on both end use market recovery and market share gains. The third quarter is normally a seasonally slower quarter due to planned automotive OEM facility shutdowns. And we expect a similar but less acute pattern this year. Our Industrial Coatings business unit delivered solid growth levels around 20%, further reflecting an improving general industrial economy in all major regions. Both Asia-Pacific and Latin America growth was around 40%, similar to the first quarter. Growth in the mature regions also was consistent with the first quarter between 7% and 10%. All of these sequential comparisons are despite a more difficult comparable period in 2009. Our Packaging Coatings business also delivered moderate sales growth and solid financial results. This business remains a consistent performer. Overall, the Industrial Coatings segment continues to return toward historic operating margins. The absolute earnings we achieved this quarter were our highest second quarter results in a decade, despite sales volumes that still remain nearly 15% below pre-recession 2008 levels. Looking ahead, we anticipate traditional seasonal impacts to result in lower third quarter sales. We will keep our cost focus and we remain comfortable with the prospects of continuing gradual recovery in the global industrial market.  Results for our Architectural Coatings Europe, Middle East and Africa or EMEA business on the following slide. Sales in the quarter of $500 million were down $27 million versus last year’s period and earning declined $5 million. Currency conversion was a notable factor in the sales decline and accounted for half of the earnings decline.  Over the past year, the results of this business have been stable and this pattern held true during the quarter. Volume trends remain consistent with the recent quarters down mid-single digit percent to do continued sluggish housing and construction markets in the geographies we serve.  As illustrated on the bottom-right chart, our geographic footprint includes very little to no exposure in Southern European countries and other countries which have experienced the most significant declines in construction, including those such as Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain which combined account for only about 1% of segment sales.  As we have traditionally shown included on the slide are the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA, we believe EBITDA is a relevant measure for this segment given the ongoing non-cash amortization expense from the SigmaKalon acquisition. As detailed EBITDA margins were once again comparable this quarter versus last year. Looking ahead, we anticipate similar business trends will remain and based on current exchange rates we expect currency conversion to again detract from year-over-year segment results in the third quarter.  Our Optical and Specialty Materials segment results are detailed on the next slide. Versus the prior year, second quarter sales surpassed $300 million up $46 million up nearly 20% volume growth. Earnings grew by 41% to $86 million a new record for this segment. Both, business units Optical Products and Silicas continued to benefit from improved overall demand, new product sales and product line extensions.  Our Optical Product sales are now approaching the peak levels we achieved directly following the introduction of our Generation 6 Transition Lense product. Our operating margins were consistent with the past quarter and remained at more than 28% through the first half of the year, which is detailed on our chart compares favorably versus prior years doing parts of the benefits of restructuring actions completed in 2009.  Looking ahead, the third quarter is typically a slower quarter seasonally and we anticipate this trend will continue this year. The next slide displays our Commodity Chemical segment results, compared with last years second quarter sales advance by more than $40 million and earnings grew by $11 million. Improved demand more than offset lower caustic soda pricing and our higher capacity utilization positively impacted manufacturing cost.  In comparing results, this quarter versus the first quarter of the year we delivered significant improvement as the business has rapidly recovered from trough earning levels. Sales advanced $32 million as higher volumes were coupled with higher pricing for the ECU which is an aggregate of chlorine and caustic soda prices. Segment earnings jumped by $50 million as sales gains combined with lower natural gas cost.  Despite our higher production rates, increased demand has cut our inventory in half versus last year. Looking forward we expect modestly higher natural gas unit cost in comparison with second quarter and we are implementing additional previously announced price increases in both chlorine and caustic soda. Our glass segment results are on the following slide. Sales were $247 million, up $40 million or 19% due to dramatic improvement in fiber glass volumes which in turn are a result of improved global industrial demand. Segment earnings improved to a $16 million profit compared with a loss of $7 million in the prior year. The 60% year-over-year increase in fiber glass volumes resulted in improved manufacturing utilization, upto nearly a 100% capacity utilization at quarter’s end. Activity levels in the US architectural glass market, both commercial and residential construction built by our performance glazings business remained challenging. Equity and royalty earnings continued to improve during the quarter and we also benefited from lower costs including savings from the restructuring actions we completed last year. We are pleased with the positive earnings momentum and looking forward, we have recently initiated further selling price initiatives. Let me conclude my remarks by discussing some cash details which are on the next slide. We ended the quarter with just under $800 million of cash on hand, down from last year’s $1 billion level. As we began to deploy our cash in a balanced manner over the past 12 months. We spent about $50 million on capital expenditures during the quarter, bringing our 2010 year-to-date total to $93 million. We also repaid more than $50 million of debt in the quarter bringing our year-to-date total to about $200 million. We don’t anticipate any further debt reduction of significance for the remainder of the year. Our quarterly dividend payments, an important part of long-standing heritage at PPG were $90 million and a total of  $180 million for the year. We also spent slightly over a $100 million on repurchasing 1.6 million shares of PPG stock. We have more than 4.5 million shares remaining under our current share repurchase authorizations. Year-to-date returning money to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks which is a PPG legacy has accounted from nearly half of our cash usages. One other cash item is pension contributions and as we previously stated, we expect full year 2010 contributions to our pension plan of $240 million and have contributed about $50 million year-to-date. For the full year of 2009, we put approximately $450 million in cash and company stock into our plans including $210 million in the first half. Our cash position still remained very strong, especially when considering that due to the seasonality of our businesses, our strongest cash generation quarters are in the second half of the year. We intend to remain disciplined and balanced with our cash deployment, but with a focus on growing earnings per share. We are reviewing potential bolt-on acquisitions and also anticipate further share repurchases will be a likely use of cash this year. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Chuck for some closing remarks.
Chuck Bunch: Thanks Bob, I will conclude by reiterating a few key items. Our global geographic footprint and a broad set of end-used markets that we serve are continuing to yield benefits. This was clearly in evidenced this past quarter as we leveraged the moderate global industrial recovery. Our results were aided by growth in emerging regions and an improved sales mix resulting from stronger results in our top performing business, including Optical and Specialty Materials, Aerospace and Auto Refinish. Our commodity chemical segment rapidly returned to solid profitability and our glass business delivered mid-single digit margins on strong fiber glass demand. As with the first quarter, we continue to experience solid earnings leverage on higher sales volumes, reflecting the benefits of the structural cost reductions we completed during the recession. Let me conclude by commenting that I am encouraged with our earnings recovery and that I believe we remain well positioned to capitalize on what we anticipate to be a continued gradual global economic recovery. Also, we are beginning to utilize our strong balance sheet to accelerate growth. We are currently reviewing several small to mid-sized acquisitions in the $20 million to $250 million range and intend to remain active on share repurchases. That concludes our prepared remarks. Now operator, would you please give instructions and open the phone lines for questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch from BB&T Capital Markets.
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets: You’d hardly know that there’s concerns about the economy out there. I mean it’s the best result in several years at a minimum in the second quarter. We've been hearing a little bit about on the paints and coatings side that the raw materials have become tighter. I think you alluded a little bit about how the price inflation of raws has outpaced your selling prices. Can you talk about the availability of raws, is that hampering? Are your volumes to any extent and I know that I think Bob mentioned that you've got some selective price initiatives underway in that sector, would you anticipate that that would fully offset by year’s end, the raw material inflation that you have seen so far in that sector?
Chuck Bunch:  I would say that we had a few spot shortages during the second quarter. There were a couple of suppliers that had unexpected outages or production problems. It probably shifted some business around for us, but we don’t think we lost any orders on an ongoing basis and if anything probably a little of the activity would shift into the third quarter. So, availability is not a major concern for us right now and pricing has stabilized in the markets for our principle raw materials, so some of the feedstock costs as we've talked previously in propylene or ethylene are actually drifting down. So, at this point we don’t see supply issues and we think that raw material pricing is stabilized, albeit at a higher level than we saw at the beginning of the year.
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets: All right, terrific and obviously nice job by Mr. McGarry and his team. Can you comment a little bit about the pricing that you've realized, the $80 in the second quarter, I guess you've got 35 to 50 on tap in caustic for the third quarter, chlorine $50 on the table for the third quarter. What is the status of those increases as well as and I guess, I think you indicated it was going to be marginally higher, how does that interplay workout as we look at the third quarter?
Chuck Bunch: Well if I stick with your first part of your question, Frank, the pricing environment in core alkali is firm, we have now been implementing the $80 that was announced in the second quarter, the industry didn’t get all of that at once, it was phased in over the second quarter and now with the $35 increase announced in July, we think that this will be implemented on a customer basis probably taking into consideration at what phase they were in contracts. So right now we do not anticipate any significant problems in implementing the second or this smaller third quarter increase, volumes have stayed up on the caustic soda side, inventories are low and we feel confident about the pricing environment for caustic soda. There has been a price increase initiative in Europe, stable pricing in Asia, so on a global basis, we think that we have a solid pricing environment for caustic soda. On chlorine, there was a $50 announcement here in the third quarter that we expect to be phased in over the course of the quarter depending on contracts. There is a little more resistance with the PVC customers, but the other merchant chlorine customers are receiving price increases. So here too we feel that the pricing environment for chlorine is stable to firm.
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets: Chuck, if I could read into your tone, it doesn’t seem to me like you are a man troubled by the possibility of a double dip coming up, is that fair?
Chuck Bunch: If you recall, what we’ve been through over the last couple of years in the chlor-alkali business, Frank. In our description of our results here for the second quarter and it's probably been a trend for a little longer, the industrial activity has been quite good, strong, restarting from recession levels, but the construction markets especially in the developed regions have been weak. We had these same economic conditions here in North America, weak construction markets, therefore weak PVC production; that strengthens the opportunity for firm pricing in caustic soda. So, we have shown in 2007-2008 that strong industrial activity while we have weak construction activity actually helps the merchant players like PPG, and it strengthens the pricing environment for caustic soda. So at this point even if we continue this economic environment that we saw in the second quarter, we feel quite optimistic that we’re out of the trough for the chlor-alkali business and then we should continue to build all the momentum that you saw after lunch here in the second quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy from Banc of America
Kevin McCarthy - Banc of America: Would you elaborate on the relative strength that you saw in auto OEM versus the industry, is that a function of geographic mix in North America and Asia or did you perhaps gain share or maybe you are aligned with the right brand owners at this point?
Chuck Bunch: Kevin, this is Chuck. I would say that what we have seen is a good customer mix on part of our PPG customer portfolio on automotive OEM. I would say one of the biggest upsides for us though has been our position in China. We are the number one automotive OEM coating supplier in China. We have a broad-based customer array including the global players like General Motors or Volkswagen and also a very good position with the domestic and regional producers. So I would say we had some gain from there. We are also very well aligned with the German producers now. That hasn't always been the case for PPG but if you look at our position with the BMW or Mercedes, the German automotive producers have been the strongest in Western Europe. We are well aligned there. We are also seeing good growth in Russia where we have a nice position. General motors and other customers here in North America, I think we are well positioned, but I would say the single biggest factor in our volume gains are coming from our position in China. 
Kevin McCarthy - Banc of America:  With regard to fiber glass, I think you mentioned you are operating near 100% capacity at this point. Is the demand strength there being driven more by electronics or by reinforced plastics there? And then given the notion that you are nearly sold out, what does the future look like? In other words, should we anticipate greater pricing power or possible expansions required at some point?
Chuck Bunch:  On the two markets for fiber glass, both of them are running equally well. So if you take our reinforcements business which is primarily supplied for PPG here in North America and in Western Europe, we are operating at a sold out capacity basis. We are implementing price increases for four reinforced products and we have almost full capacity utilization. We have one idle furnace that we are attempting to bring on here in the second half of the year. So we are sold out in the West and implementing price increases. Again, a lot of this is driven by the capacity reductions by ourselves and many of our competitors during the recession and we think the environment is very solid for the coming years now because of some of these capacity rationalizations.  On the electronics side, which is, we participate through a large joint venture that we have with Nan Ya Plastics in Taiwan, in China; that business is booming and we are running at capacity, there have been a number of significant price increases, and both sides of the business or end-used markets, reinforcements and electronics are driving both the volume and profitability improvements that we see in that business Union and it's reflected overall in this segment. So we feel pretty good about fiber glass right now. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of John McNulty.
John McNulty - Credit Suisse:  Just two quick questions. You think the economy and the industrial economy in particular is going to gradually keep improving, are there any areas where you saw any incremental weakness as you went through the quarter?
Chuck Bunch: Incremental weakness as we went through the quarter? I would say no. If you look at you know geographically, probably the industrial economy that’s still growing but at a slightly slower rate would be Europe. We are seeing even automotive OEM production. We are forecasting a modest volume improvement in the second half. This would be 5% or below. The rest of our industrial activity we think will be up in the second half in Europe, but certainly not as strong as what we are seeing in Asia, Latin America or even the North American markets. So right now as we went through the second quarter, we pre-announced guidance in the middle of June and we expected I think at that time to make the middle to higher end of the range but actually the second half of June finished strongly, and a couple of businesses notably chlor-alkali continued to accelerate through the rest of the month. We didn’t see any fall off in sales or orders in key markets in Asia or North America. So through the second quarter and now here starting in the third quarter, we have not seen an inflection point, certainly not down, and the continuation of the current trends that we’ve talked about in these announcements. 
John McNulty - Credit Suisse:  Thanks for the color on that. And then with regard to your architectural business, you had indicated the DIY market was stronger than it sounds like the stores business or contractor business that you do, was it positive and stores negative or were they both negative and it was just a degree of one being worse than the other?
Chuck Bunch:  They were both negative for us in the second quarter, DIY, a little less so than the stores or contractor business. Not appreciably different, although obviously, when we go through retailers or independent dealers, those aren’t direct sales. Sometimes we will move inventory into their locations and depending on when they move out from the warehouses or get on the shelves, we don’t always see as regular an order pattern as we would in the stores. So it wasn’t an appreciable difference, but weak volume in both places, less so though in DIY. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sergey Vasnetsov from Barclays Capital. 
Sergey Vasnetsov - Barclays Capital: Chuck, if you compare your volume recovery, specifically in your performance and industrial coatings businesses, maybe by large segments and by region versus the underlying market, where would you say that you gained some market share? It sounds like it was a case in automotive OEM, is it true? And also which other segments or geographies if that’s the case?
Chuck Bunch:  Well, I would say after automotive OEM our view, although again this is a business that goes through a two step distribution. Automotive Refinish had a very nice quarter. We think we are gaining share there and that is a global business for us, so we are well positioned in the fast growing regions like China, but we think we are gaining share in that business. Aerospace, we had a modest volume improvement there. We are gaining share although our shares in that business unit are already quite high. And the other businesses we feel that we had more than held our own, although I can't say at this point we don’t have enough market data from the second quarter. The other businesses such as our General Industrial business, our Protective & Marine Coatings business, these would be businesses that we felt we didn’t see any appreciable share loss and it could turn out when we get all the data that these could be either stable to actual market share gains, but certainly Automotive OEM, Automotive Refinish, Aerospace would be coatings businesses where we were gaining share.
Sergey Vasnetsov - Barclays Capital: And so when you think about the sources of that share gains, is it your low cost base so you can compete more effectively, did you bring some new technology that you didn’t have and other people didn’t have for the past couple of years, or what is it that allowed you to gain some share?
Chuck Bunch: I would say the principle reason for gaining share in these markets is technology and global position. So if you take automotive OEM, we are very well positioned, globally. We have worked hard to establish ourselves in markets like China, not only with the global players, but with the domestic players. We have a full product array to meet all of their needs. There is a move in automotive OEM to what we would call a shorter or a compact processes where we can deliver cost savings but provide the same corrosion and decorative protection. So I would say that clearly it’s global position in technology in automotive OEM. In Refinish, we feel that we have the best waterborne or water-based refinish system out there that’s helping us to gain share, especially in markets or regions where they are going from a solvent-based to water-based mandated system. So we think we are well positioned there and we have always been not only the market leader, but the technology leader in our aerospace products. So I think in all three of these, it would be global position, but technology. We have a better cost base certainly in these businesses after our restructuring and I think you see the effects of that, but certainly we’re not trying to win any business by just pursuing a lower price strategy. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of John Roberts from Buckingham Research.
John Roberts - Buckingham Research: Hi. I was a little surprised that DIY North American volumes were down. You have easy comps there, there’s not a lot of commercial exposure. I thought there was some negative weather in the March quarter that might have benefited the June quarter and you had the housing stimulus that sort of drove turnover very high during the quarter.
Chuck Bunch: Well, I think if you look at the DIY segment, I haven’t seen the big box retailers comps yet. But if you remember, our first quarter numbers were very weak in January and February; then we had a very strong surge in March that I think that showed some strength for us in the first quarter. We also had some weather certainly in the second quarter, I don’t know across the country but certainly here in the North East June was a very wet and rainy month.  So, I would say that it’s a little early for us to see all of the market data out there but certainly we don’t see the same momentum on either the DIY or our company owned stores side although we are working hard at it, taking cost out but there is just not as much market strength as we would have hoped. 
John Roberts - Buckingham Research: Secondly, on slide number four where you show the sales volume index, could you just provide may be some of the outliers, so optical is probably at a new high, fiber glass sounds like it’s at a new high, and then you have some things that must be down still 20% from the 2008 level like commercial construction coatings or others. Maybe most things are probably near the average but where are the outliers?
Chuck Bunch: Well, I would say that the weakest business that we had would be in our glass operating or reporting segment and that would be not the fiber glass business which drove a lot of the improvement but it would be that performance glazings business and that is primarily a North American commercial construction and North American residential construction play. So that was probably the weakest business out there from a volume standpoint for PBG. The other two businesses that were weaker from a volume standpoint, we've talked about architectural EMEA down about 5% and the North American architectural business is similarly down.  So, I would say of the businesses in our portfolio, those would be the three and coincidentally they are all construction related here in the developed economies in North America and Europe.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: Chuck, on your industrial businesses, what’s your visibility and order book? I know you are expecting continued growth. What do you actually have booked for the next period of time and how typical is that?
Chuck Bunch:  I would say, as we've looked, let’s take the biggest business in that segment which is automotive OEM. We have visibility typically two to three months out and there's good forecasting not always completely accurate for the full year. And if you take the North American business, we started this year thinking that North American auto and light truck builds would be a little under 11. And then I think at this meeting three months ago we said, hey, 11, 11.5 and now I’d say it’s probably 11.5, maybe 11.6.  So, we have continued to see a good momentum out there, inventory levels are imbalanced. So our forecast if anything, have moved up slightly. In Europe, we aren’t expecting as strong a second half, but there is still volume growth as I’ve mentioned earlier. Russia is better than we thought, the German producers are stronger. And in China even though we’re probably not going to have the easy comps that we had in the first three or four months of the year, there is still good growth in Chinese automotive OEM productions.  So that we’re maybe not going to be plus 40% as we were in the first three or four months, but we were saying all along that we thought that production could be up 15% to 20% in China, for this year. We’re still sticking to that forecast, probably at the upper end of that. And we haven’t seen things appreciably slowdown in China, at this point. So, I would say in automotive, we’re not seeing any significant deviation from what we’ve been looking at.  On the industrial side, that is a whole range of products, including appliances, consumer electronics, coil and extrusion, and I would say that the business has been solid if not great, like automotive OEM. We haven’t seen any inflection points yet. Certainly as I’ve talked about our electronics exposure in fiber glass is booming. So, at this point you know we are watching, because obviously there is some negative sentiment, if you look at the media and what they’re projecting for the second half. We have talked about the one market that we thought in China may be overheated, which is Chinese construction, especially residential construction markets. We have much less of an exposure there. We have an architectural business in China, but it is the smallest of our major coatings businesses. We are doing fine there as well but we are watching that one. So at this point, we have not seen an inflection point. We are watching and we are a little cautious because of some of the headlines out there, but our businesses continue to perform well and we haven't seen a drop off yet.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: And Chuck just on raws versus price, in Q3 would you expect your prices to now exceed your raws?
Chuck Bunch: If they would, it would be I think slight. I think we are trying to implement price increases now, and as I told you a stabilizing environment for coatings raw materials in the third quarter. So I said we may -- we will recapture what we haven't been able to get. Whether we over capture, I'm not sure at this point but I think you are going to see a more stable environment going forward and we will catch up a little bit here in the third quarter on pricing.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: And for Bob, on your tax rate I know the geographic mix has shifted, lowered your tax for this year. Given the continued growth in those regions, do we stay at 28% in 2011 as well?
Bob Dellinger: At this point, I would stick with that. We certainly look at this as we get new [ph] forecasting, but right now I think that's pretty confident to model 28%. We saw strength in Europe in our industrial base and at an attractive tax rate and we had Latin America turn profitable and we are offsetting those profits with a net operating loss position. So those were favorable to our rate and yes I feel pretty comfortable 28%.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar of Citi.
P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup: Disappointing to see that North American architectural volume is down and correct me if I am wrong, but DIY was up last year. So I'm wondering why is it going down this year, and is it the case that maybe you lost share at those?
Chuck Bunch:  I'd say it’s a little early for us to say. We certainly don’t feel that on the stain side. On the paint side, I think it depends on promotions during the quarter. We know that we have the mid and lower price points. That was more favorable position during the recession environment and it may not be quite as favorable now. We are promoting our products adequately. We haven't seen anything on the paint side yet that would show us we have a lost share, but I would say that overall it's still been a sluggish environment out there. And again depending on when we have our sales into the retailers, it doesn’t always match up on a quarter-to-quarter basis with the sales out the door. 
P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup: And then you had a price increase in your stores earlier in the year. Did that stick in this environment? And then can you talk about your next price increase that you mentioned?
Chuck Bunch:  Yes, we did have a price increase in our architectural stores business in the first quarter that was eventually followed by the other competitors in the market. At this point, we have not announced another price increase in our stores business and so we are monitoring the market and our position and depending on if we continue to see the stable raw material pricing environments, then we will not necessarily initiate a price increase in our stores.
P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup: And then if you take back, can you just talk about your outlook for the 2010 painting season, you know just talk about stores versus big boxes and what are you seeing on the remodeling activity?
Chuck Bunch: Well, I think what we are seeing is a continuation of the trends that we have seen over the past certainly a year and a half. We have not seen a resumption of strong volume activity in our stores business, which is a contractor oriented, these are contractor oriented stores. This is the commercial contractors as well as the residential painters.  I don’t see any reversal of the trends that we had commented on last year, if anything maybe the residential pieces slightly stronger, but more than offset by the continued weakness on the commercial side. DIY, I don't have all the data from the big box retailers to compare it, but not only in the same store sales, but they are paint department sales, but I would say on balance, the DIY is probably a little bit stronger then the contractor business and I would think that these will be confirmed as we go through the third quarter and see some of the major retailers releasing their same store sales growth. 
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn of Longbow Research.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research:  Good afternoon gentlemen. Congratulations on a very strong quarter. Couple of questions although most of them have been answered. Number one, you mentioned that you are going to have a little bit of seasonal slowdown in the automotive build rates going forward sequentially. On year-over-year basis, how do you look at this business, given the cash for clunkers programs in both the US and Europe last year or is that not a concern given how strong your position is in China and how rapidly things are growing there as well as your market share gains that you've been able to get over the past year? 
Bob Dellinger:
 : I would say on the automotive OEM side, there were scrappage programs just about every region and country in the US. If you look at the cash for clunkers specifically, it was a third quarter of 2009, fourth quarter of 2009 influence. So the comparables for us in the third and fourth quarter of 2010 versus 2009 will be not as good as the second quarter because if you remember the second quarter of last year, that’s when we had the bankruptcies of GM and Chrysler. That was probably the industry at its weakest. So, obviously on a year-over-year basis, we’re going to not show the same degree of improvement in the second half and we think that sales will continue to improve versus last year’s level without cash for clunkers.  In Europe, again, the eastern European countries, Russia, they are coming out of their recession rather well and the production there is growing. Germany benefiting I think from a stronger German economy and the export opportunities with that weaker Europe. So, I think even without the scrappage programs that a number of European countries have instituted last year, we are still going to see modest sales growth in Europe.  And in China, they did have some incentives in 2009 especially for smaller cars. Most of those are projected to decline in the second half or certainly into 2011. But right now, we see the growth rates moderating somewhat in China in the second half again, because of the strength of 2009 but still solid growth in that market even if some of the incentives from the Chinese government for the small vehicles are withdrawn.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research: You talked about of the importance of fiber glass business due to the profit improvements you received in the segment. Can you quantify for us or at least ballpark for us how big that business is within the glass division?
Bob Dellinger: On a sales basis, they are about equal. The two businesses, although in fiber glass we do have two Asian joint ventures that don’t show on the sales line, that do help us on the net income line, but the businesses have an equal weight in sales in the sector.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research: And profit, I am assuming it's significantly more coming from the fiber glass if not all?
Bob Dellinger: All the improvement came from the fiber glass business in this quarter and we looked to see that trend continuing because there is a lot of momentum right now in fiber glass or we are going to get some additional pricing, the performance glazings or flat glass business. Again, commercial construction is still weak out there. We’re doing a lot of good cost work, have a number of new product initiatives. We have some opportunities we think in solar energy. But right now overall, that weakness in commercial construction is over shadowing all the good work we’re doing in other parts of the business.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research: In the fiber glass business is there much difference in the growth rates between epoxy resin systems versus urethane resin systems?  
Chuck Bunch: I would say the biggest would not be in those areas, these are nylon and polypropylene based systems that they’re going into on the reinforcement side. You have epoxy resin systems as substrates with fiber glass on the electronics side and we’ve seen strength in both of those. Electronics has been booming but the reinforcements business which goes into a lot of industrial applications like automotives, that’s been very strong.  We’re seeing more use of fiber glass and plastic systems in automobiles because of the light weight advantages. We’re also seeing a little more activity on wind blades, an important part of our, what we would call our direct drill product line and fiber glass goes into wind blade production, that’s been a little inconsistent over the last couple of years.  We think wind power is the most competitive alternative energy source but some of the funding and financing for these big projects has been stalled out, so we haven’t seen quite as much growth there as we anticipate. But longer term, wind blade production for fiber glass and solar energy, glass production for performance glazings should be good market drivers for us in future years. 
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research: That’s helpful. And last question on the tax rate, and you talked about 28%, is that going to be your rate for the year implying that in the second half you are going to be kind of a more in the 26%, 27% or is that the tax rate for the second half of the year?
Bob Dellinger:  That’s the tax rate for the full year. Okay we had a $0.07 benefit in the first half I showed in the second quarter associated with the 28% rate for the first half was the 28% rate in the second half, 28% for the full year. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan [ph] from Susquehanna. Hello, your line is open. 
Unidentified Analyst : The Commodity Chemicals segment, could you just update us on how the pricing initiatives are going and you expect any weakness there if you do see some slowness in industrial activity in the second half?
Bob Dellinger: Well, I went through some of the pricing initiatives for both caustic and chlorine, reviewed what had happened in the first and second quarter, here in the third quarter. We are seeing as I mentioned a very solid pricing environment for caustic soda. We think industrial activity is maintained, inventory levels are low, the cost basis for US-based industry in chlor-alkali because of the lower natural gas cost, lower ethylene, the export environment is solid, the dollar after a period of strengthening seems to be now or reverting to a weaker footing.  And in fact if I look at anything over the last week or so on the euro dollar, that’s going to help us a little more than we got helped in the second quarter and it will also I think potentially keep the European imports out of North America as I mentioned (inaudible) just announced a price increase for cost accelerating in Europe for the Asia aluminum settlement and caustic was up so I would say that the pricing environment right now is very solid and if industrial activity, if we see a return to the conditions so we saw 18 months ago where industrial activity dropped off, could that change this outlook conceivably but right now we haven’t seen that and if anything we're seeing more of a reversion to the conditions in 2007 and 2008 which led to record caustic soda prices and drove significant earnings improvement for our chlor-alkali business.
Unidentified Analyst: So I guess most of the other operational questions have been answered. The only other one was, just on the corporate level, what’s the kind of the right corporate level that you think would be on a quarterly basis expensed?
Chuck Bunch: What I would do [Arun] is average the first two quarters and use that for the basis for the second half for the year.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to turn the call over to management for closing remarks.
Chuck Bunch: I’d like to just thank everybody for their patience during our technical issues and we appreciate everybody’s time today and look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes the presentation, you may now disconnect. Have a great day.

Presentation: 
Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the first quarter 2010 PPG Industries earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today’s conference, Mr. Vince Morales, Vice President Investor Relations.
Vincent Morales: Hello. This is Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations for PPG Industries. Welcome to PPG's first quarter 2010 financial teleconference. Joining me on the call today from PPG is Charles Bunch, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Robert Dellinger, Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer; and David Navikas, Vice President and Controller. Our comments relate to the financial information released on Thursday, April 15, 2010. Visuals supporting this briefing may be accessed through the Investor Center on the PPG website at www.ppg.com. As shown on slide number two, our prepared remarks and comments made in the subsequent question-and-answer session may contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company's current view about future events and their potential affect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could affect the company's operations and financial results and, as discussed in PPG Industries’ filings with the SEC, may cause actual results to differ from such forward-looking statements. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates on these forward-looking statements. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the company has provided in the Appendix of the presentation materials reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The agenda for today's discussion is noted on slide number three. And now let me introduce PPG’s Chairman and CEO, Charles Bunch, who will provide the opening remarks.
Charles Bunch : Thank you Vince, and welcome everyone. This afternoon I will provide a brief overview of our first quarter performance. Robert Dellinger will review details of our financial results. I will make a few closing remarks and then we will take questions.  Throughout the first quarter we continued to experience a moderate recovery in several of the global end use markets that we serve. This recovery combined with lower costs resulting from our restructuring initiatives the past 18 months, positively impacted our financial results in comparison with what was a very low earnings level in last year’s first quarter.  Higher year over year sales volumes were most evident in our industrial coatings segment which benefited from improving global automotive builds and gains in several general industrial applications. As evidence of the operating leverage we are experiencing the industrial coatings segment posted its highest first quarter earnings in 10 years despite industry activity levels, that while improving, still remain well below historical levels.  Also, our optical and specialty materials segment delivered double-digit percentage sales growth versus last year’s period and record first quarter earnings. Several businesses in our performance coatings segment and our architectural coatings EMEA segment experienced some weather related sales softness early in the quarter but rebounded strongly easily exceeding our internal projections for March. The commodity chemicals segment remained at trough earnings levels as we experienced higher input and maintenance costs versus the fourth quarter of 2009. However caustic demand has improved and we anticipate this segment will be solidly profitable in the second quarter as we implement previously announced price increases.  Our glass segment improved versus a significant loss last year as higher industrial activity benefited our fiberglass business. However we still experienced a slight loss in the quarter. Reviewing our results by region, our investments over the past several years to expand our presence in the emerging regions, such as Asia Pacific, continue to pay off.  Asia Pacific remained our star performer with 25% year over year volume growth and we realized first quarter sales and earnings records in that region. We also realized a high growth rate in Latin America. North America benefited from a modest improvement in activity with strong year over year gains in industrial end use markets including automotive OEM. The overall construction markets here however continue to remain weak. Volumes in Europe lagged that of the other major regions due to a slower economic recovery in that region. Lastly in general we believe our improved sales pace is consistent with improving demand levels and we are not aware of any notable inventory building in most of our end use markets.  Overall for the quarter I am very pleased that the difficult actions we took and all the hard work and effort we expended over the past 18 months throughout the recession to properly position the company for a recovery is now beginning to yield measurable benefits.  Also several of our businesses that have been slower to recover such as commodity chemicals are beginning to exhibit signs of further improvement and that combined with our continued cost reduction and execution focus provides us with a clear path for continued earnings recovery.  Now, I’ll turn the call over to Robert to review our financial performance for the quarter. 
Robert Dellinger : Thanks Charles, let me offer a few comments as detailed on our first quarter financial recap slide. Our sales have improved from last year’s lows but we still remain well below pre-recession demand levels in many businesses.  We have been and will remain diligent in managing our costs. This is apparent if you look at our margin leverage from our incremental sales. In aggregate the coatings and optical and specialty material segments realized a greater than 80% earnings margin on the higher sales level, excluding favorable currency conversion impacts. We have experienced modest coatings raw material inflation in the low single-digit percent range with notably different inflation rates by region and business. We anticipate the inflation rate will be higher in the second quarter reflecting improved global demand and some transitory supply issues. We have and expect to continue to offset this inflation with selling prices and productivity.  Our blended natural gas costs both hedged and unhedged in the quarter was $6.50 per MMBTU which is up about $0.50 from the fourth quarter 2009 but down by approximately the same amount versus the prior year’s first quarter. Using recent price trends our blended unit price is expected to drop to between $5.00 and $5.50 in the second quarter.  Like many other US companies our reported earnings per share results include a negative non-reoccurring impact of $85 million after tax or $0.51 per share due to a tax law change stemming from the recently enacted US Healthcare legislation.  We issued a press release on April 8th with the additional details on this matter. And lastly our cash flow cash position and liquidity all remained very solid. We have moved away from the strong emphasis we placed on cash conservation last year to now identifying ways to deploy our cash in a balanced disciplined manner to drive earnings accretion. And now I will review some details on the quarter.  A year over year bridge of our first quarter sales is detailed on the next slide, along with some relevant trends. First quarter sales improved about $340 million or 12% versus the first quarter of 2009 which was severely impacted by the global recession. Lower year over year pricing was primarily attributable to commodity chemicals coupled with lower energy surcharges in our glass and silica’s businesses.  Pricing in the remaining reporting segments was flat to higher year over year. Compared to the last year, currency translation added about $150 million to our sales and about $15 million to earnings. As illustrated on the bottom left chart the value of the euro is higher against the dollar in comparison with last year’s first quarter which was depressed because of the recession.  However the euro has declined versus the fourth quarter of last year. Based on the recent exchange rates we expect currency to be a headwind in the second quarter. Volumes improved by over $300 million with the largest increases driven by higher global industrial demand and strong growth in Asia Pacific, particularly in China and Korea. We are pleased with the increase but recognize that it is in comparison to what were very low activity levels last year. Further details on our sales are contained on the next slide. As illustrated on the chart exhibiting our volume trends by region, Asia Pacific delivered tremendous volume growth of 25% year over year led by our industrial coatings businesses in the region.  The momentum in that region has carried forward from last year and we expect the end use markets that we serve to remain robust. Our United States and Canada volumes also experienced solid growth driven again by higher industrial activity along with improving commodity chemical demand. Our businesses selling into the construction markets were flat to negative with the prior year with declines in commercial construction a major continuing factor.  We anticipate similar improvements in industrial demand going into the second quarter although outside a favorable seasonable trends, we do not expect a meaningful change in the pace of the construction markets.  Volumes in Europe were up modestly versus the prior year’s quarter yet the region lags the other major global regions in pace of economic recovery. Latin America which is our smallest region experienced solid industrial gains as well.  The chart on the right demonstrates that while our overall volumes have recovered somewhat from last year’s low levels they still remain between 10% and 15% below the pre-recession levels of early 2008. As a result we still need further economic recovery to close this gap and we are positioned to fully benefit from improving volumes based on our lower cost structure.  While I am focused on our total volume performance I want to mention that our aggregate coatings and optical and specialty material segments had a similar sales volume decline from 2008, yet have delivered an earnings improvement approaching 10% over that same time period.  Our adjusted earnings per share is presented on the next slide, a reconciliation of these amounts to our reported earnings per share is included in the Appendix of today’s presentation materials which is available at the Investor Center on our website at www.ppg.com.  In the quarter our adjusted earnings per share was $0.70 versus a $0.19 adjusted figure last year. While we are pleased with our year over year improvement we are fully aware that we are still below historical earnings levels. A key contributor in our improvement was the higher sales volume. Another major factor was our lower cost structure including the savings stemming from our restructuring actions. Lower commodity chemicals pricing served as a partial offset. Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was 30% in the first quarter of 2010 and 33% in the first quarter of 2009. Moving now to review our individual business segments, let me start on the next slide with industrial coatings.  This segment continued its rapid return to pre-recession earnings levels. In the quarter sales grew 39% or about $250 million. Earnings improved by $117 million from a $16 million loss in the prior year’s period. And our operating margin improved to 11.3%. This earnings level was the highest in 10 years despite sales volumes in many end use markets that remained depressed versus pre-recession levels.  Cost management, restructuring related cost savings and volume were all contributors to the earnings improvement. However improved volumes was the largest factor. This segment which was our most impacted segment during the recession experienced the largest recovery with volumes improving by 31% versus the prior year’s quarter. The segment volume trend chart details the dramatic volume trend changes in this segment over that time.  From an individual business unit perspective automotive OEM coatings which is our largest individual business in this segment had volumes which were up 50% versus last year’s extremely low level. Each region delivered strong year over year sales growth supported by improved demand including 100% growth in our Asian region.  However as depicted on the bottom right chart, auto build levels in the Americas and Europe combined still remain about 20% below pre-recession levels. While we normally experience a seasonal uptick in the second quarter we expect that to be muted this year given the consistent level of auto production in each month during the first quarter.  As such we anticipate a fairly similar global build rate in the second quarter as we experienced in the first quarter. Our industrial coatings business unit also delivered solid growth levels up about 20% which is a reflection of the improvement in the general industrial economy in all regions. Asia Pacific is now our second largest region in the is business and its growth rate approached 50% in the quarter.  We expect the global industrial economy to continue its moderate recovery. The packaging coatings business also improved versus 2009 and once again delivered solid financial results. Given the nature of the end use market this business is a more stable performer throughout the economic cycle. We did not experience a significant volume drop last year and we realized a moderate volume improvement during the quarter.  Overall the industrial coatings segment through much hard work has returned much closer to historic operating margins. Given the lack of traditional seasonality in the auto OEM market this year we anticipate a more modest seasonal improvement in the segment for the second quarter. However we do expect some further gradual recovery in the general industrial economy in Asia to remain strong.  Also we intend to remain diligently focused on our cost structure. The performance coatings segment results are detailed on the next slide. In the quarter sales grew by $37 million and earnings improved by $38 million versus the prior year. Overall volumes were slightly negative with improved volumes in Asia Pacific and Latin America offset by lower volumes in Europe and the US.  However a favorable business mix within the segment and lower costs enhanced our margins and created positive earnings leverage. Currency conversion added about $55 million to sales and $5 million to earnings. Our automotive refinish business was negatively impacted last year by the recession and customer destocking.  This quarter the business experienced high single-digit sales growth excluding favorable currency impacts, aided by an improving trend in the overall miles driven and by the general economic recovery. Sales in the second quarter are historically higher due to seasonality and we expect a similar pattern this year.  Our protective and marine coatings and aerospace businesses both of which have a sizable after market component, [inaudible] late economic cycle industries and did not experience anywhere near the same degree of volume decline in the first quarter of last year as most of our other businesses.  Volumes this past quarter were down mid single-digit percent from last year but as detailed on the slide, sales have been fairly consistent the past three quarters, and current quarter sales were actually slightly higher than the fourth quarter level. We expect this fairly stable sales performance to continue.  In the quarter our architectural coatings America and Asia Pacific’s volumes declined once again. Solid growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America was more than offset by lower volumes in the United States. Our US volumes were largely negative in both January and February reflecting in part poor weather in most of the country.  In March our year over year trend improved dramatically as we fully recovered from the weather effects early in the quarter. For the entire quarter US volumes were down due to lower commercial construction activity and the lack of any substantial rebound in residential activity. This business is highly seasonal and we expect higher activity levels in the second quarter but expect the overall construction markets in the US to remain at low historical levels.  Overall performance coatings has proven its stability, has delivered some of our most consistent earnings results through the recession and has maintained or grown operating margin due in part to lowering its cost structure. Looking ahead in the second quarter we expect similar stability and normal upward seasonal trends in our auto refinish and architectural coatings businesses.  Results for our architectural coatings Europe, Middle East, and Africa, or EMEA business, are on the following slide. Sales in the quarter were $436 million, up $27 million versus last year’s period and earnings improved by $8 million in what is historically a seasonal slow period for this segment. Over the past year this business has been much less cyclical than most others with volumes through the full year of 2009 falling by only mid single-digit percent. Given the slower pace of recovery in Europe our first quarter results were similar. Our higher earnings stemmed from a lower cost structure and overall cost management actions. Currency conversion added about 7% to our top line but did not impact earnings. As we have traditionally done included on the slide are the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or EBITDA. We believe EBITDA is a relevant measure for this segment given the ongoing non-cash amortization expense stemming from the SigmaKalon acquisition. As you can see aided by lower cost our EBITDA margins improved this past quarter versus not only 2009 but also 2008. Looking ahead we anticipate a longer recovery timetable for the European economies and therefore continue to expect modest volume challenges in this segment.  The second and third quarters should provide a sizable seasonal sales lift with currency a potential headwind. Our focus remains on cost management and execution to maintain profitability, building our brands and positioning to grow in emerging regions. Our optical and special materials segment results are detailed on the following slide.  Versus the prior year first quarter sales increased by $39 million to $284 million on solid volume growth. Earnings grew by 37% to a new record first quarter level due to the impact of increased volumes coupled with lower costs. Our optical products sales grew by double-digit percents with solid growth in all major regions.  Our silica products some of which are used as a raw material in the production of tires and car batteries, experienced very significant volume declines early last year but have reversed that trend consistent with year over year growth in the auto market. Looking ahead we anticipate moderate seasonal improvements in sales and intend to increase our selling and marketing efforts in the second quarter to drive further growth for the quarter and the remainder of the year. The next slide shows our commodity chemical segment results, sales dropped by about $30 million versus last year’s period, earnings fell $80 million in comparison to what was a strong performance in Q1 of the previous year. Compared with the first quarter of 2009 sales volumes improved by over 30% but were more than offset by lower selling prices.  Aggregate pricing for chlorine and caustic soda, the ECU price fell substantially. Chlorine prices improved but those gains were erased by lower caustic prices reflecting the impacts of lower industrial demand in most of last year.  Also our costs were modestly higher primarily due to a much higher ethylene cost somewhat offset by lower natural gas pricing. Comparing first quarter results this year versus the fourth quarter of 2009 the ECU price was flat as the chlorine price slipped mildly and was offset by strengthening caustic prices.  As displayed on the chart domestic caustic volumes improved especially in March drawing down our inventories but the earnings impact was nullified by increases in our primary input costs. Our inventories have fallen in 30 of the past 36 weeks. Looking forward we expect this business to return to solid profitability in the second quarter as we implement previously announced price increases in caustic soda and based on current input costs.  Our glass segment details are on the following slide, sales were $220 million, up $24 million or 12%. Overall volumes advanced while pricing declined due in part to a lower year over year energy and fuel surcharges. While the segment remained unprofitable the $3 million loss was a dramatic improvement over the prior year’s period when we lost $27 million.  Our fiberglass business benefited from the rebound in global industrial activity and volumes improved nearly 45% in contrast to a similar percentage decline last year. This higher activity resulted in improved manufacturing utilization. The architectural glass market both commercial and residential construction served by our performance glazing business remained at recession levels.  Both businesses benefited from considerable cost reductions. Equity and royalty earnings improved largely driven by equity results in our Asian fiberglass joint venture which supplies the electronics industry. We expect both businesses to exhibit better seasonal trends in the second quarter. This would also improve capacity utilization including in fiberglass where inventory levels are low and where we have already announced price increases effective in the second quarter. Let me conclude my remarks by discussing some cash details which are on the next slide, we ended the quarter with just under $700 million of cash on hand. In the quarter we used about $50 million of cash for operations including traditional seasonal working capital increases versus the fourth quarter.  Our first quarter cash from operations results puts us nearly $250 million ahead of our 2009 pace and I will remind you the full year of 2009 was our second best cash generation year on record. We spent $45 million on capital spending during the quarter and we expect our full year capital spending to be in the range of $300 to $350 million.  Our dividend payment, a long-standing heritage at PPG were $90 million. We also repaid more than $150 million of debt in the quarter and don’t anticipate any further term debt reduction of size for the remainder of the year. As we previously stated we do expect full year contribution to our pension fund of $240 million.  Last year we put approximately $450 million of cash and company stock into our plans including about $175 million in the first quarter. Our cash position remains very strong especially when considering that our strongest cash generation quarters are late in the year. And we intend to deploy cash over the balance of the year in a disciplined manner with the focus on growing earnings per share. We are reviewing potential bolt on acquisitions and also share repurchases will be a likely use this year. With that I will now turn it back over to Charles for some closing remarks. 
Charles Bunch : Thanks Robert, I will conclude by reiterating a few key items. Global industrial demand is recovering at a moderate pace and we believe there has not been any sizable inventory building in many of our end use markets we serve.  We still have several end use markets or businesses that have yet to recover such as commodity chemicals, which is beginning to exhibit positive signs that we expect will boost our earnings in the coming quarters. We continue to experience solid earnings leverage on higher sales volumes reflecting the benefits of the structural cost reductions we completed during the recession.  Our efforts and investments over the past several years to expand our presence in emerging regions such as Asia Pacific continue to pay off as they along with our optical products business have once again proven to be critical growth drivers for the corporation.  Let me conclude by commenting that global end use market activity remains well below historical levels as do our earnings and our objective is to continue to accelerate our earnings recovery back to pre-recession levels. To do so we will remain focused on diligently managing our costs to maximize the impacts from further volume recovery.  Also we intend to further deploy our strong cash position focused on bolt on acquisitions and share repurchases to further fuel our earnings growth. I am encouraged that we are now entering what has historically been PPG’s best quarter with a very low cost position and growing momentum.  That concludes our prepared remarks, now we are ready for questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of PJ Juvekar – Citi
PJ Juvekar – Citi: A question on performance coatings, your volumes fell in 1Q, can you talk a little bit about what kind of volume trend you’re expecting for the full year. 
Charles Bunch : The volumes fell in the first quarter in a couple of the segments, one architectural coatings, the other protective, and marine and we had volume growth in automotive refinish. We would expect that volume trend in automotive refinish, the positive trend to continue this year. We’re fairly optimistic about the business here in the developed regions as well as what’s happening in the emerging regions.  We think the architectural business was effected by weather conditions early in this quarter, was rebounding in March as the weather improved, so we think that even though we’re not optimistic about strong volume growth in architectural we do think we’ll show better performance in the upcoming quarters than we did in the first quarter and we think that protective and marine shows some positive signs and so we’re looking for modest growth there and in aerospace. So I think the picture is going to be slightly better as we move through the upcoming quarters. 
PJ Juvekar – Citi: In the US architectural business can you talk a little bit about what you’re seeing at company-owned stores versus home centers versus the dealer channel in terms of which channels are holding up better. 
Charles Bunch : The patterns have remained similar here. Its still early in the season so I would say its too early for us to reach any definitive conclusions but as we saw last year the remodeling segment of the business held up better than either commercial construction or new home residential. That does favor the DIY segments that are either in the national home centers or in the dealer channel. So I would say early in the year here in the first quarter those trends continue. 
PJ Juvekar – Citi: Would you expect your total store count to be flat for the year or up or down. 
Charles Bunch : We don’t expect it to be down, I would say that if anything there may be a net very modest store count growth this year, mainly tied to lease renewals and the like. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy – Merrill Lynch 
Kevin McCarthy – Merrill Lynch : In architectural I understand you led a price increase at the company-owned stores in the US, can you comment on the success of the realization there relative to the raw material increases, in other words are you able to hold margins and over in Europe do you foresee any need or opportunity to raise prices in architectural coatings there. 
Charles Bunch : In regards to the price increase at the company-owned store channel we did implement that during the first quarter. We felt that that would offset price increases from raw materials that we were experiencing and we talked about the low 3% to 4% kind of inflationary indicators that we were seeing for raw materials.  What we’re seeing right now is as we come into the early parts of the second quarter we’re seeing a little bit higher inflation level especially in a couple of commodities so we’re watching this right now. I would say that today we’re in several of our channels where we have had pricing, we think that we’re in pretty good shape but we’re watching the trends.  In several of our segments or end use markets where we haven’t yet achieved all the price increases that we’re looking for, we will be talking to customers because this is, I would say a consistent trend across regions that we are seeing raw material inflation, combined with some shortages here that have emerged in the first quarter.  And Europe is similar story even though the volume there has been I would say weak in the first quarter, had similar weather conditions in Europe to what we experienced here in North America. There is some not as great inflationary pressure in Europe on the raw material side and we will be looking as we move through the second quarter we’re going to monitor raw material prices and see if we need to look at targeted price increases on the architectural side. 
Kevin McCarthy – Merrill Lynch : And shifting gears to the optical segment margins there were exceptionally strong, could you comment on the underlying margins that transitions versus silica and what we should expect in 2Q there in terms of margins. 
Charles Bunch : We were very pleased with the improvement overall in the segment and we saw improvement both in the optical business and in transitions led by volume improvement there and we picked up a little volume leverage on our prices on the transition side have not changed. But this is I think a good indicator of us keeping our overhead costs and manufacturing costs in line or lower and we’re getting some help from improved volume.  On the silica side we had a very nice improvement there as well both in volume and in margins. As Robert mentioned in his remarks the tire industry has recovered here in the first quarter so that provided some volume lift. We also have some cost benefits in the silica business from lower natural gas costs and the restructuring actions that we took last year.  So we’re seeing nice improvement in both sub segments of optical and specialty materials. 
Kevin McCarthy – Merrill Lynch : Is it fair to say that the majority of the $80 per ton proposed price increase for caustic soda has gone through for April 1. 
Charles Bunch : Our view, we’ve fully implemented the price increase announced earlier in Q1 which was $75 a ton. We are in the process of implementing this $80 a ton price increase in the second quarter, not all of which will be implemented April 1 but we are confident especially with the trends that we see on the volume side and overall in the market that through the course of the second quarter we will implement fully the $80 a ton caustic soda price increase. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs 
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs : Can you comment a little bit on the industrial coatings side, sort of what the raw material and pricing developments there are by sub market and then on the auto OEM what do you expect sequentially in those regions as you go forward. 
Charles Bunch : In the industrial coatings segment on the raw material side first quarter again we had raw material price increases consistent with my earlier remarks, 3% to 4%, however we do use more epoxy resin in this segment of our coatings business. That was experiencing especially at the end of the quarter some higher inflationary pressure. So we have been in all three end use markets, automotive OEM, the general industrial segment and packaging that are the three sub segments of industrial coatings, we are pushing price increases in all three of those sub segments to offset the overall increases and also to specifically address the epoxy resin increase. 
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs : And what about production trends by region OEM, what would you expect that to look like as we go through the year. 
Charles Bunch : They have remained fairly solid. I would say right now, if we start hearing North America, we had a very good start to the year. We were looking at maybe build numbers for North America at a little less than 11 million for the year which are still going to be up over 20% but now we’ve upped those and its over 11 million. Its probably going to be between 11 million and 11.5 and the sales trends in the market seem to be positive. Europe however although we had a good first quarter we think its going to flatten out. We haven’t seen the same uptake in the sales levels so I would say that we’re still looking for maybe on a full year basis very modest volume growth in Europe, very low single-digits. South America remains strong although it’s a smaller market and the big story as we’ve been reading about and we certainly experienced in the first quarter and we think its going to continue is the growth of sales particularly in China but more broadly in Asia Pacific.  So the sales were up, you saw the March numbers in China up another 40%. We’re predicting only 10% to 15% full year in China but it is certainly a strong sales pace and we think its going to continue through the year at that 10% to 15% level, not at what we saw on a year over year basis in the month of March. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets: I just wanted to thank you for sending us the best wide receiver in football. I wanted to follow-up, I mean obviously the optical business was awesome and you attributed part of it to transitions and part of it to the silica’s, if I look at that $20 million year over year increase how would you apportion the benefits between those two segments. 
Charles Bunch : I would say in terms of the earnings, its probably the 80/20 rule here, that 80% of the improvement would be on the optical side, 20% on silica’s and optical is obviously a much bigger proportion of the overall segment so I would say that they’re both improving nicely at about the same rate. 
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets: That actually gives us a little more confidence that its mostly on the transition side which is obviously the more stable of the businesses there, and then your expectation with that material pick up have we reached a new plateau level here on this segment.  
Charles Bunch : I don’t think we’ve reached the plateau level, as we’ve talked about in our discussions of the transitions business we have what we think is a very good penetration level here in the United States, about 20% market share so that means 20% of all prescription eyewear is transitions. We think that we have room to move that up and certainly our level of penetration in Europe or in Asia or in Latin America is not at that level, in fact most of those markets are less than 10% market penetration.  So we think we have plenty of upside and room to grow the business and we think that this story will continue. 
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets: Hopefully [Kenny Ferry] and [Trevor Imelman] will perform for you there. And you talked about using cash for share buyback and bolt ons, would you care to size the order of magnitude of what potentially you are looking at in both of those areas. 
Robert Dellinger : On the bolt on acquisitions I think things in the $200 to $250 million range and more focused on Asia Pacific and the emerging markets. On share repurchase its something we are and will continue to evaluate but its probably not appropriate to size it at this point. 
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets: But can you refresh our memory how much is left on the current authorization. 
Robert Dellinger : We have a little more than six million shares on the current authorization. We had five approved late last year and we had a little more than a million, million and a half shares outstanding under the existing authorization, so about 6.5 in total. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Sheehan – Deutsche Bank 
James Sheehan – Deutsche Bank : What was our operating rate in chlor alkaline in Q1 and could you also comment on where the demand improvement is coming from, is that mainly like the pulp and paper market for caustic, or is it across all the end uses.  
Charles Bunch : I would say operating rates moved up in the quarter to the high 80’s, close to 90%. We did have some maintenance outages in the month of March that brought down some of our numbers and we haven’t seen the operating rates for the industry in March but they were at what I would say would be historically good levels.  And caustic demand as you know is spread across a number of end use industrial markets. We thought pulp and paper was solid if not really strong, refinery business good, we saw some pick up on the aluminum side, so we saw a number of the end use markets beginning to pick up although there was no one stand out market but just I would solid improvement across the board.
James Sheehan – Deutsche Bank: And could you estimate what percent of your natural gas costs would we hedged in Q2, would that be around 25%. 
Charles Bunch : Its going to be around there, around 25%. Its going to move down each quarter so that we’re probably going to end the year because we’re not looking to hedge at this point any additional volumes and it moves down to around 20% by the end of the year but the second quarter hedges will be down slightly but around 25%.
James Sheehan – Deutsche Bank : And finally you mentioned the euro being a headwind in Q2, is there any way to quantify what that might be if the euro were to be at this level for the rest of the quarter. 
Robert Dellinger : You can certainly look at our sales in euros. We have about $4.5 [billion] of sales in the euro region and roughly half of that is denominated in euros. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ivan Marcuse – KeyBanc
Ivan Marcuse – KeyBanc: In the commercial markets are you looking for, how are you looking the year to play out, are you expecting it to remain at the low level it is to 2010 or do you expect a slight recovery as you go through the year. 
Charles Bunch : We’re not looking for any recovery this year in new commercial construction. The architect index in commercial construction are still below 50, I think 45 was the latest number, and there is not a lot of optimism on the new construction front in commercial. There may be some pick up later this year on the renovation side of commercial but at this point we’re saying we’re hunkered down trying to get through this year in the market and looking for improvement next year.  
Ivan Marcuse – KeyBanc: In the packaging industry you mentioned that has been pretty stable, has there been any regions that are better than others or has it been pretty stable globally.
Charles Bunch : The best growth similar to the stories in the other, in many of the other end use markets is Asia Pacific region and China have been stronger than the developed region. There is still a few, if you look at can consumption as an example in those markets or packaged goods or packaged foods, they still have quite a ways to go in China and India to even get close to the consumption levels on a per capita basis here in the developed regions.  So we expect that story to continue for the coming years and this year as we get into the second and third quarters we always see some positive uplift when there’s a World Cup and there is one starting in June in South Africa and that usually leads to an increase in beer and beverage consumption during the year. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson – UBS
Don Carson – UBS: Just on chloralkali industry operating rates were about 84% in January, February and you indicated you were well above that, I’m just wondering where is all the chlorine going that enables you to have these kind of high operating rates. 
Charles Bunch : Well it was stronger export, the export shipments of [PVC] especially in the first two months of the year. That started to slow down some from the ethylene price spikes that we saw as we moved through the quarter. But that was contributing to higher operating rates across the industry and that historically as you know the US has not been a strong exporter of [PVC]. But we are now with some lower natural gas or energy costs and a weaker dollar there have been more opportunities although right now we see those opportunities declining because of the spike we’re seeing in ethylene costs. 
Don Carson – UBS: And on natural gas hedging its been somewhat of a mixed performance over the last year, I guess the basic question would be why even bother hedging other than say during winter months when you might get a spike in pricing. Have you sort of looked to see whether hedging actually benefits you or is a net increase in your cost position. 
Charles Bunch : If you look at our record over time we have experienced some periods where it really helped us. What we have been trying to do in the hedging program is take away the upside spikes in pricing. If you look at the experience in this decade until the last year and a half or so, most of the variability came on the upside either during weather events like a hurricane or harsh periods of the winter and we saw price spikes that would go well over $10 in MMBTU and into $13 and $15 range. So we were really trying to cap some of those, the upside risk that we saw from the pricing. Now what’s happened over the last couple of years we think has changed the game. When you have had an overall weaker economy but obviously the shale gas has made a big difference whether it’s the [Barnett] Field or the Marcellus Field here in this region, the supply picture has changed quite a bit, and so even with improving demand we see pricing very stable, volumes, and inventories continuing at very high levels.  So we think the game has changed. We’re no longer concerned about protecting ourselves against these upside price spikes so we have really, we really stopped hedging over a year ago but up until that time we were going out two or three years with some of our hedges in order to protect ourselves and we had a little more in the winter months typically where there was more potential for variability. So we stopped hedging and we’re going to just ride this thing out and hopefully this shale play is a long-term trend for us and I think if it is, its going to be a very positive factor for the US chemical industry and for a number of our other manufacturing industries including our glass business. 
Don Carson – UBS: Turning to your architectural business you seem somewhat cautious in your outlook, it appears at least if you look at the DOC data that we’re close to a bottom here, must below 600 million gallons a year, what kind of recovery do you see. Is your caution in 2010 really because of weakness in commercial and what kind of growth do you think we could see both in 2010 and 2011 in the overall US market. 
Charles Bunch : Well what we’ve seen is certainly the industrial markets led by automotive have recovered more rapidly and on a more consistent basis globally. And we’re in now the fourth year of this housing recession here in North America. I predicted that we were going to be out of this recession probably a year and a half or a year ago and I have been I think continually disappointed by the pace of the recovery.  Now I don’t think we’re going to get any worse, new housing starts, we’ve talked about building from this level of 600,000 but we haven’t seen it so far and the start of the year was very weak. Some of that we hope is weather and now we have the commercial construction market a little weaker. We think that the renovation side of residential will be better so overall its still going to be a positive story for us this year. But I am surprised that its taken us as long as it has as a country to work through all these mortgage and foreclosure issues. We have a housing credit that is going to expire so there’s just a lot of, there’s conflicting data and so we think overall it will be positive but not strong and clearly with what we’re seeing on the automotive side from maybe a deeper decline we’re seeing more of a bounce back.  So I think 2011 for us seems like a better year to predict a strong upturn. We should get improvement in commercial, new homes should finally start to get better, maybe even later this year. But we just haven’t seen volume on the construction markets either here in North America or in Europe that would lead us to say that we should be really bullish on that market for the rest of this year. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research 
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research : Couple of questions on the architectural coatings business in Europe, first what was the volume decline in EMEA business in first quarter and can you provide a little bit more color on I guess countries where you’re seeing some improvements beyond seasonality or some maybe that are getting a little bit weaker for you.
Charles Bunch : I would say that volume decline in the first quarter and again Europe had similar weather to ours here so they were very weak in January and February as a result of the weather but we ended up with low single-digit declines in volume overall for the market and I would say there was no particular market that was either stronger or weaker. And we have I would say a mix of country exposure, France, the UK, Benelux, Eastern Europe, and I would say none of those exhibited real strength nor did any of them exhibit exception weakness so it was fairly consistent through the first quarter but again its not, we’ll need a little more time to see the emergence of seasonal trends and as we get through the second quarter I think we’ll be able to see if some markets are getting a little stronger and others are not. We do not have exposure as we’ve said in some of the weakest markets like Spain and Portugal and very small exposure in Italy or the other Mediterranean countries so we don’t have a good barometer there but certainly they have been the weakest overall in the construction industries and overall in their economies. 
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research : You mentioned that you’re seeing some shortages in some raw materials, can you be a little bit more specific which raw materials you’re talking about and also can you provide a little bit more color on the raw material environment in Europe versus US. 
Charles Bunch : I would say we have had, there are two things going on, we’ve had some price run up and we’ve talked about ethylene, propylene is also increasing in price. We’ve had some products in that petro chemical chain that are experiencing shortages. I can talk about phenol, epoxy resin, some of the [accrolates], so I think as some of the production ramped up as we went through the quarter I think many of these companies and industries where there had been a lot of restructuring or they’d mothballed some facilities as demand came up, I think there were a few supply disruptions that we think will move away as we go through the second quarter. But certainly those would be some of the markets that and some of the products in the petro chemical chain that we saw either with price increases or supply disruptions. In Europe although the demands haven’t been as strong, the economy has been weaker there and slower to recover than here, we’ve had some similar issues.  There was a TIO 2 plant that has had, they had a significant supply event in the UK and that has effected short-term supply and demand balance for TIO 2 and we’ve had some raw material inflation again at the lower end of that 3% to 4% kind of inflation that we’ve been talking about but even in the, with the weakness in the economy in Europe we have had some raw material inflation in Europe as well. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts – Buckingham Research 
John Roberts – Buckingham Research : Impressive margins, the European automotive coatings business, I thought that was by far the largest, maybe 50% larger than US or 50% larger than Europe, I don’t know if that’s correct or not, but I wanted to check your comments, did you say that the full year in Europe auto builds will be up slightly or did you say the second half, the remainder of the year will be up slightly. Because the first quarter was up materially. 
Charles Bunch : Our first quarter was up as you said materially, we think production will still be up for the full year although at a lower level and what I described as low single-digit increases for the full year in Europe in automotive production. And in terms of our automotive OEM business unit, Europe is the biggest single region but it is not twice the size of our North American business. 
John Roberts – Buckingham Research : No I thought more like 50% larger than North America.
Charles Bunch : No, it is larger but not 50% larger. 
John Roberts – Buckingham Research : And so the rest of the year you expect to be down so that the full year is up only modestly. 
Robert Dellinger : No, if you look last year the comps get more difficult in Europe. The first quarter in all of auto globally last year was very difficult. Europe came out of that quicker because of the incentives they put in place so their comparables get harder as we go throughout the year on a year over year basis. 
John Roberts – Buckingham Research: Right but if they were up a lot in the first quarter and they’re only up a little for the full year, they’re going to be flat or—
Charles Bunch : They’ll be flattish.
Robert Dellinger : Marginally for the rest of the year, that’s correct. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John McNulty – Credit Suisse 
John McNulty – Credit Suisse : Just one quick question, with all the cost cuts that you put through last year your margins are clearly really solid in a bunch of your businesses and in some cases they’re at record levels whether it’s the optical or even industrial coatings seems to be close to that, are you in any of your businesses constrained right now because of the cost that you put in where you might be having to go out and hire or add in some incremental costs, how should we think about that going forward and maybe the impact it might have on margins.
Charles Bunch : We don’t think that we’re constrained now. We’re not contemplating in the businesses where we did close facilities either plants or warehouses, we’re not contemplating restarting or building any new facilities especially in the developed region. We have plenty of capacity. We are as you know from previous calls we are building capacity in Asia in particular China, but we don’t see any big cost adds going through. Now we have had our salaries frozen for the last 14 months and we also eliminated the 401K match here in North America. Those will be reinstituted in the second half of the year so we will have some cost increase on the wages and benefits side here in North America and in the developed regions in the second half of the year.  But that would be other than raw materials, the only significant cost increase that we’d be looking for. 
Operator: Your final question is a follow-up from the line of Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets 
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets: Just a quick follow-up you mentioned the World Cup and possible opportunities, I actually hadn’t thought of PPG as a World Cup play, can you talk about your various touch points in South Africa and what the materiality of that would be.
Charles Bunch : Well actually we do have a significant architectural business in South Africa, its called Prominent Paints. We’re the number four player in South Africa so we are getting some lift there from a lot of the construction activity, but more importantly the overall lift for PPG at least in, is more on the beer and beverage side and its not with actual [inaudible] in South Africa, its with all the sports fans around the world who are gathered around their televisions watching their teams play in the World Cup.  And although it seems almost humorous to say that, but beer and beverage consumption during the World Cup goes up significantly and for those of us in that market we know during the World Cup there’s a lot of beer and beverages being consumed.
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets: That makes a lot of sense and I can understand that, thanks a million. 
Operator: There are no additional questions at this time; I would like to turn it back over to management for any additional or closing comments. 
Charles Bunch : Thank you very much for listening in and for your support and we look forward to reporting back to you in another three months with what we hope will be further improvement and another solid quarter. Thank you.

The agenda for today's discussion is noted on slide number three. And now let me introduce PPG’s Chairman and CEO, Charles Bunch.
Charles Bunch : Thanks you Vince and welcome everyone. This afternoon I will provide a brief overview of our fourth quarter and full year performance. Robert Dellinger will review details of our financial results. I will make a few closing remarks and then we will take questions.  The fourth quarter of 2009 capped what was a challenging year. The global recession was both steep and broad and adversely effected many of our end use markets. PPG reacted decisively as we implemented aggressive restructuring and cost reduction actions and further increased our focus on cash flows.  The impact of these efforts is clearly evident in our fourth quarter and full year financial results. Led by our coatings and optical and specialty materials businesses we have continued to realize positive momentum in our financial performance.  These segments performed well and delivered higher year over year earnings. Given challenging end use market conditions our performance glazings business unit and commodity chemical segment weakened in comparison with the prior year’s quarter and a seasonally stronger third quarter.  Overall demand in the quarter was lower year over year with the exception of double-digit percentage growth in Asia and improvement in a few select global industrial end use markets such as auto production.  However activity levels were stable or modestly improved versus the third quarter 2009 when taking into account seasonal trends. Our increased operating leverage again being driven by our restructuring initiatives was a major contributor to our improved financial performance.  This was most evident in our industrial coatings segment where earnings grew by $129 million versus last year’s fourth quarter on only modest volume improvement. In fact, industrial coatings earnings were even higher than fourth quarter 2007, despite over 15% lower demand.  And our focus on cash and working capital continued with nearly $600 million of cash generation in the quarter exceeding even last year’s strong performance. PPG’s full year results provide continued validation that the strategic direction and the actions we have taken over the past few years to transform the company are yielding the intended improvements.  Despite the severity of this recession the aggregate full year earnings of our coatings and optical and specialty material segments dropped by less than 10%. Measured in local currencies this figure was only about 5% with the remainder due to negative currency conversion.  This performance includes higher earnings in local currencies from our architectural coatings EMEA segment which represents the majority of our 2008 SigmaKalon acquisition. Our focus on growing our presence in Asia also yielded significant benefits in 2009 as our markets there continued to demonstrate good growth characteristics. Lastly our improved portfolio was important in enabling us to generate over $1.3 billion in cash from operations in 2009 which is our second highest year on record. Our strong cash performance allowed us to confidently raise our annual dividend payout yet again and we substantially reduced our debt level paying down an additional $675 million.  I am pleased with how we finished the year. Our earnings are recovering and our strong cash position provides us with financial flexibility to support earnings growth going forward. Yet until we see further signs that demand is recovering more broadly our attention will remain focused on cost management and diligent execution of our strategy.  Now I’ll turn the call over to Robert to review financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year. 
Robert Dellinger : Thanks Charles, summarizing the fourth quarter, sales were down $72 million or a modest 2% decline versus fourth quarter 2008 sales which were partially impacted by the onset of the industrial recession.  Commodity chemicals experienced a sharp decline in sales due to lower pricing. This decline was partially offset by higher sales in our other businesses including higher volumes in automotive coatings, and favorable currency impacts.  Overall we experienced fairly normal seasonal sales patterns with the exception of automotive production which remained consistent throughout the quarter as opposed to the traditional pattern of trailing off in December.  Our gross margins expanded not only versus 2008 but also versus solid 2007 results reflecting the impact from our restructuring actions, additional cost management initiatives, and lower input costs. Our full year tax rate came in at 30% based on actual full year mix of earnings by geography. The lower rate added $0.12 to fourth quarter earnings per share due to the catch up from the lowering of the tax rate the prior three quarters.  We also estimated our 2010 tax rate will remain at 30%. We delivered very strong cash performance in the quarter generating almost $600 million and that is after recognizing an additional $100 million we contributed to our pension plans in December.  Also we reduced debt by an additional $175 million during the quarter and ended the year with over $1 billion of cash on hand. The year over year bridge of our fourth quarter sales along with some relevant trends is depicted on the next slide and a full year sales bridge is included in the appendix for your reference. Negative price of $166 million is entirely attributable to lower selling prices in commodity chemicals and lower year over year energy and fuel surcharges in glass. We realized modest price improvements in coatings and optical but they were not sufficient to overcome the sharp drops in commodity chemicals and glass.  Following four consecutive quarters of headwind currency conversion finally became a tailwind and positively impacted fourth quarter sales by $150 million. As depicted on the chart the euro advanced modestly versus the third quarter of this year, however year over year improvement was realized due to a rapidly weakening euro in the fourth quarter of 2008.  Despite the favorable impact in the fourth quarter currency translation reduced full year sales by nearly $600 million. Our volumes remain negative in the quarter however they have recovered gradually over the year and the decline was less severe in the fourth quarter than prior quarters.  This reflects the lower activity level in last year’s fourth quarter, modest demand improvements in Asia in some of our industrial end use markets, and higher commodity chemicals exports. The next slide provides sales data by region.  Our regional volume variance for each quarter in 2009 is provided versus the prior year’s quarter. In the fourth quarter volumes remained modestly negative in both the United States and Europe. However we experienced growth in our emerging regions including single-digit growth in Latin America and nearly 15% growth in Asia Pacific driven by higher industrial demand.  And on a full year the emerging regions of Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe represented nearly one third of our coatings portfolio. Our adjusted earnings per share is presented on the next slide. A reconciliation of these amounts to our reported earnings per share is included in the appendix of today’s presentation materials which is available at the Investor Center on our website at www.ppg.com. In the quarter our adjusted earnings per share was $0.86 and includes a 30% effective tax rate. We anticipate the same tax rate of 30% for year 2010. While lower taxes were part of the earnings per share improvement a significant contributor to the earnings per share was the increase in savings generated by our restructuring actions.  As we ended 2009 we had completed all major elements of these initiatives ahead of schedule including the reduction of two European manufacturing operations during the fourth quarter. Throughout 2009 we realized partial year savings from many of our actions and we will have an incremental $100 million of savings in 2010 in recognition of the full year structural cost savings from these actions.  Our improving EPS trend is detailed on the next slide. As you can see our fourth quarter performance represented a sizable gain versus a difficult fourth quarter of 2008. The right side displays the segment earnings trends for our coatings and optical segments. While not immune to the effects of a recessionary economy these segments have experienced only modest earnings declines.  What’s more they’ve achieved these results despite the fact that several businesses are exposed to severely challenged end use markets, such as automotive and construction that were heavily impacted by this recession.  As Charles stated this strong performance during a recession provides continued validation of our strategy to grow these segments as a portion of our portfolio. Moving now to review our individual business segments, let me start on the next slide with industrial coatings which delivered dramatically improved results in the quarter versus what was a poor performance last year.  In the quarter sales grew 12% or $92 million, earnings improved by $129 million from a $40 million loss last year, and we achieved a 10% operating margin. This improvement was driven largely by lower cost including restructuring and cost management. In addition we experienced modest year over year end use market demand improvements.  All regions realized higher earnings with the largest gains in Asia and the US. Looking quickly at the full year we experienced the full effect of the global recession in 2009 as demand dropped dramatically due to lower consumer spending and significant industrial inventory destocking. While volumes have partially recovered this past quarter they still remain well below historic levels.  We reacted swiftly to the demand declines by completing major reductions in our cost structure. One bright spot this year has been Asia, which now represents more than 20% of this segment in sales and even more in earnings as the region is now delivering our highest operating margins.  Further details on our industrial coatings segment are included on the next slide. We grew volumes in the quarter versus a very weak fourth quarter 2008. To put this in perspective our volumes this past quarter were still more than 15% below fourth quarter 2007 volumes. By region volumes improved significantly in Asia, growing over 40% and also in Latin America, but remained negative in the US and Europe. The largest end use market improvement was in automotive production. In North America year over year auto production was down about 50% versus 2008 in the first half of the year but fourth quarter 2009 was essentially flat with the weakened quarterly result from 2008. As illustrated on the bottom right graph, North America vehicle production is still running below the level of US auto sales, and automotive dealer inventories remain very low in comparison with historical levels.  Also we delivered very strong growth in Asia on a much higher year over year auto production. Overall for this segment 2009 was a remarkably challenging year. That environment required us to aggressively manage and restructure the business to succeed and we were pleased that our actions aided in achievement of double-digit operating margins this past quarter.  Looking ahead to 2010 for the full year we anticipate improvement in global industrial demand versus the low levels in 2009 especially in the early months of the year. These demand improvements will likely be led by automotive production which we expect to increase by 10% globally versus 2009 with the growth of 20% or more in North America alone.  Due to our lower cost structure we expect to fully leverage improving volume while we keep our focus on tightly managing costs and execution. The performance coatings segment results are detailed on the next slide. In the quarter despite sales volume decreases in the mid teen percents, earnings grew modestly aided by strong cost management.  Positive currency conversion added about $50 million to quarterly sales and $5 million to earnings. This segment has historically demonstrated more stability in sales and earnings given the large after market nature of the end use segments. As such our fourth quarter volume results were similar to the volume results the prior three quarters of 2009.  In the fourth quarter year over year sales comparisons in protective and marine coatings and aerospace both of which serve later cycle industries, trended down slightly. Volumes in our architectural coatings business declined slightly more than 10% which is very similar to the prior two quarters.  In the United States our stores and dealer channels which primarily serve profession paint contractors, were down more while our national accounts or DIY channel was only slightly negative. Full year earnings were down a modest $31 million or 5% including negative currency conversion of $24 million.  Yet the segments operating margins improved by 120 basis points. For the year and fourth quarter the automotive refinish business experienced the most sizable volume declines including the negative impacts from distributor inventory destocking earlier in the year. As we look ahead to 2010 we once again anticipate this segment will be a stable performer with some year over year benefit due to the absence of inventory destocking and continued cost discipline.  Results for our architectural coatings, Europe, Middle East, and Africa or EMEA business, are on the following slide. Sales in the quarter were $457 million, up $43 million versus last year’s period and earnings improved by $11 million from a break-even level last year. The table in the center of the slide displays the seasonal mix of segment sales by quarter.  You see a nearly identical trend in 2008 and 2009 including traditional seasonality in the fourth quarter. Volumes for both the quarter and the year were down slightly more than 5% with improved results in the second half of the year. This performance occurred despite a severe economic decline in the region and clearly demonstrates the resilience of this segment due to the significant maintenance component of architectural coatings in Europe.  Currency aided sales by about $40 million and earnings by $3 million in the quarter, however for the year currency represented about $200 million or two thirds of the $300 million sales decline and had a $19 million negative impact on earnings. In 2009 earnings in local currencies were higher than 2008, an exceptional achievement considering the economic environment.  Also as expected this segment delivered strong cash flow. Included on the slide are the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or EBITDA. As you can see our EBITDA margins improved for the year in spite of the recession. We believe EBITDA is a relevant measure for this business given the ongoing noncash amortization expense stemming from the SigmaKalon acquisition.  Looking ahead we anticipate a longer recovery timetable for the European economies and therefore continue to expect modest volume challenges in this segment. Our focus remains on cost management and execution to maintain profitability levels, building our brands and positioning to grow in the emerging regions.  Our optical and specialty materials segment results are detailed on the next slide. Fourth quarter sales of $245 million were up slightly versus 2008. Margins improved as earnings of $47 million were up over 40% from last year’s level aided by strong cost management. For the quarter optical product sales grew slightly aided by favorable currency translation. Sales of our silicas products which are used as a raw material in the production of tires and car batteries grew mid single-digit percents versus last year and reversed a sizable negative sequential volume trend that began in mid 2008. Full year sales declined 12% including volume declines in silicas of nearly 20% and single-digit percent declines in optical products in comparison to 2008 which featured the benefit of a new transitions product introduction. One notable highlight was our near 25% transitions growth rate in Asia.  Full year segment earnings declined slightly in 2009 however our margins improved from focused cost management efforts. Looking ahead we expect this segment to return to a strong growth trend based on our optical products offering and anticipated improvements in the automotive OEM and after markets which would aid silicas.  The next slide shows our commodity chemicals segment results, sales declined by over $00 million versus last year’s period driven by lower pricing. Earnings fell $80 million in comparison with a strong performance the previous year. Aggregate pricing for chlorine and caustic soda, the ECU price fell significantly in comparison with last year’s record fourth quarter but was higher versus the third quarter of 2009. Demand for our chlorine and caustic soda fell in North America versus a seasonally stronger third quarter in the prior year. Although caustic exports grew and we experienced unfavorable mix driven by higher chlorine derivative exports. Our fourth quarter and full year 2009 natural gas costs were approximately $6.00 per MMBTU. We anticipate our first quarter 2010 natural gas costs to be in the range of $6.50 to $7.00 per MMBTU which includes the effects of recently higher market prices.  In 2009 we had about 50% of our natural gas needs hedged at about $8.00 and in the full year of 2010 this drops to about 25% at similar price levels. On a full year basis this segment achieved a solid 12% operating margin and once again delivered good cash generation. Looking at early 2010 we have announced caustic soda price increases for the first quarter and has mentioned also anticipate higher natural gas prices versus the fourth quarter of 2009. We expect overall demand levels during the year to track closely with US industrial production trends.  Our glass segment details are on the following slide, as with last quarter we included 2008 results both with and without the automotive glass and services business that we divested at the end of third quarter 2008. My full year comparison comments will be against the results excluding auto glass.  Sales this quarter were $223 million, down $22 million from last year. The demand environment for performance glazings or architectural glass, deteriorated as US commercial construction declined significantly versus last year and also versus the prior quarter. Fiberglass demand strengthened modestly year over year but still remained nearly 25% below 2007 levels.  Pricing was down in reflection of lower fuel and energy surcharges. Full year sales declined 29% stemming from the volume declines. Glass had $1 million in earnings this quarter versus a loss of $700 million in last year’s quarter aided by both lower costs and higher other income including improved equity affiliate results.  Earnings for the full year are down more than $90 million as significantly lower volumes overshadowed $25 million in cost improvements including a 20% reduction in our performance glazings manufacturing capacity. The segment did however produce positive cash flow for the year.  In 2010 improving industrial demand will aid fiberglass but will likely be offset by commercial construction declines negatively impacting performance glazings. Our focus on cash and aggressively managing the cost structure will continue in 2010. Our cash position is detailed on the next slide and we ended the year with over $1 billion of cash on hand.  We intentionally maintained a higher cash balance during 2009 given the global economic environment. In light of a gradual improving economy and following two years of significant debt reduction we will begin to manage our cash balance down towards historical levels. During the quarter we generated almost $600 million of cash from operations.  This strong cash performance and more importantly step change improvement in cash stemming from our SigmaKalon acquisition continues as our full year from operations exceeded $1.3 billion, just below last year’s record level.  Several notable cash uses are detailed on the following slide, our capital spending was $240 million, well below prior year levels and indicative of our ability to manage capital expenditures of our transformed business portfolio going forward. Every payment was one of our top priorities following our acquisition of SigmaKalon in early 2008. We repaid an additional $675 million of debt in 2009 following a similar figure in 2008. Since the acquisition we have lowered our net debt by about $1.9 billion which is over 2.5x original target despite operating in a much more challenging economic environment.  Funding our pension plans is another cash use and we have contributed about $450 million to our pension plans this year with about $100 million of that consisting of stock. We mitigated the dilutive effect to our share count through share buybacks. I will remind you that pension contribution figures are pre-tax and we do receive a tax benefit. Lastly we once again raised our annual dividend payout marking our 38th year in doing so, the track record we are pleased to continue and made possible by our portfolio’s strong cash characteristics. This next slide details some of estimates of key financial data for 2010 as compared to the approximate 2009 figures.  First on the income statement side, we expect our pension expense to decline by about $40 million to $160 million. This reflects our high level of pension funding in 2009 along with our asset performance and finalized 2009 discount rate. We anticipate that our full year tax rate for 2010 will be 30%, consistent with 2009. Relative to cash deployment the level of our pension funding is expected to decline to the range of about $200 to $250 million.  And although we still intend to keep our 2010 capital spending below the levels in most prior years it will likely be higher than the very low 2009 figure. Following our SigmaKalon acquisition debt reduction was a primary cash use and as I mentioned we are well ahead of schedule. In 2010 we will likely make some further debt reductions but the level of debt repayment will likely be notably lower than the prior two years.  Finally as we have mentioned the past several years, if our proposed asbestos settlement is confirmed by the court we will need to fund the trust which would entail a net cash outlay totaling $310 million after tax benefit. Let me conclude by saying that the generally favorable year over year trends, the key cash uses noted here combined with our strong and consistent cash generation history, will give us even further financial flexibility in 2010 to deploy cash with an earnings growth focus. With that I will now turn it back over to Charles for some closing remarks. 
Charles Bunch : Thanks Robert, I will conclude our prepared remarks by highlighting a few key items. Overall demand in the fourth quarter improved gradually versus the third quarter when adjusted for the seasonal nature of many of our businesses. We experienced strong earnings leverage on the modest volume gains.  While earnings have not fully recovered I am pleased with the pace of our improvement given the continued challenges in the global economy. We have completed our restructuring actions ahead of schedule and these actions benefited our 2009 performance and will do so to a greater degree in 2010. Despite the challenging environment we once again delivered strong near record cash generation in 2009 and raised our annual dividend payout. Let me end by saying that due to the severity of the recession 2009 was an extremely challenging year. Like most companies, PPG was not immune to wide reaching economic effects but we reacted quickly and decisively.  The rapid and full recovery of earnings in our coatings and optical and specialty materials segments along with our near record cash generation as a corporation provides measurable validation of the soundness and execution of our strategy to focus on these businesses and expand our geographic breadth.  As we begin 2010 we are guardedly optimistic. While recovery in a global economy remains gradual PPG is well positioned in several ways. Our strong and growing presence in Asia will continue to yield benefits based on economic growth in that region. We will also realize an incremental $100 million of savings from our completed restructuring actions that should enable us to fully leverage anticipated higher full year global activity levels.  And we have a strong cash position of just over $1 billion to support earnings growth opportunities. That concludes our prepared remarks. Now we would be happy to take your questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank 
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank : Can you comment on what you’re seeing in industrial coating demand trends by region both for January and how it looks for longer term.
Charles Bunch : The industrial coatings segment for us, the trends are positive especially here in North America and in Asia. In North America we’re benefiting from the rebound in automotive builds and as you know 2009 and the end of 2008 were periods of real weakness. So in 2010 we’re looking for a rebound in North America on the automotive side and a lesser rebound but still a positive push here in North America on the industrial coating side.  In Europe the story is slightly different, we think that OEM automotive production will be relatively flat, maybe slightly positive depending on how the year proceeds and industrial production will be up slightly, these are low single-digit numbers in Europe. The real positive story for us is going to continue to be Asia. As we mentioned in the report Asia now makes up about 20% of the sales of our industrial coating segment. We had record automotive builds in China in 2009. We ended the year with a lot of momentum. The beginning of 2010 appears to be strong so we’re looking again in China for another 10% or so increase in automotive production.  Korea and India are also positive and building momentum. And on the industrial side we’re seeing some strength in the consumer electronics and in automotive parts so I would say we’re looking in the industrial coatings segment to continue growth in Asia, return to growth in North America and relatively flat in Europe and South America although its less important for us, looks positive as well. 
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank : Can you comment on raws, are you seeing price increases in either T02 or some propylene based raws, if not, when might you see those price increases. 
Charles Bunch : We saw the beginnings of modest price increases in coatings raw materials I would say these are now single-digit numbers in the fourth quarter as we went through the quarter. We have discussions going on now in most of those commodities for coatings. Propylene as you know has been going up throughout 2009, that’s the basis for many coatings raw materials so now I would expect modest price increases as we move through the year.  And I’m talking now low single-digit kind of increases overall for coatings. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy – Banc of America Merrill Lynch 
Kevin McCarthy – Banc of America Merrill Lynch : To follow-up on industrial coatings your margins in that segment were the best since the first half of 2007, even well before the downturn commenced, I was just wondering if you could comment on the outlook for margins there. It sounds like you have a constructive volume outlook in raw materials are under control, should we expect margins to move higher this year. 
Charles Bunch : I think we can overall look for improvement in 2010 in our industrial segment for earnings margins. I think we are going to benefit here in North America in particular from a year over year increase in automotive OEM production and the real story for us has been the restructuring activities. We have really worked hard at reducing our structural costs in our industrial coatings segment, both here and in Europe. And as you know from Robert’s remarks earlier in the presentation we are still now achieving at the end of the fourth quarter some additional cost reductions in the industrial segment so I think the cost story for us is going to continue to be positive. We’re going to pick up volume especially here in North America and in Asia.  I think raw materials although there is some inflation out there, I think it is manageable so we’re looking for some further improvement in the coatings margins for industrial in 2010.
Kevin McCarthy – Banc of America Merrill Lynch : And as a follow-up I think you made a comment that you would intend to manage the cash balance down this year, it looks like your target for incremental debt reduction is lower at 150 to 250, perhaps you could comment on uses of free cash flow in that context and touch upon M&A and potential for repurchase this year. 
Robert Dellinger : I think if we continue to have $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet same as we did the end of last year, we’ll likely return to a more balanced approach towards using our cash. Debt repayment will still be there, if its neutral or accretive to earnings to the extent our debt is trading above market and difficult to repurchase, we probably won’t chase it.  And we will continue to look at bolt on acquisitions and may selectively consider share repurchases. And so I think over time we’ll look to be a little more aggressive in our cash usage in a way that facilitates earnings growth. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets: Perhaps another use of cash could be getting a luxury box at the Super Bowl to see the Jets play this year. 
Charles Bunch : We’ve enjoyed the success over the past few years from the Steelers but I wish you and the Jets all the best to you. I don’t have a dog in this fight now so if you want the Jets, we’ll root for the Jets. 
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets: Just following up on the last question, you said that you wanted to get the cash levels down to historic levels, are you taking about half a billion dollars, is that kind of the normal levels that you were thinking of. 
Robert Dellinger : Yes I think that’s where we’ve operated over an extended period of time. You have to recognize that we do need to reserve some cash for a likely or potential asbestos settlement here later in the year. So, in the neighborhood of $300 million after tax, obviously we continue to expect to generate cash during full year 2010 so you’re right we will have flexibility. 
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets: A lot of flexibility, that’s not an insignificant number plus the higher CapEx is more than offset by the lower pension side of things so we can look for something of a meaningful bolt on let’s say or a fairly meaningful share buyback and something along those lines, is that something that is a first quarter or second quarter event that you’re thinking right now. 
Robert Dellinger : We’re not prepared to share timing on those kind of things but as we said we are going to look to be balancing our usage of cash. Bolt ons are clearly part of that equation and we are out looking for those and we’ll continue to look for those and we’ll selectively consider share repurchases.  
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets: So obviously a very nice job in 2009 on building up that cash balance front, and then just to, there was a question earlier about raw materials inflating up modestly on the coatings side of things, how would you talk about your ability to generate price increases such that you’re offsetting some of those raw material costs. 
Charles Bunch : We’re working on price increases in a number of our coatings businesses. We think we will be successful in passing along cost increases for our coatings businesses so at these levels of expected inflation which are modest we think that we will be able to successfully move pricing in those businesses that would be effected. 
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets: And on the income statement there was a note D, that talked about $40 million from improved equity affiliate results, higher royalty income, as well as impact of gains on non operating asset sales, should we think of those three items, the equity affiliate, the royalty income, and the non operating asset sales in that order in terms of size relative to the $40 million total. 
Robert Dellinger : Yes, and I’d point out that this number, other income has averaged about $40 million a quarter over the last eight quarters with two exceptions. First quarter 2009 and fourth quarter 2008 where obviously we were severely impacted by the recession so our normal run rate here has been about $40 million a quarter. It has obviously jumped up a little higher in fourth quarter 2009 and we did see a significant increase in equity earnings and royalty income associated with our glass and commodity chemicals business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts – Buckingham Research 
John Roberts – Buckingham Research : I think you indicated the automotive OEM market was expected to be up about 10% this year, how much higher than 10% will the first half be and how much lower than 10% would the second half be because the comparisons are very uneven as we go through the year. 
Charles Bunch : I think what we said there is that we’re going to expect to be up about 10% globally and I would say that the percentage will be higher we think in the first half, a percentage increase would be higher in the first half than the second half because we began to experience a recovery especially here in North America but also we were building momentum through the year in China and in Asia so I would expect that you would see higher percentage increases in the first quarter and in the second quarter then you’re going to see later in the year. 
John Roberts – Buckingham Research : Would it actually flat in the back half of the year or you think you’ll still be up because you’re comparing against a little bit of a stimulus recovery here in the second half of 2009.
Charles Bunch : I think its not going to be flat in the second half of the year, it may be flat in Europe, but we’re not expecting a big difference but I would say that in North America it should be up in the second half as well and as you look at the broadening of the growth in automotive builds in the rest of Asia, places like Korea, India, even Australia, that I think you’re going to have growth in the second half in Asia as well. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson – UBS
Don Carson – UBS: Question on the chloralkali business you mention that gas costs will be up sequentially in Q1, I know there are some caustic price initiatives but they seem to be taking a little longer to get in place, and chlorine is coming down, so the question is when do you see the chloralkali business bottoming and a follow on to that would be, I know there’s been some talk of closing mercury cell plants and legislative pressures potentially is that something you’re looking at doing that would help firm up the industry.
Charles Bunch : I would comment on chloralkali in, let’s talk about it first in the fourth quarter, we did get chlorine price increases in the fourth quarter. Actually volumes were a little better than prior year and sequentially in the fourth quarter. Some of that was related to the healthy export business that we’re seeing from PVC back and also back in the chain and also I think at the end of December we saw a little more strength again because of some of the uncertainty surrounding price increases that had been announced for caustic.  As we went into the first quarter here earlier in the month I think there was lighter activity in part because I think there had been a number of shipments made at the end of the month around the pricing. We had bad weather. But we’re seeing now we think a positive trend on volume for chloralkali. We also are increasingly confident about the success of the $75.00 caustic price increase so we feel that even though we’re not going to be able to achieve as much of an earnings lift in the first quarter because of some of the export or mix volume and some of the higher natural gas and ethylene costs but we think we’re at the bottom here in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter so we think we see some positive trends for our chloralkali business and the industry in general. 
Don Carson – UBS: And as a follow-up any plans for closing West Virginia given the pressures on mercury cell capacity and could that be what helps turn the industry around. 
Charles Bunch : I don’t at this point, we’re not contemplating a near-term decision on any mercury cell capacity. We did convert at Lake Charles several years ago and that mercury cell production for us at Natrium continue to be a part of our production planning and there is increased regulatory changer in terms of water quality and the rest but we’re confident that we can meet in the coming years the higher standards that we’re being held to in terms of emissions.  In the overall industry for chloralkali in terms of supply and demand in the near-term there have been some production disruptions among our competitors and we think that has served to tighten the supply demand in the industry and I feel that with the enhanced export volumes that you’re seeing and if we see a return of economic growth here in North America I think you’re going to see that supply demand will remain in balance and that there’s no immediate need to shutter additional capacity. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sergey Vasnetsov - Barclays Capital
Sergey Vasnetsov - Barclays Capital: What do you see in the commercial construction markets.
Charles Bunch : The commercial construction market remains weak. In the fourth quarter the business units that we have especially here in North America that have exposure to the commercial construction market and this would include architectural coatings, performance glazings, also some of our general industrial coatings markets, there were some of our weakest.  We did not see a rebound in the market in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter its still early days but I would say at this point we’re not looking in the first half for an improvement in commercial construction. Obviously in some of the markets outside of North America and in particular Asia and China commercial construction activity is quite good.  The activity in Europe is what I would call flat to slightly negative. But the big concern I think because of some of the issues in the construction market and the financing markets for commercial construction is weakest right here in the US. 
Sergey Vasnetsov - Barclays Capital: And what kind of trends do you see in some other long lead time cycles such as aerospace and marine. 
Charles Bunch : Aerospace has been a little weaker here at the end of the fourth quarter. We saw weakness in business or general aviation. That was probably the weakest market and maybe to a lesser extent some of the military applications. Here in 2010 aerospace we think still is holding up. The backlogs continue to slide for the big commercial airliners. We’re looking at lower backlogs at Boeing and Airbus but they have kept production schedules at the OEM level in aerospace fairly steady and we think that as they move through all the qualification steps and start ramping up production for the Dreamliner, the 787 at Boeing, that presents us and a number of other suppliers with some upside.  So I think that if we can move out of this economic crisis environment 2010 should still be a good year for our aerospace business and we hope that if the recovery continues the backlog can rebuild itself over the next 18 months to two years and they can maintain some of the production schedule that we have. So our outlook there we realize there’s some weakness but we think that it is manageable for us. Similar story on the marine business, the production schedules in Asia and in China and Korea in particular have been fairly steady over the last year and we’re only looking for a modest decline this year 2010 in the OEM builds. Now the backlogs there are coming down as well. So we could have an impact in 2011 in our protective and marine business as they adjust production schedules if the backlog doesn’t start to rebuild. The aftermarket business for marine we think is going to be pretty steady. Most of the indicators now in terms of marine activity not the new OEM builds but overall ship usage are going up so we think that’s going to be a positive and a potential offset in the aftermarket business and the protective side of our business unit that goes across a number of industrial and infrastructure assets that’s been very solid in Asia and we look for that to continue.  And we think that the business if the stimulus dollars here or potentially in 2010 in Europe can get to those projects that that will start to give us a little bit of growth because the protective side of the business has not been very strong here in North America nor in Europe and we’re hoping that industrial activity and some of these infrastructure projects as the stimulus money gets through could give us a little better story in that protective market for 2010.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of PJ Juvekar – Citi
PJ Juvekar – Citi: In your architectural EMEA business are all the synergies from SigmaKalon merger factored into the results and what do we look forward to in that business in 2010. And what I mean by that is your margins have always been lower than the US architectural business in Europe so how high can those European margins go. 
Charles Bunch : Well we think that we were still working on our synergies and restructuring activities in the architectural business in Europe as we moved through 2009. We took a what I would call a significant restructuring in the third quarter of 2008 and that got at the initial opportunities we saw from the merger of SigmaKalon and PPG. But as we continued through 2009 the restructuring announcement in the first quarter of 2009 and our work throughout the year we think we were able to take additional costs out of our architectural coatings EMEA supply chain and so we think there is additional upside.  I think Robert commented on the EBITDA performance of the former SigmaKalon business or the architectural EMEA business which was very solid in this weaker construction environment. So we think we have good upside going forward first from additional restructuring and then when we do start to see growth returning to those markets in Europe we think we’ll have good operating leverage and we think also that the combination of the two companies in Europe has given us additional purchasing power and the ability to work a little harder on our input costs in coatings in Europe. 
PJ Juvekar – Citi: I was wondering if you could quantify those savings that you generated in 2009. 
Robert Dellinger : Maybe I can touch on those, our original synergy target was about $50 million in 2008. We beat that. In 2009 we’re looking for another $40 to $50 from synergies. We achieved that. We counted on a little extra maybe $20 to $30 million in 2010 and we saw most of that into 2009. So I would say we’re ahead on the synergy target. Charles talked about the additional restructuring actions. Those had some benefit this year we’ll have continued benefits into 2010. So I think we’re on and ahead of those commitments. To your other question, this business will be less volatile on the downside in a recessionary environment and it will go up at maybe a more modest rate in an upside environment. That is the nature of it and I think we’ve seen that in the difficult economic environment in 2009. It held up very, very well. 
PJ Juvekar – Citi: And I have follow-up question on chloralkali, one of the arguments put forward by PPG is that as coatings raw materials go up the same environment chloralkali makes more money so there is a natural hedge in the portfolio. And how strongly do you believe that that hedge will hold up in 2010.
Charles Bunch : I would say that if you looked at the period when we had the strongest raw material inflation and this would be during 2008 especially those first three quarters, you saw at that time the strongest performance for chloralkali. Now its typically been a lagging business unit in terms of its performance so it lags the recession. We’re feeling some of that now.  We think as my comments on Don’s question is that we are near the bottom of the chloralkali cycle and we’re looking for improvement through the year in 2010 even if we’re still at a relatively low point. So I think you’re going to see a similar phenomenon out of the chloralkali business. As I’ve commented the increases that we’re seeing in raw materials are modest at this time and we’re always going to have somewhat of a lag on that with our chloralkali business but we also feel that we also have a lag in terms of when we get raw material increases either because of contracts or our ability to negotiate with our suppliers.  So we think that we will still get the benefits of chloralkali in terms of that counter cyclical performance. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs 
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs : On the commentary around your auto refinish, you mentioned that demand was weak there and the lack of a restocking cycle, did you not push through the typical end of year price hike to [inaudible] early year price hike to incentivize those dealers to restock. 
Charles Bunch : We did have some pricing activity in refinish in the fourth quarter but we did not provide any additional incentives for our customers, our dealers and distributors to incentivize them to buy and I think this is in recognition of let’s say the more fragile nature of the recovery and the balance sheet or borrowing capabilities of everyone throughout the chain and I think what we’ve seen during this cycle as you’ve heard from our commentary about how we’ve watched cash and tried to deliver good cash performance, strength in the balance sheet, we’ve see that add any number of customers including the automotive refinish customers.  So that they clearly have been watching their balance sheets more closely so rather than restock aggressively to take into consideration a buying window or some other incentive from the manufacturers we’ve seen what now is no longer a destocking because that was their initial reaction especially earlier in this year, they were destocking inventories that they had been holding but this year we’ve also been listening to them so they haven’t been asking us to hey give us some incentive so that we can restock.  Let’s manage demand and let’s manage our inventories to the level of activity that we see out there. Now we also saw at the beginning of this month some more severe weather here in North America and in Europe so we’re hopeful that that will lead to increased demand as we get into the spring because of the number of accidents and the other things that happen with that bad weather.  But it did make it a little tougher at the beginning of this year to look at economic activity in both the North American and European markets because the weather over the first two weeks, its moderating now, was much colder and we think that we’re not as able as a result of that here sitting in mid January to say that we’re going to see this sell through but we’re more confident that as the quarter goes on we get into spring, refinish will be a stronger market because we definitely experienced destocking during the course of 2009.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs : I can sadly say I helped your refinish business in the fourth quarter unfortunately. 
Robert Dellinger : We’re sorry to hear that, slightly happy. 
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs : On the architectural EMEA obviously you have pointed to a much more stable market there given the dynamics of the paint industry, I guess that removes some of the opportunity for a big reversion to the [mean] as things get better, can you sort of put in context where historically those margins have been. You’ve shown us now they’re sort of in the 11 to 12% range, where could they go if everything starts to hit on all cylinders in Europe. 
Charles Bunch : I would say if you look historically at the EBITDA margins for the business in Europe and this goes back to periods before they were part of PPG, they have traditionally been in the range of let’s call it low to mid double-digit so on an EBITDA basis you’re probably looking at 10 to 13, 14% so there is I think some modest upside if we get some good growth and we continue to work hard on the cost synergies.  But I would say some other margins that we’ve seen historically out of PPG business where you’re north of 15%, I don’t think we’re going to see that kind of growth especially for the next couple of years because I don’t think the European construction forecast is robust at this point. So I would say that I think we can see some further improvement but we’re going to need some additional growth both in the continent and also in that emerging Eastern European region for us to move it up significantly over a percentage point or two. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Saul Ludwig – KeyBanc
Saul Ludwig – KeyBanc: Just a clarification, that gain on the sale of the non core assets how much was that and where did those earnings fall in the segment numbers and unrelated to that did you sell any platinum in the quarter that may have contributed some earnings. 
Robert Dellinger : To my knowledge we did not sell any platinum. The other income as I said is slightly higher than its historically been. We’ve normally run about $40 million a quarter, we’re up to $52. Principal driver was higher equity earnings from affiliates and royalty income streams which impact the glass and commodity chemical segments. 
Saul Ludwig – KeyBanc: But can you quantify the asset sale component. 
Robert Dellinger : The gap between our average and this high level. I would use the gap between where we’ve been averaging and this $52 million you mentioned. 
Saul Ludwig – KeyBanc: With regard to your stores, where did you start the year in terms of numbers of stores, where did you end and what are your plans for stores for this year. 
Charles Bunch : We started I would say on average around 425, we’re now at 400 and we think this is the right number of stores for our footprint and so we’re not contemplating any significant move on store count. 
Saul Ludwig – KeyBanc: And with the increase in capital spending what would be an example of some of the new projects, are they cost reduction projects, are they capacity projects, what type of strategic thrust do the higher cap spending have. 
Charles Bunch : Well the biggest single project that we have in 2010 is we have started, we announced this last year a new resin plant in China, Zhangjiagang, and so that is the biggest single capital project for PPG this year and that would be an example in Asia and in China in particular the capital spending increases are to meet demand.  We do have, we are running pretty hard at our facilities in Asia, so I would say Asia, the capital is more tied to growth. In North America and in Europe its mostly cost reduction, productivity, maintenance of assets, they are not capacity driven projects in North America and Europe. 
Saul Ludwig – KeyBanc: Strategically when you think about your portfolio of businesses which has the glass and has the chemicals and has the silicas, what would you like to achieve. It takes two to tango obviously but what would you like to achieve during 2010 in terms of further repositioning the portfolio of businesses within PPG. 
Charles Bunch : Well right now as Robert indicated in our comments about use of cash we would like to start making smaller bolt on acquisitions. We still think that there are things for us to do especially outside of North America in terms of improving our position in coatings. So that would be I think further, that would accelerate to a limited extent what is already a natural tendency of these regions to grow a little faster and our portfolio to grow a little faster.  At this point we are obviously trying to work ourselves through some tougher times in our glass businesses and also in chloralkalai, these are more asset intensive higher asset industries and businesses. We’ve been pleased during this cycle with the contributions for chloralkali. We think that the fiberglass business is coming back. The performance glazings business however is being challenged by this weak commercial construction market in North America.  So we’d like to see those businesses rebound to a position where they are contributing more to the portfolio but obviously our priority is to continue to grow our optical business and our coatings businesses especially in some of the higher growth developing regions and I think you’re going to see that our portfolio will continue to move toward those priority businesses over time regardless of whether we’re successful in making larger acquisitions. 
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research 
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research : A couple of questions I would like to follow-up on, you talked about the silicas business being up significantly in the optics and specialty business, and I think you also said that the optics business was up a little bit and yet your volumes are down in the quarter on a year over year basis so what was the offsetting business that did not do well. 
Robert Dellinger : We said the silicas business volumes were up. We said the optical business sales were up aided by currency. So currency was the delta there. 
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research : So actually the optical business then excluding currency was down enough to offset the improvement in the silicas. 
Robert Dellinger : Correct. 
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research : Then secondly on the natural gas you talked about only hedging 25% or so of your needs in 2010 at about $8.00 so is that going to trail off from 50 to 25 through the year or are you basically going to start the year at about 25% hedged. 
Robert Dellinger : It does ramp down and its I think maybe it goes from 30 to 20 over the course of the year. So we are burning off those hedges so that the amount of hedged natural gas at the end of the year will be lower than what it is right now. 
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research :  And can you give us an idea of kind of what your outlook for natural gas is that you’ve decided to reduce your hedging. 
Charles Bunch : Obviously hedges protect you on the upside, they don’t help you, they hurt you when you’re in a natural gas market like we’ve been in and we’ve been trying to understand what’s going on in natural gas. We don’t know if what we’ve seen during the course of 2009 was the result of the reduced, the recession and reduced industrial activity, was it the result of increased demand, especially with some of these shale gas finds.  So we have a little less confidence I guess you would say in our ability to forecast or predict the market and so what we’re saying now is that we’re prepared especially until we better understand the supply side and what’s happening with shale that maybe the assumptions that we were under over the last few years, that natural gas was a diminishing commodity and we were going to face inflationary pressure for the foreseeable future. We don’t believe that now. And we’re trying to understand the market and we think we don’t need to have the positions out in the out years that we’ve had and we didn’t see even during 2009 the forward years, there wasn’t as much of a decrease from kind of a spot or monthly rate. So we seem to be paying or the hedgers that we’re paying a premium for that ability for the ability to kind of lock in those costs and maybe that’s appropriate for utilities that can pass some of those through to their regulatory agencies but it wasn’t as appropriate for us. 
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research : Turning our attention to the automotive OEM side of the business, you talked about not seeing any tail offs in production in December that you would typically expect towards the end of the year, is this just being delayed. Are you seeing production being curtailed in January or do you think the inventory has been depleted enough in the second half of 2009 that the producers are basically not taking the shutdowns they typically do. 
Charles Bunch : Yes, automotive OEM in this country we saw a little more strength in December versus certainly last year or historically some of the shutdowns. I think they are still working to get through, to rebuild inventories in certain models here in North America so we think that the first quarter is going to be a solid quarter and then maybe the manufacturers will kind of take stock of where their inventories are, what they see the demand being and they could make adjustments down or up following this quarter but it looks like in North America things are fairly locked in. In Europe we think that it’s a little less clear but in Asia and especially China we see production moving through the end of the year with a lot of momentum. Chinese New Year is a little later this year. Its in the middle of February so our production levels here at the early part of the first quarter are still strong.  We are hearing as we have all been hearing about some of the movement of the Chinese government in terms of financing or borrowing and lending in China. So I think it’s a little too early for us to say that this thing is going to continue at the 25% plus kind of numbers for all of 2010. We don’t forecast that for China. Our forecasts are more modest then that. But at this point we’re seeing very good production in Asia and in China. 
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research : Can you give us an idea of how big your Asian business is versus your US business in automotive OEM paint. 
Charles Bunch : Our automotive OEM coatings business is about 20% of our total, we’re about a third in North America and the balance would be in Europe and in some of the outlying areas, South America and South Africa as an example. 
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research : So not much in Asia then. 
Charles Bunch : No, we’re 20%. For us this is very, we think its, and none of that is in Japan. We have not been able to penetrate the Japanese market at all so that we think that 20% of our sales now in automotive OEM coming out of Asia with no content in Japan and this has all been delivered for the most part over the last five plus years, we’re quite pleased with our performance and how we’ve balanced geographically in that business unit. 
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research : And then on the autos, as part of your industrial coatings business how big is autos in 2009, or how big was it in 2009.
Charles Bunch : It was still, automotive OEM was still our biggest business unit within that industrial segment. You have to know that the industrial coatings or some call it the general industrial business unit which is the second largest business unit in that segment was also effected, not quite as much as automotive OEM but it was still down so in 2009 and 2010 the automotive OEM business will be the biggest one in that segment. 
Operator: There are no additional questions at this time; I would like to turn it back over to management for any additional or closing comments. 
Charles Bunch : Thank you very much. We appreciate all of your support and your interest in PPG and we look forward to working with you in what we hope is going to be another year of recovery here in 2010. Thank you very much.

Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the third quarter 2009 PPG Industries earnings conference call. My name is Keesha and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Vince Morales, Vice President Investor Relations.
Vincent J. Morales: Hello. This is Vince Morales, Vice President Investor Relations for PPG Industries. Welcome to PPG's third quarter 2009 financial teleconference. Joining me on the call today from PPG is Chuck Bunch, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Bill Hernandez, Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer, Bob Dellinger, Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer Designate and Dave Navikas, Vice President and Controller.

The agenda for today's discussion is noted on Slide number 3. Our third quarter recap is on Slide number 4. And now to discuss that, let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch.
Charles E. Bunch: Thank you, Vince, and welcome, everyone. This morning I will provide a brief overview of PPG's performance in the third quarter. Vince will then review some of the financial details and then I will make some closing remarks. At that time Bill Hernandez, Bob Dellinger, Dave Navikas, Vince, and I will be happy to answer questions. Overall I am pleased with the progress we are making in our efforts to return to the level of profitability experienced in 2007 and early 2008. PPG's solid performance in the third quarter reflects the positive changes we made to our business portfolio over the past several years. Combined, our coatings in optical and specialty materials segments delivered 7% higher year-over-year earnings and collectively accounted for over 95% of our segment earnings. We achieved these results despite a sales decline of about 15% for these businesses and in comparison with what were record levels in the prior year. We benefited greatly from our aggressive cost reduction actions as well as a modest improvement in demand stemming from a very gradual recovery in the global economy. In the quarter, overall business conditions remained challenging in comparison with prior years. But, again, general demand levels in many end use markets we serve increased moderately versus the second quarter. This improvement was consistent throughout the quarter and was evidenced in all of our major regions including Asia where China was the main contributor to what were very strong results. Also, we benefited from an upturn in auto production especially in North America. This aided our industrial coding segment which includes our automotive OEM coatings business and our Silicas business unit, which is part of the Optical and Specialty Materials segment. Our Performance Coating segment grew earnings and margins year-over-year and continues to demonstrate its resilience. Architectural coatings, EMEA, continued its solid performance. And while earnings were down very slightly this quarter, they were actually up in terms of local currency. However, conditions remained most challenging in our glass end use markets, including further deterioration in the US commercial construction market. And as expected, our commodity chemicals segment results declined versus last quarter and in comparison to last year's record levels. This decrease was due to lower sales prices, although pricing did improve at quarter's end. We made good progress on our previously announced restructuring initiatives and have supplemented those actions with additional initiatives to reduce costs based on our lower volume levels. And while we are well ahead of schedule in completing our list of restructuring actions, we have further steps to take and several plants yet to close. This will provide us with additional savings to be realized in the next few quarters. In the quarter, currency conversion remained a headwind. The Euro, despite recent strengthening, was still 6% weaker against the US dollar year-over-year. In total, currency negatively impacted our segment earnings by about $11 million or about $0.04 per share. Using today's rates, currency would turn into a tailwind in the fourth quarter. Lastly, we generated about $650 million in cash from operations in the quarter, up a noteworthy 40% versus a solid performance last year. This was primarily due to our continued focus and execution on managing working capital. We paid down about $700 million in debt during the quarter and still ended the quarter with about $900 million of cash. Now here is Vince to review some of the financial details.
Vincent J. Morales: Thanks, Chuck. I will start by reviewing our sales results which are detailed on Slide 5. Overall sales for the company were down $1 billion versus the third quarter of last year with nearly one quarter of that decline, or approximately $230 million, stemming from our late 2008 divestiture of the majority interest in the Automotive Glass and Services business. Also contributing to the sales decline were lower selling prices of about $150 million. The key factor in this regard was lower caustic pricing and commodity chemicals. Currency represented an equal-sized headwind. Weaker year-over-year demand resulted in about $500 million and lower sales volume equating to a 12% volume decline. We experienced our largest percentage decline in our glass segment where volume declines exceeded 25%. Our best volume performance was in our Architectural Coatings, EMEA, segment where volume results have improved each quarter this year as we experienced only a slight decline of low to mid-single digit percent this quarter. Also, our Industrial Coating segment volumes, while down year-over-year, improved markedly in comparison with early quarters this year with the largest improvement in automotive OEM coatings. And detailed further on the next slide, our year-over-year volume results, while still negative, have improved gradually each quarter this year in reflection of slightly better demand. Also as illustrated, 2008 results did not deteriorate notably until the fourth quarter. So comparisons for this year's third quarter were against record third quarter sales levels for the company. In terms of our regions, Asia Pacific was clearly our best performing region this quarter, delivering higher volumes versus last year driven by strong growth in China. Our US region along with our European region experienced low teen percentage volume decreases. This was a solid improvement compared to earlier this year. Also, as Chuck mentioned, negative currency translations remained a headwind. Included on the slide is an illustration of a key benchmark currency, the Euro, which, despite recent strengthening, was still about 6% lower in comparison with the third quarter of 2008. This currency translation was also negatively impacted earnings by about $11 million or about $0.04 a share. The following slide details our sales by segment. In summary, total sales were down about 20% excluding the impact of Auto Glass and the Service business divestiture late last year. Sales declined in all segments. Commodity Chemicals and Glass experienced the most severe decreases and the rate of decline was fairly consistent with the second quarter. Inversely, our coatings and Optical and Specialty Materials segments were still down year-over-year but demonstrated an improvement in comparison with earlier quarters this year. Our historical trend is that sales seasonally dropped from the second to third quarter by roughly 2% to 4%. However, the improving trends in these segments this quarter resulted in third quarter sales eclipsing second quarter levels by about 5%. Our segment earnings are detailed on the next slide and in total we're down just over 20% compared with last year. However, our earnings have been on an improving trend each quarter this year and as you see, were actually higher in several segments. As with sales, Commodity Chemicals experienced severe declines in comparison with what were record levels of earnings last year in reflection of lower selling prices for caustic soda. Last results were also negative due primarily to lower end use market demand. In contrast, and despite lower sales levels, the combined earnings of our Coatings and Optical and Specialty Materials segments improved nicely and accounted for the great majority of our total segment earnings. A major contributor to these results was the significant cost reduction steps we took over the past year. As Chuck mentioned, we expect to realize additional savings in the coming quarters. Our adjusted earnings per share are presented on the next slide. The reconciliation of these amounts to our reported earnings per share is included in the Appendix of today's presentation materials which is available at the Investor's Center on our Web site at www.ppg.com. In the quarter, our adjusted earnings per share were $0.97 compared with $1.37 per share in 2008. Our improving trend is detailed on the chart to the right side of the slide. As you can see, our third quarter performance, while still down year-over-year, represents a sizeable improvement in comparison with the prior three quarters. Once again, aggressive cost management was key to this performance. PPG's restructuring initiatives are detailed on the next slide including the anticipated annual run rate of our cumulative savings from these cost reduction actions. We initially expected to achieve an annual savings run rate of over $250 million by the end of 2010 when our restructuring programs were scheduled to be fully implemented. This equates to over $1 in earnings per share accretion. However, we have accelerated our pace by several quarters and now anticipate achieving our targeted savings level earlier in 2010, thus benefiting us for nearly the full year of 2010. The incremental savings next year will be about $100 million higher than this year. The restructuring actions are generally structural in nature as we are permanently modifying the way we conduct business. These restructuring savings were a main contributor to our improved quarterly results and were combined with a variety of other cost measures we took based on lower activity levels and general economic conditions along with solid results stemming from our efforts to lower input costs. Moving now to our business segment review, I will start on the next slide with our Industrial Coatings segment where the impact of our cost management and restructuring actions are readily apparent. As a reminder, this segment has business units serving the global automotive OEM, general industrial, and packaging end use markets. As detailed in the segment results, sales have improved each quarter this year although the third quarter sales were still about 20% below the prior year's period. However, due in large part to our aggressive cost management, we have delivered consistent improvement in segment operating margins despite the lower sales levels. As detailed on the chart, PPG's Industrial Coatings segment earnings are higher this year versus last and nearly $100 million higher in comparison to the 2008 fourth quarter figure on only marginally higher quarterly sales. This clearly illustrates the operating leverage we are able to achieve due to our lower cost structure. Further details on our Industrial Coatings segment are included in the next slide. Sales in the quarter totaled nearly $825 million, down about $200 million. Volumes were up 18% and currency accounted for the remainder of the decline. As displayed on the segment volume chart, third quarter volume declines were an improvement in comparison with the past several quarters as demand increased in each of our major regions. The largest improvement was in the North American automotive OEM market in which year-over-year production was down about 50% in the first half of the year but improved significantly in the third quarter. While this increase was notable, as illustrated on the bottom graph, North American vehicle production continued to run below the level of US auto sales. As a result, inventories of automobiles in the United States are currently very low and we anticipate flat to higher auto builds in the fourth quarter which would build inventories and bring production closer to ongoing sales levels. Business for the Industrial Coatings segment in our Asia Pacific region reflected a stronger and growing Chinese economy. China is now producing more cars than any country in the world. This aided PPG's auto sales in the region and we easily eclipsed last year's sales levels. The end use market served by this segment such as automotive OEM and several other industrial markets experienced some of the most traumatic volume declines during the depths of the recent recession. Our businesses have been working diligently over the past year to return this segment to historical profitability levels. And although we still have some work to do, surpassing last year's earnings level was an important milestone. We remain very well positioned from a cost perspective to benefit from any level of additional volume. Performance Coating segment results are detailed on the next slide. Sales were down about $150 million, or 13%. Segment volumes fell 13% although the segment's business in Asia posted volume growth. We delivered strong earnings topping last year by $7 million despite a negative currency conversion impact on earnings of $6 million. Operating margins increased by 240 basis points as aggressive cost management was a key contributor in offsetting volume declines. Looking individually at each business unit, our Architectural Coatings American and Asia business unit has volume declines of low double digit teen percentages similar to last quarter. In the US, our stores and dealer channels, which primarily serve professional paint contractors were down more while our national accounts or DIY channel was only slightly negative. Asia volumes grew while Latin America was down more than 25%. Volumes in our Automotive Refinish business were also down but improved in comparison to last quarter primarily due to reduced distributor destocking. Sales in both Protective and Marine Coatings and Aerospace, both which serve later cycle industries, were also down year-over-year but the overall sales levels were essentially flat with the prior quarter. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we anticipate normal seasonal sales declines stemming primarily from our US Architectural Coatings business. Results for our Architectural Coatings Europe, Middle East and Africa, or EMEA business, are on the next slide. Sales were about $560 million in the third quarter, down about $73 million versus last year's period with about $50 million of decline related to currency conversion. Sales were down only about 3% in local currencies. Earnings were $59 million, down only slightly from last year's $61 million despite a negative $8 million impact from currency conversion. Volumes in the business were down low single digit percentages in comparison with record levels in the prior year. In light of the economic conditions the business has performed extremely well all year in both sales and earnings. This is attributed to the large maintenance nature of Architectural Coatings in the European markets we serve along with a tight cost focus. Included on the slide are the earnings before interest, taxes, appreciation and amortization or EBITDA. As you can see, our EBITDA margins improved 120 basis points this quarter. We believe EBITDA is a relevant measure for this business given the ongoing non-cash amortization expense stemming from the acquisition. Looking ahead, based on current exchange rates, currency conversion would shift to a slight tail wind in the fourth quarter and we expect to realize traditional notable seasonal sales declines which are customary for Architectural Coatings. Our Optical and Specialty Materials segment results are detailed and the next slide. Sales were $257 million, down $33 million versus last year's quarter. However, earnings were $67 million, about 10% higher than the prior year's period. Sales in our Optical products business were comparable to last quarter while sales of our Silica products, which are used as a raw material in production of tires and batteries, recovered somewhat in comparison with the past several quarters reflecting higher automotive production. The segment operating margins, which are the highest in PPG, also expanded nicely as improved year-over-year results in Silicas complemented strong Optical products results. Both business benefited from cost reduction actions. Looking ahead, we expect traditional seasonal sales declines in business and will remain focused on cost and operating margins.  On the next slide are our Commodity Chemical segment results. Sales declined by over $200 million versus last year's period driven by lower pricing. Earnings fell by $97 million from record levels in the previous year's third quarter. Aggregate pricing for chlorine and caustic soda, or the ECU price, fell versus the second quarter but moved up toward the end of the third quarter. Demand for chlorine and caustic soda improved from the prior quarter as did our operating rates. Our natural gas cost in the quarter was lower than a year ago and was about $6 per million BTU. This included the impact from our natural gas hedge position as we had half of our normal purchases hedged at about $8 per unit in the quarter. Looking ahead, seasonal demand has historically trended down 7% to 8% from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. Our Glass segment details are on the following slide. As was the case last quarter, we included 2008 results both with and without the Automotive Glass and Services business we divested in late 2008. My comparison comments will be against the 2008 results excluding Auto Glass. Sales this quarter were about $225 million, down $100 million or about 30% from last year. The demand environment for performance glazings or architectural glass remains extremely challenging including further deterioration in the US commercial construction end use market. Fiberglass demand remains equally weak year-over-year but did improve from extremely low activity levels in the prior two quarters of 2009. Earnings dropped $28 million year-over-year to a loss of $6 million driven by the lower volumes and related lower manufacturing utilization. The earnings drop is despite aggressive cost reduction actions which yielded savings of more than $15 million in the quarter alone. End use market demand is seasonally lower in the fourth quarter and we will continue to aggressively manage these businesses.  Let me conclude my remarks by reviewing PPG's cash position which is detailed on the next slide. We ended the quarter with about $900 million of cash on hand. In the quarter we generated just about $650 million of cash from operations which is up 40% from last year's third quarter. Our cash generation performance the past two quarters, driven by working capital management, surpassed last year's results and now I will remind you our full year 2008 results were a record for the company. As with recent prior quarters, we have been holding a higher cash balance to support liquidity due in part to our strong cash generation this past quarter. We repaid about $700 million of debt including a repayment of all of our commercial paper. We remain on or favorable to our full year targets in all of our cash uses. Let me discuss a few of them. Debt repayment remains one of our top priorities. And sense our acquisition of SigmaKalon in 2008 we have lowered our net debt by about $1.4 billion which is double our original target despite a much more challenging economy. We will continue to pay down debt while neutral or accretive to earnings. Funding our pension liabilities is another cash use and we have contributed about $300 million to our pension plans this year with about one third of that being made in stock. I will remind you that pension contribution figures are pretax and we do receive a tax benefit. Also, we are mitigating the dilutive effect to our share count through the use of equity forward agreements we made primarily in the first quarter of this year when our stock price was at a low level. We don't anticipate any further pension contributions of meaningful size this year. We originally targeted $200 million in full-year capital spending excluding acquisitions. We have spent right at $50 million each quarter this year or about $150 million through the first nine months, so we remain on target. Regarding acquisitions, we will likely remain cautious but continue to analyze acquisition candidates, particularly [bolt] on opportunities. If we continue to see slight and consistent improvement in the global economy, we will likely reduce our cash balance closer towards historical levels. Overall, we are very pleased with our cash generation performance and position. However, we recently heightened our focus on working capital management and expect this effort to benefit us even further in future quarters. With that, I will now turn it back over to Chuck for some closing remarks.
Charles E. Bunch: Thanks, Vince. Let me summarize what I believe was a solid quarter by recapping a few key items. In most markets, demand levels improved modestly in comparison with the past several quarters. We were able to fully capitalize on this higher demand and our earnings benefited from our lower cost structure. Our coatings and Optical and Specialty Materials segments demonstrated their resilience and provided insight into why we have been growing our presence in these businesses. Also, our efforts to expand our global footprint the past several years prove beneficial as we were able to grow nicely in Asia this quarter and, as we expected, Commodity Chemicals pricing fell during the quarter but moved up in September. In the fourth quarter, excluding the impacts of a normal seasonal drop, we expect overall market conditions to once again improve for most of our businesses, but only modestly. We expect our growth to continue in Asia and anticipate global automotive production will remain at least at third quarter levels, if not higher. Currency conversion is likely to shift to a tailwind based on what today is a weaker US dollar. We will continue to execute on our restructuring and other cost reduction actions and the related earnings benefit will grow again next quarter. Regarding our strong cash position, we will keep debt reduction as one of our top priorities but expect to gradually return to a more balanced use of cash in the coming quarters. Let me conclude by saying that overall it was a solid quarter as we continue to return to our prior levels of profitability, including excellent performance in coatings and Optical and Specialty Materials. Our ability to profitably leverage the modest volume improvement we saw versus the last few quarters was apparent. Equally important is that our execution was and remains a critical factor as we delivered additional cost savings and focused on working capital reductions.  Before we take questions I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome Bob Dellinger to our management team at PPG. Bob, welcome, and we're looking forward to working with you. And I would be remiss if I didn't publicly thank Bill Hernandez, our Senior Vice President and CFO for his many years of service and many contributions to the company. Bill, I wish you a very happy retirement, and thank you for everything you've done for PPG. Now, Operator, would you please give instructions and open the phone lines for questions?
Operator:   (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Sergey Vasnetsov - Barclays Capital.
Sergey Vasnetsov - Barclays Capital: I think your results have shown what strong incremental margins you could bring once the [inaudible] comes back and it sounds from commentaries the fourth quarter could be a combination of seasonal weakness and some incremental recovery. Would you think that those factors would roughly offset each other?
Charles E. Bunch: Yes, I think, Sergey, what you're seeing from us is that we're going to have seasonal weakness in many of the construction related businesses. These would be our Architectural Coatings businesses in Europe or in North America and also some seasonal weakness in our chlor-alkali business. But we feel that with the cost reduction actions that we've taken and the momentum we have in some of the industrial businesses where you see in markets like North America or China in particular where auto builds are continuing to increase, I think we are going to have somewhat of an offset to the seasonal weakness that we traditionally experience in the fourth quarter.
Sergey Vasnetsov - Barclays Capital: And so on the acquisition front given as you get more comfortable on your overall debt structure, as you think about the [inaudible] would you expect minor opportunities or reasonable size opportunities for you?
Charles E. Bunch: We are beginning to look now, Sergey. Obviously this year we've been focused on our restructuring actions and making sure the company was well positioned. We're very pleased with our cash generation capabilities here over the last couple of quarters. We have a good cash balance now. And we will begin to look for acquisition opportunities in coatings in particular and we hope that, you know, in the coming quarters that, you know, some of these may develop into legitimate opportunities for us.
Operator: Your next question comes from Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets.
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets: On Slide, Page 16, you showed the trend on the chlor-alkali side having bottomed in the July/August timeframe and moving up in the September timeframe. We're halfway done with October. Would you anticipate that that trend coming off the bottom is where you would see the ECU such that the fourth quarter average ECU might be above the third quarter average ECU?
Charles E. Bunch: We think the ECU will be modestly improved in the fourth quarter. The one factor we’ll have in this business unit is the seasonal volume weakness that we traditionally get typically towards the end of the fourth quarter, but we do have some positives that are working for the industry in general because of the weaker dollar, the strength in the Asian markets where I think we’re going to see less exports out of Asia, more use of their domestic chlor-alkali capacity in the region, so I think that it will set the stage for improvement as we go through the fourth quarter and into 2010, but we still expect some seasonal trends here, especially on the volume side.
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets: All right, so the volume’s coming off of pricing moving up. And Chuck, staying with Asia, obviously you talked about the volumes being positive in that part of the world. What percent of sales was Asia in total for the third quarter, and can you give us some indication at least of the current trends in China post the national holidays that the had there.
Charles E. Bunch : The percent of sales now for our businesses in Asia is over 15%, it’s around 18%, so a very positive trend here and we had some strength here at the end of the third quarter, especially in China, because of the national holiday at the beginning of October, but we have been monitoring volumes as the plants came back to work in the second week of October, and activity levels are very good, so we’re picking up here after the national holiday celebration at similar levels, very positive indicator for us. 
Operator: As a reminder, please limit questions to two. Your next question comes from Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs. 
Analyst for Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs: Good morning. This is Amy [inaudible] for Bob. I have two [audio impaired]
Operator: Your next question comes from David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank. 
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank : Chuck, can you comment on what you’re seeing in raw materials, whether you’re taking any higher Ti02 prices, are you seeing any oil based raw materials?
Charles E. Bunch : I would say that there are trends probably in both areas, Ti02, there are discussions going on with the Ti02 producers now. They are attempting to get price increases, and the discussions are ongoing. I would say that certainly the trend is not down and we will see in the coming quarters if there is price increases on the Ti02 side but certainly the suppliers are attempting to pass those costs in a modest way to their customers.  On the oil based side, we have obviously some strength in oil prices combined with weakness in the dollar. I would say that right now we are experiencing conversations let’s call it where suppliers are trying to pass some of these costs on. You have a countervailing trend though with the weakness in natural gas prices here and a lot of the raw materials for our coatings businesses are based on natural gas or ethylene and those trends are favorable so we have a mix there and I would say that if there is any price tendency, it is modestly higher but I would say at this point, very muted.  
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank : And Chuck, w hat’s your ability to pass through any high raw materials to your selling prices?
Charles E. Bunch : We’ve seen in prior years and prior quarters that we have some ability to pass along higher raw material prices, but usually with a lag effect of one or two or more quarters, so right now I would say we’re monitoring and in discussions with both suppliers and customers, making sure that the trends that we see don’t accelerate, but typically the industry in many of our end use markets has been able to pass on costs, but usually with a lag effect. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Amy in place of Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. 
Analyst for Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs: Thank you. I have two questions. The first one is regarding glass and I’m wondering how shall we expect an operating profit of this segment to progress in the fourth quarter and also heading to 2010. It looks like the commercial construction market may show further erosion. On the other hand, you guys may have more aggressive cost cutting efforts there.
Charles E. Bunch : Well, we continue to work hard in this business segment. We are disappointed that we continue to report an operating loss here. We have some trends that are moving against each other. We have some positive trends, especially in our fiberglass business where the electronics market in Asia in particular is strengthening. Also in the composite side of the business which supports transportation and a number of other plastic composites end use markets. That appears to be strengthening, so those are good trends for us, positively affecting our fiberglass business.  We do, however, see a pause in the wind energy market where we are a large supplier for wind blades to these large turbines. That’s pausing and we do have this negative trend in commercial construction that has affected our flat glass or performance glazings business, so we’re still fighting some, I would say, some difficult market conditions in some of our end use markets, so we are still working hard to take some more costs out, but we’re trying to be patient here with these businesses, but we are clearly disappointed that we are again are reporting a loss here in the third quarter.
Analyst for Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs: My second question is related to the US paint market. I’m wondering how did the dynamic between the two channels, the stores and those national accounts played out. If I’m right, I heard you say the stores sounded weaker. National account declined modestly but I recall last quarter you said national accounts were up in the single digit levels, so I’m wondering what the trends look like on a sequential basis across the two channels.
Charles E. Bunch : Typically the volumes do start to weaken especially later in the third quarter in the architectural coatings business here in North America, but it was a very modest weakness in our DIY home center channels. The volumes we thought were relatively stable. We do see, however, continued weakness on our company store channel and there we are seeing continued volume losses. We’ve been talking about a modest improvement in new home construction but we’re still at very low levels and we did get impacted by the weakening of the commercial construction markets here in North America. So the third quarter volume trends were still negative for us. We have closed a number of stores. We reduced our costs and infrastructure to support the business. We feel that we are in a position now with a stable store count and we will be able to profitably take advantage of volume improvement and I think you’re going to see that in new home construction and the biggest piece of the company owned stores business which is the residential repaint market, but right now we are fighting some negative trends in commercial construction and we’re going to have to look I think to 2010 to see some improvement there from a volume basis.
Operator: Your next question comes from PJ Juvekar – Citi. 
Analyst for PJ Juvekar – Citi: Hi, this is Anthony [inaudible] standing in for PJ. Just as a follow up to Amy’s question, on the paint store count, can you quantify how many stores you started out with in the beginning of the year, and then maybe how much you will end up with at the end of the year?
Charles E. Bunch : We have now a little over 400 stores. If you look at our store count last year, we were approaching 450, so we are down from let’s say last year’s peak levels to today about 10% in store count and about half of that has taken place here in 2009.
Analyst for PJ Juvekar – Citi: In the DIY channel, one of your major competitors reduced selected price points, and granted we’re headed into a slower part of the season. Are you seeing any price pressure in the DIY channel?
Charles E. Bunch : In the DIY channel, I’m not sure exactly what you’re referring to, but obviously in our channel we go to market through primarily Lowe’s and I think that from everything that we see in the marketplace, Lowe’s is holding their own in the DIY channel and they have been I think successful in continuing to attract consumers into their stores as we discussed before. Repainting is a relatively low cost home improvement project and I think it’s held up better in the home improvement centers as opposed to some of the larger ticket items such as bathroom or kitchen remodeling, so I think the DIY segment in our home center customers have done on a relative basis better through this recession.
Operator: Your next question comes from Kevin McCarthy – Banc of America Merrill Lynch . 
Kevin McCarthy – Banc of America Merrill Lynch : Chuck, as you look ahead to 2010, I was wondering if you could comment on what we should expect in terms of industry volume growth in both US and European architectural coatings and maybe could provide some color as to what you’re seeing in Europe these days in terms of trends and different country trends.
Charles E. Bunch : We think that volume trends, if we start in Europe, I would say the volume trends are not positive. So I would say in 2010 we are not preparing for volume growth. I would say that we are talking about zero volume growth to maybe negative low single digits. So that’s the kind of volume growth. We obviously have some markets that are stronger than others but we are not forecasting volume growth in Europe for next year. In North America we think there will be modest improvement in volumes. Again, probably on the positive side, lower single digits, because I think we will be fighting a little bit of the headwind in commercial construction, but we think that residential, both new home and the repaint markets will be somewhat stronger. [audio impaired]
Operator: Your next question comes from Don Carson – UBS. 
Analyst for Don Carson – UBS: This is [inaudible] calling in for Don. We had a couple questions. First off was the corporate line. You guys reported $15 million and I know you had an $8 million currency gain last quarter, so is that what’s going on here? What’s the real run rate for corporate going forward?
Vincent J. Morales: This is Vince. Similar to last quarter, the currency gains for inter-company accounts payable and receivable benefited us a few million dollars versus last quarter, and again, that’s typically a sequential event because we revalue those each quarter with the dollar weakening. That’s aided us by just a few million dollars, so I think we’re still in the $15 million to $20 million run rate per quarter, absent those currency gains. 
Analyst for Don Carson – UBS: I thought last quarter the run rate was supposed to be around $30 million.
Charles E. Bunch : No, first quarter we had currency go against us which pushed the first quarter up.
Analyst for Don Carson – UBS: In chlor-alkali, I guess what’s your read on the price increase that are out there? I mean, we’ve been reading this, the pickup and operating rates over the summer, a little strain on realizing some of those increases. Do you see that or are they…
Charles E. Bunch : We think that the price increases that we have been successful and in some of the price increase throughout the third quarter, and I think what you’ll see through the coming quarters is that the prices will continue to firm in chlor-alkali, again, in what we think will be some positive trends, some of these macroeconomic in terms of the relative strengths of economies around the world and the US dollar. Those will be positive trends and we haven’t seen as we’ve been talking about on the architectural coatings side, we haven’t seen the volume in construction take off yet in a very strong direction and that will more than likely keep some of the PVC production muted.
Analyst for Don Carson – UBS: Just real quickly, is there a chance to increase auto production? When do you think that would help you guys get positive in glass?
Charles E. Bunch : Today we are in our company’s operations, we are exposed to the automotive OEM business in coatings and we are positive, we made money in the third quarter in our automotive OEM coatings businesses around the world. So that has been positive. It’s benefiting obviously from some of the restructuring actions. The automotive glass side of the ledger, that business has been divested … we divested a 60% interest in the third quarter of last year, and they are I think also benefiting from the restructuring actions that were taken after the divestiture, so I think they are improving their positioning in the automotive glass market, and benefiting here with the return of production levels in North America to improved levels.
Analyst for Don Carson – UBS: Do you think you can return to profitability in the fourth quarter?
Charles E. Bunch : It is profitable. The business, the auto glass business, is profitable. It is not included, however, in the glass operating segment. The glass operating segment does not include our 40% interest in the auto glass and services business. That operating segment only includes the performance of our two remaining glass businesses, fiberglass and performance glazing. 
Analyst for Don Carson – UBS: Which is down because of the construction.
Charles E. Bunch : In performance glazings, yes. Fiberglass still coming back from a very weak market tied to what we talked about. The transportation market, wind market being stalled out here for the moment, but we see positive trends actually in the fiberglass business and we think that will be helping us in the coming quarters. 
Operator: Your next question comes from John Roberts – Buckingham Research . 
John Roberts – Buckingham Research: If you look at the results sequentially instead of year-over-year, how much of the 3.5% sales gain was currency, and how much of the $0.06 earnings sequential improvement was currency as well?
Vincent J. Morales: This is Vince again. Currency moved up just slightly. It’s too hard to look at some of our businesses sequentially because of the seasonal nature of them. You can do it I guess by comparing the sales dollars in our average margin for each segment, but there’s too much seasonality in some of the businesses to try to estimate that.
John Roberts – Buckingham Research: You had a pretty significant move in the Euro sequentially and again you had a pretty good gain in this quarter because of that movement in the earnings.
Charles E. Bunch : From memory our currency impact last quarter was close to a dime negative. This quarter it was close to $0.04.
Operator: Your next question comes from Saul Ludwig – KeyBanc. 
Saul Ludwig – KeyBanc: A couple questions. With regard to the hedging on natural gas, where do you now sit for the fourth quarter and maybe the first half of next year and then a second unrelated question, you talk about Asia being about 18% of the revenues, what was the change this year, third quarter versus third quarter a year ago in Asia revenues and in Asia operating income?
Charles E. Bunch : First the hedging position in the fourth quarter will be similar to what we have reported here in the third quarter, so we’re hedged close to 50% at around $8 levels, so obviously we’re not taking full advantage of the lower seasonal prices that we’re seeing in the $4 to $5 range in natural gas, but it will be something similar in the fourth quarter and actually our hedging is going to decline in 2010 to more our traditional one-third hedged and this year we’ve been affected by some slightly higher hedging volumes and also lower activity levels, so I think next year you’re going to see lower hedge percentages, but probably a similar delta if prices stay where they are.  Now prices have started to move up in natural gas here during September, but then we’ve seen over the last few days that some of that increase has come off. There’s been a lot of activity around hedging practices, some of these exchange rated funds that were investing in natural gas futures, so it’s a little bit of a jump now in terms of what the direction is going to be in natural gas. We didn’t have any hurricanes this season but we had some colder weather. Good storage levels however, and I think there are some external factors that are now affecting hedging going forward, so I would tell you that we’re still going to be hedged probably at a third level less than this, less than what you’ve seen this year or what you’ll still see in the fourth quarter.
Saul Ludwig – KeyBanc: Are you hedged for the fourth quarter already at $8?
Charles E. Bunch : We are hedged for the first quarter and the hedges I would say $8 is more of an average so that we will have hedging at these kinds of levels for the first quarter, yes.
William H. Hernandez : So in Asia… let me answer your question. Our sales are up in [inaudible] currencies 4% to 5% year-over-year. Currency has a slight headwind. Earnings, we’re seeing the same type of margin gains in Asia as we are globally relative to earnings.
Saul Ludwig – KeyBanc: Earnings are up more than 4% to 4%?
Charles E. Bunch : That’s correct.
Operator: Your next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research. 
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research: Couple of questions. Number one, if you look at the industrial automotive business which improved quite markedly, at least on year-over-year negative delta that you’ve been experiencing for the first half of the year, I understand that automotive business was a big part of it. If you exclude automotive, what did the rest of the industrial business look like and if you can give us a little more detail on what your automotive OEM business looked like in the quarter.
Charles E. Bunch : There are three global business units in what we report as industrial coatings segment. The largest is automotive OEM coatings and the other two are industrial coatings or maybe more properly general industrial coatings and packaging coatings. Both of those are global businesses with similar trends that we’ve talked about. They had negative volumes in those business units but we have been restructuring heavily, especially in the industrial coatings business unit, so we had favorable earnings trends in those businesses as well without any offsetting volume trends. The one thing that you saw in automotive is that we do have strength in Asia and in China in particular, and we had a positive sequential quarter in North America with volumes in automotive OEM, but we still have some weakness in the end use markets for our general industrial customers. These would be the coil and extrusion markets, again, partially tied to commercial construction. We’ve seen some weakness in the appliance end use market, so we were able to offset those negative trends in general industrial and report higher sequential and higher year-over-year earnings in those businesses despite weak volumes.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research: Okay, so kind of the low 30s volume declines that you saw in year-over-year basis and then industrial, in general industrial, that's still going on. So the improvement it sounds like came from better Automotive business with packaging kind of holding its own being down, you know, low to mid single digits. Would that be a correct…
Charles E. Bunch: I would say that's correct. And we have focused heavily on reducing costs in our automotive OEM and general industrial businesses. So that's where we've really been working hard and that's where we've seen some of the larger benefits from our restructuring programs.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research: Sure, sure, okay. And then the second question on margin, we saw a significant margin improvement I think setting at least a couple year's record on the Optical and Specialty films business or Specialty Materials business. On the other hand we saw a pretty sharp decline into single digits on the profitability of the Commodity business. So if you look at the Optical and Specialty, was the margin recovery there a result of restructuring or raw materials or better mix or Silicas coming back and going from perhaps losing some money to making money? And then on the Commodity side, the decline in profitability, how much of that was just pricing being down, you know, significantly more sequentially as well as year-over-year and how much of it was perhaps natural gas or other input costs, you know, changing versus what they were in the first half of the year when you were able to maintain margins and double digits?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, I'll answer the first question. The Optical and Specialty Materials business, we had, if you look at the two segments, the Optical segment, we did have negative volumes there, modest low single digit volume declines in the Optical business, although we still feel that in transitions, our Photochromic business that represents the majority of our Optical business unit, that they were still performing better than the industry as a whole. So volume trends were still negative there but only slightly. And we have worked hard there at cost reduction, especially here over the last quarter or two. You know, we had a very strong first quarter in that business with some product launches in Europe. The volume trends haven't been quite strong here over the last two quarters. So we have been focusing on cost reduction opportunities there as well. And in the Silicas business unit as you referred to, we did see some nice strengthening. And there I would say the biggest pickup was in some end use markets tied to the batteries and tire markets. And we had also restructuring actions in that business plus they are a natural gas user. So we had both raw material benefit from natural gas. We had lower costs from our restructuring and some end market strength. So if you looked at the two components even though Silicas is the smaller business within that reporting segment, Silicas actually had more improvement than we saw even in the Optical business. On the chlor-alkali side I think that was your question. What was the question again?
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research: I was wondering what the decline into single digits in operating profits, was that just a question of pricing finally catching up or was there some negative comps where there was natural gas or other input costs or transportation that cost the margin to decline into single digits.
Charles E. Bunch: Well, the pricing is the biggest driver of the declining earnings. It's actually been helped somewhat by lower natural gas and some of our cost efforts there as well. But the negative trend in that business has been price.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we only have time for two further questions. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Judd - Greenwich Consultants.
Michael Judd - Greenwich Consultants: In terms of the pattern of sales into the automotive industry I guess what I’m hearing is that obviously July was relatively weak. They had a very good August and September's been pretty good. In terms of your comments about sequentially production being sort of flattish, I mean, that must imply that you're anticipating a weaker type of December. And, you know, just sort of in terms of the seasonal understanding of that business, do you anticipate that December and January will be weak? And when would you expect to begin to see a pick up in production potentially in the first quarter?
Charles E. Bunch: Well, I would say here if we're talking about North America and today you have different dynamics in each region of the world and you have, as we've been talking about, a lot of strength in China, as an example. But here in North America we did have a strong, you know, August and September, not by historical standards but certainly by what we've seen earlier this year. And that trend is continuing in October and November as the North American car makers are rebuilding their inventories. I think that at this point December is historically a weaker month and the shutdowns can come close to Christmas or before. And last year, actually, the fourth quarter in automotive production stayed strong through November and early December and then really dropped off and they stayed down well into the first quarter and actually they didn't really start having production at a significant level until the end of July. So I would say that we have good visibility in October and November. We think they'll be rebuilding their inventories. And I think then they'll probably make decisions in December depending on the demand levels or sales levels that we see. Sales levels dropped off in September after the expiration of Cash for Clunkers. And I think the automakers are going to wait and see how the trends develop before they say when they're going to shut down production in December or when they will start back in January. So it's still, I think, a little bit of a wait and see. But obviously anything that they're making, and we think they'll be back making cars, you know, in January. That will be significantly higher than what we saw in the first two quarters of 2009 where production levels were at levels that were, you know, more like 5 million to 6 million auto builds in North America. That was the rate in the first two quarters of this year, which I don't think is a sustainable level. And so we'll certainly be bouncing nicely off those levels in 2010 in North America.
Operator: Your final question is a follow-up from the line of Kevin McCarthy.
Kevin McCarthy – Banc of America – Merrill Lynch: Quick follow-up on pension, do you have a preliminary 2010 outlook for pension expense and potential cash contributions next year?
William H. Hernandez: Well, the cash contributions - this is Bill - is going to be roughly what is was in 2009. We don't anticipate much of a change there on a worldwide basis. Some of our pension contributions performance will be dictated really at the end of the year as the final data is reset. The one thing we have done this year as you're aware of is put some shares in relative to cash. And we may do that as well next year rather than putting in cash.
Charles E. Bunch: And, Kevin, we had $200 million of cash, $100 million of shares just as a clarification.
Kevin McCarthy – Banc of America – Merrill Lynch: What was the rationale for the share component of that contribution?
Charles E. Bunch: Several reasons, one that by putting in the shares we have extremely high dividend yield. And when we put it into shares we're at a pretty good value. And basically what we did for the first contribution was offset it with an equity forward so that basically the interest rate we were paying on the equity forward was less than what the dividend yield was, was actually cash positive going in and we got the full deduction for the pension. Now, we did it a little bit here again in the third quarter and that's why you see a little bit higher share comp action in the third quarter because we're actually exercising and putting that equity forward in here beginning in October.
Kevin McCarthy – Banc of America – Merrill Lynch: A second piece on the income statement side, you know, if we assume relatively stable capital markets over the next couple of months, do you have an idea of what the expense might be for 2010?
Charles E. Bunch: I don't think we're ready to get into that detail. We still have to go through our actuarial efforts and, you know, that's something we can offer more information on as we get closer to the year-end.
Operator: And we're reached the limit for Q&A today. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Bunch for any closing remarks.
Charles E. Bunch: I want to thank all of you for your attention. We appreciate the dialogue and the Q&A and all of your support and we're very pleased with our results. And we look forward to talking to you in the coming weeks. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Now let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Charles Bunch.
Charles Bunch: Thank you Vince and welcome everyone. I will provide a brief overview of PPG’s performance in the second quarter. William Hernandez will then review some of the financial details and then I will add some closing remarks before we field questions.  In the second quarter we experienced a traditional seasonal sales increase versus the first quarter. Our total sales this quarter remained fairly consistent month to month with some slight strengthening in June and were also steady within each major region.  This gives us a degree of confidence that most markets have stabilized albeit at considerably lower level than prior years. However we continue to experience very challenging conditions in several markets such as the US automotive OEM sector and certain general industrial OEM markets.  In these industries there was little improvement from the extremely difficult environment we saw in the first quarter. In other markets such as those for European and US architectural coatings we did see some improvement versus the late fourth quarter 2008 and first quarter levels even though demand was still down in comparison with the prior year’s second quarter.  As for earnings our results are still down considerably versus last year but were pleased our profitability improved substantially versus the previous two quarters despite weaker results in our commodity chemicals business.  Clearly the improved bottom line results in our coatings businesses reflect the very aggressive cost cutting measures we’ve taken combined with increased savings from restructuring actions. This is particularly evident in our industrial coatings segment where global demand levels have remained depressed.  Yet we delivered substantial segment earnings improvements of $68 million and $44 million versus the fourth and first quarters respectively on a relatively similar sales base. A major factor in the quarter that negatively impacted sales and earnings was currency conversion.  In the second quarter of 2008 the euro peaked versus the US dollar. As a result year over year currency translation in this year’s second quarter was a significant headwind. In architectural coatings EMEA and performance coatings specifically the negative impact from currency translation nearly equaled the year over year earnings decline.  So in local currency these segments had nearly flat year over year earnings performance, a very noteworthy achievement given the volume headwinds related to the weakened economy. Lastly we remained focused on cash.  We generated nearly $400 million in cash from operations this quarter, up 25% versus last year driven by improvements in our businesses working capital levels. As a result we once again ended the quarter with a very solid cash position with over $1 billion of cash on hand.  While our cash position is high compared to historic PPG standards, we have been and intend to remain very prudent in our uses of cash. Now here is William to review some of the financial details. 
William Hernandez : Thanks Charles, I will start by reviewing our sales results which are detailed on slide five, overall sales for the company were down nearly $1.4 billion versus the second quarter of last year which includes the reduction of just over $250 million stemming from our third quarter 2008 divestiture of a majority interest in the automotive glass and services business.  Demand remained weak resulting in a decline of about $825 million in sales volumes. Volumes declined year over year in each region with Asia down the least dropping 7% driven by weak Asian exports offset by strong consumption within China.  Our United States and Canadian volumes fell by over slightly more than 20% driven by weak automotive and industrial activity levels. Our European volume was down 18% with drops well in excess of 30% in many industrial markets combined with mid single-digit declines in our architectural coatings.  I will remind you that the Easter holiday shifted into the second quarter this year but was in the first quarter in 2008. Also as Charles mentioned negative currency translation was sizable resulting in a headwind of over $300 million.  Turning to the next slide, you will see that one key benchmark of the currency headwinds is the euro which peaked against the dollar in the second quarter of 2008 with the exchange rate 13% lower this year. This translation impact also hits earnings.  Our year over year earnings fell by about $22 million versus last year due to currency translation or about $0.09 per share. I will also point out that we were facing a similar but smaller headwind in the third quarter based on current exchange rates.  Also on this slide is our seasonal sales index trend for the past several years between our first and second quarters. The second quarter is typically our best quarter seasonally and as illustrated we experienced fairly comparable sequential sales growth this year compared with last.  However as Charles mentioned this is from a much lower absolute sales level. We typically experience a single-digit percentage volume drop due to seasonality between the second and third quarters and we are expecting that trend to continue.  The next slide details our sales by segment and I will review each segment in detail later. In summary total sales were down about 25% excluding the impact of our automotive glass divestiture late last year.  Sales in all of our segments were down with more pronounced declines in excess of 35% in industrial coatings, commodity chemicals, and glass. Similar to the first quarter our industrial coatings segment drop was driven by continued end use market weakness for light vehicles and for general industrial products.  As I will discuss shortly many of these markets remained at similar depressed activity levels in comparison with the first quarter. Also lower industrial production dampened our commodity chemicals and glass results and a slumping US commercial construction market also contributed to the glass decline.  As I mentioned previously currency conversion was a large factor in the overall company results and specifically in the architectural coatings EMEA segment where currency was easily the largest single factor in the reduction of sales accounting for just over $100 million of the $140 million difference. Both the performance coatings and optical and specialty material segments experienced mid teen percentage declines. In specialty materials our silicas business experienced volume drops of about 35% in comparison with last year which was even worse than the first quarter reflecting weakness of the automotive and general industrial markets that it serves.  Volumes in our performance coating segment which has a notable after market component faired somewhat better and this segment was also negatively impacted by currency. Our segment earnings are detailed on the next slide.  These results reflect a significant impact of the global economic downturn has had on our sales volumes. In aggregate our second quarter segment earnings fell by about 35% versus last year and while this is a fairly steep drop, its important to note that our first quarter segment results were down about 50%.  This improvement was primarily in our coating segments and reflects the progress we made in implementing our cost and restructuring actions. I will review all our segments in further detail later but the largest earnings decline was in industrial coatings, again reflecting the severe deterioration in industrial production including automotive OEM.  The segment was down over $80 million in the quarter and represented over 40% of the corporation’s total decline. Equally important to mentioned however is the segment was solidly profitable this quarter after incurring losses in the previous two quarters.  Earnings in both performance coatings and architectural coatings EMEA would have been flat but for the negative impacts of currency translation. The next slide presents our adjusted earnings per share, a reconciliation of these amounts to our reported earnings per share is included in the Appendix of today’s presentation materials which is available at the Investor Center on our website at www.ppg.com.  In the quarter our adjusted earnings per share was $0.91. This is down from $1.66 in 2008 and which results from the impact of volume from a continued sluggish global economy partly offset by our cost actions. One takeaway from our results this quarter is illustrated on our trend chart on the right side of the slide.  As you can see our second quarter performance while down over 40% year over year easily outpaced similar comparisons for both the fourth quarter of 2008 and first quarter this year. To add further perspective the sequential earnings improvement is despite a nearly equal year over year sales decline this quarter versus last.  As Charles noted, our aggressive cost management in addition to the savings we are yielding from our restructuring actions are important factors in our improving the relative earnings performance. Our restructuring savings are detailed on the next slide.  Depicted on the slide is the anticipated annual run rate of our cumulative savings from the restructuring actions. As detailed we expect to achieve about a $250 million annual savings run rate by the end of 2010 when our restructuring programs will be fully implemented. This annual savings level at completion equals nearly $1.00 in earnings per share accretion.  The restructuring actions are generally structural in nature as we are permanently modifying the way we conduct business. To date we have achieved about 20% of the targeted savings which puts us slightly ahead of our original schedule. But obviously we still have a sizable portion of savings that will be accretive in future quarters.  Moving to our business segment review on the next slide, the impact of our cost management and restructuring actions are most apparent in our industrial coatings segment. This segment has business units serving the global automotive OEM, general industrial and packaging end use markets. As detailed on this slide while we are still at a very low earnings level we have dramatically improved this segment earnings performance the past few quarters despite consistently low sales levels.  Our sales are still below our fourth quarter sales level, but our quarterly earnings have improved by a dramatic $68 million in comparison. Also reviewing results on a monthly basis, we have been solidly profitable for the past four consecutive months and are now approaching monthly profit levels we last achieved early in the fourth quarter of 2008 despite sales this quarter being 30% lower.  Some additional details on our industrial coatings segment are included in the next slide. Sales in the quarter totaled about $740 million, down 36% versus last year. Lower volumes accounted for the lion share of the decline but currency was also a sizable headwind. As displayed on the segment volume chart second quarter volume declines nearly matched the steep first quarter drops.  Global industrial demand remained very weak although Asia primarily China, easily outperformed the other major regions. The global industrial weakness was most intense in the United States automotive OEM market where year over year production dropped a remarkable 50% for the second consecutive quarter.  This is also where we have instituted the most significant cost actions. In our September 2008 restructuring announced before the severe end use market collapse, was focused on this segment and is now delivering positive earnings results.  Also as illustrated on the bottom graph North American vehicle production is actually running well below the depressed level of US auto sales. We expect production to move closer to sales levels in future quarters as had been the case early last year. That being said, the end use markets in this segment are still likely to remain some of our most challenging and we will continue to execute on our announced cost reduction actions to incrementally improve profitability and position this business to benefit when market demand recovers.  Performance coating segment results are detailed on the next slide, sales were down about $200 million or 16% from last year’s sales level but reflect normal seasonal gains versus the first quarter. Earnings declined slightly, slipping $13 million which is equal to the negative impact of currency translation.  As Charles mentioned we are pleased with this segment’s ability to achieve earnings parity in local currencies in light of today’s economic climate. Segment volumes fell low double-digit percentages which is much less than most of our other segments and in part reflects the important after market component of the businesses in this segment.  Operating margins improved as aggressive cost management helped to offset the volume declines. Looking individually at each of our business units, our architectural coatings Americas and Asia business had volume declines of low double-digit percentages. This was a solid improvement over the past several quarters led by our US results where volumes improved versus the previous two quarters but were down high single-digit percentages.  Our stores and dealer channels were down more while our national accounts or do-it-yourself channel delivered growth in the low double-digit percentage range. Asia volumes were down mid single-digits while Latin American volumes were down 30%.  Our automotive refinish business continue to experience lower sales volumes falling double-digit percentages as a result of the continued distributor destocking and less collision repairs which are due in part to fewer miles driven versus last year.  Our volume results this quarter were only moderately different than the first quarter. Both protective and marine coatings and aerospace sales were down mildly excluding currency impacts. These businesses support end use markets which have a sizable after market and both still have considerable OEM backlogs.  Also the protective coatings market supports global infrastructure projects and while aerospace is doing fine overall, the business jet market is experiencing extreme volume declines. Results for our architectural coatings Europe, Middle East and Africa or EMEA business, are on the next slide. Sales were about $525 million, down $140 million versus last year with over $100 million of the decline related to currency conversion. Sales were down only about 5% in local currencies. Earnings declined $16 million due largely to the impact of currency. From a seasonal perspective the second quarter is traditionally our highest sales quarter and we did experience a typical seasonal bounce versus the first quarter.  Also our year over year volume results improved nicely in comparison to the first quarter. Volumes in the entire segment declined mid single-digit percents and were partially offset by price gains. Volumes in the first quarter were down double-digit percents. As is customary volume results differ greatly throughout the various regions with all major regions down year over year but some less so than others.  As with the first quarter exclusive of currency there was minimal earnings erosion compared to last year due in large part to very strong cost management. Also illustrated on this slide are the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITA. And our EBITDA margins were flat.  We believe EBITDA is a relevant measure for this business given the ongoing non-cash amortization stemming from the acquisition. We estimate between 75% and 80% of architectural coatings in many of our major regions are related to recurring maintenance applications which are less sensitive to economic swings and allow this segment to deliver more stable financial results.  Looking ahead, we expect currency to remain a headwind in the third quarter but to a lesser degree. Also we anticipate a similar stable business profile in the coming quarters. And anticipate normal seasonal sales patterns.  Our optical and specialty material segment results are detailed on the next slide. Sales were $255 million, down $55 million from last year. Earnings were about $60 million, about 20% lower year over year. Segment operating margins remained [inaudible] year over year. Year over year declines in this segment financial results were very similar to the first quarter.  I will remind you that our year over year comparables are very difficult as the optical products business experienced record sales and earnings in the first half of 2008 due largely to our generation six transitions product introduction and pipeline fill in North America. Looking individually at the businesses in the quarter, silicas which is a raw material used in the production of tires and car batteries, experienced even steeper volume declines than in the first quarter, with volumes falling nearly 35% based on collapsing demand in both the automotive OEM and auto after markets.  Our optical product sales were impacted by both negative currency and the lower volume impacts I mentioned earlier along with continuing difficult economic conditions in our major regional markets. Glancing ahead, we expect the year over year volume declines in silicas to lessen somewhat due to improved automotive production and easier comparables from the second half of 2008.  Also we anticipate year over year sales declines in the second half of 2009 in our optical products business to moderate based on a less significant effect in the second half of 2008 from our next generation transitions lens product introduction. On the next slide are our commodity chemicals segment results.  Sales declined about $175 million versus last year driven by both lower volumes and pricing. Earnings fell by $26 million due to lower volumes and the related impact of lower capacity utilization on our manufacturing costs. Our operating rate this past quarter was in the low 80% range, down from the low to mid 90% range last year.  This lower utilization is a reflection of lower market demand driven primarily by similar declines in the rate of US industrial production which is the economic statistic that serves as a good measure for caustic soda market demand.  Segment operating margins remain fairly consistent with the prior year as lower pricing was offset by lower input costs including natural gas. Our natural gas cost in the quarter was about $6.00 per million BTU. This included the impact from our natural gas hedge position as we had half of our normal purchases hedged at about $8.00 per unit in the quarter pricing decline versus the prior year as a result of weaker demand.  As we look ahead caustic soda pricing fell by double-digit percentages in each month during the quarter. So our second quarter results did not fully reflect an entire quarter’s impact from the lower pricing. Separately we announced three pouring price increases totaling $300.00 per ton which will be implemented in the second half of the year. Also the business would benefit in both sales volume and capacity utilization from an increase in US industrial production. Our glass segment details are on the following slide. As was the case last quarter we included 2008 results both with and without the automotive glass and service business we divested late in 2008.  My comparison comments will be against the 2008 results excluding auto glass. Sales this quarter were $207 million, down about $120 million or 37% from last year. Fiberglass sales were down nearly 50% due to severely lower global industrial demand. Performance glazings sales dropped by over 30% due to continued weakness in US residential construction and a deteriorating US commercial construction market. Earnings dropped $27 million year-over-year to a loss of $7 million driven by the lower volumes and related lower manufacturing utilization. We continue to execute on our restructuring and cost reduction actions, and achieved total year over year cost reductions approaching $10 million. Our second quarter earnings results were $20 million better than our first quarter results despite only a slight seasonal sales increase. Although we are seeing a slight improvement in demand, market conditions remain very difficult. We will continue to aggressively pursue cost savings in these businesses. Let me conclude my remarks by reviewing cash which is detailed on the next slide. We ended the quarter with over $1.0 billion of cash on hand. In the quarter we generated just under $400 million from cash from operations, which was up about 25% from last year’s second quarter driven by strong working capital results. Our ending cash balance includes about $235 million of cash from a $400 million multi-year term loan we obtained in late June at favorable interest rates. We immediately used about $165 million of the loan proceeds to repay existing debt, and intend to use the remainder in the third quarter for similar purposes. Excluding the excess cash from the term loan, our cash balance is still up about a $0.50 billion dollars from the prior years’ second quarter levels. As with the past several quarters, we maintained about $240 million of commercial paper outstanding. Based on our anticipated strong second half cash generation, we will likely pay down a good portion of this commercial paper. We remain on or favorable to our full year targets in our uses of cash and let me discuss a few of them. We originally targeted $200 million in full year capital spending, excluding acquisitions, and we have spent $100 million through the first half of the year. Relative to acquisitions, we will likely remain cautious in that area. Regarding other cash uses, we have about $115 million of term debt maturing in the third quarter with no other maturities of size this year. And last, we have already made pension contributions of nearly $200 million for the year, most of which are voluntary and have actually decreased our full year funding projection from $350 million to $250 million. I will remind you that the pension contribution figures are pre-tax, and we do receive a tax benefit. We are pleased with our cash performance and growth year-over-year, particularly in light of today’s economy. Given today’s economic times, we intend to continue our focus on managing our cash and will likely maintain a larger than normal cash balance for the financial flexibility it provides in the current environment. With that I now will turn it back over to Charles for some closing comments.
Charles Bunch : Thanks William. Let me summarize the quarter by recapping a few key items. In most markets, demand levels remain depressed in comparison with the past several years and improved only mildly from the first quarter. However demand was stable during the second quarter and our businesses’ earnings performance improved. Our coatings and optical and specialty materials segments, which combined accounted for 90% of the company’s segment earnings during the quarter, delivered improved earnings performance versus the first quarter in absolute dollars and in year over year percentage change. Conversely our commodity chemicals business, while still performing solidly, experienced declines from what were truly excellent results the past several years. In total, I was pleased with the partial recovery in earnings back towards last year’s level in light of the continuing difficulties in the economy.  And as I mentioned at the outset, this was a result of our strong execution, and aggressive cost-cutting and restructuring actions we are taking across all of our businesses. We believe that because of these actions, we are well positioned and will have excellent operating leverage which will enable us to fully capitalize as economic conditions and demand improve. In the third quarter, excluding the impacts of a normal seasonal drop, we expect overall market conditions to improve but only mildly. And, as William mentioned, the direction and magnitude of change will differ among the various pieces of our portfolio.  For example, we expect sequential improvement in US automotive OEM, but anticipate the opposite for commodity chemicals. I will assure you that we will continue to execute on our cost-reduction actions and the relating benefit will grow again next quarter. Also, because it deserves mentioning again, we intend to remain very prudent in how we manage our cash position. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready for your questions. 
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Sergey Vasnetsov - Barclays Capital
Sergey Vasnetsov - Barclays Capital: Could you comment on such a big difference between the European and US decorative coatings results, we know that your business [inaudible] housing bubble but nonetheless I think the difference is huge. 
Charles Bunch : I would say that performance in our architectural coatings business in Europe was very good. Obviously the demand is weaker but I think we offset that with some aggressive cost actions and so the performance was very solid. Here in North America the volume is actually even weaker than in Europe but I think there too our team did a very good job in reducing their costs and their performance although weaker in volume, was solid. 
Sergey Vasnetsov - Barclays Capital: And could you comment what you see Asia broadly and China specifically when it comes to industrial and [inaudible] coatings. 
Charles Bunch : Our performance in Asia Pacific in coatings in the second quarter was very good. Volume was down. Sales were down but it was a record pre-tax, pre-interest earnings performance in the second quarter despite that. It was led by our businesses in China. They offset what I would consider weaker results in countries like Korea or Australia.  And I would say that the businesses in China especially the automotive OEM business, they benefited from some of the Chinese stimulus plans. Our protective and marine coatings business, our packaging coatings businesses, these businesses in China all had very solid quarters and we’re very pleased with the results there.  Industrial coatings, because some of the industrial end use markets are more tied to the Chinese export markets weren’t quite as strong but we had many of the domestic Chinese businesses were among our strongest. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank 
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank : Can you comment on the trends you’re seeing in raw material costs as well as selling price increases in your coatings businesses. 
Charles Bunch : Let’s talk about raw material costs, I would say that after some weakness at the end of last year in raw material input costs for us, pricing environment has stabilized. If you remember during the first quarter oil prices got down to below $40.00 a barrel then they started moving up late in the first quarter and through the second quarter. We therefore had a lot of suppliers who were attempting to get prices up in the second quarter.  And so far what I would say is that its bit of a standoff in terms of raw material input. The biggest benefit we’re still experiencing is the natural gas prices which have remained weak and that is helping us. That is the unhedged portion so that’s been the biggest positive story. The other raw material prices are now let’s call it stable.  Similar for pricing, we have I think a more stable pricing environment if oil prices and raw materials remain stable so at this point I would say our pricing actions are modest at this point either positive or negative. 
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank : Is your pricing ahead of or equal to your raw material cost. 
Charles Bunch : Well I think what you saw last year we as we’ve talked, we usually have a little bit of a lag both in absorbing the cost and being able to move those through to our customers so we were probably a little bit behind the curve at this time last year then we were able to get some modest price increases in some markets and so I would say now, the situation for the last several quarters has been stable.  Prices for our raw materials not going up although our suppliers are attempting to discuss those with us and by and large our pricing actions are neutral with our customers. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Mccarthy - BAS-ML  
Kevin Mccarthy - BAS-ML : I heard you say that you expect to remain pretty cautious as it relates to acquisitions and of course watch cash carefully, understandable given the last nine months, but on a forward looking basis I guess you could also argue it’s a buyers market right now. You’ve got a year and a half of Sigma-Kalon behind you and end use markets in architectural and industrial are pretty fragmented. So I guess my question is what sort of conditions would you be looking for to accept a little bit more risk in terms of adding to the portfolio here in the coatings side. 
Charles Bunch : What I would say is that the market for coatings acquisition opportunities is a little slow right now. We have not seen very many companies or properties being offered. We have been fairly inactive but I think in many cases you’re seeing companies that are focusing on execution on improving their returns and so we have not seen a lot of opportunities and certainly last year and earlier this year the discussions that we did have, there was still an expectation on the part of the sellers that the valuations should be similar to what the market was in 2007 or early 2008 when the earnings were stronger.  So I think there’s still a little bit of a dislocation there so we’re going to obviously look at opportunities. We haven’t seen anything yet that we would regard as a real bargain opportunity. We also have as you know a stock price at PPG that we think has room to move on the upside so that would be an alternative if we continue to see this level of excess cash and our operating performance and cash flow continue strongly, I think we would also look to modestly have share buybacks as part of our program. 
Kevin Mccarthy - BAS-ML : Follow-up if I may on slide six, you show a seasonal sales growth index comparing 2Q to 1Q, I was wondering if you could comment on the outlook in coatings for 3Q versus 2Q and what sort of sequential pattern you might foresee there. 
Charles Bunch : I would say that we’re looking for a still a decline versus the third quarter of 2008 but if you’re looking from a let’s call it a seasonal standpoint I think that its going to be in coatings a little favorable in the third quarter to what would traditionally be a second quarter to third quarter fall off anyway so I think the volume declines that we would normally see from second to third quarter historically will be a little less and one of the reasons there is we think there’ll be a little more strength in the automotive OEM and industrial markets.  I think a lot of the destocking has already taken place. We see here in North America that General Motors and Chrysler who have you know, were virtually out of the car production business in the second quarter, we do look for them to start production here later this month and through the rest of the quarter. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs 
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs : In terms of the savings benefit you’re talking about in $250 million on the run rate basis, how much of this target of savings benefit is sensitive to the underlying economic conditions. In other words if we see some improvement in this economic environment will you still be able to produce that $1.00 per share savings benefit. Or probably you have to give back some. 
Charles Bunch : At this point our view would be that these reductions that we’ve made, these structural cost reductions are somewhat transparent to our customers. We intend to be able to by reorganizing our supply chain we would not anticipate these types of cost savings would be shared with our customers as you know in the businesses that have been most impacted by this downturn such as our automotive coatings or our glass businesses, these are businesses that are still struggling and as William indicated we’re still losing money in our glass segment. So at this point we need these cost reductions to return to solid levels of profitability for PPG. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts – Buckingham Research 
John Roberts – Buckingham Research : With GM and Chrysler now out of bankruptcy are they more interesting customers to you now that they’re balance sheets are in better shape and they’ve shed some of the legacy liabilities. 
Charles Bunch :  I would think as stand alone companies these are healthier. They have better balance sheets. We feel that they represent, they’ve always been good customers although the outlook in the longer-term was always somewhat cloudy. Now I think there’s a little more certainty and so they’re certainly attractive customers for us.  We intend to continue the position that we have had before their bankruptcy in terms of supply so we think we will be able to start back up with them as they ramp up production and we think they represent good opportunities for us to grow with them and in the case of General Motors, their businesses outside of North America that weren’t as touched by these bankruptcy challenges, we see them continuing to do well in markets like China, like Korea, like Latin America.  So we think they present a very solid opportunity to grow. 
John Roberts – Buckingham Research : Are you concerned at all that Europe’s auto production may be propped up here by their cash for clunkers program and that there’ll be an uncharacteristic drop later this year when that comes off. 
Charles Bunch : I think there is obviously a risk that this has pulled forward some of the demand and that will probably mean that the continued improvement that you’d like to see at the bottom of a recession won’t be as strong in 2010 in Europe. So I think that is a valid point. We won’t get the kind of growth that maybe we would have had if we’d gone down to the depths this year. But I think especially in the case of Europe where it takes you a little longer to implement restructuring actions, to close plants, I think its given all of us the car manufacturers and the automotive suppliers, the dealers and the like a little more time to adjust to these economic conditions. But I think we’ll see some of that same phenomena here in North America. The scrappage program will I think bring forward some sales and I think that we’re already hearing that its bringing interest into the dealers lots.  There’s more inquiries and we hope that in the case here, that it will restart the industry and that even though it may steal a few sales from next year, I think the sales have been so depressed at this point that eventually you will get stronger pent up demand as we go forward. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of PJ Juvekar – Citi
PJ Juvekar – Citi: You talked about this automotive OEM ramp up in the US is that a third quarter event or more like a fourth quarter event and if we think production is running at seven million units or so where do you think that could go. 
Charles Bunch : I think its, you’re going to see improvement here in the third quarter. If you remember last year in North America production levels started being taken down dramatically in the third quarter. We are going to see a restart especially at Chrysler and General Motors in this quarter. So we think you’ll see some impact here in the third quarter and it will continue on into the fourth quarter.  Because we have really been producing in North America at lower than these depressed sales levels, so right now inventories are healthier from that standpoint that they have been in a number of years. So I think we’ll see some improvement here in the third quarter and that should continue on into the fourth quarter. 
PJ Juvekar – Citi: And then quickly on chlor-alkali, spot caustic prices have come down so contract prices are likely to come down, but you talked about chlorine price increases, natural gas is down, if you look at all those moving parts do you think you can hold your margins in that 13% to 14% range in the second half. 
Charles Bunch : I think in the third quarter we’ll have I think a challenge to hold the margins that we saw in the fourth quarter. The prices were coming down through the quarter so we ended up in, at the end of the quarter certainly not at the same pricing level or profitability. Yes we are helped by what’s happening in natural gas or ethylene, but I think it will be a challenge for us to maintain this level of profitability in the third and fourth quarters. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Silke Kueck – JPMorgan
Silke Kueck – JPMorgan:  I have two questions, one is a question of clarification on the US architectural business, did I hear correctly that you said that the US architectural stores business was down double-digit but that the do-it-yourself business was up double-digit.  
Charles Bunch : Yes, that was correct. The stores business in the second quarter was off, low double-digits from the previous year and our national accounts business and dealer business were slightly positive. 
Silke Kueck – JPMorgan: What’s slightly positive. 
Charles Bunch : They were in mid single-digits volume gain. 
Silke Kueck – JPMorgan: And I have a question on the cost savings, the annualized run rate of $50 million in cost savings can you tell which areas of your income statement benefit, I saw that SG&A costs were down more than $200 million in the quarter on a year over year basis and also your gross margin improved nicely by a couple of hundred basis points so can you tell where these cost savings are more noticeable. 
Charles Bunch : I would say they are split between let’s call it supply chain improvements or manufacturing. We closed a number of factories there at the end of 2008 and here recently in the second quarter so some of that will flow directly to the margins as part of our variable cost reduction but we also took out significant overhead costs so that is why you’re seeing some improvement in the RS & GA so I would say its probably a mix between the two. And that trend will continue. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson – UBS
Don Carson – UBS: Just a couple of housekeeping items first I don’t know if you went over this but the corporate expense was down sequentially and just wondering what drove that and what you think a sustainable corporate expense level is and then just also wondering about the year over year depreciation decline, what’s driving that. 
William Hernandez : Let’s talk depreciation first, a lot of the things we’ve closed down have eliminated depreciation since we no longer have them. We’ve also gotten rid of our automotive glass business so that’s closed down quite a bit of our depreciation as well.  In terms of the corporate expense, part of that is equity earnings. 
Vincent Morales: The biggest change in corporate expense this quarter really was a currency conversion, the rate shifted sequentially. We had a currency conversion gain this quarter. If you recall back to the first quarter we had actually had a currency conversion loss versus again the fourth quarter rates.  So if you look on a run rate basis, corporate was running about, its running on constant items of about $30 million exclusive of the stock options and the currency gain was $8 million this quarter. The currency loss last quarter was an equivalent $8 million. 
Don Carson – UBS: And then on the chlor-alkali, you’re talking rates in the low 80’s which is quite a bit above the industry rate which has been around the 72% range, I’m just wondering what’s driving your higher rates and can you just talk a bit about sort of the average ECU for the quarter and where you ended the quarter. 
Charles Bunch : I would say on our capacity utilization we were a little stronger outside of our US plants. We have four plants, two in the US, two outside the US. Our operating rates were stronger and historically are outside the US so those are running above kind of US industry averages. I would say our two US plants have been running maybe slightly ahead of industry operating rates but as we looked at the last half of the second quarter those operating levels came down a little bit.  And in terms of the ECU we don’t give out prices on specific prices on ECU levels. We’ve said that they were coming down through the second quarter and we finished the second quarter arguably 25% below where we had been in the first quarter and the trends right now in the third quarter are mixed. Obviously caustic prices are still weak. There is spot prices that have been leading the contract prices down, but there are a number of actions in pricing on chlorine including some that we have announced that we hope will stabilize the ECU pricing environment in the second half. 
Operator: Your next question is a follow-up from the line of David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank 
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank : I know that question has been addressed or asked somewhat but on your cost actions how much of these costs are variable in nature that may come back as volumes ramp up whether its in R&D or SG&A. 
Charles Bunch : I would say that our intent is to make sure that the cost, especially the cost of where we’ve taken these restructuring actions, that we are making let’s say a long-term adjustment in our cost and ability to deliver services so that at this point we have talked maybe in one case in our glass furnaces where we’ve said we’ve actually idled the furnace with the opportunity to bring it back at a later date.  But if you look at most of the rest of our cost actions in manufacturing typically we’re closing plants such as the one we closed in the second quarter in automotive coatings in Canada. Our intent would not be to bring that production back at that location and consolidate it in our other facilities. And likewise with our overhead costs we’re looking at opportunities or ways to do things more efficiently, more productively so I would say that we are not looking to add these costs back at a later date. We are looking for new ways to do business under the kinds of collapses in demand that we’ve seen, we understand now that we have really had to challenge ourselves on the way we do business and so we intend for these changes to be longer-term. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research 
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research : I have a follow-up question on raw material costs, can you quantify the delta on raw material costs year over year. 
Vincent Morales: If you remember last year oil ran up in the second quarter, in early third quarter and we typically lag oil inflation so we didn’t really see a sizable inflationary impact in coatings raw materials until the second half of the year. So our year over year deflation from raw materials is fairly benign in the second quarter. 
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research : Then on domestic architectural market, particularly on your store paint sales, sales are down double-digits and your competitor announced price declines in the channel. Just wondering what is your stand on pricing in that channel. 
Charles Bunch : Are you referring to the Sherwin Williams announcement on retail prices in their stores business. 
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research : That’s correct.
Charles Bunch : Our stores channel is more focused on the professional painter. We have at this point not tried to compete aggressively in what I would call retail or DIY paint from our stores channel and we would view Sherwin Williams as competing with our customers and I can’t comment on whether those pricing actions on their part are designed to get them competitive at those levels.  So our pricing to the professional segment through our stores has been stable this year. We have taken a number of actions to reduce costs. We have lowered our store count in the face of this weaker economic and construction environment and we actually feel that we are stabilizing in that business and our performance is improving despite the fact that volume is still showing a decline in the second quarter. 
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research : On chlorine, price increases, given weak demand do you think those price increases will stick and do you expect them in the third quarter or fourth quarter. 
Charles Bunch : We certainly hope that these price increases will stick. We would see some of that benefit starting in the third quarter although if there were all implemented the full benefits would be seen in the fourth quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets 
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets : Sorry if I missed it but did you quantify on an EPS basis what the foreign exchange negative impact was and if not, is it around 10%. 
Vincent Morales: Nine to $0.10. 
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets : And if currencies stay where they are right you’d anticipate that that might be a little bit less in the third quarter, is that fair. 
William Hernandez : It would probably be about half of that I think in the third quarter. 
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets : And then I caught the part where your nat gas unfortunately was hedged at $8.00 per MM BTU in the second quarter where does that stand for the third and fourth quarters right now. 
Charles Bunch : It will be very similar. We’ve been hedging actually three years out for a third and then we have a little more of that hedged now especially with the volume declines so the hedge position will be similar in the third and fourth quarters. 
Operator: Your next question is a follow-up from the line of PJ Juvekar – Citi
PJ Juvekar – Citi: I just had a quick follow-up question, first on the raw material benefit, your raw materials typically tend to lag the commodity market by one to two quarters, so we saw a big benefit in 2Q, do you expect that benefit to narrow as we go ahead because oil prices have gone up. 
Charles Bunch : I would say the raw material prices are fairly stable right now. As you know the prices have gone up and the suppliers would like to pass some increases on but at this point I think given the weak economic environment we think that raw material prices appear stable here in the near-term. 
PJ Juvekar – Citi: And on the European architectural business, your volumes held up but margins are still below the US margins, can you comment about the cost structure there and what have you done in the last 18 months in terms of improving that cost structure. 
Charles Bunch : What I would say is actually again, we’re very pleased with the performance of the architectural business in Europe and the margins were very solid. As you can see they were double-digit margins in the second quarter. That’s obviously the strongest point of the season. But if you look at the comparison to our US or North American architectural business or other architectural businesses that we have around the world, this is actually a better performance. If you look at our business here in North America it is in the performance coatings segment, the performance coatings segment has higher margins than what you see in the architectural Europe segment but we also have some very strong businesses in that segment as well so I would say like for like the European performance is very good in architectural. 
Operator: Your next question is a follow-up from the line of Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs 
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs : For your North America architectural paint business the volumes at the store channel has been up and underperforming the national [inaudible] distribution channel dramatically and heading to the second half of the year, would you expect that the volume trends at your stores just to stabilize the weak level or we should expect some sequential improvement or even some sequential deterioration. 
Charles Bunch : I think that the volume, if you look at the stores, our stores business, its more exposed to the commercial segment. Its more exposed to new home construction, both of which have been weaker than what we would consider the DIY channel where I think you’re seeing a little better performance on the part of the consumer.  Repainting is a low end or a low cost way to make home improvements and so I would say that at this point we don’t look for any further declines in volume for our store channel but some of the trends where we haven’t seen significant improvement in new home construction and commercial is sluggish out there.  I’m saying that volume shouldn’t improve significantly and the improvements that we have seen in that channel have been from or own cost reduction initiatives. 
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs : In Europe and obviously your architectural paint volume is much better than a lot of people would have expected and just wondering is there any particular regions that represent a big benefit for PPG or you take market share from some of your major competitors in some product lines or areas. 
Charles Bunch : I would say that as we’ve been talking about the former Sigma-Kalon architectural business is very well positioned. They had a lot of momentum over the last couple of years in the marketplace. They control a lot of their own distribution so that gives us, I think we’re not as subject to the vagaries of the retailers in some cases in Europe.  We have a little more control. I think we’ve done a good job in positioning the business. Share has been stable to slightly positive and although we’ve been exposed in the UK to a weak construction market, we have missed some of the weakest markets in Europe like Spain, or Italy and I think with our focus on the repaint market, the smaller painters, in Northern Europe, in France, that has given us a more stable business profile. 
Operator: There are no additional questions at this time; I would like to turn it back over to management for any additional or closing comments. 
Charles Bunch : Thank you very much for joining us and we look forward to continuing our dialogue with you in October for our third quarter results. Thank you.

Operator: Welcome to the fourth quarter 2008 PPG Industries earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today’s call, Mr. Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations. 
Vince Morales:  Good morning, this is Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations for PPG Industries. Welcome to PPG's fourth quarter and full year 2008 financial commentary. Joining me on the call for PPG is Chuck Bunch, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Bill Hernandez, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer and Dave Dave Navikas, Vice President and Comptroller.  Our comments relate to the financial information released on Friday, January 16, 2009. Visuals supporting this briefing may be accessed through the Investor Center on the PPG website at www.ppg.com.  As shown on slide number two, our prepared remarks and possible comments in the question-and-answer session, may reflect forward-looking statements reflecting the company's current views about future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could affect the company's operations and financial results and as discussed in PPG's filings with the SEC may cause actual results to differ from such forward-looking statements. The company is under no obligation to provide subsequent updates on these forward-looking statements.  This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures presented on slide number five of the visuals supporting this briefing.  Now let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch. 
Charles Bunch:  Thank you Vince. Welcome everyone. In a few minutes Bill Hernandez will discuss our fourth quarter and full year financial results. Before he does that I will provide a quick recap of our businesses performance and I will also review the significant progress we made in 2008 toward continuing to transform our company.  Without question the fourth quarter was a challenge. Like many other companies, PPG experience dramatic volume declines and settle of the industrial end use markets that we serve due to the rapid deterioration in the overall global economy. Most significant were industry activity levels in automotive OEM which were down between 20-30% in each global region versus 2007 and a variety of general industrial end use markets which experienced equivalent declines.  As a result the earnings in our industrial coatings and glass reporting segments and the silica business unit which is part of our optical and specialty materials segment were significantly impacted. Both our industrial coatings and glass segments which collectively account for about 30% of our business portfolio actually reported operating losses in the quarter.  However, the remainder of our business portfolio representing about 70% of the company’s sales, delivered solid performance in the quarter despite the dramatic economic slow down. Our commodity chemicals segment grew earnings and performance coatings matched strong 2007 results. Our optical products business unit delivered once again organic volume growth and our architectural coatings EMEA segment in what is always a slower quarter due to seasonal trends performed slightly above our expectations.  Throughout the quarter we have continued to implement a variety of initiatives to reduce costs in all of our businesses in response to worsening global economic conditions. These actions were in addition to the initiatives we have underway as part of the restructuring program announced in September. Of equal importance is that we posted yet another strong quarter for cash. Bill will provide more details on our liquidity position in a few minutes but let me simply state we ended the year with $1 billion of cash on hand. This gives us tremendous financial flexibility which as all of you know is critical in today’s business climate.  Overall for the full year 2008 it was certainly a challenging and dynamic year for most companies. PPG was no exception. Early in the year we experience rapid inflation including skyrocketing raw material, energy and freight costs. PPG reacted quickly to these increased costs and collectively our businesses achieved selling price increases that offset this inflation.  Later in the year the global economic downturn resulted in significantly lower activity levels. PPG again responded quickly. During the third quarter and well ahead of most companies we identified the severity of declining volumes and announced restructuring actions focused on lowering our cost structure.  This ability to swiftly adapt our businesses aided our financial results. What also helped were the broadened end-use markets served by our business portfolio as well as our enhanced geographic footprint. This diversification provided some resilience despite the sudden economic shifts and recessionary conditions we experienced in the year.  Our nearly $16 billion in sales established a new PPG record and was up 30% over the prior year including nearly 50% growth in our combined buildings segment sales. Optical and specialty material sales also grew by double digit percentages and our commodity chemicals business had one of its best years ever.  Our adjusted earnings per share results for 2008 were down slightly falling by more than 10% with the decline solely related to fourth quarter results. We anticipate this performance will exceed that of many companies in our peer group.  Also as you would expect from PPG throughout the year we actually enhanced our financial flexibility and greater exceeded our debt repayment commitments for the year. The company ended the year with one of its largest cash positions in recent history and we have only minimal debt maturities in both 2009 and 2010. We have improved our liquidity through our focused effort to manage working capital and capital spending along with the successful execution of our strategic initiatives.  Foremost among the strategic actions we have taken in this regard is our acquisition of SigmaKalon which we completed at the beginning of 2008. This acquisition has out performed all of our expectations including the business’ solid and stable generation of cash. As a result the company’s cash from operations for the year was a record $1.4 billion, up nearly 40% from our 2007 figure.  Also in September in a difficult M&A market we divested a majority interest in our automotive glass and services business. In addition we have continued to grow in emerging regions where we expect economic activity to continue to outpace the growth in mature regions. Our sales in emerging regions are approaching $4 billion or nearly 25% of our existing portfolio.  Finally, we have continued to grow or gain share in key end use markets such as optical, aerospace and protective and marine coatings. Our strategic actions have transformed PPG significantly. We are now a more focused company with stronger geographic and end use market diversity. This has not only helped drive solid financial results in 2008 but it has better positioned the company for today’s economic challenges and created a positive step change in our ability to generate cash. I believe that these accomplishments will provide PPG shareholders with benefits for years to come. Now Bill will review the financial details and then I will conclude our prepared remarks with a few comments on 2009. 
William Hernandez: Thanks Chuck. I will spend a few minutes covering PPG’s overall financial performance both fourth quarter and full year. I will also provide some details by business segment and discuss some macro trends relative to the year 2009.  Reviewing the slide detailing our fourth quarter sales our results increased 3% to a new fourth quarter sales record with our SigmaKalon acquisition the main driver of the gain. However, as Chuck mentioned, the quarter was truly a global end mark demand story. We, along with most other industrial companies, were heavily impacted by rapidly deteriorating volumes driven by economic weakness including lower overall consumer demand combined with industrial customer inventory de-stocking.  These lower activity levels were apparent in most of our businesses which directly face industrial customers resulting in our year-over-year volumes for the quarter declining by 12% or nearly $400 million. I will discuss this in more detail when I review each segment.  Our industrial coatings and glass segments were most heavily affected as a result of lower global automotive OEM and general industrial end-market demand. Our sales pricing continued a positive trend as our selling price gains accelerated during the quarter despite the slower volumes.  Currency served as a headwind in the quarter and our divestiture of our automotive glass business reduced our sales in comparison to last year by $230 million. The next slide details our full-year results showing our sales grew to $15.8 billion, up $3.6 billion or 30%. Again, our acquisitions accounted for the majority of this growth but we delivered $0.5 billion of favorable pricing gains as well.  Volume fell over 2% or approximately $325 million with the entire volume shortfall occurring in the fourth quarter but partially offset by favorable currency. Of note is that our combined coating sales grew by 47% to $11 million and are up over 225% versus just five years ago. Also, sales in emerging regions now account for 25% of the company versus 10% of a much smaller base just five years ago. From an earnings perspective our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.41 versus $1.22 in the prior year with the drop primarily the result of the dramatic decline in volumes I mentioned.  Our sales price gains and lower cost structure stemming from our cost initiatives more than offset lower equity earning and higher inflation. Our full-year tax rate increase as the fourth quarter decline in earnings resulted in a geographic shift in our earnings.  Full-year adjusted earnings per share was down more than 10% versus 2007. Our year-over-year decline in earnings in the fourth quarter pushed our full-year results below our year 2007 results. Our full-year performance, while negative, will likely outpace a similar comparison by many other industrial companies and our favorable comparison to our peer groups is the result of many of the actions we have taken over the past several years focused on minimizing the impacts of steep economic shifts.  Let me quickly discuss two key topics on the next few slides that impacted our fourth quarter and full-year results. First and foremost was the fourth quarter decline in volumes. The nearly $400 million decline in the quarter resulted from our full-year volumes turning negative. The volume drop was broad both by end use market and by geography. Volumes were down at least 11% in all of our major geographic regions. As mentioned, the most severe declines were in the general industrial and automotive OEM markets. However, many other end use markets were impacted but to a lesser degree.  We did deliver positive volume growth in key businesses such as optical products and also aerospace despite the Boeing employee work stoppage. The next slide illustrates the rapid rise in energy costs which pushed up our inflation rates in several areas including natural gas, coatings raw materials and freight.    Our total full-year inflation for the company including raw materials, energy and other general inflation totaled $465 million. As Chuck mentioned, operationally we reacted quickly as we committed to cover the inflation impacts with selling price gains and we were successful as our selling price increases totaled about $500 million. Depicted on the right side of the slide were our expected and actual inflation rates for coatings raw materials costs each quarter. Many of our coatings raw materials are petroleum based and we typically lag petroleum inflation or deflation by about six months. Therefore, the first half 2008 rises in petroleum costs were most impactful to PPG’s results in the second half of the year.  As we began the fourth quarter we expected inflation rates to continue to accelerate which they initially did. But, toward the end of the quarter we began to see very rapid abatement for raw material pricing which allowed us to end the fourth quarter virtually flat with the prior quarter. We expect the rapid raw material price declines to continue in 2009 given both the second half 2008 slide in petroleum costs and the materially lower demand levels at our suppliers.  We also expect lower natural gas costs in 2009. Our full-year 2008 natural gas costs averaged about $9.00 per million BTU which was up about $1.50 versus 2007. We use 60-70 trillion BTU’s of natural gas per year so a $1.00 change in our purchase price equals to us $60-70 million pre-tax earnings impact. We expect 2009 natural gas costs to be lower and we have about ½ of our gas needs hedged in the first quarter at about $8.50 per million BTU. Based on recent market prices for the non-hedged portion our calculated first quarter 2009 gas price would be about $7.50 per unit versus $8.50 in the first quarter of 2008.  I will discuss some other macro topics that impacted 2009 shortly.  Now I will shift our discussion to our business performance. Our industrial base segment results are detailed on the next page. We recorded an operating loss of $40 million in the quarter versus $77 million in earnings in 2007 as sales declined nearly 18%. This segment felt the full impacts of the severe decline in the global industrial demand as fourth quarter selling volumes dropped by more than 20% in comparison with last year. The lower activity levels were across a broad section of global end-markets including consumer electronics, many general industrial applications and the most dramatic declines being in global automotive OEM markets.  Generally speaking, a 20% rate of decline was fairly consistent in our volumes serving these end-markets and in all geographies. In addition, our businesses were saddled with high raw material inflation in the fourth quarter even though raw material costs began to abate toward the tail end of the quarter.  During the quarter we had only begun to implement the restructuring efforts we announced in September focused on lowering our cost structure but we also instituted a variety of additional cost reduction measures given the rapid end-market deterioration. For the full year segment sales grew by 10% reflecting the addition of the industrial coatings business we successfully integrated from our SigmaKalon acquisition, partially offset by a 5% decline in volumes.  Despite an economy that weakened throughout the year a great majority of our year-over-year shortfall in both volumes and segment earnings occurred in the fourth quarter when global industrial demand collapsed. Strategically, our emerging region sales now are just slightly less than 40% of total segment sales and now represent our largest base as they exceed the sales of either the U.S. region or the western European region.  As we look at the first quarter of 2009 the outlook for global demand in our industrial end-markets shows further deterioration versus this past quarter. We will continue to manage our costs aggressively and are anticipating increasingly lower raw material costs from our suppliers.  The next slide details our performance coatings segment results. The fourth quarter earnings were flat. This is impressive when considering our aerospace business results were negatively affected by the Boeing employee strike which lasted into November. Earnings from the SigmaKalon acquisition, selling price gains and tight cost controls were key factors in our delivery of these results.  Our architectural business continued to experience lower volumes which were down by mid-teen percentages. Also, our global automotive refinish business volume declined reflecting the fact that fewer miles are being driven. Full-year volumes were down for these same two businesses. However, the performance co-segments still managed to grow total sales by nearly 25% and segment earnings by 3%. A key contributor towards this growth was the acquisition and successful integration of the SigmaKalon protective marine business. Additionally, sales volumes were accretive in aerospace and our legacy protective and marine coatings businesses and all businesses achieved selling price gains.  Strategically, emerging region sales nearly doubled in 2008 and now account for more than 25% of segment sales. Given the global nature of this segment, in early 2009 we are anticipating some currency headwinds and a challenging demand environment in comparison to the first quarter of 2008. Our architectural EMEA segment results are on the following slide.  This segment, in what is traditionally its slowest quarter due to seasonal trends, once again met or exceeded our various performance targets. From a business activity perspective year-over-year sales in Eastern Europe continue to grow in the quarter while western European sales declined as a result of the continued sluggish United Kingdom market.  On a full-year basis segment earnings were $141 million and include a reduction of approximately $120 million of annual non-cash expenses related to depreciation and acquisition related intangible amortization. The $261 million of segment earnings before depreciation and amortization exceeded our full-year targets for this business. As a reminder, the architectural EMEA segment represents a little less than 70% of the total SigmaKalon acquisition.  Looking at first quarter 2009 the largest headwind we anticipate is currency versus last year’s first quarter. Now let me take a minute to reflect on the entire SigmaKalon acquisition which was the largest acquisition in the company’s history. The acquisition was a strategic milestone as it materially altered the company by both substantially expanding our coatings profile and extending our geographic diversity. Additionally, the business provides us improved access to or expands our position in several markets and regions.  The performance of the entire acquisition exceeded our financial targets including drawn cash generation and over achievement versus our synergy targets. Simply put, by any measure the acquisition has been a significant strategic and financial success for PPG.  The optical and specialty materials segment details are on the next slide. Segment sales in the quarter were down slightly as higher optical sales were more than offset by lower sales in the silica business unit. Optical sales volumes grew in all regions resulting in growth in the mid single digit percentages despite slowing consumer spending and were aided by our generation six transitions product rollout in parts of Europe.  Silica volumes declined by 20% as the tire and battery end-markets were negatively impacted by the global slow down in the automotive markets. In both the quarter and full year we remained aggressive in spending on selling and advertising to stimulate sales and to further build our Transitions brand. Full year optical sales grew once again by more than 10%. We had a very successful roll out of our Transition Generation Six product in the United States in the first half of the year followed by a partial introduction in Europe in the fourth quarter.  Optical remains one of our best growth platforms although year-over-year growth in early 2009 will be a challenge given the very difficult comparables due to our Generation Six product roll out in the United States in early 2008 and currency will also be a headwind.  Our combined chemical results are displayed on the next slide. We had another very solid quarter with year-over-year earnings improvement. Demand was very strong at the outset of the quarter assisted by industrial end-market outages stemming from the third quarter hurricanes which severely impacted a variety of industrial activity in the U.S. gulf coast. Demand fell each month during the quarter reflecting pent up post hurricane demand fulfillment along with slower U.S. economic conditions but price remained fairly stable all quarter.  Our inventory levels remained low as we exited the year. On a full-year basis this business delivered one of its best years ever despite higher input costs driven by natural gas costs which averaged slightly more than $9.00 per million BTU versus about $7.50 per million in 2007. This business remains a stellar cash generator for the company. Looking ahead we are anticipating that early 2009 demand levels will be less than the fourth quarter reflecting the absence of the post-hurricane related impacts.  The next slide details our glass segment reported results which include our automotive glass and services business that we sold in the third quarter of 2008 as well as the pro forma results excluding this divested business. My comments will focus on the pro forma results as we believe these are more meaningful given they reflect the segment on a go-forward basis.  For the fourth quarter the segment reported a $7 million loss as the fiberglass business experienced slowing general industrial demand including weakening electronics end-market activity. This lower end-market demand had a negative impact on our fiberglass earnings as did lower other earnings resulting in part from lower equity earnings from our Asian joint ventures. These shortfalls were only partially offset by improved year-over-year results in our performance glazings architectural glass business.  For the year, pro forma earnings declined 40% on essentially flat sales with the entire decline occurring in the fourth quarter. We continued our relentless focus on cost in these businesses as our manufacturing costs improved by $25 million during the year. Additionally, during the fourth quarter we accelerated execution of our announced restructuring program focused on reducing even further our cost structure.  In 2009 in addition to the recent industrial weakness this segment will likely face a slower commercial construction market and incur higher pension costs. Needless to say, we will continue to aggressively manage these businesses. Also, from a strategic perspective in 2008 we divested our automotive glass and services business in September and hold an equity interest in the new entity. Both the legacy pension and OPEB costs and the ongoing equity results from the new entity are reported in our segment earnings table in the line labeled “Legacy Items.”  The next slide details some 2009 key topics.  Let me quickly summarize our 2008 business performance. Despite one of the most challenging environments in at least the past decade many of our businesses posted good financial results. However, several of our businesses’ performances were severely impacted in the latter part of the year. We responded quickly and are taking considerable cost actions to minimize the impacts of the slowing external marketplace.  Now, as we look at early 2009 several of these headwinds remain the most notable of which is overall global demand levels. Chuck will give you a more detailed read on our early 2009 demand in a minute but as I mentioned in many end-use markets first quarter 2009 demand will certainly be lower than our first quarter 2008 levels.  Also, we may be faced with a higher tax rate depending on the geographic mix of earnings in 2009 and currency is currently a negative versus the prior year. Pension and OPEB costs will inflate and we expect our first quarter 2009 impact to be in the range of $25-30 million pending final actuarial calculations. As I mentioned earlier we do expect some offset to these headwinds due to lower input costs stemming from the decline in energy prices and the lower global demand environment for commodities.  Also, the significant cost actions we have taken and continue to implement will provide benefits as well. This was not intended to be an all-inclusive list but does provide some of the key items for consideration for the first quarter 2009 which will be a challenging quarter.  Now let me discuss our cash generation, cash uses and liquidity. As displayed on the graph on the following slide our cash generation results were impressive throughout the year including the fourth quarter despite the slipping economic environment. We generated about $1.4 billion of cash in 2008 which exceeded our internal targets and was nearly 40% higher than 2007 easily establishing a new record for any year in the company’s history. Several factors influenced these results including the strong cash performance from our SigmaKalon acquisition and our commodity chemicals segment both of which had bid models that result in high cash conversion.  Also we aggressively managed working capital during the year. Strong and consistent cash generation are hallmarks of PPG and our positive step change in cash generation is the direct result of our recent strategic actions. This new level of cash generation has and will allow us to continue to remain flexible financially.  The next slide details our approximate 2008 deployment of cash. In the year we used about $375 million for capital spending necessary for maintenance and organic growth needs. This is only slightly above 2007 despite a 30% increase in company sales and provides additional insights into the capital light nature of our expanding core businesses.  For 2009 our capital expenditures may decline by up to 50% versus our 2008 figure as we tightly control spending. Our dividend payments were $343 million, up 2% versus 2007. We increased our dividend payment once again in October of last year and 2008 marked the 37th consecutive year of increased payments. In anticipation of closing the SigmaKalon acquisition on January 2, 2008, we increased our debt level at the end of 2007 and in early January by a combined $3.1 billion. During 2008 we subsequently paid down about $650 million in debt, nearly double our original debt pay down commitment which was $350 million per year.  In addition we made pre-tax pension contributions totaling about $125 million resulting in approximately $80 million of cash outlays after tax. In 2009 primarily as the result of 2008’s equity market performance we will likely make pension contributions of between $400-500 million all voluntary except in certain non-U.S. pension plans. This is a pre-tax figure so our actual cash outlay will be closer to $250-300 million.  Also, we have $116 million of term debt due in 2009. Therefore, despite much higher pension funding we currently expect our combined net outlays for pension and debt repayments will likely be between $375-425 million, several hundred million less than our 2008 figure and we will still remain ahead of pace on our debt repayment commitments.  Regarding acquisitions, we completed our SigmaKalon acquisition during the year for $1.6 billion plus assumed debt of $11.5 billion. Outside of the SigmaKalon acquisition we spent just under $100 million of cash on a few bolt on acquisitions. While we will continue to review acquisition opportunities in 2009 this will be a lower cash use priority and we will remain extremely selective and opportunistic from a pricing perspective.  Finally, share repurchases were negligible during the year as we focused on conserving cash and we will do so again in 2009. Generally speaking our cash deployment in 2009 will remain cautious and flexible. However, the base case cash deployment assumptions I just provided along with a strong 2008 year-end cash balance likely gives us hundreds of millions of dollars of excess cash and financial flexibility and we will either conserve or deploy cash based on our ongoing assessment of global economic conditions.  Let me conclude our cash discussion by reviewing our liquidity on the next slide. Most impressively is that we ended the year with $1 billion of cash on hand. As the year progressed and we identified the economic slowing we shifted to cash conservation and our results are up notably from earlier in the year including a $500 million increase from just the end of the third quarter.  Looking at our term debt, outside of $116 million term debt due in August 2009 we have no additional long-term debt due until 2012. We also have about $200 million of commercial paper outstanding which we currently plan to keep rolling over and the markets have improved versus the fourth quarter. We have just about $550 million drawn on a variety of European banking facilities which is available to us until at least 2010 and we have never drawn on our $1 billion U.S. revolver that is due for renewal in 2011.  Since we receive this question frequently, the only covenant we have for our debt is a debt to total capital ratio. We have nearly $4 billion of borrowing headroom before that covenant comes into the equation. Needless to say we have extreme financial flexibility and similar ability to deploy our large cash balance in a manner which best benefits the company.  Let me quickly summarize our annual financial results. We grew annual sales by 30% and overcame dynamic external economic issues to post one of our best adjusted earnings per share results ever. During the year we posted record cash generation, growing these results by nearly 40%. Our debt repayment was nearly double our original commitment and our cash on hand doubled versus 2007 levels and as is our legacy we raised our dividend for the 37th consecutive year.  It was certainly a solid overall year financially and we move into a difficult early 2009 with a prudent fiscal approach toward managing the company.  Now let me turn it back over to Chuck. 
Charles Bunch: Thank you Bill. As I mentioned at the outset of today’s call our performance this past year under intensely difficult market conditions continues to demonstrate our strength and business portfolio and the success of our strategic direction. We delivered solid earnings and record cash generation despite rapidly rising energy costs and substantial declines in various industrial end-use market demand levels.  Of equal importance is that we have continued to transform the company and I believe our strategy accomplishments this past year including our notable portfolio changes were greater this year than in any of the 30 years I have been with PPG. The progress will prove even more beneficial as we move into 2009 including our stronger and more stable cash generation capabilities.  Regarding 2009, Bill touched on several of the issues we and many other companies are facing entering the New Year. Of these the one issue of most concern to me is the demand levels in the global end use markets we serve. While we have made tremendous strides in diversifying the company and while coatings and optical remain very low fixed cost businesses, if volume declines persist at the magnitude we witnessed in the late stages of 2008 it will prove to be a challenging environment for many companies including PPG.  Our early read on 2009 is that the first quarter and possibly the first half of the year is shaping up to be an even greater challenge than this past quarter. Our immediate focus is on improving our operating margins as we will manage our businesses to cost levels that reflect the pace of the slower end-use markets. We do expect relief in the form of lower raw material and energy costs which will help mitigate a portion of the impact of the decreased volumes and we are considering additional permanent cost reduction actions on top of those we announced last September which may result in additional restructuring charges and related cost savings in 2009.  Obviously we will remain focused on our cash position and maintaining complete financial flexibility. We have already taken prudent and proactive steps in both managing working capital and capital spending along with many other initiatives to preserve our large cash position until we have more visibility on the credit markets or see more stability in the global economy. Let me add that we are proud of our track record at PPG of managing through difficult economic times.  We have always been able to rapidly and decisively respond to cycles and downturns. However, unlike past downturns today we have the added benefits of a diverse set of businesses, a broader geographic base and a stronger cash position.  My expectations are that 2009 while challenging will ultimately prove to be another successful year for PPG. We expect more of our businesses will continue to deliver solid financial results and for those businesses which are facing the most difficult economic conditions I assure you we will take aggressive measures to manage those businesses to be successful.  Finally, and most importantly, we are extremely proud of our heritage of rewarding shareholders including increases in our annual dividend payments. As is well know we are one of only a handful of U.S. companies that has paid an annual dividend since 1899, a consecutive streak of 109 years. Also, we have raised our annual dividend payment for 37 consecutive years including an increase just a few months ago.  Our portfolio transformation, our historically strong and growing cash flow and our longstanding prudent fiscal discipline has positioned the company to continue regarding shareholders into the future.  Thanks again for your time and interest in PPG and we will now be happy to answer any questions. Would the operator please give instructions and open the line for questions? 
 :
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets. 
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital : What is tougher, the first quarter of 2009 or the Ravens’ defense on Sunday? 
Charles Bunch: I would say speaking as a Pittsburgher I think the first quarter 2009 may be tougher than the Ravens’ defense. 
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital: One of the things we are trying to get a handle on and you talked about difficulty in the fourth quarter with the de-stocking phenomenon working its way through the chain, do you have any sense how much further that has to go? When do we get to an underlying level of demand and along those lines could you offer an expectation of global GDP in 2009? 
Charles Bunch:  Let me take the first question. Volume levels and de-stocking in the first quarter of 2009, we are still at a relatively low activity level especially in the automotive and industrial segment in January. A lot of our customers here in the U.S. and also around the world in automotive have not yet restarted their operations in a significant way. We also have an early Chinese New Year at the end of January so I would say on the automotive side we are not going to have good visibility until February/March. I think we are still going through some de-stocking this month but I think you are going to see a return to lower volumes but somewhat more normalized here as we move through the quarter.  I think in some of our other non-automotive businesses we are seeing some activity levels that are up from the very low December levels. I think in other segments we are going to see a modest pick up from where we were. I think the de-stocking in many of the non-automotive and industrial businesses is moving through the system.  Overall, we looked at GDP growth on an overall global basis in 2008 of about 2.5%. We are probably going to be in our calculus probably slightly positive on a global basis, a couple of tenths of a percentage point. Certainly here in the first quarter and first half we are looking at negative growth on the GDP side in North America. 
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital:  You mentioned it is your belief as we marched through the fourth quarter conference call that PPG will have out performed the competition with the results you posted here today. What gives you the confidence to say that? 
Charles Bunch: I think as we look at our businesses we do not think that we are losing share or position in our end-use markets. Obviously the weakest end-use market we have is automotive and I think relatively to other automotive peers I think our performance is going to be at least as good, if not better. Our confidence level is more about the fact we are well positioned in our end-use markets across the board. We are gaining share in a number of them and not losing any share or position in other markets. 
Operator:  The next question comes from Kevin McCarthy -Banc of America. 
Kevin McCarthy -Banc of America: Of the $465 million in cost inflation you experienced in 2008 how much of that would you expect to unwind this year and then of the amount that unwinds how much do you feel you can retain versus sharing with your customers? 
Charles Bunch:  If you look at our input cost inflation during 2008 we are now obviously unwinding the costs in a couple of areas. Obviously the energy markets, natural gas and what we saw in 2008 in terms of our transportation of fuel cost bills on surcharges. We are now seeing in the fourth quarter of 2008 we started to see for the first time declines in our key raw materials dependent on the raw material at the region but those have started to come down now and we are approaching levels we saw earlier in 2008.  We are, however, seeing some resistance now because the volume or activity levels in our businesses are lower with our customers they are lower. Many of our suppliers are saying we are having difficulty matching the price declines you are expecting because you, PPG, are not taking the kind of volumes you had historically been. So there is some resistance I would say because of this lack of economies of scale with the lower volumes. I expect that our input costs are going to decline across the board during 2009 and my hope is that we will share some of that with our customers but for the most part we intend to improve our margins because as you have seen in many of our segments margins have declined for PPG despite our productivity actions. We need to restore those margins and that is a priority for PPG. 
Kevin McCarthy -Banc of America: To follow-up on architectural coatings, particularly in Europe, can you comment on your expectations for volume trends as well as pricing in Western and Eastern Europe in 2009? 
Charles Bunch:  Volume trends in 2009 are going to be relatively flat. We have not seen a recovery yet in some of the markets that started to weaken in 2008, notably the U.K. We started to see in the fourth quarter a weakening in the continental European markets. Right now our forecast would be for flat volume for 2009 for our European architectural business.  The raw material pricing has been at a slightly different phasing in Europe. We saw a little more increase actually as we went through the year because of the weakening Euro and the fact they had not passed some of the raw material increases on. So we are still now increasing our prices to maintain margins during 2009 and keep the levels that we had in 2008 with what is going to be I think very flat volume across the board in Europe. 
Operator:  The next question comes from Sergey Vasnetsov – Barclays. 
Sergey Vasnetsov – Barclays : Can you comment on some businesses that in the past have been counter-cyclical which is the auto refinish business for example? If people are not buying new cars maybe they will repaint the vehicles more than they have done in the past. Have you seen that and do you expect it in 2009? 
Charles Bunch:  I would say that as you saw in the performance of our refinish business which is within our performance coating segment those earnings have held up relatively well. This is an after-market business that has traditionally played that kind of balancing role for us in that portfolio. The volumes have not been quite as resilient because we have seen some declines in miles driven both here in North America and now in Western Europe. Gasoline prices are coming down so I expect we are going to see that decline reverse itself. We are also having some very severe weather here in North America and I do agree with you as people are keeping their vehicles longer, because we are not seeing the OEM sales here in automotive, I think that there is an opportunity in our refinish business to post a I think better volume performance during 2009 for these reasons. 
Sergey Vasnetsov – Barclays : Bill, you have a few hundred million dollars of free cash flow in 2009 and I think you can find different [size] banks these days with the amount of money. What is your range of priorities for this surplus cash for expense? Maybe speak to a couple of areas? 
William Hernandez:  As we said, we do think we have several hundreds of millions of dollars of cash flexibility next year. Our current thought process is we are going to be fairly conservative especially in the early part of this year until we get a little more visibility on what the future is going to hold for us. I think we will keep quite a bit of cash on hand. I mentioned we are starting the year here with $1 billion in cash and we will keep commercial paper. I think we will keep doing that. We are starting to see commercial paper rates dropping. It is getting a little bit better and it is being placed for longer periods of time. So we will keep a good amount of cash.  Then as we go into the year I think one of the things we may look at is being a little more aggressive at paying down some of the debt. As I mentioned we only have a little over $100 million of long-term debt maturing this year that we have to pay down and actually that $100 million is from a term note we took out in 1999 when we did our acquisition at the end of that decade of about $300 million and we have very quietly paid down that debt since it was well above 7% interest rate. I think one of the scenarios would be a little more aggressive in paying down some debt.  Depending on what happens in the equity markets and the effect that may have on our pension fund we may decide to increase or decrease the amount of cash we put into our pension plan. Then probably acquisitions, as we mentioned earlier, will probably be less of a use of cash for year but we will continue looking at that. Last, we always look at our stock price as a flywheel for any excess cash. 
Operator:  The next question comes from David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank. 
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: Can you comment on the resilience of the optical business in 2009? 
Charles Bunch:  So far we have been quite pleased with the continuing performance of our optical business. As you know, this business has probably more of a healthcare profile with some exposure obviously to some consumer discretionary purchasing but it is behaving more like a healthcare end-use market and as you know in this economic environment we have probably seen the strongest relative performance from the healthcare segment. I think this is giving us a little bit of confidence we are going to continue to see this as an opportunity to grow and to balance our portfolio. We still have some momentum from the Generation Six launch in Transitions. As Bill indicated in his remarks we only launched that in North America and in a few select markets in Europe. Now that is going to be rolled out in the first quarter in the rest of Europe. That should give us a lift. Overall we are still looking for very good things from our Transitions portfolio business and our optical portfolio. 
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: You mentioned potential further cost actions. What would cause you to pull that lever and what would they be in terms of size and areas of focus? 
Charles Bunch:  If you look at our last restructuring announcement which was in September of last year and a third quarter item it was really focused really in two areas. One was capturing synergies from the SigmaKalon integration and also select and targeted actions primarily here in North America in our automotive coatings business and also in our glass segment. What we saw, however, in the fourth quarter was the rapid spread of this decline in automotive around the world and we have seen continued weakness there so we were, I think, now saying we probably did not do enough in that industrial coatings segment. We have to look more broadly there. If these lower volumes and activity levels persist from an overall corporate standpoint we have to look more broadly at actions especially in some of our weaker segments. I would say we are certainly a ways away from making those decisions but I would say throughout the first quarter we are going to analyze this and you will see I think something we will come up with early in the year if we see these conditions persist and we get confidence that we could take cost out of our operations and the magnitude I would say it would not be significantly different than what we saw in the third quarter of last year. 
Operator:  The next question comes from Amy Johnson – Goldman Sachs. 
Amy Johnson – Goldman Sachs: On the pricing front, I noted most of your [inaudible] posted the pricing gains during the quarter which was a little bit surprising to us given how weak the demand environment was in November and December. My question, what would be your pricing strategy and also pricing outlook in 2009? As far as we know several of your competitors already have stopped pushing prices in the latter part of Q4. 
Charles Bunch:  At this juncture we are looking at 2009 as not being a year where we are going to be able to significantly increase prices. If you look at one of the larger segments for us from a pricing perspective which was chlor-alkali we feel pricing peaked in the fourth quarter and we are seeing I think modest declines there. In many of the other segments I don’t look for increased prices during 2009 and it will be more of trying to improve margins through our productivity actions and holding onto some of the gains that we were able to get in 2008 and again with an emphasis in restoring margins through productivity and holding onto those increase rather than passing them through because there has been a margin shift in our businesses either to suppliers or customers over the last couple of years. 
Amy Johnson – Goldman Sachs: Can you give us a little more color on what is going on in Asia? I saw your PowerPoint during the quarter Asia volumes actually dropped more than 10%. Are there any business line or any country particularly weak in the quarter and what is your outlook for that region? 
Charles Bunch:  We saw a decline in activity levels throughout Asia in the fourth quarter. We saw it even in markets that had been growing nicely prior to that. Korea was weak in the automotive sector in the fourth quarter as was China. I think there was anticipation after the Olympics we would maybe pause and then resume growth. Certainly the growth in the fourth quarter in a sector like automotive or our overall industrial we did not see that return to the growth patterns earlier of 2008 and in fact if you look now at the end of the 2008 quarter or how we are starting in other important segments in addition to automotive like consumer electronics those were actually starting to weaken in China and more broadly in Asia.  We are seeing that start slowly in 2009. We have this early Chinese New Year at the end of January so we are looking now to February as the real indicator of what kind of recovery we are going to see but yes, broadly across markets and countries in Asia we saw weakness in the fourth quarter that has not corrected itself as of yet in 2009. 
Amy Johnson – Goldman Sachs: Regarding SigmaKalon I am not sure if you addressed in your prepared remarks, what is your profit expectation for that business? Fourth quarter that business was break even on the profit line. Is there any chance in 2009 given the fact the deterioration of the outlook in Europe and housing and construction market is there any chance in 2009 one could see that business see to an operating loss? 
Charles Bunch:  I would say as we talked about there is a seasonal variability in the architectural coatings business. In Europe it is no different there. Actually the performance in the fourth quarter for us was ahead of our plan. They had very solid growth and earnings during the course of 2008. We expect that to continue. They were able to meet their targets in the fourth quarter even on some lower volumes. So we think they are quite resilient and have a very sound business. At this point even though we are not looking for a lot of volume growth in 2009 we are looking for SigmaKalon and architectural EMEA business to have another solid year in 2009. 
Operator:  The next question comes from Dmitri Silverstein – Longbow Research. 
Dmitri Silverstein – Longbow Research: I just want to follow-up, you mentioned in several of your businesses headwind from foreign exchange when it comes to revenue line. Can you give us an idea of what the impact of foreign exchange would be on your operating profit line providing the dollar stays at current levels? 
William Hernandez:  The headwind is mainly in comparables versus last year. We had a very weak dollar at the beginning of the year and I think what we are really talking about is comparables as we begin comparison with the year and where we go. Looking forward I think it is anybody’s guess exactly which way all currencies will play out for the remainder of the year. It is a headwind at the beginning of the year. I don’t think it will be a headwind as we progress through the year. It is more comparison here in the first quarter. 
Dmitri Silverstein – Longbow Research: I understand that. I’m not asking you to predict where the dollar is going to go but if it stays at current levels I am just trying to determine what kind of year-over-year sensitive is to foreign exchange on the operating profit line. 
Charles Bunch :  For every dollar change on the top line it is about 10% on the bottom line. We think there is about a 10% headwind. 
Dmitri Silverstein – Longbow Research: In regard to your performance coatings business I think you talked about fourth quarter volumes in architectural coatings being down 15% for the division overall. Can you give us an idea of the relative performance of the U.S. market versus the Asian market? Have you seen comparable declines or was one worse than the other? 
Charles Bunch:  I would say we saw weakness here in North America as well as in other parts of the globe. South America, they began experiencing some of the same issues we have had here in North America during the fourth quarter as did Australia and China was not as strong either. I would say that this recessionary environment for the construction industries has spread rapidly around the world, not as severely as automotive but certainly we are seeing weakness outside of North America as well now with Europe and our position there and our SigmaKalon business holding up the best. 
Dmitri Silverstein – Longbow Research: Turning attention to the commodity chemical sector you talked about the overall demand in early quarter being strong and then falling each month with the pricing holding steady. What was the volume decline you witnessed in the chlor-alkali segment and what are the current utilization rates? If volume keeps declining can you keep shutting down capacity to maintain utilization rates? 
Charles Bunch:  We saw volume or utilization rates decline through the quarter. October was actually a very strong month. We were recovering from the September hurricane and operating levels were quite good. In November they declined somewhat but were still pretty solid. In December, you saw many of the chemical customers for our business and some of the other industries that are served by the chlor-alkali industry started shutting down to kind of manage inventories and do de-stocking in December. So we did see a sharper fall off in December.  As I said earlier in my remarks in January we have actually seen these levels come up a little bit here in chlor-alkali. Activity levels are better and that is in contrast to some of my comments about automotive where we have seen in January activity levels still remain low for our automotive customers in January with we hope a pick up starting in February. 
Dmitri Silverstein – Longbow Research: Do I take to mean the modest reductions in capacity in January you were able to execute to maintain utilization rates we will be able to maintain that pace in 2009 so that utilization rates allow for some pricing stability? 
Charles Bunch:  I think that pricing is going to…there are some declines in pricing right now, some industry price levels such as the alumina contract are still being discussed. I think pricing in the first half of the year is going to be relatively stable if at a lower level and activity levels, they will probably be obviously weaker at the start of this quarter than they were at the start of the fourth quarter because October was quite a good month for us but I would tell you I think that operating rates for us will be fairly stable and we should be able to manage our inventories and operating levels to be solidly profitable in the first quarter and first half of the year. 
Dmitri Silverstein – Longbow Research: On the glass segment, did I hear you correctly the architectural glass business was up for the quarter? What is the current make up now that you have de-consolidated the automotive glass? What is the current make up of the division between fiberglass and other types of glass, flat glass? 
Charles Bunch:  There are really just two businesses within that glass segment. One is flat glass or performance glazing. That makes up a little more than half of the sales of that segment. Fiberglass is a smaller piece of sales although they do have a significant joint venture that is not consolidated on the sales line. I would say they are equally present within the segment and yes performance glazing business on a relative basis had a better quarter than the previous year whereas fiberglass because of the rapid de-stocking especially in the thermoplastics side of the business which has end-use markets in automotive and industrial, they experienced a very rapid drop off in demand starting in November. Because of the higher fixed costs in that business it is a little tougher to adjust capacity but we are doing that now. 
Operator:  The next question comes from Steve Schuman – Lafayette Research. 
Steve Schuman – Lafayette Research: A question on your projection for 2009. You had said things are probably a little worse than you had expected. With that what are the chances of doing another major restructuring? Automotive in particular doesn’t look to recover any time soon; at least on the big three side. 
Charles Bunch:  I would say we are looking at that now and I would say in the next couple of months we will determine whether we can execute a restructuring but certainly given the weakness of the markets we have right now we are going to work hard to try to identify some opportunities to lower our costs and that would mean more than likely a restructuring action. We are still working at it right now. 
Steve Schuman – Lafayette Research: The few hundred million of free cash next year does that include or exclude the voluntary pension payment of a couple hundred million also? 
William Hernandez:  It included it. That is over and above the pension numbers we talked about. 
Steve Schuman – Lafayette Research: That also takes into consideration that you thought you could bring CapEx down by 50%? 
William Hernandez:  Yes. 
Operator:  The next question comes from Saul Ludwig – KeyBanc. 
Saul Ludwig – KeyBanc: For the pension expense for 2009 for the full year what do you expect it to increase and as part of that answer what are you using for your discount rate for 2009 versus 2008 and your assumed rate of return of assets in 2009/2008? 
William Hernandez:  The discount rate we are using is just a little bit above 6% as what we are looking at over the coming year. We think about an 8% return on assets and it has been pretty steady over that time period. As we said, the pension expense we are talking about is several hundred million dollars for this coming year. On an after tax basis it will be about $250-300 million. 
Saul Ludwig – KeyBanc: I’m not talking about pension cash contribution. I’m talking about pension expense going forward. 
William Hernandez:  Expense going forward we are looking somewhere between $25-30 million a quarter for increased pension expense for each quarter of 2009 versus 2008. 
Saul Ludwig – KeyBanc: The 6.2 or 6.2 discount rate, how did that compare with the discount rate you used in 2008? 
William Hernandez:  It is pretty close to the same. We are talking one or two basis point difference. 
Saul Ludwig – KeyBanc: Chuck, on the chlor-alkali outlook for 2009, when you consider the effects of both volume, price weakness, help on natural gas, do you think the combination of those items keeps earnings the same in that segment or do think it gets a little better or a little worse? 
Charles Bunch:  I wouldn’t want to make a direct forecast but I would say in view of what we see overall in the markets and some of the weakness I think it will be a challenge keeping those operating earnings at the same level for the full year. 
Saul Ludwig – KeyBanc: Your comment about SigmaKalon expecting to be flat in volume how was their volume in 2008 versus what it was when SigmaKalon had them in 2007? 
Charles Bunch:  Volume was up slightly. It was down in the U.K. but up overall. It was modestly up. I would say this is certainly just less than 2%. 
Saul Ludwig – KeyBanc: When you had it up 2% in the total year which wasn’t so bad economically in Europe until late in the year and we see Europe decelerating at a fairly rapid pace, being flat in volume would be a darn good performance. I would call that optimistic. Why do you feel so confident that volume could stay flat as the whole economic scene in Europe is deteriorating rapidly? 
Charles Bunch:  2008 was a record year for SigmaKalon. It was there performance improved over 2007 and that top line is a combination of volume and price. We have seen their ability to adjust their costs and expenses to fluctuate with volume so we think the combination of flat volume, some pricing in margin maintenance and lower cost as an opportunity to have another good year for SigmaKalon in what is arguably going to be I think a tougher environment next year. 
Saul Ludwig – KeyBanc: CapEx will work against them as well? 
Charles Bunch:  Yes it will. 
Operator:  The next question comes from Silka Koopf – JP Morgan. 
Silka Koopf – JP Morgan: A question on the domestic architectural coatings business. Can you talk about the magnitude of the volume decrease in the fourth quarter and what volume expectations you have for full year 2009 and also how large is architectural coatings as a part of performance in coatings? 
Charles Bunch:  Architectural coatings broadly, this would be North America and the rest of the world; I would say was over 20% of the total for performance coatings. Volumes were down here in North America modestly and what we were able to do though because we have been adjusting costs, reducing our footprint we actually had a better performance in the fourth quarter of 2008 on lower volumes. I think we have proven we can make the tough decisions here and take costs out. These were costs we took out without the benefit of a restructuring reserve. I would tell you that we are not looking for a pick up in architectural market here in North America. We think we are going to be able to continue to perform better because we have been aggressive on cost, productivity and trying to make up for the weakness in the market with our own actions. 
Operator:  The next question comes from John Roberts - Buckingham Research. 
John Roberts - Buckingham Research: Do you manage the seasonal ramp up for the architectural coatings business different this season at all? Do you normally build to inventory in addition to serving the inventory needs of the customer? Is that going to change given the uncertainty that is out there in the ordering? 
Charles Bunch:  Typically we start building inventory in the architectural business at the end of the year or the end of the fourth quarter so you start to see that in December. This year I think we were a little more cautious and we are starting to do that now here early in the first quarter. We are not expecting a significantly weaker environment in the architectural business here in North America this year. We are 2.5 years into what has been a housing recession. We think there is a lot of stability in our customer base in every channel and even though we are not expecting a lot of strong growth here we think we have a good handle on demand and our inventory needs and we are managing that now. We are starting to add inventory here in the first quarter to handle these seasonal requirements.  Thank you very much. I look forward to talking to you at our next quarterly earnings release and question-and-answer session. 
Operator:  Thank you for attending today’s conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2008 Q3  (2008-10-16 08:30:00) =====
Executives: Vince Morales - VP of IR William Hernandez - SVP and CFO
Vince Morales: Good morning, this is Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations for PPG Industries. Welcome to PPG's third quarter 2008 financial commentary. The financial commentary is provided by PPG's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, William Hernandez. These comments relate to the financial information released on Thursday, October 16, 2008. Visuals supporting this briefing may be accessed through the Investor Center on the PPG website at www.ppg.com. As shown on slide number two, the following presentation contains forward-looking statements reflecting the company's current views about future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could affect the company's operations and financial results and as discussed in PPG's filings with the SEC may cause actual results to differ from such forward-looking statements. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the company has provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures presented on slide number five of the visuals supporting this briefing. Now let me introduce PPG's Senior Vice President and CFO, William Hernandez.
William Hernandez: Good morning and thank you for your time and interest in PPG. Today I will review PPG's third quarter 2008 operating performance and comment on various trends that impacted our results. Before I recap the quarter, let me quickly discuss a few strategic updates. First, we completed the sale of our automotive glass and services business within our originally communicated timeline, despite challenging market conditions. I will discuss a few details on the deal later, but once again we are pleased to have followed through on our commitments. Also, we recorded a business restructuring reserve in the third quarter, which focuses on adjusting the cost structure of our ongoing operations to reflect current market conditions, and will aid in achieving the year 2009 synergy targets that we set-forth for our SigmaKalon acquisition. We anticipate the restructuring will result in a $100 million cash outlay, and expect to achieve savings at a $100 million annual run-rate by the end of 2009. Last, we repaid net debt of over $650 million, which puts us on pace to more than double our 2008 debt reduction target. Also, as you would expect from PPG, we remain financially disciplined, as we ended the quarter with cash of $500 million which exceeds our short-term commercial paper of about $175 million. We have been able to deliver these results due to our excellent cash generation, which is about $250 million or 50% ahead of a strong 2007 performance, including about $450 million of cash from operations in the third quarter. Now let me discuss our ongoing operations. As we communicated toward the end of the third quarter, several of our businesses were hampered by non-recurring items including weather related events such as the two hurricanes, Gustav and Ike, which struck the US Gulf coast, and an employee work stoppage at The Boeing Company which is a large PPG Aerospace customer. Additionally, overall economic conditions resulted in a significant drop in production levels in the automotive OEM industry and adjacent industries. Despite these challenges, we delivered double-digit percentage growth in both sales and segment earnings. Our adjusted earnings per share, which include the negative impacts from weather, the considerably slower automotive OEM end-market, and continued cost inflation, was $1.37, which is comparable with a year ago. Achieving these results despite the items I mentioned and in today's increasingly difficult economic climate, validates the strategic progress we have made in both transforming the company and making the company less prone to negative earnings shocks due to individual end-markets or regions. Collectively, the weather related events and Boeing strike, negatively impacted our results this quarter by about $17 million pre-tax, or $0.07 per share. The negative weather impact to our financial results was less severe than we originally anticipated and communicated in September, due to better end-of-month performance in our commodity chemical business, as customer demand in the Gulf Coast region returned more quickly and stronger than we expected. Meanwhile, the lower automotive OEM activity levels, which are primarily reflected in our Industrial Coatings reporting segment, combined with higher cost inflation, resulted in the majority of the substantial operating earnings decline for that segment versus last year as segment earnings fell 46%. And, although we sold the business at quarter-end, the third quarter automotive glass operating results were included in our reported earnings and also dropped versus last year. Again, despite these notable headwinds, the company still delivered comparable results as the remainder of our business portfolio performed well despite slowing in the overall economy, and our results were aided by our largest quarterly selling price increase in at least a decade. Our Commodity Chemical business, despite some negative impact from the weather related events, performed exceptionally well with year-over-year earnings up about 30%. Additionally, our Optical and Specialty Materials segment grew earnings by nearly 11% and our Performance Coatings segment despite the Boeing work stoppage in September still grew earnings by about 6%. Finally, our SigmaKalon acquisition remains ahead of our financial targets supported by the continued growth of our Architectural EMEA segment, which consists of the majority of the SigmaKalon acquisition. Third quarter year-over-year sales were up over 12% to $632 million as organic growth comprised of higher prices and stronger volumes accelerated further this quarter and were supplemented by currency gains. Segment earnings were $61 million, which includes a reduction of $30 million for depreciation and ongoing amortization stemming from acquisition accounting. Let me conclude my recap of the quarter by stating once again the strong execution, which you have come to expect from PPG, our broad geographic reach and diverse end-markets, and our prudent approach toward managing our cash has once again, produced solid financial performance despite a variety of headwinds. Also with our recently announced restructuring, we are taking further action to adjust our cost structure to the shifts in the global markets we serve. Now, if you turn to the next slide, let me review some of the details for the quarter. First, our reported sales exceeded $4.2 billion up 37% from last year, establishing a new PPG third quarter record. Despite the challenging economic backdrop, we delivered a year-over-year quarterly sales record for the 22nd consecutive quarter. Every one of our segments, except Glass, posted double-digit sales growth. Our acquisitions primarily SigmaKalon added about 30% to PPG's total sales and increased the sales in our combined coatings segments by about 50%. We also delivered our best quarterly pricing results in at least a decade, as year-over-year selling prices added about $175 million to our sales. Our volumes were down less than 1%. We experienced extremely weak US end market demand in automotive OEM, and lower demand in residential construction. We offset those volume declines with solid volume growth in several businesses including optical and aerospace, as well as continued growth in emerging regions. Currency was also slightly incremental, adding an additional 2% to sales. Our segment earnings grew by over 10%, which is a result of the earnings of acquired businesses, the double-digit growth in the Commodity Chemicals and Optical and Specialty Materials segments, and the growth we delivered in emerging regions. Many of our business units delivered third quarter earnings records as well. Once again, we are proud of our growth and overall solid performance in today's economy. Now let's review our earnings per share results. The next slide provides a reconciliation of our continuing operations reported earnings per share to our adjusted earnings per share for both this year and last, adjusting for unusual charges. Our reported earnings per share in the quarter were $0.70. We had unusual charges of $0.67 for business restructuring and $0.02 for our proposed asbestos settlement. We also had a one-time gain of $0.02 relating to our completed automotive glass divestiture. Our third quarter adjusted earnings per share excluding the one-time and unusual items is $1.37. This compares with $1.40 last year. This performance provides both validation of the strength of our portfolio as well as a milepost on the progress of the company's transformation to a coatings, optical and specialty materials company. Now let's review some of the details. Looking quickly at our sales results by region, our year-over-year sales in the United States and Canada grew by 6% in the third quarter, which is a much higher growth rate than last year despite volumes being hampered by weather related issues. Pricing improved by 8% with every business, except our Automotive OEM businesses posting fairly solid pricing gains as we continue to work to offset cost inflation. Volumes in the region were down 2% including the negative weather and Boeing strike effects. As mentioned, the US automotive OEM industry weakened even further this quarter, while residential construction remained weak. Many of our other business units did experience higher volumes in this region highlighted by optical and aerospace. We anticipate the fourth quarter to be equally challenging from an automotive OEM volume perspective, but we also expect to gain additional pricing. Moving to the next slide, our European sales grew by about $850 million dollars, up more than 130%, primarily due to our SigmaKalon acquisition and currency. All SigmaKalon sales, including organic growth versus their 2007 performance, are classified as increases due to acquisition and thus not illustrated on this chart. As I mentioned SigmaKalon's organic growth rate accelerated during the quarter. Excluding SigmaKalon, our selling prices increased by 2%, which offset slightly negative volumes, which were down 1%. As you can see on the graph, activity in the region has been fairly comparable all year. Also, with the last few quarters, our quarterly comparables from both 2007 and 2006 were exceedingly difficult, so maintaining these prior year gains is pleasing. Regarding the fourth quarter, we are currently expecting additional slowing of general industrial growth in Western Europe, which will be partially offset by solid growth in Eastern Europe. We also expect to realize higher selling prices in this region. Our Asian results are detailed on the next slide and our year-to-date sales in this region through September have already eclipsed, by about 20%, our full year sales from 2007 exemplifying our continued rapid growth in the region. During the quarter we still delivered double-digit organic growth despite lower activity levels around the 2008 Summer Olympics held in Beijing. In the region, we have established a good market presence in each of our coatings businesses and our profitability remains at a high level, when compared with both overall coatings industry margins and even PPG's other regions. We expect similar growth rates to continue in this region in the fourth quarter. Now before I discuss each of our individual business segments, let me discuss a few macro topics. As detailed on the next slide, during the quarter we continued to experience year-over-year inflationary increases in the cost of energy and raw materials. In the quarter, our primary energy cost, natural gas, inflated to just above $9.50 per unit, compared with slightly under $7 in the third quarter of last year. Our cost did move down from the second quarter of this year, when it was about $10.50 per unit. For those of you less familiar with PPG, we use 60 to 70 trillion BTUs of natural gas a year to generate power for the production of chlorine and caustic soda, and to produce glass and fiber glass. So, if natural gas unit costs change by $1 per million BTU, our pre-tax costs change by about $60 to $70 million on an annual basis. Looking ahead we have about 40% of our fourth quarter gas needs hedged at about $8.75 per million BTU. As a reference point, our fourth quarter 2007 unit costs were about $7.50. We have also experienced inflation in our coatings raw material costs, which include petroleum based materials. Raw materials are the largest major component of production costs for coatings. Our expectation at the outset of the third quarter was for year-over-year inflation in the range of 4% to 6% and our actual inflation was right at 6%. Our expectation for the fourth quarter is for year-over-year inflation in the range of 5% to 8%, but I will comment that it is a dynamic market today with both energy costs falling, but remaining very volatile, and our suppliers growing concerned about demand levels. In addition to raw materials and direct energy costs, we also experienced higher year-over-year transportation costs and surcharges associated with higher gasoline and diesel costs. Our total transportation costs in the quarter increased by about $20 million versus last year. Regarding inflation overall, we have continually increased efforts to identify and qualify new and more cost effective sources of raw materials. Also, as I mentioned earlier, our selling price was up about 6% this past quarter and our businesses are working to secure additional pricing to further offset the higher costs. Now before I review our business results in more detail, I typically provide an update on our proposed asbestos settlement. For those not familiar with the details of the proposed settlement, please refer to the disclosures beginning on page 22 of our second quarter 2008 form 10-Q. As we said in previous updates, we have filed motions asking the court to reconsider, alter or amend its ruling from December, 2006. Also, various parties, including PPG, are currently working toward an amended PPG settlement agreement to address issues the court raised in its ruling. We continue to believe we are close to a potential resolution. However, given the overall complexity of the issue we are not able to offer any time line upon, which any next step will be taken. Now let's discuss the performance in each of our business segments. The next slide illustrates the results in our Performance Coatings segment. Third quarter sales grew by over $250 million or 28%. Acquisitions added 21% growth, currency added 3%, volumes were flat and price added 4%. Our segment earnings were $148 million, up 6% versus the prior year. A few key elements driving the increased earnings were our pricing efforts, our continued growth in Aerospace despite the negative impact of the Boeing work stoppage, cost management in our US Architectural business and our Protective and Marine Coatings business results, which include a portion acquired in the SigmaKalon acquisition. Let me review a few key items in our business units: In Aerospace, our sales grew 10%, resulting primarily from our volume and pricing gains. Volume growth outside the US was up double-digit percentages, with US growth up moderately despite the Boeing work stoppage which started in early September. This remains a solid business with continued growth prospects, but the level of growth next quarter will depend on the length of the Boeing work stoppage. Our automotive refinish sales grew 12% supported by moderate gains in price, volumes, currency and acquisitions. Share gains are offsetting industry volume declines in the mature regions. Of note is the fact that we are delivering double-digit volume growth in Asia, and our quarter-end acquisition of the Chinese refinish paint company Bonny will further expand our offering into that rapidly growing market. Our Architectural Coatings Americas and Asia business unit grew sales by 9%. Our non-US markets grew primarily as a result of a prior year acquisition and favorable currency. Our US and Canadian sales were flat. Volumes were down mid-single digits as volume in our national accounts rose, while company owned store and independent dealer volumes were down. We did achieve price increases in most channels as we continue to work to offset raw material inflation. We remain at a very low activity level in the US, and we continue to aggressively manage costs in this business. Looking ahead we are continuing to seek further pricing to offset inflationary impacts, and do not expect any material changes in the overall activity level outside of the normal seasonal decline. We continue to achieve high growth rates in our protective and marine coatings business unit. The SigmaKalon acquisition has more than doubled our sales into this end-market and the acquired business grew organically this quarter by mid-teen percentages, while our legacy business grew both pricing and volumes by mid-single digits. We expect end-market activity to remain strong for the foreseeable future. To summarize the quarter for this segment, we offset lower activity levels in our US Architectural Coatings business with continued growth in aerospace, protective and marine and in all businesses in emerging regions. Also, we realized a notable portion of our initial pricing efforts which were intended to offset current year inflationary impacts. Finally, as I have mentioned all this year, the protective and marine portion of SigmaKalon has been nicely accretive and is performing ahead of our expectations both in end-market results and in synergies. Moving to the next slide detailing our Industrial Coatings segment, our sales rose by about $120 million or 13%. The gain was due primarily to our acquisitions, including the SigmaKalon industrial coatings business. Favorable currency and price outpaced lower volumes. Our segment earnings were down significantly, dropping from $89 million to $48 million. A major factor in this decline was the rapid deterioration in automotive OEM industry production levels. In the quarter, US auto OEM industry production declined by about (17%), a sizable downward shift from just last quarter. Other impacts were from higher inflation and industrial sales in the mature regions which slowed slightly. Continued growth in emerging regions partially offset the slower end-markets and mature regions. Of note is that our sales in emerging regions of Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, are now collectively much larger than the sales in the US and Canadian region. Let me quickly comment on each of the businesses comprising the Industrial Coatings segment: Our automotive OEM coatings sales were up 2% as volumes fell 2%, including a 15% drop in the US and Canadian market. The US and Canadian region represents about 30% of the business unit sales. Our combined non-US regions continued to grow by mid-single digit percentages, but growth rates in all these regions moderated. Looking ahead, we expect at a minimum, an equally challenging end-market in the fourth quarter. Industrial Coatings business unit sales improved over 35%, as the SigmaKalon acquisition remained the main growth factor. Overall volumes were down 2% due to softer demand in mature regions, partially offset by growth in emerging regions which now account for over 40% of this business unit. Price gains accelerated to 2% for the business. We anticipate overall global activity levels to soften further in the fourth quarter. Packaging coatings sales grew by 9% aided by currency and price, with slightly lower volumes. Overall our Industrial Coatings segment experienced a very difficult end-market decline. We are reacting quickly to this decline and announced a business restructuring late in the quarter which, in part, is targeted to lower this segment's ongoing cost structure in regions with lower ongoing activity levels. We will continue to focus on managing costs and will respond to as any other challenges that arise in the end-markets served. Our next slide is Architectural Europe, Middle East and Africa or EMEA, and it represents about three quarters of the acquired SigmaKalon business. Segment sales in a seasonally strong quarter were $632 million. Organic sales growth accelerated to mid-single digit percentages versus pre-acquisition SigmaKalon results last year, reflecting continued growth in most regions. Earnings for the segment were $61 million. These earnings include $30 million each quarter in ongoing depreciation and non-cash amortization of intangibles stemming from the acquisition. The business is performing well and is pacing well ahead of a solid 2007 financial performance. As I mentioned last quarter, we have minimal participation in several of the most negatively impacted construction markets in Europe, such as Spain, Italy and Ireland. We do participate in the UK market and that was our only major market with negative growth, when compared with last year. However, solid pricing gains and strong positions in other, more stable regions and several Eastern European countries resulted in our accelerated organic growth. Looking ahead, I will remind you that the fourth quarter is traditionally our slowest quarter seasonally in this business with about 20% of our annual sales in the fourth quarter versus roughly 27 to 29% in the second and third quarters. As with last quarter, I will take this opportunity to provide you with an update on the overall SigmaKalon acquisition. This update includes our Architectural EMEA business, along with the SigmaKalon businesses, which we merged into our Industrial and Protective & Marine businesses. As we mentioned previously, during the first quarter, we secured permanent debt financing within the interest rate guidance we set forth last November. Also, our integration efforts remain on schedule to achieve over $50 million of cost synergies this year. On top of that we have achieved additional raw material cost mitigation through the first three quarters of the year, due to our enhanced purchasing power. This quarter, we announced business restructuring plans within the acquired businesses that will aid us in delivering our 2009 synergies. Looking at the combined financial results from all the acquired SigmaKalon businesses, I am happy to report that we are exceeding our original 2008 financial targets due to stronger performance by all three business segments and this does not include the incremental raw material cost mitigation, I just mentioned. Obviously we are pleased with the acquisition results and the notable impact on our financial results this year. Shifting to our Optical and Specialty Materials segment on the next slide, we achieved double-digit segment sales and earnings growth. This was a result of 10% volume growth in optical products, including Transitions. The growth rate accelerated versus the second quarter. Our Specialty Materials business delivered strong price gains, but posted volume declines reflecting lower automotive demand for our silica products in tires and batteries. As we communicated last quarter, we increased, yet again, our marketing investments with notably higher selling and marketing costs. The investments continued to drive profitable growth as segment earnings grew 11% driven by optical volume gains. Looking ahead, the rollout of our new generation Transition Optical lens product in certain European countries is now underway. As a result of this and continued strong demand in general, we anticipate further growth in this segment in a seasonally slower fourth quarter. The next slide details our Commodity Chemicals segment. This segment was negatively affected by both US hurricanes Ike and Gustav, which resulted in two voluntary shutdowns of our largest facility, which is located in Louisiana. While our facility sustained minimal damage, production was curtailed by difficulties in securing critical raw materials and transportation equipment and similar issues for our customers including inability to secure energy to power their facilities. Our facility returned to normal operating rates toward the end of September and the hurricane impacts on the business were not as severe, as we initially projected as customer demand returned sooner and stronger than anticipated. In the quarter our sales increased by 25% to a new all-time quarterly record. Pricing in response to industry supply and demand dynamics plus higher costs for both natural gas and ethylene, drove the majority of the sales gain. Segment earnings improved by 30%, which includes negative effects from the hurricanes. As we look ahead, the fourth quarter is traditionally slower than the third quarter due to seasonality. As we exited the third quarter, several products remained on force majeure due to our low inventory position resulting from the outages and continued strong demand. Last price increases have been announced for select products for the fourth quarter Our next business segment slide details our Glass segment. We sold the Automotive Glass and Services business on September 30th. So, our reported results for the quarter include the automotive glass business results. However, to aid in the understanding of the remaining glass businesses, we are providing financial figures both including and excluding the automotive glass business. Looking at the businesses, which remain Performance Glazings, sales improved 8%. Pricing was favorable as higher prices in a few end-markets were combined with our energy surcharge. Volumes dropped slightly as volumes into the commercial construction segment were up, while residential construction volumes sagged. Fiber Glass sales advanced 5% mostly due to pricing gains. Combined earnings from these two businesses declined by about $5 million versus last year as lower volumes and inflation more than countered the improved pricing and lower manufacturing costs. Looking ahead we anticipate some additional, moderate demand erosion in some industrial end-markets of these businesses in the fourth quarter. Now let me quickly describe our automotive glass and services operating results. Automotive glass and services sales decreased 8%, stemming in part from lower end-market demand. Earnings were down by $13 million. The business sale was completed on September 30th, and on an ongoing basis, we will hold about a 40% minority share in the new entity. Also, PPG retained liabilities for pension and retirement benefits, which were earned up to the business sale date, and we will recognize earnings and balance sheet impacts from these liabilities going forward based on GAAP requirements. Now let's move to the company's cash results. The subsequent slide provides some details on our cash position and year-to-date cash uses. For the quarter, we generated about $450 million in cash from operations. On a year-to-date basis our cash from operations exceeds $800 million, and is more than $250 million, or about 50% ahead of last year's pace. Our uses of cash through September are as follows: Year-to-date we have spent approximately $260 million on organic capital spending, excluding acquisitions, or about 2% of sales. Our dividend payments year-to-date totaled about $256 million, as dividends per share are up 3% versus last year. Regarding debt, we assumed about $1.5 billion in the first quarter, as a result of our SigmaKalon acquisition. Year-to-date we have paid down net debt of over $650 million, which has already nearly doubled our debt reduction target for the entire year. Regarding pensions, we made pre-tax contributions of about $100 million this year. Next are acquisitions, and outside of SigmaKalon we have made a few bolt-on acquisitions this year. Finally our share repurchases and through the third quarter our focus remained on offsetting dilution from options. Let me conclude my cash discussion by reiterating what I stated in my opening comments. Our culture as a company, both historically and currently, is one of financial discipline. Given the recent issues in the credit markets our long-standing financial policies are providing us with an even larger benefit today. We currently have $500 million of cash, which well outpaces our commercial paper outstanding of about $175 million. Additionally, the fourth quarter is traditionally a strong cash generation quarter for us. So, we remain extremely comfortable in our liquidity position and have actually been receiving interest on our excess cash at rates higher than our short-term debt interest rates Now let me conclude my commentary on our third quarter results, by highlighting a few key takeaways from the quarter: As I mentioned at the outset, we are proud to deliver comparable year-over-year adjusted earnings per share, despite weather related issues and a generally more difficult economic environment. Our SigmaKalon acquisition performance continues to demonstrate how successful that acquisition has been. We continue to execute on our transformation strategy with this quarter's highlight being the completion of the sale our automotive glass and services business. We are managing some difficult end-markets and, as you would expect us to do, have reacted by quickly announcing business restructuring targeted at reducing our cost footprint serving those markets. A key measure of any company's success is cash generation, and the level of our year-over-year increase is providing us benefits and flexibility today and will do so into the future. In conclusion, we are experiencing one of the most tumultuous economic environments in recent history. A time, where a broad business portfolio and extended geographic reach, traits that we have successfully built into PPG, are providing stability and continued growth potential. Our performance this quarter and year-to-date confirms this, and we expect to continue our solid performance including our pace of record cash generation.

===== 2008 Q2  (2008-07-17 08:00:00) =====
Executives: Vince Morales - Vice President, Investor Relations William Hernandez - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Vince Morales: Good morning, this is Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations for PPG Industries. Welcome to PPG’s second quarter 2008 financial commentary. The financial commentary is provided by PPG’s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, William Hernandez. These comments relate to the financial information released on Thursday, July 17, 2008. Visuals supporting this briefing may be accessed through the investor center on PPG’s website at www.PPG.com. As shown on slide 2, the following presentation contains forward looking statements reflecting the company's current view about future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could affect the company's operations and financial results, and as discussed in PPG Industries filings with the SEC, may cause actual results to differ from such forward looking statements. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the company has provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the Appendix of the visuals supporting this briefing. Now let me introduce PPG’s Senior Vice President and CFO, William Hernandez.
William Hernandez: Today I will review PPG’s second quarter 2008 performance and comment on various trends that are impacting our results. Let me quickly recap the quarter. First, let me state that we are very proud to deliver strong financial performance this quarter. We achieved double digit percentage growth in sales, segment earnings and adjusted earnings per share, despite a higher inflationary environment and overall slower economic conditions including severe recessions in US residential construction and US automotive production. We were able to deliver this performance due to the strength and diversity of our business portfolio. Some of the main contributors were our growth drivers of Aerospace, Optical, Protective and Marine Coatings and our coatings businesses in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, which continued to grow at very high rates. Our commodity chemical business had yet another solid quarter. Also, across all our businesses, we achieved one of our largest selling price increases in the past several years. Many of our strategic actions over the past several years were to diversify our business and geographic sales mix. These actions had more complexity versus remaining or expanding predominantly in the United States and not exploring new end markets. But we were successful in executing and we are realizing the dividends today as indicated by the financial performance we posted this quarter. This includes our recent SigmaKalon acquisition which is currently tracking ahead of our 2008 financial targets. Also, earlier this month we signed an agreement to sell approximately 60% of our Automotive Glass and Services businesses and we expect the deal to close in the third quarter. Since the third quarter of 2007, this business had been classified in our financial statements as a discontinued operation because of our intent to sell the entire business. Because we are retaining 40% interest in the business, generally accepted accounting principles require us to report this business as part of our continuing operations for both the second quarter and in our historical financial results. Therefore, included in today’s presentation is second quarter and June year to date financial information which identifies the operating results of the Automotive Glass and Services businesses and one time charges, including those related to the pending sale of the business. We believe this provides investors with all the pertinent details relating to our financial results both with and without the Automotive Glass and Services businesses. Now if you turn to the next slide, let me quickly recap our strong operating performance in the quarter. First regarding sales, our reported sales were nearly $4.5 billion, up over 40% from last year and easily establishing a new PPG record for any quarter in the company’s history, demonstrating the consistency of our growth, this is the 21st consecutive quarter, or over five years in a row now where we have delivered a year over year quarterly sales record. All eight of our coatings business units, both Optical and Specialty Materials business units, our commodity chemicals business and our Performance Glazing glass business unit posted second quarter sales records. Many of these business units also delivered second quarter earnings records as well. We delivered overall organic growth of 5% in the quarter, with both volume and price contributing. Also, currency added an additional 5% to sales. We experienced extremely weak US end market demand in automotive OEM and residential construction, with our volumes in businesses directly serving these markets down over 10%. However, we more than offset those volume declines with solid organic volume growth in Asia, Latin American and Europe, along with solid volume gains in several businesses including Commodity Chemicals, Aerospace, Optical, and Specialty Materials. Higher year over year selling prices added just about $90 million to our sales, again one of our largest increases in the past several years. Our acquisition of SigmaKalon added about 30% to PPG’s total sales, and increased the sales in our combined coatings segments by 50%. All SigmaKalon sales for 2008 will be reported as acquisition gains for PPG since we closed on the purchase January 2, 2008. However, on a year over year basis, overall SigmaKalon sales were up double digit percentages aided by favorable currency and low to mid single digit organic growth. Our segment earnings grew by double digit percentages, which is a direct result of the global breadth of our businesses portfolio and the solid performance of our commodity chemical business. Once again, we are proud of our business growth and overall solid performance given today’s economic conditions. Now let me compare our total company results. The next slide provides a recap of our adjusted financial results for both this year and last, excluding the Automotive Glass & Services business results and unusual and one time charges. A detailed reconciliation from our reported results to this recap for both years is available in the appendix of today’s presentation. The results provide a clear illustration of our growth this quarter with our adjusted earnings per share for the quarter of $1.62, which is $0.17 or 12% higher than our prior year results. I will remind you this performance is despite a variety of headwinds including softer economic conditions and higher inflation. Also, although it is not reflected on this slide, let me also comment that our cash generation results are impressive. On a year to date basis we have generated over $350 million of cash from operations which is about 60% higher than last year. As I mentioned earlier, we are very proud of our financial results for the second quarter given the prevailing environment as they reflect the strength of our business portfolio and also demonstrate in a clear and measurable fashion the success of our past strategic actions. Now let’s review some of the details. Looking quickly at our sales results by region, our sales in the United States and Canada grew by 5%, with 4% price gains and 1% due to Canadian currency. We experienced flat volumes in the quarter in the United States and Canada. As I mentioned previously, the US automotive OEM and US architectural paint end markets in this region were very weak and our businesses, while outperforming the end markets, experienced low double digit percentage declines. Meanwhile high volume growth in other businesses, including excellent results in commodity chemicals and optical and specialty materials, provided for a complete offset. Looking ahead into the third quarter, we expect current market conditions to remain and we are not anticipating much volume growth in this region. However, we have a variety of selling price actions either announced or already implemented, and expect higher pricing gains in the third quarter. Moving to the next slide, our European sales grew by just under $1 billion dollars, up 140% primarily due to our SigmaKalon acquisition and currency. We also recorded higher selling prices of about 2%. Once again all SigmaKalon sales, including organic growth versus their 2007 performance, are classified as increases due to acquisition. Again, I will discuss SigmaKalon in detail in a few minutes, but SigmaKalon grew organically low to mid single digit percentages. In the region, our 2% percent selling price increase was supplemented by volumes in the quarter which rose by 1%. Of note and illustrated in the trend graph, our second quarter comparables from both 2007 and 2006 were exceedingly difficult. Obviously we are pleased in maintaining our cumulative gains from these prior years. We are anticipating some moderation of overall economic growth in Europe in the third quarter, which is historically a seasonally slower quarter in Europe. However, we expect our year over year performance to remain fairly similar to the second quarter. Similar to the United States, we also have current pricing initiatives in this region which will provide benefits during the third quarter. Our Asian results are detailed on the next slide and our overall sales are up about 80% this year. Our quarterly sales in this region were right at $500 million, up over 325% from just two years ago providing a quantification of the rapid and material growth we are driving in this region. Also, this region remains one of the best in terms of operating margins. Acquisitions were a sizable component of this growth, but our sustained growth in volumes in this region continued, advancing 14%. Prices added an additional 1% to our organic results. Each of our coatings businesses in the region is contributing towards our solid volume performance, and despite transportation changes in certain areas in China ahead of the 2008 Summer Olympics, we expect commensurate performance next quarter due to the continuation of strong demand in the broad end markets that we serve. Now before I discuss each of our business segments, let me discuss a few macro topics. As detailed on the next slide, the rising cost of energy and raw materials remains a dominant topic globally. In the quarter, our primary energy cost, natural gas, inflated to about $10.50 per unit, compared with just under $7.75 in the second quarter of last year, and $8.50 in the first quarter of this year. For those of you less familiar with PPG, we use 60 to 70 trillion BTUs of natural gas a year that generate power for the production of chlorine and caustic soda, and to produce glass and fiber glass. So if natural gas unit costs change by $1.00 per million BTU, our pre tax costs change by about $60 to $70 million on an annual basis. Looking ahead we have about one third of our third quarter gas needs hedged at about $8.50 per million BTU, and current unit market price for the remainder is about $12.00. As a reference point, our third quarter 2007 natural gas costs were about $6.75. We have also experienced inflation in our coatings raw material costs, which include petroleum, based materials, and is by far the largest component of production costs for coatings. Our expectation at the onset of the second quarter was for inflation in the range of 2% to 4% and our actual inflation was slightly over 3%. We communicated a few weeks back that feedstock pressures have elevated further and we expected our third quarter 2008 raw material inflation to be in the range of 4% to 6% and this remains our expectation. It is very important to note that this is a blended rate for all of PPG coatings businesses and geographies. The range differs greatly by geography, with a higher range in the United States, and generally lower ranges outside the United States. As detailed on the pie chart, only about 30% of our coatings sales are in the United States and Canada. In addition to raw materials and direct energy costs, we also experienced continued inflationary pressures in transportation costs and surcharges associated with rising gasoline costs. Our total transportation costs in the quarter increased by an additional $20 million versus last year, an increase of about 20%. Regarding inflation overall, we are not anticipating any easing from the current environment. We have increased our efforts to identify and qualify new and more cost effective sources of raw materials. Also, as I mentioned earlier, our pricing was up 3% this past quarter and our businesses are working to secure further pricing to offset these rising costs. Now before I review our business results in more detail, I typically provide an update on our proposed asbestos settlement. For those not familiar with the details of the proposed settlement, please refer to the disclosures beginning on page 22 of our first quarter 2008 Form 10-Q. As we said in previous updates, we have filed motions asking the court to reconsider, alter or amend its ruling from December, 2006. Also, various parties, including PPG, are currently working toward a third amended plan of reorganization to address issues the court raised in its ruling. While we believe we are closer to a potential resolution this quarter versus last quarter, given the overall complexity of the issue, we are not able to offer any time line upon which any next step will be taken. Now let’s discuss the performance in each of our business segments. The next slide illustrates the results in our Performance Coatings segment. Second quarter sales grew by almost $300 million or 30%. Acquisitions added about 24% growth, currency added 6%, volumes slipped by 2% and price added 2%. Also I will add that regionally, we delivered 20% organic growth in Asia, with each business unit contributing nicely. Our segment earnings were $171 million, up 8% versus the prior year. The acquisition of SigmaKalon’s Protective & Marine Coatings business was nicely accretive to earnings. Also, strong organic volume gains in our legacy Protective & Marine coatings business and Aerospace, along with favorable currency impacts, offset the earnings impact of significantly lower volumes in our United States architectural coatings business. Inflation was mitigated by cost reduction actions and pricing gains. Let me review a few key items in our business units; our Architectural Coatings Americas and Asia business unit grew sales by 9%. This growth was principally due to non-US acquisitions and currency. Our volumes in the United States and Canada were down slightly more than 10%, with declines in all channels. This performance is reflective of the significant residential housing recession and slower home remodeling market. Looking ahead we are not expecting any improvement for, at a minimum, the remainder of 2008 in this end market. Due to cost actions, we minimized the overall earnings impact of the lower volumes, and will continue to manage costs aggressively in the business. In addition, we have already secured and are seeking further selling price increases. In Aerospace, our sales grew 11%, supported by volume and pricing gains, and currency. This remains a solid growth driver and we continue to expect similar performance looking ahead. Our Automotive Refinish sales grew 17% with price, volumes, currency and acquisitions all contributing. As evidenced this quarter, this business is a very reliable contributor, and we anticipate similar consistency in the future. Protective & Marine Coatings was added as a separate business unit in this reportable segment this year, as the SigmaKalon acquisition more than doubled our sales into this end market. In addition to acquisition growth, we also achieved solid organic growth from our base business with both pricing and volume gains. As we mentioned last quarter, sizable growth opportunities remain in the future as the global shipping market and large scale civil infrastructure construction projects served by this business remain robust. To summarize the quarter for this segment, despite lower activity levels in our Architectural Coatings business, we still delivered organic sales growth and posted 8% earnings growth. This performance was due in large part to consistent organic growth in the Aerospace and Protective and Marine businesses, strong Asian growth and nicely accretive acquisition results from the Protective and Marine portion of SigmaKalon which is ahead of our expectations. Moving to the next slide detailing our Industrial Coatings segment, our sales rose by about $200 million or 22%. Similar to last quarter, about half of the gain was due to the acquisition of SigmaKalon’s industrial coatings business with the remainder due to favorable currency, positive volume growth and a slight pricing improvement. By region, we continued to experience headwinds in the United States and Canada with volumes declining about 10%, but that region now only accounts for slightly more than 25% of this segment’s total. We more than offset these negative impacts with organic growth of just under 10% in every one of our other regions, Europe, Asia and Latin America, which combined now account for about 75% of the segment. Our segment earnings were flat reflecting the impact of the rising inflation and a notably weaker US automotive OEM end market. We offset these headwinds with strong results outside the United States and positive SigmaKalon acquisition related earnings. Also of importance is we continued to fund our growth initiatives in key end markets and regions. Let me quickly comment on each of the businesses comprising the Industrial Coatings segment; our Automotive OEM Coatings business grew by 11% and not only set a new second quarter sales record but a new record for any quarter. Currency added 8% and pricing was flat. Volumes were up 3% despite severely negative results in the US and Canadian market, a region which represents about 30% of the business unit sales. Our non-US regions averaged double digit percentage growth in recognition of our strong customer base and overall global growth in the industry. We continue to communicate to the equity markets the growth performance and overall strength of the global auto OEM industry, and our results this quarter provide yet another measurable milepost of this. However, we remain convinced that the global growth potential is vastly misunderstood and incorrectly valued by the equity markets. Industrial Coatings business unit sales improved by 44% with the SigmaKalon acquisition the main contributor of the growth. Overall volumes were flat, as softer US volumes, which approached double digit percentage declines, were offset by solid growth in all other regions. Packaging Coatings sales grew by 15% with currency the main factor, although volumes and price also contributed. Overall our Industrial Coatings segment results truly reflect the geographic diversity of the segment as we were able to offset appreciably lower US market results. Looking ahead we expect generally similar results in all regions in the third quarter. Our next slide is Architectural Europe, Middle East and Africa or EMEA, and it represents about three quarters of the acquired SigmaKalon business. Segment sales in a seasonally strong quarter were $667 million. Excluding positive currency impacts, sales grew by low to mid single digit percentages versus pre-acquisition SigmaKalon results last year, reflecting continued organic growth in several regions. Earnings for the segment were $71 million. These earnings include the majority of the $20 million quarterly, non-cash amortization of intangibles stemming from the acquisition. In addition, this segment incurs about $20 million of non-cash depreciation per quarter as well. This business remains very healthy and is well ahead of their strong 2007 financial performance. While construction activities in a few countries in Europe, such as Spain, Ireland, Italy and the UK, are slowing, we generally and historically have very minimal participation in most of these regions. The UK is a market in which we do participate and our year to date sales into that market are flat. Based on our geographic footprint, including strong positions in several Eastern European countries, we anticipate the overall business will continue to post good results in the third quarter. Now let me take this opportunity to provide you with a mid year update on the overall SigmaKalon acquisition. This update includes our Architectural EMEA business, along with the SigmaKalon businesses which we merged into our Industrial and Performance Coatings segments. As we mentioned previously, during the first quarter we secured permanent debt financing within the interest rate guidance we set forth last November. Also, our integration efforts are on schedule and we remain on our target to achieve roughly $50 million of cost synergies this year. On top of that we have through the first two quarters of the year achieved an additional $20 to $40 million of raw material cost mitigation due to our enhanced purchasing power. Looking at combined operating financial results from all businesses, I am happy to report that we are exceeding our original 2008 financial targets at mid year due to strong performance in all three business segments, and this does not include the $20 to 40 million in raw material cost mitigation I just mentioned. So obviously, we are very pleased with the performance of this acquired business. It is a core element of our successful financial performance this year and also of our growth moving forward. Shifting to our Optical and Specialty Materials segment on the next slide, our next generation Transitions VI lens product which we introduced in the United States at the onset of this year continues to drive strong sales growth. In addition, our Specialty Materials businesses posted solid sales gains as well. Segment earnings improved 7% driven by volume growth in Optical and higher segment pricing which offset inflation in our Specialty Materials businesses due to higher raw material costs along with higher advertising spending at Transitions Optical. Segment operating margins were 25%. Looking ahead, we are accelerating to the fourth quarter of this year the roll out of our new generation Transition Optical VI lens product in certain European countries. We will likely incur slightly higher year over year ad spending in the third quarter, but also anticipate strong year over year sales gains during the quarter. Shifting to the next slide detailing our Commodity Chemicals segment, sales increased by about 30% to a new quarterly record. Volumes and price contributed equally to the sales gain. Segment earnings improved by about 20% with favorable manufacturing and overhead cost performance contributing to the volume gains. Meanwhile, natural gas, ethylene and freight costs experienced significant year over year inflation, which equally offset higher pricing. Toward quarter end we declared force majeure due to a weather related incident which reduced production capacity at our largest chlor-alkali facility and strained our inventory levels. We were able to continue to manage our order book. However we are carrying a significant backlog. We expect our low inventory position to continue into the third quarter, compounded by river transportation issues due to the flooding in the Midwest. Also, price increases have been announced for select products for the third quarter. Our next business segment slide details our Glass segment. During the quarter, our reported sales, including Automotive Glass and Services, were flat. Positive currency equally offset negative volumes. Earnings in the segment declined by about $20 million due to lower volumes and higher inflation, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs. Looking at results by business unit; Performance Glazing sales improved 9% due to positive volumes, price and currency. Volumes are up over 5% as similar to last quarter, continued weaker sales to the residential market were more than offset by higher commercial construction market sales. Fiber Glass sales advanced slightly as favorable currency and price offset weaker volumes. Automotive Glass and Services sales were down due to lower volumes. This segment continues to face challenging end market conditions and higher input costs. We will continue to aggressively manage costs in this business. Also, as noted earlier, we signed a sales agreement for the controlling interest in our Automotive Glass and Services business and expect that transaction to close in the third quarter. Now let’s move to our cash results. The next slide details our prioritized cash uses, which most of you have heard us discuss for some time. For the quarter we generated over $300 million in cash from operations. On a year to date basis our cash from operations exceeds $350 million and is more than $125 million or about 60% ahead of last year’s pace. Our uses of cash through the first six months are as follows; year to date we have spent approximately $150 million on organic capital spending, excluding acquisitions necessary to keep the businesses healthy and competitive. Our dividend payments year to date totaled about $170 million, up 4% over last year. Regarding debt, we increased our debt by about $1.5 billion in the first quarter to partially finance the SigmaKalon acquisition. Since the beginning of the year, we repaid about $250 million of debt from cash from operations. Separately regarding the pensions, it is likely we will make pre-tax contributions of about $100 million this year. Next are acquisitions, and outside of SigmaKalon we have not completed any sizable acquisition this year. We use share repurchases for any excess cash, and through the second quarter our focus remained to offset dilution from option exercises. I will conclude our cash discussion by commenting that we are delivering, once again, strong performance in cash generation. We have been and will remain focused on balancing our uses of cash with overriding goals to strengthen and grow our businesses and provide for sustainable earnings growth opportunities for the benefit of our shareholders. Now let me conclude my commentary on our second quarter results by highlighting a few key takeaways from the quarter. As I mentioned at the onset to today’s call, our financial results remain solid with double digit percentage growth in sales, segment earnings and adjusted earnings per share and these results continue to validate the success of our past strategic actions. This success is amplified when considering today’s economic backdrop. Our SigmaKalon acquisition is tracking ahead of our mid year financial performance targets. We continue to advance our transformation strategy, and signed a sales agreement for controlling interest in our Automotive Glass and Services businesses and our cash generation, a PPG hallmark, remains well ahead of a solid prior year figure. In conclusion, as we look ahead we are even more confident in the direction of our company and expect our performance to compare favorably versus our industry groups.
Vince Morales: This concludes the second quarter 2008 financial commentary, featuring comments by William Hernandez, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

===== 2008 Q1  (2008-04-17 08:00:00) =====
Executives: Vince Morales - VP, IR William Hernandez - Senior VP and CFO
Vince Morales: Good morning. This is Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations for PPG Industries. Welcome to PPG’s first quarter 2008 financial commentary. The financial commentary is provided by PPG’s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, William Hernandez. These comments relate to financial information released on Thursday, April 17 2008. Visuals supporting this briefing may be accessed through the investor center on the PPG website at www.ppg.com. As shown on Slide number 2, the following presentation contains forward-looking statements reflecting on the company's current view about future events and their potential effect on PPG's operating and financial performance. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could affect the company's operations and financial results, and as discussed in PPG Industries filings with the SEC, may cause actual results to differ from such forward-looking statements. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the company has provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures on Slide number 9 of the visuals supporting this briefing. And now let me introduce PPG’s Senior Vice President and CFO, William Hernandez.
William Hernandez: Good morning and thank you for your time and interest in PPG. I will review PPG’s first quarter 2008 performance, and comment on various industry and economic trends that are impacting our performance. If you turn to Slide 3, let me quickly recap the quarter. Our sales from continuing operations were $3.7 billion, up over 40% from last year, easily establishing a new PPG record for any quarter in the company’s history. For 20 consecutive quarters, or five years in a row, we have delivered a year-over-year quarterly sales record. Our acquisition of SigmaKalon represented a sizable portion of our sales gain, but volumes, pricing, and currency were all positive contributors as well. We delivered solid overall volume growth of over 2% in the quarter. As a result of slower economic activity, our US and Canadian volumes were flat. European volumes were down 1%, reflecting, in part, strong comparables last year and a slowing in some European economic segments or regions. We more than offset these slightly lower volume results with very robust growth in Asia and Latin America, each advancing by about 18%. Pricing was an additional positive of 3%, which was our largest quarterly sales price increase since mid-2006. Also, currency added about 6% to sales. Regarding the SigmaKalon acquisition, integration is going very well and the business has continued to grow. Although we report all the 2008 SigmaKalon sales as acquisition gains for PPG, on a year-over-year basis, excluding currency gains, overall sales were up low-to-mid single digit percentages. Also, as we communicated earlier during the quarter, we recognized $117 million in pre-tax, non-recurring acquisition related costs, and we finalized our long-term financing of the deal. I will discuss specifics regarding the acquisition in a few moments. Our earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter were $0.53, which included a $0.54 reduction related to the non-recurring acquisition costs I just mentioned. First quarter 2007 earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.06, which included a $0.03 reduction relating to our proposed asbestos settlement. Our adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.07 in 2008 versus $1.09 in 2007. Of note when comparing these figures is a net unfavorable impact of $0.07 in 2008 due to non-recurring tax items in both years. A key measure of our business growth is our total segment earnings, which increased by 17% versus last year. Regarding cash; our cash from operations increased by about a $150 million versus the first quarter of 2007. To quickly recap our performance, we are very pleased with our organic growth and double-digit segment earnings growth, especially in the light of today's economic backdrop. This performance provides a clear measure of the success of our prior actions taken to expand our geographic footprint and broaden our end market served, which has resulted in a stronger, more resilient company. Also, we are delivering on our commitments relative to the SigmaKalon acquisition. Finally, we remain focused on increasing even further our historically strong cash generation with a primary use of this cash in the near term to grow our earnings through the paying down of our debt. Now, let's review some of the details. The next slide illustrates our new geographic mix of sales. As displayed, we have excellent geographic diversity. Of note is that our sales in the United States and Canada have segued from nearly 75% of our total reported just two years ago, to about 45% today. Our total coatings sales are even more diverse with the US and Canada accounting for about 30% percent of our total. Western Europe accounts for about 40%, and combined the emerging regions of Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America now account for about 30%. Our past strategic actions have provided us with this broad geographic distribution, which enables us to take advantage of regional growth and also minimize the impact of economic slowing in any individual region. The next slide provides details on PPG’s organic volume trend. This was our ninth consecutive quarter of positive volume growth, but our growth slowed from the prior year’s trend. Factored into the slower rate of growth were a variety of headwinds this past quarter, including the weakening US economy, a major supplier strike which impacted General Motors production in the United States, and a shift of the Easter holiday into the first quarter this year. Our strong growth in the Asian and Latin American regions, and in businesses such as Optical and Aerospace, more than offset the impact of these headwinds. The following slide shows our volume trend in Europe. Volumes were down slightly this year due to some slowing in Western Europe combined with some difficult comparables from solid growth in several businesses the past two years as evidenced by the chart. These comparables included strong 2007 results in Automotive Refinish, bolstered by customer conversions to our new water-based product last year, following government regulations eliminating solvent-based product. Our SigmaKalon results are not included in this chart, as all their sales are classified as acquisition sales. However, as noted earlier, our Architectural EMEA business, which represents the major portion of the acquired SigmaKalon business, enjoyed low-to-mid single-digit percentage growth versus 2007, exclusive of currency gains. Next is a slide detailing our Asian volume performance. Once again, our comparables were exceedingly difficult, and once again we have grown by double-digit percentages. Our 18% growth was our best performance in the past four years, despite a much larger sales base and frankly excellent performance in many of the previous quarters. Our total sales in this region are more than three times what they were just two years ago, and are now a very meaningful portion of both sales and earnings for PPG. Now let’s review our overall segment results detailed on the next slide. I will discuss each segment in further detail later, but let me summarize a few key items. Total sales grew over 40%, driven by a 30% gain due to our acquisitions. Favorable currency added about 6% to sales. Despite various headwinds, organic growth was achieved in every segment except Glass, which was down slightly. We established sales records in several segments and most of our individual business units. Segment earnings improved by $56 million, or 17%. Earnings in Performance and Industrial Coatings were level with last year, as growth outside the United States offset lower US results, due to a difficult U.S. economy. Architectural EMEA earnings are all incremental and reflect results for a seasonally slower period for the business. These earnings also include the majority of the $20 million in intangible amortization expense stemming from the acquisition. Optical & Specialty Materials posted a 17% improvement in net earnings, based on strong sales growth stemming from introduction in the United States of our new generation Transitions Optical product. Chlor-Alkali delivered meaningful earnings growth driven by higher pricing, while glass earnings were aided by better Fiber Glass results. Now let’s review our earnings per share results. As depicted on Slide number 9, we reported first quarter earnings per share of $0.61 comprised of earnings from continuing operations, net of tax of $0.53, and earnings from discontinued operations; net of tax of $0.08. The reported net earnings from continuing operations include a reduction of $89 million after-tax, or $0.54 per share, related to non-recurring acquisition-related costs from the flow through cost of sales of the step-up to fair value of the inventory acquired in the SigmaKalon acquisition, and the write-off of in-process research and development costs. The impact of our proposed asbestos settlement on our first quarter results was not material. As noted earlier, our adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.07, which was achieved due to our double-digit segment earnings growth. Last year, our reported first quarter earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.06. This figure included a $0.03 charge related to the asbestos settlement. Our tax rate on continuing operations in the first quarter last year was 23%, and is about 30% in the first quarter of 2008. Tax rates in both years included adjustments due to non-recurring items. The net unfavorable impact of these non-recurring tax items on 2008 earnings-per-share is $0.07, when comparing results versus last year. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax was $13 million or $0.08 per share in the first quarter this year, compared with $18 million and $0.11 per share a year ago. Please refer to Slide number 9 of this presentation on the investor center section of our website for a reconciliation of these adjusted earnings amounts to the comparable GAAP financial measures. Let me now discuss some relevant economic statistics. The next slide provides an overview of either our or Global Insight’s current estimates of relevant economic statistics. I will also provide our outlook for the coming quarter. Year-over-year US GDP growth is estimated to be about 2%, but activity has softened throughout the quarter. This figure differs from the well documented GDP comparison versus the last quarter of 2007, which is expected to be flat or possibly even negative. However, we have historically utilized the year-over-year figure as it is a better proxy for sales comparisons versus last year’s first quarter. Year-over-year GDP growth in Western Europe was also estimated to be about 2%, with Emerging Europe growth estimated to be three times that figure. Meanwhile, GDP in China advanced by about 11%, while Latin America grew by mid single-digit percentages. In the second quarter, we expect growth in the North American economy to slow even more. Exports should continue to provide an economic boost, offset by the drag from higher energy costs, lower consumer spending, and tighter credit markets. We anticipate the economy in Western Europe will continue at a level consistent with the first quarter. Unemployment in Western Europe is at one of its lowest levels in the past decade, but higher inflation and flattening-to-declining results in some sectors continue to mitigate growth advances. Solid growth will continue in Emerging Europe supported by growing infrastructure needs and continued manufacturing expansions. We expect other emerging economies, including China and Latin America, to continue to experience rapid growth. Last, we continue to closely watch two US economic statistics, employment and consumer spending, which at present are close to but not at levels signaling a US recession. Over the past several months, these statistics have continued to drift downward, which has created a contraction of the overall growth rate. We continue to believe these will remain the two most relevant economic figures in today’s economy. Next is automotive production, which, on a global basis continued to advance with mid-single digit percentage gains. In the quarter, North American light vehicle production is estimated to have declined about 6%, due in part to a General Motors supplier strike. Total European vehicle production is estimated to have increased by about 3%, with a 2% decline in Western Europe offset by growth exceeding 15% in Eastern Europe. Asian growth is estimated to have exceeded 20%. Our global automotive OEM coatings business grew organically once again, posting mid-single digit percentage volume gains despite negative US volumes. Our growth is a result of both the global reach of our business and our excellent customer relationships supported by innovative technologies and services. Looking ahead, we again expect global vehicle production growth next quarter, but still anticipate a decline in the US market. Shifting to overall industrial production, we continue to see and benefit from the continued globalization of the industrial base. North American industrial production improved by about 1% year-over-year. Western Europe is estimated to have produced growth of about 3%. China is expected to have grown by nearly 15%. I will remind you that both a shift in the Easter holiday and, specific to the US, the GM supplier strike weighed on the quarter’s results. Our industry projections in the US for next quarter are for slower growth year-over-year, but up slightly sequentially. Finally, in the construction markets, the US commercial and residential construction markets moved once again in drastically opposite directions. Residential construction softened even further, contracting by about 30% year-over-year. Conversely, commercial construction has grown by more than 10% over the same period. Looking ahead, we are not anticipating any recovery in the US housing market in the near term. Regarding commercial construction, there is anecdotal evidence of certain sub-segments hitting a plateau, while other sub-segments continue to grow nicely. While our organic North American architectural business results have outpaced the combined market, this has, and will remain, a very challenging environment. Let me conclude our economic discussion by mentioning that we have evidenced notable contraction in several US economic sectors, including residential housing and automotive production. Both of these US segments are already in recession, and have been for some time. We are working hard to effectively manage our businesses serving these markets. At the same time, we have continued to benefit from growth in other economic segments such as Aerospace, along with broad industrial growth supporting higher exports. There is no question that the US economy is, at a minimum, flirting with an overall recession. However, our past strategic actions to significantly change our geographic footprint and broaden our end-markets served, have allowed PPG to continue to grow despite the US economic slowdown. While there will likely be some contagion in other regions from the weakening US economy, for PPG we expect continued growth in these other regions to more than offset any negative US impacts. We have years of experience managing the ups and downs of the business cycle. If the US economy does slip into a potentially prolonged recession, we will manage our businesses appropriately, with the intent of minimizing any impacts to PPG and our shareholders. Now, moving to Slide 11 let me discuss a few other key topics. Energy costs remain a focal issue. In the quarter, our primary energy cost, natural gas, inflated to $8.50 per unit, up from a comparative of $7.50 in both the first and fourth quarters of last year. For those of you less familiar with PPG, we use 60 trillion to 70 trillion BTUs of natural gas a year to generate power for the production of chlorine and caustic soda, and to produce glass and fiber glass. So, if natural gas unit costs change by $1 per million BTU, our pre-tax costs changed by about $60 million to $70 million on an annual basis. We have also experienced increases in our coatings raw material costs, which includes petroleum-based materials, and is by far the largest component of production costs for coatings. Our expectation at the outset of the quarter was for inflation in the range of 2% to 4%, and our actual inflation was right at 2%. In addition, we also experienced rapid inflationary impacts in freight costs due primarily to direct costs and surcharges associated with rising gasoline costs. Our total freight cost in the quarter increased by approximately $20 million versus last year, an increase of more than 15%. As we look ahead, the energy markets remain volatile due in part, in our opinion, to speculation. Accordingly, we expect no relief in our energy or freight costs. Regarding natural gas costs, based on pricing at the beginning of the quarter, we have about 30% of our second quarter costs hedged at about $8.75 per million BTU. As a reminder, comparable per unit costs were $8.50 in the first quarter of 2008 and $7.70 in the second quarter of 2007. With respect to coatings raw materials, feedstock pressures will remain, but we expect second quarter inflation to remain within our previously communicated range of 2% to 4%. Our substantial organic growth and acquisitions, geographic diversity, broadening of our supplier base, and ability to reformulate our products have continued to aid us in minimizing these inflationary impacts. As I mentioned earlier, our selling pricing was up 3% this past quarter, which was our largest increase in a few years. But, we did not fully offset these higher costs. Our businesses will continue to work to secure pricing to offset these inflationary items. Now, before I review our business results in more detail, I typically provide an update on our proposed asbestos settlement. For those not familiar with the details of the proposed settlement, please refer to the disclosures beginning on page 58 of our 2007 form 10-K. As we said in previous updates, we have filed motions asking the court to reconsider, alter, or amend its ruling from December, 2006. Also, various parties, including PPG, are currently working toward a third amended plan of reorganization to address issues the court raised in its ruling. Given the overall complexity of the issue, we are not able to offer any timeline upon which any next step will be taken. Now, let’s discuss our businesses performance. Slide 12 illustrates the results in our Performance Coatings segment. First quarter sales grew by slightly more that $250 million, or about 30%. Acquisitions added about 21% growth, currency added 6%, volumes grew 1% and price added 2%. Our segment earnings were $120 million, comparable to last year. As I will discuss shortly, earnings were negatively impacted by lower volumes in certain regions or businesses, offset by favorable growth elsewhere. Also, the favorable impact of currency offset higher future growth focused costs in certain business, including Protective & Marine Coatings and Automotive Refinish. Let me review a few key items in our business units. Our Architectural Coatings Americas and Asia business unit grew sales by 16%. This growth was principally due to acquisitions and currency, as our total US volumes were down mid-single digits, where we experienced sharp volume declines in our professional channels, both in our company-owned stores and in independent dealers. These lower volumes were partially offset by volume gains in our national accounts or “big-box” channel. Looking ahead, we are not projecting any improvement, and actually may see some further deterioration in this business in the second quarter based on continued end market weakness. We have been, and will remain, diligent on managing our costs, and are focused on pricing to offset raw material increases. In Aerospace, our excellent double-digit growth continued with sales improving by 12%, supported by volume and pricing gains, and currency. This is one of our strongest end-markets, and we expect it to remain strong in the foreseeable future. Our Automotive Refinish sales grew by 14%, driven by both currency and acquisitions. Pricing was also up, offsetting slight volumes declines. These volume declines were driven by lower European volumes, based on a strong comparable from last year. We anticipate this business will deliver both positive pricing and volumes in the second quarter. We added this year our Protective & Marine Coatings business unit to this segment, as the SigmaKalon acquisition more than doubled our sales into this end-market. In addition to the acquisition gains, we also experienced organic growth from our base business with pricing gains and double-digit volume gains. Similar to Aerospace, sizable growth opportunities remain due to the robust end-markets served by this business. To summarize the quarter for this segment, our organic growth in Aerospace and Protective & Marine allowed us to absorb and offset the impacts of lower activity levels elsewhere. Additionally, we were able to invest in future growth initiatives, which will begin to provide benefits as early as next quarter. Last, our acquisitions are meeting our expectations and also provide another basis for additional growth in the future. Moving to the next slide detailing our Industrial Coatings segment; our sales rose by just under $190 million, or 22%. About half of the gain was due to the acquisition of SigmaKalon’s Industrial Coatings business. The remainder of the increase was due to favorable currency and positive volume growth in all businesses. This segment has our greatest geographic diversity. We continue to experience headwinds in the US and Canada, with volumes declining high-single digits, but that region now accounts for less than 30% of the segment total. We more than offset these negative impacts with very strong organic growth in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. Combined, these regions averaged a robust 10% volume growth, and account for 70% of the segment. Our segment earnings were flat, reflecting the impact of the weaker US market and higher inflation, offset by strong results in our Non-US regions and positive acquisition related earnings. Let me quickly comment on each of the businesses comprising the Industrial Coatings segment. Our Automotive OEM Coatings business grew by 13%, and set a new first quarter sales record, despite the negative impact of the US General Motors supplier strike and the calendar impact of the Easter holiday. Volume increases of 4%, once again validated the growth potential of this business, supporting global growth in this end-market. Industrial Coatings business unit sales improved by 41%, with the SigmaKalon acquisition contributing about three-fourth of that growth. Overall volumes grew slightly, despite US volumes which were down by about 10%, as double-digit percentage growth was achieved in emerging regions. Packaging Coatings sales grew by 14% with currency the main factor, although volumes and price also contributed. Overall our Industrial Coatings segment results truly reflect the geographic diversity of this segment, as we were able to offset appreciably lower US market results. Looking ahead, we expect a continuation of the current market conditions in all of these regions. Our next segment is Architectural Europe, Middle East, and Africa or EMEA, and it represents about three-quarters of the acquired SigmaKalon business. Segment sales in a seasonally slow quarter were $536 million. Excluding positive currency impacts, sales grew by low-to-mid single digit percentages versus SigmaKalon results last year, reflecting continued organic growth in several regions. Earnings for the segment were $9 million, which included a reduction of earnings associated with the majority of the $20 million non-cash intangible amortization stemming from the acquisition. We mentioned previously that the first quarter was a seasonally slow quarter for this segment, with 15% to 20% of annual sales and about 10% to 15% of the annual earnings in this quarter. Historically, the second quarter represents 30% to 35% of the annual totals, which will result in a material sales and earnings increase versus the first quarter. Also, I will quickly comment on the overall SigmaKalon integration which is going extremely well. I have been very impressed with the energy and enthusiasm exhibited by both our existing and our new colleagues. And, despite a fairly volatile credit market, we were successful during the quarter in placing our permanent financing within in the interest rate range we previously stipulated upon announcing the deal last July. Last, we remain on target to achieve our full year 2008 cost synergy target of $25 million to $75 million, with measurable progress already achieved this past quarter despite this being the first quarter of integration. Shifting to our Optical and Specialty Materials segment on Slide 15, we once again delivered record sales supported by the introduction of our new generation Transitions Optical product. Segment earnings improved 17%, driven by volume growth in Optical which offset lower earnings in our Specialty businesses due to higher raw material costs. Segment operating margins remained in the mid-20s. Looking ahead, we will likely experience additional increases in our Specialty businesses input costs, but are very pleased with the excitement and growth rates driven by our new Transitions technology and anticipate this carrying forward into next quarter. Shifting to the next slide detailing our Commodity Chemicals segment, sales increased by about 14% to a new first quarter record. Most of the sales gain was due to positive pricing, which has been on an upward trend since the beginning of 2007, as customer demand remained strong. Earnings in the segment improved by over 50%, with favorable manufacturing performance adding to the price gains. Meanwhile, natural gas, ethylene, and freight costs experienced significant year-over-year inflation, which acted to moderate the earnings improvement. Price increases have been announced for select products for the second quarter. Also, we are planning on some minor maintenance outages, which will impact our production volumes. Slide 17 details our Glass segment. During the quarter, our sales grew by 3%, driven primarily by currency gains. Positive pricing did not fully offset volumes which were down 2%. Earnings in this segment improved by $13 million, driven by improved manufacturing. The absence of our prior year joint venture write-down was offset by higher inflation, including natural gas. Looking at results by business unit. Performance Glazings sales improved 5% due to positive volumes, price, and currency. Volume growth continued as weaker sales to the residential market were more than offset by higher commercial construction market sales. Fiber Glass sales advanced slightly as favorable currency offset weaker volumes. This segment continues to face challenging market conditions and higher input costs. As our improved manufacturing results indicate, we have, and will continue, to manage costs in this business very aggressively. Now, let’s move to our cash uses during the quarter. Slide 18 details our prioritized cash uses, which most of you have heard us discuss for some time. We generated roughly $50 million in cash from operations this quarter, which is an increase of $150 million versus last year. Our prioritized use of cash remains balanced, and are as follows: First, is prudently funding our businesses through organic capital spending necessary to keep the businesses healthy and competitive. We spent $90 million, excluding acquisitions, in the quarter. Our annual target remains about 4% of sales. Next, we once again rewarded shareholders in the form of dividends and our payout was up 4% over last year. Regarding debt, our debt-to-capital is about 50%, reflecting the increased debt related to the SigmaKalon acquisition. The total debt at the end of the quarter associated with the final acquisition financing is about $3.1 billion. This includes the $1.5 billion related to our senior note issuance completed during the quarter. Our intentions remain to pay down an average of $250 million to $450 million per year in 2008 through 2010. Debt payments this year will occur later in the year. With respect to pensions, it is likely we will make contributions ranging from $100 million to $200 million this year. Next on our list are acquisitions, and while we are reviewing potential acquisitions, any we make this year will likely be fairly small. Our last prioritized use of cash is share repurchases, and it is likely any buybacks completed this year will be done with the intention of offsetting dilution. Let me conclude our cash discussion by reiterating that our overriding goals for our cash deployment remain to strengthen our businesses and provide for sustainable earnings growth opportunities for the benefit of our shareholders. Now, let me conclude my commentary on our first quarter results by highlighting a few key takeaways. We have substantially increased our penetration into the Global Coatings market, with an increase in total coatings sales of 57%. Also, our Optical and Specialty Materials segment grew sales by 18%. This is significant growth in our core business segments, which has, and will, continue to benefit PPG. Our past strategic actions to build a globally diverse Coatings and Optical and Specialty Materials company are now paying dividends. We have increased our share of the coatings market in each major region of the world, which makes us a more resilient company as evidenced this quarter. Equally important is that these sizable beachheads outside of North America also provide for future growth. We remain focused on continuing to solidify our portfolio. Obviously, the successful integration and delivering of value from our recent acquisitions, including SigmaKalon, remains a focal point. Additionally, our intentions remain to sell our Automotive Glass and Services business this year. Last, we are not resting on our heritage of strong cash generation. We have sharpened our focus in this area once again, and expect even further improvements in this hallmark of PPG performance. The additional cash we generate will be utilized to grow earnings, initially through the payment of debt. In conclusion, given the economic backdrop, we are pleased to deliver sales and double-digit segment earnings growth, supplemented by the positive performance of our acquisitions. Our geographic diversity and broad customer and end-market coverage have been and will remain key contributors despite slowing economic sectors or regions and high inflation rates. We remain confident in our ability to grow in today’s environment due to our past actions, while concurrently laying the foundation and investing for tomorrow.

Operator: (Operator Instructions) Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the fourth quarter 2007 PPG Industries earnings conference call. My name is Stacey and I will be your moderator for today. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question and answer session towards the end of the conference. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today, Mr. Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations for PPG Industries.
Vince Morales: Good morning. My name is Vince Morales, Vice President of Investor Relations for PPG Industries and I would like to welcome you to PPG’s 2007 fourth quarter and full year financial commentary. Joining me on our call today is Chuck Bunch, Chairman and CEO; and Bill Hernandez, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. [Inaudible] supporting today’s briefing may be accessed through our investor center on the PPG website at www.ppg.com. Turning to slide number two, please note that parts of today’s presentation contain forward-looking statements reflecting the company’s current view about future events and their potential effect on operating and financial performance. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could affect the company’s operations and financial results as discussed in PPG Industries filings with the SEC and I would refer you to the Safe Harbor Statement therein. Now if you turn to slide number three, let me introduce PPG’s Chairman and CEO, Chuck Bunch.
Charles Bunch:  Thank you, Vince. Welcome everyone and thank you for joining us on today’s call. I will make a few opening remarks, then Bill Hernandez will review our fourth quarter and full year financial performance. I will then highlight the accomplishments of some of our businesses, discuss several strategic achievements, and provide our current perspectives on 2008. Regarding our fourth quarter, we are proud of our financial performance and our growth in the face of a difficult economic environment. In the quarter we posted our best organic volume results in three years with growth above 5%. Bill and I will comment on a few of our actions that allowed us to excel in the fourth quarter and for the full year in just a few moments. However, before we do that let me just say that for 2007, while we did perform well our financial results are just one measurement of our success. Just as our past strategic actions paved the way for a successful 2007, during this past year we took additional, even more decisive steps including the SigmaKalon acquisition that we expect will benefit the company for years to come. Here are just a few of the key 2007 accomplishments you will hear about in today’s call. We delivered meaningful growth in sales and earnings and did so by successfully executing in all our businesses. This execution was even more critical this past year given the economic back drop that was a major contributor leading to our strong financial performance. Next, we continued to significantly grow the core business segments of coatings and optical and specialty materials. Which combined, grew by 17%. Also exiting 2007, these core segments approached 80% of our segment sales and earnings. Also of significant importance, we again rewarded our shareholders with two dividend increases during the past year.  Strategically during the year we took several decisive steps to shape the company’s future. Following up on our dozen or so acquisitions in 2006, we completed several additional coatings acquisitions in 2007 which further extended our global footprint. We truly accelerated our transformation by acquiring SigmaKalon, a transaction we finalized on January 2, 2008. We expect this acquisition to grow our coating sales by an additional 40% in 2008 versus 2007. And will provide PPG with one of the broadest geographic reaches of any coatings company in the world. In 2008 less than 50% of our segment sales will be in the United States and Canada, down from the 70% we reported at the end of 2006.  We also made decisions to divest our automotive glass and services, and fine chemicals businesses as we transform our portfolio. We completed the sale of the fine chemicals business in the fourth quarter. And while our automotive glass business sale was not finalized as we had expected our intent remains to divest this business in 2008. These were just a few highlights from this past year and we will review some additional details throughout the call. Before turning it over to Bill, let me reiterate that in 2007, we delivered strong financial performance, and of equal importance made considerable progress in shaping our company’s future. And now if you would please go to slide number four, here is Bill Hernandez.
William H. Hernandez: Thanks, Chuck. Let me review a few financial highlights. For the fourth quarter and full year, we achieved new, all-time sales records. Our fourth quarter segment sales grew by 15%, with organic volume growth the largest contributor. Our full year results are up about 14%, also due to solid organic growth as well as the performance of our acquisitions and currency. Fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations improved by 30% versus the prior year and were a new all time fourth quarter record. As a reminder our earnings per share was up about 16% in the third quarter, so we have continued to perform well even in today’s slowing economy. Our full year earnings per share were also an all time record for the company. For the full year, we again generated $1 billion of cash from operations. And during the year we raised our dividend twice, making 2007 the 36th consecutive year in which we increased our shareholder payments. We are obviously very please with these overall results. But equally important is the fact that several of our year-over-year financial comparisons have become more positive throughout the year despite a more challenging economic backdrop. These improving trends provide us with measurable proof of both the soundness of our strategies and the extent to which we have successfully implemented them. Now let me review some of the details. Our fourth quarter and full year sales results are illustrated on slide number five. As I mentioned, our overall sales increased 15% to a new all time fourth quarter record. Each business segment delivered sales growth of at least 10%, with our organic line growth leading the way. We will review some additional segment details later. For the full year, we grew sales by about 14% to a new all time annual record. We once again achieved double-digit percentage growth in both of our coating segments, and our optical and specialty materials segments. We also are pleased by the fact that we stretched even further our global presence, including continued rapid and profitable growth in the emerging regions. Now, as I mentioned, the largest factor in our fourth quarter sales increase was our organic volume growth. As depicted on slide number six, our organic volume growth has continued to accelerate during the year despite a deceleration in the overall economy. Our fourth quarter volumes improved by over 5%, our best quarterly growth in three years. These gains were broad-based, as not only did every single business segment improve but ten of our eleven individual business units posted positive volume growth. With the one remaining business unit posting essentially flat results.  From a geographic perspective, our results were also impressive with each region contributing nicely. Our volume growth in the United States and Canada was up 5%. Also, we continue to grow rapidly in the emerging regions, with double-digit percentage growth in Asia and Latin America despite difficult comparison periods. Now let me discuss how we translated these results into earnings. As [levels] on slide number seven, our reported fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.17, which includes a charge of $0.01 for a proposed asbestos settlement. This level represents a 30% increase over last year’s figure of $0.90, which included a $0.02 reduction for the asbestos settlement. Supporting this improvement were higher operating earnings in each one of our business segments, which in total grew by 14%.  Our earnings per share also benefited by $0.04 [store] in the quarter as a result of lower taxes stemming from the Canadian government reducing it’s federal corporate income tax rate. Our total PPG earnings per share were $1.21 in the quarter, which included $0.04 stemming from our discontinued operations of fine chemicals and automotive glass and services. Let me discuss a few details regarding our strong business segment performance. I will attempt to cover this quickly to leave sufficient time for questions. As slide eight shows, our performance coatings segment quarterly sales improved by 22%. Once again with strong volume growth led by our aerospace and refinish businesses, and the impact from our Ratner and Barloworld acquisitions.  Quarterly earnings improved to $143 million or 7%. On a full year basis we grew the segment sales by just less than 25%, with about half relating to the acquisitions. While our 2007 acquisitions were not expected to be accretive in 2007, they will be in 2008. Our segment earnings improved by 10% year-over-year due in part to the performance of our 2006 acquisitions. Some business unit highlights, our aerospace business volumes grew by 15% in the quarter and 13% for the full year, with the gains accelerating throughout the year, which certainly bodes well heading into 2008.  The overall North American architectural coatings market remained a challenge. However, as our results indicate we managed this end market very well, our full year volume supplying just 1%, and for each quarter within the year we posted fairly similar year-over-year volume results. And both the quarter and the year, favorable pricing offset the slight volume decline. We expect an equally challenging environment in 2008 and we remain equally focused on execution. Our automotive refinish business remains a key contributor with record performance all around. Our water-based product continues to perform very well in the marketplace and we are realizing continued growth in emerging regions. We expect both of these positive factors to continue in 2008.  Moving to industrial coatings on slide number nine, during the quarter our sales grew 10% supported by continued excellent gains in Europe and the emerging regions, which more than offset lower US volumes. Volume growth in the quarter was 3% with automotive OEM coatings being the biggest contributor. For the full year sales grew 13% and earnings grew 6%. As detailed on the chart, for the year we continue to broaden our geographic presence. Our US volumes were down mid-single digits, reflecting several slower industrial economic sectors. However, our largest region, Europe grew by just under 20%. With just more than half of that due to currency and just less than half due to organic growth. Also Asian sales continue to grow significantly, improving by more than 40%. For the full year our automotive OEM coatings business unit achieved 6% volume growth. This growth was broad based with each region delivering positive results. Our footprint in this business is truly global in nature, with the United States and Canada representing only about one-third of the unit’s sales. Also as detailed on the chart, in North America we once again delivered growth in this difficult market and outpaced the total North American automotive industry which declined. Similar to 2007, we expect the total global automotive market to grow once again in 2008. And as our results continue to indicate this remains a growth platform for PPG. Our optical and specialty materials results are detailed on slide number ten. Our fourth quarter sales grew by about 14%, mostly due to volume gains. One item of significant note is during the quarter our customers worked to deplete their inventory of our transition lenses Generation V product as Generation VI will be available in the United States on February 1st.  Earnings in the quarter were up 5% versus the prior year. However we recorded an additional $9 million of advertising costs versus last year. Most of which was to drive volume growth initiatives in all regions including our Generation products. For the full year sales were up 14% in the segment and earnings improved by 8%.  We are very optimistic about 2008, given the launch of our new Generation into the marketplace. As illustrated on slide eleven, our commodity chemicals business realized 14% sales growth in the quarter aided by solid cost of sales and a healthy export market. Earnings improved by more than 50% versus the prior year. Our full year sales reached an all time record for the business as ECU prices have remained relatively stable during the year and actually the past 18 months. Full year earnings were down 15% but as detailed on the graph, they have trended above prior year results for the past two quarters.  The recent trends carrying us into 2008 are that we announced a price increase mid-way through the fourth quarter and our fourth quarter capacity utilization was our second highest out of the past eight quarters.  Moving to slide twelve, our quarterly glass segment sales improved by 10% as our performance glazings and fiber glass businesses delivered at or just below 10% volume growth. Earnings also improved nicely growing 40%, due in large part to better fiber glass operating margins. Full year sales were up 3%. While earnings were off 9%, primarily due to lower year-over-year earnings in the first half of the year predominately in performance glazings, reflecting a competitive end market. As detailed on the chart, our year-over-year performance has improved throughout 2007. However, heading into 2008 these remain very competitive industries.  To summarize, we had an excellent fourth quarter with sales growing 15% and earnings per share growing 30%. For the full year we achieved combined sales growth of 17% in our coatings and optical and specialty materials segments. And that growth was consistent and growing throughout the year.  Let me conclude my comments with a discussion on cash. Our long track record of consistently generating cash continues and as detailed on slide thirteen, our cash deployment remains balanced. For the year, we again generated $1 million in cash from operations, which includes a reduction of $100 million for voluntary US pension fund contribution. We have remained consistent in our prioritized uses of cash with the overriding goals of strengthening our businesses, and providing sustainable benefits to our shareholders. We have balanced these uses in 2007, spending just under $600 million to strengthen our businesses and returning just over $600 million to shareholders.  To strengthen our businesses our 2007 organic capital spending, excluding acquisitions was about $350 million, within our perennial target of 3-4% of sales. And in terms of acquisitions to grow our businesses, we spent about $225 million in 2007.  PPG has paid uninterrupted dividends for 108 years and in 2007, we once again rewarded our shareholders by raising our dividends twice. We paid $335 million in dividends and this marked the 36th consecutive year of increasing dividend payments, a heritage that we are very proud to continue. Also in 2007, we spent just about $275 million in repurchasing a little under 3.7 million shares of PPG stock. We currently have just below four million shares remaining on our current board authorized share repurchase program. Remarkably after completing all of these activities, our year end cash balance was about $525 million, $75 million higher than the previous year.  Now let me turn the call back over to Chuck.
Charles Bunch: Thanks, Bill. At our New York investor day in November, we talked about transforming PPG and several of the actions we are taking to accelerate this transformation. One of our key objectives in transforming PPG has been to drive profitable organic growth.  The two charts on slide 14 illustrate our 2007 results as they relate to this goal. As you can see on the left chart, for each business segment we have delivered solid volume growth results. And as Bill described, our total results actually improved as the year progressed.  The chart on the right provides similar details by geography and for some of the specific business units that have either faced difficult market conditions, or where we received many questions from some of you in the equity markets. Bill discussed our growing aerospace results earlier and in regards to automotive OEM coatings, he also stated that we have continued to post positive results. And we now have a five year trend of outperforming the US industry metrics. We have stated for a long time that the automotive OEM coatings business remains a growth platform for us. And once again our US and global results provide measurable proof of that.  Meanwhile despite a very challenging residential construction market, our North American architectural coatings and our performance glazings or architectural glass businesses have performed admirably due to our focus on operational excellence and a broad range of value added products and innovative customer relationships. Geographically each major region has contributed nicely. Our ability to deliver this organic growth performance both in total and within the individual businesses is a direct result of our execution and leading technologies and services. Slide 15 shows the results of our next strategic objective, which is to focus on the emerging regions. Our growth here this past year was substantial, with each of these regions growing by nearly 50%. This performance is noteworthy because combined these regions are now a meaningful portion of our portfolio accounting for 20% of our total. And growth rates in these regions will likely remain well above the growth rates in more mature regions of the world. On slide number 16, let me conclude our transformation update by discussing SigmaKalon. The acquisition of SigmaKalon provides us with additional earning stability and even more consistent and much higher on going cash flow. It adds significantly to the core of our company and as detailed on the chart, enhances our overall global presence further minimizing the impact of any one region. Certainly in 2008 a major focus for the corporation will be the successful integration of SigmaKalon. And even though the closing was just a few weeks ago, we are now fully engaged in the integration process.  Like PPG, SigmaKalon also had a very successful 2007 and their results exceeded all of our projections. Based on SigmaKalon 2007 financial results and PPG’s successful financing and currency activities for this transaction, we paid a multiple of less than nine times 2007 EBIDA to acquire this business. This is certainly a very reasonable price given the quality of these assets.  As previously announced, we are creating a separate reporting unit, architectural coatings EMEA for SigmaKalon’s architectural paint business in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, which represents roughly three-quarters of the acquired sales. We are doing this so that everyone is able to measure the performance of the major business acquired in the largest acquisition in our company’s history. In November, we also provided a variety of financial projections with admirably wide ranges since we had not yet closed on the transaction and did not have access to some of the detail financial information given we were still competitors. These ranges related to intangible amortization, interest cost, and acquisition related cost. We don’t yet have any updated guidance on the one-time acquisition cost but will provide clear detail of these costs this year as we announce our quarterly earnings.  Regarding the interest cost, we anticipate first quarter incremental interest will be around $40 million versus the fourth quarter of 2007. We are currently using interim financing and permanent financing will be in place sometime in 2008. Regarding the non-cash intangible amortization, progress has been made in this complex area. We now estimate that the amortization in the first quarter will be $20 million. This could be revised as our purchase accounting is finalized later this year, but we are not currently expecting any adjustments to be material.  Regarding the acquisition, I am happy to report that our integration process is off to a great start. This is an excellent business with strong managers and energized people. And today more than ever, we are confident that this acquisition will provide on going benefits to PPG and its shareholders. Our execution and performance here is obviously one of our most significant tasks this year and will continue to be the focus of our future investor updates. In summary, as you can see, 2007 was a milestone year for PPG financially and strategically. Our financial performance provided continued proof of our abilities to perform well and grow despite external challenges. Strategically we made the most progress in any single year in the company’s history as we continued to position our company for success in today’s and tomorrow’s global economy. We have truly accelerated our transformation and positioned the company to be successful and reward shareholders for years to come. As our performance in 2007 indicates, our past actions have us poised for continued success in 2008 despite the challenges in the economy as we enter the year. And now with the time remaining, we will take any questions that you may have.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with BB&T Capital Markets, please proceed.
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets:  The transcript from this call, that I get to ask the very first question on the PPG conference call, this is a very special moment for me indeed and forgive me for choking up.
Charles Bunch:  Welcome, Frank.
William H. Hernandez: Thanks, Frank.
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets: As I listened to the commentary, it sounded as if you were putting together a thesis that things were accelerating for PPG as we progressed through the year in terms of the year-over-year comparisons, which obviously bodes well for the early part of ’08. Is that a fair takeaway? And also, Bill, if you could provide some thoughts on the broader economic environment both domestically and internationally.
Charles Bunch: Thank you, Frank, this is Chuck Bunch. And thank you for being the historic first caller on this webcast. And I would say that from an economic standpoint, the fourth quarter had a lot of the issues in our markets that we talked about dealing with in 2008.  We’ve been dealing with a weaker residential construction market here in the US all year and certainly continued in the fourth quarter of ’07. The automotive market also in the fourth quarter of ’07 was weaker. But I think that you saw the strength that we have with our geographic and diversity, and our mix of businesses that despite weaknesses in some of our end markets, especially here in the US, we still had a very solid quarter. And we think some of those issues will be with us at least in the first half of 2008, especially here in the US.  But overall, we do not see signs of weakness outside of the US at this point. And I will let Bill also respond and what he’s seeing.
William H. Hernandez: I think that Chuck is right about that. As we look at it, we have seen a little bit of a soft patch here in the US, maybe for the first half of the year. I think that we mentioned a year ago that we saw and felt that a soft patch was coming, and it is here now.  In our opinion, we have really been navigating through some very choppy waters for the past six months and there is still some ahead. But we think that the economy is doing quite well and it is absorbing these issues and it is still growing. There are still some lagging effects to be felt there, no doubt about it. And I think that there is a great deal of pessimism baked into some people’s thoughts that may be overdone.  So, we are not predicting a recession and we hope that we are right. And if we are wrong, we can act accordingly and quickly. I think that we have just been looking at some of the specific markets. I think in terms things like residential construction, we don’t see any meaningful change in the market to the earliest at the later half of this year, especially given some of the inventory overhang that’s out there.  Now relative to commercial construction and you know that that is a bigger part for us. In this segment continues to perform real well but we do expect a leveling off of that here in the first half. But that is a pretty good activity to level.  And turning to Europe, we think that the European economy is going to continue outpacing the US growth, primarily in the [inaudible] in support of the continued need is a question of Europe product that is going into Eastern Europe and China. And as we talked about, our footprint has really changed and emphasizing much more of a balanced worldwide distribution out there. Again I think that is helping us too in terms of just general economics. If you look at the automotive market, mind we have only about a third of our automotive sales are in the US market and that being said, we have seen over the past several years and continue to expect a slight decline here in automotive production. But as with the past five or six years we soon anticipate that we will once again outperform the overall market statistics. The important thing that we think is globally automotive production will continue to grow. And we think it will be roughly in the 5% kind of growth market, growth arena.
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets: Terrific, and then lastly, Chuck or Bill, what is your best guess in terms of timing as to when you would cash the $25 million break up fee check from Platinum Equity? And in terms of timing what would be your expectation in terms of announcing the sale of the Auto Glass business?
Charles Bunch: Right now, Frank, as you may know we have filed a countersuit against Platinum Equity. We are vigorously pursuing our rights under the contract, and as you know, we are a very experienced buyer and seller. Nothing like this has ever happened in any of the transactions that we have done so we will intend to vigorously pursue that.  The course of the legal actions and the timing, I would say is unclear. We’ll have to depend on the legal system to do that. We still, however, intend to pursue a divestiture of this business. We are evaluating our process now. And I would say that in the next few months that we will be back to you to tell you what we think that the prospective timing would be on any transaction for our glass business.
Frank Mitsch - BB&T Capital Markets: All right terrific, thanks guys.
Charles Bunch: Thank you.
William H. Hernandez: Before we take the next question, let me also introduce for the Q&A session, Dave Navikas, our Vice President and Controller.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Jim Brown - Mirage Research. 
Jim Brown - Mirage Research: A couple of questions regarding guidance. What are your top three anticipated gains of your PPG’s lean and continuous improvement programs?
Vince Morales: What was your question again? Sorry, we had problem hearing you.
Jim Brown - Mirage Research: What are your top three anticipated gains of your continuous and lean improvement programs?
Charles Bunch:  The top three gains would be continued improvement in terms of our labor productivity, in terms of our material usage, so that we would see continued declines in our scrap rate improvements in yield and also the first run quality that we deliver to our customers. I would say those were the three largest gains we would expect from our quality program.
Jim Brown - Mirage Research: There are a lot of world-class manufacturers similar to yours that are now seeking real-time visibility into performance across the entire plant network. How are you guys addressing this issue and what kind of concerns do you have regarding this?
Charles Bunch:  I am not sure I followed your question.
Jim Brown - Mirage Research: Regarding all your plants, how are you guys looking at the real-time visibility regarding your plants in terms of capacity constraints, labor savings, over time, to help improve throughput across your plant?
Charles Bunch:  You mean we would make this proprietary information available in our presentations? Is that your question?
Jim Brown - Mirage Research: No, I am just asking in general.
Charles Bunch:  We have visibility throughout our organization. We have metrics and goals and objectives of which all of our executives, our teams, every associate would have a set of goals that would remain completely transparent and visible to them through our organization and would be measured against.
William Hernandez:  Each of our businesses are very different, one from the other, so I don’t think we can give you a single answer for the overall company.
Jim Brown - Mirage Research: Are you guys making strides now to shorten your manufacturing cycle?
William Hernandez:  We’ve done that over the years. One of, I think, key characteristics of PPG as we have discussed for years is the fact that when we manufacture our products on first run capability and the ability to shorten the production cycle very significantly over the years has actually been a hallmark of the company.
Jim Brown - Mirage Research: So you guys are real happy right now with your manufacturing cycles?
Charles Bunch:  Yes.
Operator:  Your next question comes from David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank. 
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank:  I know it has only been two weeks of owning this company, but any further update on synergy savings? You gave a range back in November. Any further clarity or further upside?
Charles Bunch:  We’re having a little bit of a lag, could you identify yourself and repeat the question again please?
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank:  Yes, this is Dave Begleiter of Deutsche Bank.
Charles Bunch:  Hi Dave. How are you doing?
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank:  Good, thank you. Just looking at SigmaKalon, any further update on synergy targets within that range you gave back in November having owned it for a short two weeks here?
Charles Bunch:  No, we don’t have an update on the synergy targets. We certainly feel still very comfortable with the range, but as you know, that transaction only closed two weeks ago so we are hard at it right now, we’re still comfortable that the integration is going to produce the kinds of synergies that we talked about but we don’t have an update for you at this time.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank:  Bill, what was SigmaKalon’s EBITDA for 2007, do you have a hard number yet?
William Hernandez:  We have a hard number. I don’t think we disclosed that, but it’s close to $250 million. 
Vince Morales: If you do the math we paid under nine times 2007 EBITDA, David.
William Hernandez: 8.8 times EBITDA for 2007, that was our hold.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank:  Bill, just on the permanent financing, where do you stand and what types of rates are you looking at today?
William Hernandez:  We are still anticipating the rate being somewhere between 5% and 6% for the permanent financing. As you know, we have bridge financing debt that can extend through the end of the year 2008 but we are starting to see a little bit more settling in there in the market both in Europe and the US. So if all things go well, we’ll probably be going out for permanent financing after we finalize and have our audited statements for the end of the year. So probably early part of March is what we are anticipating unless we see a real advantage to delaying that because of our future interest rates, or moving that forward, but right now I think it should be accomplished in the first quarter.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Kevin McCarthy -Banc of America. 
Kevin McCarthy -Banc of America : Can you comment on your outlook for raw material costs in 2008, given the energy complex and solvents, soda, ash, et cetera and some of your other key inputs?
Charles Bunch:  We think there will be a little more pressure on raw materials this year. We kept the overall raw material bill around 2% last year in terms of inflation this year. Our range is probably the low end would be 2%, maybe 2% to 4% although we do note that oil is back down to $90. Natural gas here in the U.S. has been stable and you haven’t seen as much pressure outside of the U.S. because of the strength of the currencies with the price of oil.  So, we are hopeful that as the year progresses that we’re going to be able to certainly keep it in the lower end of that range but we are preparing right now for a worst case scenario. We’re discussing our own pricing actions and initiatives with customers and we recognized that if the inflationary environment accelerates, then we’re going to have to deal aggressively with it.
Kevin McCarthy -Banc of America : Okay. Then just a follow-up on SigmaKalon, Chuck, you referenced a multiple of 8.8; it seems as though that’s coming in better than you would have anticipated. Can you comment on the variances perhaps versus your prior expectations and also elaborate on your expectations for the architectural coatings market in Europe here in 2008?
Charles Bunch:  Well the biggest single contributor to the improvement -- and we have been discussing this throughout the process -- was the performance of the SigmaKalon businesses over the course of 2007. We have obviously a window into the market through our own businesses in Europe and we saw that there was continuing strength. The SigmaKalon management team was very confident that they would be able to exceed the forecast.  They had a very strong year throughout the year in the architectural or decorative segment. We also were observing the growth and improvement in the marine and protective coating segment, because we are participants there as well. We thought that they would be able to improve those results and so the single biggest component of the improvement was the results of SigmaKalon.  However, we were also able, through our successful financial and currency hedging and also improvement in the overall balance sheet with a record date at SigmaKalon to improve the multiple to what is now, at 8.8, is something that we feel is a very good price, especially considering the quality of the assets here at SigmaKalon. Those were the principal drivers of the improvement in the multiple to EBITDA.
Kevin McCarthy -Banc of America : Bill, the other income line came in above the trend. Can you comment on the components of other income in the quarter and the magnitude of any gain on sale that may be embedded in that number?
Vince Morales: Kevin, I think for the quarter we were a little bit favorable in other income; a couple of items where foreign currencies included in there. We also have embedded in there, we had a couple of losses last year that as you know, we always put those in a number. We had a casualty fire and also legal settlement last year. We also had a gain from the AZDEL sale we announced. Those four collectively accounted for the majority of the difference.  But on a year-to-date basis I think the biggest difference, I think we were off about $220 million year-to-date full year over full year, $697 million of that was environmental. So for the full year the total number was fairly even year over year.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Gregg Goodnight - UBS. 
Gregg Goodnight - UBS:  I noticed that your margins in the performance and applied coatings weren’t down very much, despite a lot of raw material increases. You mentioned pricing increases. Could you please rationalize why your margins weren’t down more in a pretty tough pricing or cost environment?
Charles Bunch: In that business segment; we have really four sub-segments now. We have a refinish business. This is automotive refinished coatings, which is a very stable margin business, it continues to do very well both in terms of growth and we also have been able to offset the inflationary pressure with pricing in that market. Aerospace had an excellent year so we have very good margins in aerospace; in fact some improvement.  The other sub-segment in there is marine and performance coatings and that is also a segment that is improving. The one other area where we had more margin pressure was in our architectural business, this was a result of (1) the weaker environment, especially here in the U.S. and then some of the purchase accounting on the acquisitions that we made. We made two acquisitions of significance in this segment in ’07. That was the Renner acquisition in Brazil and Barloworld in Australia.  So you saw some pressure on margins from those acquisitions and the overall market conditions in the U.S. but they were offset largely by continued strength in the other segments.
Gregg Goodnight - UBS:  It seems like an improved mix story. 
William Hernandez: Actually aerospace has continued to improve year-over-year for the last few months.
Gregg Goodnight - UBS:  What are your plans for share repurchases in ’08? Is this going to depend upon the timing of the glass sale or how much are you going to repurchase, do you think?
William Hernandez:  Really, most of the repurchases we did in 2007 were in the first half of the year. If you look at how its laid out; once we knew we were buying SigmaKalon, we really scaled back the amount of share repurchases. I think really the emphasis is going to be here in the short term paying off some of the outstanding debt that we have out there and share repurchases probably a much smaller percentage going forward, at least for 2008.
Gregg Goodnight - UBS:  If you complete your glass sale by midyear, will you relook at the possibility of repurchasing shares?
William Hernandez: I don’t think that will have much of an effect on it. We’ll probably just continue paying down debt, that will probably be the primary emphasis. We may buy some shares back. Depending on if we see a major disruption out there in terms of what’s going on in the market, but that is not our intent at the moment.
Gregg Goodnight - UBS:  Your tax rate in ’09, you said maybe 25% to 29%. Have you put a finer point on that?
William Hernandez: Gregg that 25% to 29% was SigmaKalon’s tax range on their earnings. Our full year rate next year will be likely around 31%.
Operator:  Your next question comes from P.J. Juvekar - Citi. 
P.J. Juvekar - Citi:  We all know that housing has slowed down. In your numbers and now that you have access to Sigma’s books, do you see any spillover into industrial or commercial construction so far?
Vince Morales: You are talking about Europe?
P.J. Juvekar - Citi:  I am talking about Europe and US.
Charles Bunch: Well right now the fallout here in the U.S. is principally in new home residential. Obviously we have seen the renovation market in residential flat now, and commercial has held up. We have not seen a decline here in the U.S. in commercial construction. For our visibility, which would be the first half of this year, we continue to feel that the commercial construction market in the U.S. will remain healthy. Now there are predictions, potentially late in 2008 or next year you could see some softness but right now in commercial construction we haven’t seen that. We have seen, however, continued weakness on the new home residential.  In SigmaKalon, I would say the visibility there in terms of their architectural markets they are primarily on the coating side, commercial, and what we would call maintenance and renovation. Those markets are still solid. The new home residential market in Europe has principally been in Spain where SigmaKalon is not a participant. So right now we have not seen any weakness on the markets for architectural or decorative in SigmaKalon. On the industrial side, in Europe we are still seeing good growth in automotive, which is coming from our PPG indicators. On the industrial side, there was a little weakness in Europe in the fourth quarter in what we would call the CO/EX market, coil and extrusion. Some of that you saw that there was some end of year imports into Europe from China contributing to some of the weakness, so that’s a market that we’re going to have to continue to watch in Europe and that market has been a little weaker here in the U.S. as well because its tied both to residential and a little bit of commercial in that coil and extrusion market, and that’s been weaker here as well in the U.S.
P.J. Juvekar - Citi:  That’s a good overview. If I may ask one more question. On the architectural side, you sell through big boxes and through your own company-owned stores. Did your stores outperform the big boxes in terms of volume growth? Thank you.
Charles Bunch: No, they didn’t. Our stores, where we have I would say the PPG store network has more exposure to new home residential and to some markets that were more affected regionally than the national markets. So our same-store sales growth in our store network under performed versus the national accounts or the home centers, which are more tied to, as you know, the renovation and maintenance market.
P.J. Juvekar - Citi:  Can you quantify that a little bit in terms of how much?
Charles Bunch: I would say that we saw same store-sales growth that approached minus 5% on a year-over-year basis. I would say the performance of, if you looked at Home Depot or Lowe’s, I think they had negative same-store sales growth but it was less than that 5% number.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Don Carson - Merrill Lynch. 
Don Carson - Merrill Lynch:  A couple of clarifications on SigmaKalon. Chuck, the slide you presented back in November you were talking about $50 million to $150 million in amortization when you gave that pretty wide range of what the EPS impact would be of SigmaKalon in ’08. So you are basically narrowing that down to about $80 million on a full year basis, is that the takeaway we should have?
Charles Bunch:  That’s correct.
Don Carson - Merrill Lynch:  But you are not in a position yet to narrow down that integration and purchase accounting line then?
Charles Bunch:  Not yet.
Don Carson - Merrill Lynch:  Bill, if you look at your base business, I know you guys don’t give out formal guidance, but based on your economic outlook of slowdown but no recession in the U.S., what kind of volume growth do you see in your business ex-SigmaKalon this year? I would presume that if volumes are growing, given your traditional excellence at productivity, you would expect base earnings ex-SigmaKalon to be up in 2008 versus 2007?
William Hernandez:  That’s true, Don. As we said, we are probably in the soft patch here earlier part of the year, but we have it built into our process continued volume growth albeit not maybe at the rapid rate as the last couple years. We do have productivity baked in too, so your assumption is correct.
Don Carson - Merrill Lynch:  What’s you outlook on the chlor-alkali business? Obviously caustic pricing is very robust, I am somewhat surprised that you ran at such a higher rate in the fourth quarter given the reduced demand for chlorine. What’s your outlook for chlor-alkali in 2008 in terms of what operating rate you might run at and year-over-year improvement in ECU price and margin?
Charles Bunch:  We have been really pleased with the performance of the business in the fourth quarter. The chlorine side of the molecule is a little weaker, and that’s of course tied to PVC. Caustic, as you know, very strong, the $75 price increase on caustic appears to be fully implemented. We have the alumina contract that settled here in the first half at around that same kind of increase. So we are at a very attractive level for the aluminum contract, which will hold for the first six months and so we think that caustic is certainly going to hold up its side of the ECU.  We were a little more active in terms of the export market and there we’re being helped by the weakness of the dollar. That both improves our competitiveness and it makes it more difficult for potential exporters into the U.S. So that was a little bit of the flywheel here in the four quarter to help offset some of the domestic weakness of the PVC business.  So we’re relatively optimistic about chlor-alkali. This is in the phase of, as you know, the much talked about Shintech expansion should come on at some point in the second quarter. Now we have seen maybe a small impact on the chlorine side but on caustic there has not been a ripple. So at this point, we think that the market looks solid for the next couple of quarters here and we feel pretty good about it.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Sergey Vasnetsov - Lehman Brothers. 
Sergey Vasnetsov - Lehman Brothers:  We almost went through the conference call without the chlor-alkali question, so I thought I was listening to the Specialty Coatings Company conference call. Don would not allow us to escape without that, so that’s good.  Just a few remaining questions, one is on glass business. You have shown very strong volume gains versus last year and also about a 3% gain on currency. Given that the only business I know that you are dealing outside the U.S. would be essentially for selling Mercedes windshield screens, is that’s the driver or there were some other product lines you were exporting out of US.
Charles Bunch: No, if you look at the two remaining businesses that are in this segment, one performance glazings or flat glass, that’s primarily a domestic business but the other business, which is fiberglass, is a global business. We have benefited there from a global footprint and strong markets in a couple of the product lines, one being what we called the direct draw business, which is the product that’s going into these wind energy markets or also the pipe markets that are going into energy and infrastructure.  So actually our fiberglass business, which had experienced some very difficult times earlier this decade, is on a strong rebound. So we still have great performance out of our PFG joint venture that’s into the electronics chain but our new join venture in China with SJJ, doing well in that market, and also these infrastructure plays are helping our fiberglass business. We had the best performance in our fiberglass business in ‘07 in seven years and we’re looking for further improvement in ‘08.
Sergey Vasnetsov - Lehman Brothers:  Opticals, this business has been growing pretty steadily, it’s about 8% to 10% and now you’re rolling out the gen 6 material. What kind of volume trends do you hope to achieve in ‘08 in optical?
Charles Bunch: We hope to again have another high single-digit growth rate for our transitions business. We think that this gen 6 especially here in the first several quarters of ‘08 will drive that and we’re still seeing very good growth in this business outside of the U.S. I would say we’re looking for high single-digit growth out of that optical and transitions business.
Operator:  Your next question comes from John Roberts - Buckingham Research. 
John Roberts - Buckingham Research:  Bill, in Europe, relatively good economics here, and there is a lot of debate on whether the emerging markets can hold up should the Western economies decline. I know you’re not foresting a recession but I think exports are still one-third of China’s GDP, for example. So if we did go into a U.S. or European downturn, would you expect your relatively high emerging market growth to continue or do you think that would moderate a lot?
William Hernandez:  It’ll continue but you have to expect some moderation. I think if you just look at what’s going on in China, the number of levers that the Chinese government is pulling on things, going from the financial system to changing their export tax credits to discouragement of energy intensive businesses. They are seeking their own way. I do think it’s quite little bit unclear what the total impact would be, but it could have a moderating effect, no doubt.
John Roberts - Buckingham Research:  Do you think it would be a lot less? Previously we had kind of a coordinated downturn globally; when we sneeze here they catch a cold there.
William Hernandez: No I don’t think we’ll see that at all. I think they are little more independent than they ever were before. If we look at an awful lot of what our sales are in China they are for their own use. The major inroads we made there with automotive, there are plenty for their own use, the same with refinished, the same with aerospace. The maintenance part of that; we think it is becoming a little more dislocated in terms of a ripple effect.
John Roberts - Buckingham Research:  Thank you.
Operator:  Your final question comes from line of Bob Goldberg - Scopus Asset Management. Please proceed.
Bob Goldberg - Scopus Asset Management : Two questions, one is really more of a detailed type of question. I was just curious if you were familiar with Sigma’s seasonality, wondering how much of the business is 2Q and 3Q versus 1Q and 4Q.
Charles Bunch: Actually the first quarter is one of the toughest quarters if you looked at it. I think they are probably roughly 10% to 15% in the first quarter in earnings. You see they have a much bigger impact in the second and third quarter. I think if you add those together and you are going to get 65%, 70% of the total earnings for the year and roughly around 20% for the fourth quarter. You can’t expect the first quarter probably to be the lightest quarter for them in the year.
Bob Goldberg - Scopus Asset Management : In terms of the optical business, I am just curious about what you think about the economic sensitivity/ That business has performed so strongly and you are expecting strong growth in ‘08. I am just wondering how sensitive that business would be if we did have a more serious global slowdown?
Charles Bunch:  I think the optical business, I think some aspects of the market are tied to consumer spending but it is very much also linked to the healthcare industry. I think you have a blend that makes this market more stable than a complete consumer discretionary item.  I think that even if there is some weakness on the consumer side, the healthcare side, we’ll stabilize that and then we’ll have the growth opportunities with the new generation.  This year which we think will generate a lot of interest in the brand, we are going to aggressively promote this new advertising campaign and the like; we did that last year and really reestablished a very good momentum for the brand. We are confident even in a softer consumer market that we can still deliver these kinds of results this year.
