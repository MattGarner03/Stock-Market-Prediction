===== 2023 Q3  (2023-10-26 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings. Welcome to Juniper Networks’ Q3 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Jess Lubert, Head of Investor Relations at Juniper. You may begin.
Jess Lubert: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to our third quarter 2023 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer, and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results might differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release furnished with our 8-K filed today, the CFO commentary posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website today, and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and Juniper undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website under financial reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results is included in today's press release. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question, so that as many people as possible who would like to ask a question have a chance. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami.
Rami Rahim: Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss our Q3 2023 results. We delivered better-than-expected results during the third quarter, with total revenue of $1.5 billion. Better than expected results during the third quarter, with total revenue of $1.398 billion, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance. Profitability was also strong in Q3, as our non-GAAP growth and operating margins both exceeded expectations, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.60, which was above the high end of our quarterly guidance range. Our teams continue to execute well against the backdrop of a challenging macro environment. We remain confident in our positioning from a technology perspective and our ability to win across industry verticals as customers increasingly look to leverage AIOps and software automation tools to improve network operations and reduce overhead costs, what we call experience-first networking. We believe our attention to providing customers with the best user experience, along with our continued go-to-market focus, will position us to deliver healthy, long-term growth and improved profitability. Total product orders came in largely as expected during Q3 and the rate of year-over-year order decline improved as compared to the prior few quarters. Our Enterprise business remained healthy as orders experienced high single digit sequential growth and exceeded our expectations. Enterprise strength helped offset order weakness with our Cloud and Service Provider customers where we continue to see accounts digesting prior purchases before placing new orders. I am extremely encouraged by the momentum we're seeing in our Enterprise business, which once again delivered record revenue results and accounted for more than 50% of total revenue for the first time in Juniper's history. Total Enterprise revenue grew by nearly 40% year-over-year in the Q3 timeframe and represented our largest and fastest growing vertical for a fourth consecutive quarter. Importantly, new logos saw another quarter of healthy double-digit growth, and we continue to see strong mid-market success as enterprise deal registration through the channel grew by more than 20% year-over-year and commercial orders grew by nearly 20% year-over-year. We believe continued growth in new logos and mid-market strength speaks to the differentiation of our products and our ability to capture share. Our campus and branch business had another record quarter in Q3 with our AI-driven enterprise revenue growing more than 40% year-over-year. Revenue from the mystified segment of our business, which consists of products driven by Mist AI, also had a record quarter growing by nearly 100% year-over-year in the Q3 time frame. Our mystified orders also achieved a notable milestone in Q3, surpassing $1 billion run rate on an annualized basis, less than four years after crossing the $100 million run rate milestone in Q4 2019. Customers and the industry are recognizing Juniper's clear and defensible leadership when it comes to AI-driven operations delivered via a modern microservices cloud and the meaningful benefits these solutions can provide in terms of reducing network trouble tickets, automating manual tasks, speeding time to deployment, and reducing mean time to repair as compared to competitive platforms. We see these benefits resulting in share gain opportunities as customers transition from legacy on-prem solutions managed by people to next-gen solutions managed using AI and the cloud. We believe this architectural transition remains in the early innings and will represent attractive growth opportunities for years to come. In Q3, we secured a win with a global pharmaceutical leader, the world's largest healthcare provider added to its Juniper Mist rollout and two very large retailers extended their Juniper Mist network to include our full stack across Wi-Fi, wired and SD-WAN. One of these retailers is approaching 10,000 locations. Initial demand for our cloud-based network access control product was also strong, securing more than 50 customer wins in a little more than a quarter of availability, with customers highlighting dramatic reductions in rollout time from days to minutes and simplified operations as being key differentiators. Mystified strength was broad-based across the portfolio with record wireless, wired, and SD-WAN revenue in the quarter, as well as record full-stack wins where customers purchased several of these campus and branch products together. We view momentum with these full-stack wins as a positive forward indicator, given our belief that for every dollar of wireless, there is $2 to $3 of wired switching and additional SD-WAN and NAC opportunity. Our Enterprise data center business also performed well in Q3, with Apstra continuing to see strong momentum in the market. Apstra new logos grew by more than 80% year-over-year in Q3, and the pipeline of opportunities remain solid. Hardware pull-through for every dollar of Apstra software has been meaningful and growing, which we view as a positive forward indicator for our data center prospects. Key data center wins in the quarter for Apstra and our QFX switch offerings included large government agencies, international Tier 1 service providers, and one of the largest global appliance manufacturers. The performance of our Enterprise business shows our diversification strategy is working. And given our level of portfolio differentiation balanced against our relatively modest share in the large markets where we compete, I expect us to grow our Enterprise revenue and orders in 2023 and 2024, even in a more challenged macro environment. As highlighted over the last few quarters, we continue to see accounts across each of our customer verticals more closely scrutinizing budget and project deployment timelines due to the macro uncertainties that are happening around the world. This has been particularly true in the Cloud vertical, where many of our customers are still in the process of digesting prior purchases. While these dynamics are likely to pressure our Cloud segment for at least the next few quarters, we remain optimistic regarding our longer-term prospects in the cloud. Our optimism is driven by our strong wide-area footprint, the rapid traffic growth that continues in many of these customers' environments and the opportunity to capitalize on the adoption of large language model and the build-out of AI clusters, where we are seeing strong customer engagement that is driving optimism regarding our opportunity to benefit as the industry increasingly considers Ethernet as the right choice for a wide array of AI-ML use cases, including front-end, back-end, in-print and storage networks. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect AI adoption to drive a meaningful uptick in traffic growth that is likely to benefit our cloud wide-area footprint over time. We also remain optimistic regarding our AI data center switching opportunity, but we are already seeing success with cloud major and enterprise accounts due to the performance and power efficiency of our custom silicon, the congestion management capabilities embedded within our Junos operating system and our support for technologies such as RDMA networking. Additionally, by incorporating Apstra in our AIML design, Juniper differentiates in its ability to deliver the turnkey deployment and reliable operations of AI-ML clusters, which is critical to achieving the performance goals required by AI-ML team. Our Service Provider business softened in Q3 and was impacted by some of the macro uncertainties that are happening around the world. These dynamics are causing many carriers to more closely scrutinize budgets and, in some case, to run their networks harder than planned. We found this to be particularly true amongst our Tier 2 and Tier 3 customers as well as certain large international accounts, while activity with the US Tier 1 operators has largely tracked according to plan. Despite these macro headwinds, we remain encouraged by the momentum we're seeing in our Cloud Metro portfolio where our new ACX7000 platform had a record revenue quarter and saw solid year-over-year growth from an orders perspective. These products secured six new footprint wins in the Q3 timeframe, including a win with an international Tier 1 account. We expect this business to build through the remainder of the year and become more material to revenue in the 2024 timeframe and beyond. I'd like to highlight that our services team continued to execute extremely well and delivered another quarter of record revenue and margins during the Q3 timeframe. Services accounts were more than 35% of our total revenue and we believe represents an underappreciated aspect of the business that is not only recurring and likely to grow in the years to come, but it also presents opportunities for margin expansion as the team continues to identify and capture efficiencies. In summary, while the macro environment remains uncertain and is impacting our near-term outlook, I remain confident with our strategy and optimistic regarding our long-term growth prospects. My enthusiasm is fueled by our continued enterprise momentum and the attractive longer-term opportunities we continue to see in the Cloud as well as Service Provider metro opportunity. I'd also like to emphasize that we remain committed to delivering improved profitability and still expect to deliver greater than 100 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement in 2023. We also expect further improvement in 2024. While we view revenue growth as the primary lever to achieving improved profitability and reducing costs is never easy, we recently announced an action to protect profitability while preserving investments in strategic areas of the company. I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results and outlook in more detail.
Ken Miller: Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start by discussing our third quarter results, then provide some color on our outlook. We ended the third quarter of 2023 with $1.398 billion in revenue, which was over $10 million above the midpoint of our guidance. We delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.60, which was $0.01 above the high end of our guidance range, driven by better-than-expected revenue results and improved gross and operating margins. Total product orders came in largely as expected, and the rate of year-over-year decline improved as compared to the prior few quarters. Enterprise demand continues to be strong and exceeded our expectations, resulting in orders that grew in the high single-digits on a sequential basis but were approximately flat year-over-year. Cloud and Service Provider demand remained pressured due to digestion of previously placed orders and an unfavorable macroeconomic environment. From a customer solution perspective, on a year-over-year basis, AI-driven enterprise led the way with record revenue and growth of 43%. Automated WAN solutions revenue declined 18%, and cloud-ready data center revenue declined 26%. Looking at our revenue by vertical. On a year-over-year basis, Enterprise increased 37%, Service Provider declined 20%, and Cloud decreased 28%. Total software and related services revenue was $313 million, which was an increase of 27% year-over-year. ARR was $357 million and grew 37% year-over-year. Deferred revenue from our SaaS business grew more than 50% year-over-year. We remain confident in our software transformation and ARR growth. Total Security revenue was $160 million, up 14% year-over-year. Our services business remained strong in Q3, posting record revenue and profitability. Service revenue was $500 million and grew 12% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Non-GAAP service gross margin of 72.8% improved 4.8 points versus a year ago and 3.1 points sequentially. We see the potential for continued services revenue growth and improvements in profitability. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, five were Cloud, three were Enterprise and two were Service Providers. Our top 10 customers accounted for 29% of total revenue as compared to 34% in the third quarter of 2022. Non-GAAP gross margin was 59.5%, which was at the high end of our guidance range. This was primarily driven by the improved service margin, favorable software revenue mix and lower logistics costs, which was partially offset by higher inventory-related expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 4% year-over-year, primarily due to headcount-related costs but were down 1% sequentially. Non-GAAP operating margin was 17.5% for the quarter, which was above our expectations, primarily driven by better-than-expected gross margin. Cash flows from operations were $329 million. We paid $70 million in dividends, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share. We also repurchased $125 million worth of shares in the quarter. We exited the third quarter of 2023 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments increasing to $1.4 billion. Lastly, we incurred an aggregate amount of $62.5 million in restructuring charges in the third quarter of 2023 in connection with the plans to reallocate resources to efficiently support our strategic priorities while delivering against our profitability goals. As disclosed in an 8-K filed earlier this month, we announced a plan to reduce worldwide head count by approximately 440 employees, resulting in the majority of this restructuring charge. Please reference our SEC filings for more information. Overall, we delivered solid results in the third quarter, and I'm pleased with our team's dedication and commitment. Now I would like to provide some color on our guidance, which you could find detailed in the CFO commentary available on our Investor Relations website. The macroeconomic environment is expected to remain challenged, which has been factored into our outlook. For the fourth quarter of 2023, we expect to see sequential growth in bookings and expect the rate of year-over-year order declines to further moderate. We continue to see healthy Enterprise momentum and expect orders to grow both in the fourth quarter and on a full year basis. However, we expect demand from Cloud and Service Provider customers to remain constrained as they continue to digest previously placed orders. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to modestly increase in the fourth quarter of 2023 to approximately 60% due to expected lower supply chain costs. We will continue to manage non-GAAP operating expenses prudently and expect a sequential decline of approximately $10 million. With our fourth quarter guidance, total 2023 revenue is expected to grow approximately 5% to 6% on a full year basis, and non-GAAP operating margin will expand by more than 100 basis points. Additionally, non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to grow double digits in 2023, meeting our previously stated guidance for revenue and profitability. While the current global macroeconomic environment poses some uncertainty, we would like to provide some initial color regarding our current outlook for 2024. Bookings across all verticals are expected to grow next year on a full year basis. We expect our Enterprise revenue to grow. However, total revenue results will depend on the rate and pace of recovery in our Cloud and Service Provider verticals, which remain uncertain at this time. Based on our current order expectations and backlog levels, we expect a return to more traditional seasonal revenue patterns beginning in the first quarter of 2024. As a reminder, prior to the industry-wide supply chain shortage, we historically experienced double-digit sequential revenue declines in the first quarter followed by sequential revenue growth throughout the remainder of the year. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to expand in 2024. We will continue to manage non-GAAP operating expenses prudently and expect non-GAAP operating margin expansion in 2024. However, our ability to achieve this objective will be partially dependent on revenue results. Our long-term financial objectives have not changed. We plan to deliver sustainable revenue growth, improved operating margin and earnings expansion over time. Finally, I'm pleased to announce we have declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per share to be paid this quarter to stockholders of record. In closing, I'd like to thank the Juniper team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success, especially in this dynamic environment. Now I'd like to open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today is coming from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Amit, your line is live.
Amit Daryanani: Thanks. Good afternoon everyone. Good job on the [Technical Difficulty]. Fairly impressive. My question is really around the weakness you're seeing on the Cloud and Service Provider market in aggregate. I'm really curious if you've seen any change in tone over the last 90 days because a lot of the stuff [Technical Difficulty] as well. And maybe across both the segments, is your sense that the weakness is coming more from customers having to digest the product they already have? Or is it more a pushing out new deployments? I'm curious how this starts across the segments. And then maybe related to this [Technical Difficulty], from a historical perspective, how long do you think these corrections typically last and perhaps that answers a little easy on Service Provider versus Cloud, but I am not sure what the historical perspective looks. Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Hi, Amit. This is Rami. I'll start. For some reason, you're really choppy. So I hope the issue is not on our end. I think I caught most of what you asked really around the demand environment that we're seeing for Cloud and SP, and I think you're looking for some commentary around sort of the duration of that -- the challenges that we're seeing in that segment. I'd say, first, not much has changed from the last quarter in terms of what we're seeing in SP and Cloud. Service Provider is probably incrementally more challenging. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, not so much because of Tier 1 service providers in the US, more about Tier 2, Tier 3 and international. Cloud is challenging as we expected. I don't think it's gotten worse or better, really. And we've always expected that the digestion period that is being faced in the Cloud and, to some extent, in the Service Provider vertical as well, is going to last for several quarters. Having said that, I don't think it's all negative. I mean in the Service Provider space, for example, there are plenty of opportunities out there that we're competing for, especially in the metro, where we're seeing really great early momentum. And I expect that that's going to more meaningfully contribute to our top line next year. In the cloud provider space, there are projects that are ongoing. We're competing for new projects for certain. The AI cluster opportunity is going to emerge, as I think, a wonderful opportunity for us to go and to pursue. I just think it's going to be a few more quarters of digestion before those opportunities start to play out and we begin to benefit from them.
Amit Daryanani: Got it. Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Thanks, Amit.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Michael Ng from Goldman Sachs. Michael, your line is live.
Michael Ng: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for the question. I just have two. First, I was just wondering if you can talk a little bit more around the strength in hardware, maintenance and professional services. Very good quarter-on-quarter growth. Was there something that may have helped on the maintenance side, whether it's the incremental challenges in SP that you talked about that may have led to more maintenance? And then second, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about product orders. It's encouraging to hear that it was in line with expectations and the year-over-year decline improved. But how much did product orders actually decline in the quarter? Thank you.
Ken Miller: Yeah. So I'll take those questions. So on the services side, very proud of the team. And we've seen some record services result both on the revenue side, up 12% year-on-year, as well as on the margin side. So really phenomenal results there. The services business does include predominantly our maintenance professional services business, but it does include a growing portion of our SaaS software, which has been growing faster than the overall services results. So the SaaS business is absolutely helping services overall. But as you look at just the maintenance business, which is what you talked about and the growth there, really, there's a lagging indicator of what we've seen in the past couple of years on the product side. So the product growth over the last couple of years has really given us the opportunity to expand our installed base and to attach more service contracts, and we're realizing the benefit of that now. So that's been great. On the product booking side and the order side, it did come in as we expected. Enterprise was maybe a little more favorable than we originally anticipated at the start of the quarter. Service Provider was a little bit weaker than we anticipated, but in aggregate, it was as expected. And as we predicted, we are starting to lessen that year-over-year decline that we've had the last couple of quarters, and I expect us to further lessen that decline here in the fourth quarter.
Michael Ng: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. Samik, your line is live.
Samik Chatterjee: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I guess if I start on the margin front, you're guiding to operating margin expansion, although with the sort of caveat about what that revenue outlook looks like. I do see you sort of expanding gross margins next year. So can you just outline what is sort of the sort of puts and takes here? What is the amount of revenue decline you can absorb even with gross margin expansion and still sort of deliver operating margin expansion as you look to next year? And just a quick clarification on Michael's question here. So you said orders have tracked in the quarter largely in line, but you seem to be moderating your 4Q order trajectory of saying now it's maybe a more modest decline where earlier you were saying it's an increase as of the last quarter. So there seems to have been an incremental change there even though it tracked in line in the quarter. So can you just clarify what led to that change? Thank you.
Ken Miller: Absolutely. So this is Ken. On the margin expansion for next year, which we are anticipating, we are going to -- we are expecting a gross margin improvement next year. We also -- we will be -- continue to be prudent on cost controls. So with the gross margin expansion as well as the prudence on cost controls, we do believe we will expand operating margin. That really would apply to revenue at, say, modest decline levels. If revenue declines were to get larger than that, it would be more challenging. But we would stay laser-focused on protecting profitability. And if necessary, we would consider taking further costs out of the business to protect our margins. On the Q4 order perspective, you're right, in prior quarters, we did mention we thought we will return to year-on-year growth potentially as soon as Q4. We still might return to year-on-year growth in Q4. Quite confident that the year-on-year decline, if there is one, will be significantly lessened from the last couple of quarters. But we may return to year-on-year growth in Q4, but it's not factored into my current base case. I do expect us to return to full year growth or year-over-year growth in 2024, early in 2024. And on a full year basis, in 2024, I would expect all verticals to have full year growth.
Samik Chatterjee: Okay. Thank you. Thanks for taking my question.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Alex Henderson from Needham. Alex, your line is live.
Alex Henderson: Great. Thanks. I was hoping you could give us some sense of when you think some things are going to normalize. And most specifically, the -- at what juncture do you think your backlog is fully normalized? And at what juncture do you think your excess inventory will normalize? I assume that's with a lag to the backlog. And do you think that there's any risk within that inventory as we're going through these delays and changing environment? Is there anything in your inventory that you think might be an obsolescence problem? Thanks.
Ken Miller: Good questions. On the backlog front, backlog has come down faster or normalized faster than we expected this year largely because the supply chain has actually improved much quicker than we expected from a lead time perspective. So we have seen backlog come down. I expect it to continue to come down in the fourth quarter as well. I still believe we will remain -- we'll exit the year at an elevated backlog position. But at this point, I do not believe it will be two times the elevated position that we've been talking about in prior periods. So I think it will be elevated but not quite two times. I do expect backlog to fully normalize probably by the middle of next year. I would say probably the first half to the middle of next year, backlog should be kind of fully normalized. Inventory has been growing throughout the last couple of years. I would expect this to plateau and start to come down at some point in 2024. It is going to take longer. To your point, the inventory kind of normalization, if you will, it's going to take a few years, in my opinion. And I don't think we'll ever get down to previous normals, right? I think we've learned some lessons with the recent supply chain situation. I think we'll continue to carry inventory at higher levels than we historically did, but there is still a fairly sizable room for it to reduce over the next few years. And on the cost of that inventory, there are costs. I mean I mentioned in the gross margin guidance, we had a very strong gross margin quarter really highlighted by software, services. And we are seeing some of the earlier transitory costs, i.e. logistics and expedite fees come down. But some of the goodness in gross margin was offset by an increase in inventory-carrying charges. That would include excess and obsolescence reserves as well as just carrying charges. So we are paying for those now. That's factored in, obviously, to our results and to our near-term and longer-term guidance. I do think there's opportunity for those to reduce over time as inventory starts to normalize.
Alex Henderson: Great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Simon, your line is live.
Simon Leopold: Great. Thanks for taking the question. First, just a quick clarification, if I might. In your prepared remarks, you talked about a return to normal seasonality in 2024, and you also make a reference to Q1 being down double digits in the past. Are we to take it that you expect Q1 '24 to be down by a double-digit rate? That's the clarification, simple. In terms of the broader question, however, I see a number of the third-party market research firms expect the campus environment, both wireless LAN and campus switching, will decline in 2024. And you've been experiencing some good growth here. I assume it's decelerating, but you sound very confident that you'll still grow. Could you help us unpack what separates your view from the market research firms? Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Thanks for the question, Simon. I'll start with your second question first, and I'll then hand it over to Ken. So first, you're right, I am confident in our campus and branch business. We have grown over the last few years even in the face of pretty significant headwinds. At a time when, for example, the middle of COVID where some of our peers were seeing some declines, we consistently saw growth in our campus and branch business. I think the solutions that we're offering that include AIOps that simplify and reduce the cost of operations actually truly resonate with customers that are looking for executing on digital transformation projects in a situation where their budgets are challenged, right? We're basically enabling them to transform their business with less total cost of ownership. That's part of the value proposition of our solutions that's really resonating. In addition to that, the campus and branch market all up if you include wired, wireless and WAN is a $25 billion market opportunity, give or take, of which we're a small player and plenty of room for us to grow, even in the face of a total addressable market that's not growing all that much or even not even growing at all. So for all of these reasons, I'm super optimistic about our Enterprise business and especially our campus and branch business moving forward.
Ken Miller: Yeah. And on your clarification question, the short answer is yes, I would expect a sequential decline from Q4 to Q1 in that double-digit realm based on kind of previous traditional patterns.
Simon Leopold: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from David Vogt from UBS. David, your line is live.
David Vogt: Great. Thanks guys for taking my question. I'm going to kind of bundle a couple of things here, all related, if you may -- if you let me. So I'm trying to understand sort of the seasonal patterns of the business that you referenced going into Q1 and then sequentially getting stronger because the business is a little bit different today than it was pre-COVID, right? Mist is much stronger, and I would imagine the severity of the decline in cloud is much deeper than you would have anticipated. So I guess the first question is, does the normal seasonal patterns hold? Or is there some sort of variability around the normal seasonal patterns in the years prior to COVID? And then in conjunction with that, I think you said backlog should get normalized by the end of the second quarter. Does that mean you're expecting roughly $300 million, $400 million, maybe $500 million of revenue from backlog in the first half of 2024 to show up as revenue? And then I have a follow-up.
Ken Miller: Yeah. So I'll address the seasonal pattern one. We do expect the double-digit decline Q4 to Q1 as we mentioned. And then from there, we expect sequential growth throughout the rest of the quarter. I would say we've talked a lot about revenue next year was uncertain predominantly because it's just unclear about the pace and timing -- the size and timing of the recovery within Cloud and SP. So that implies to me that we expect it to recover at some point next year but just not exactly sure when. And when that does, that should accelerate revenue. So I would expect revenue to be maybe a bit more back-end loaded, probably closest traditional patterns this last year 2023 or this year. 2023 was not kind of a sequential growth quarter. It was kind of a flattish quarter from a quarter-to-quarter perspective throughout the year. Next year, I think we'll start down and it will build back up as the year progresses.
David Vogt: And then on the backlog because it sounds like it's going to be normal after the end of the second quarter. So that sounds like it would be a pretty healthy tailwind despite sort of the commentary for sequential pressure in the first quarter. So I just wanted to clarify that.
Ken Miller: Yes. So backlog continues to be a bit of a tailwind in each of our quarters, but it's lessening quarter after quarter as it starts to normalize. So not giving any specific guidance other than I do expect it to remain elevated as we exit the year but not to the degree that we previously thought. We were thinking it was going to be two times previous kind of historical levels. We now think it will be less than that but still be above historical levels.
David Vogt: Okay. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from George Notter from Jefferies. George, your line is live.
George Notter: Hi guys. Thanks very much. I guess I wanted to dig in on gross margin a bit more. Could you walk us through some of the puts and takes on gross margin? I guess I'm thinking more about some of the impacts on the supply chain crunch. It sounds like -- I imagine there's certainly high-cost componentry that's running through the gross margin line right now. Also, it sounds like there's some breakdown associated with excess and obsolete inventory here as well. I guess, can you give us a sense for how big those components are in terms of their impact on gross margin?
Ken Miller: Yeah. So I mean we are seeing -- we're definitely seeing some improvements in what we used to refer to as the transitory costs, right? These were predominantly logistics costs and expedite fees or purchase price variance fees, where we're paying more just to get a hold of the product that was scarce, hard to get. We clearly are not paying any more of those fees as we are able to get products pretty much on time with standard lead times at this point. The supply chain has completely normalized from a lead time perspective. But we do still have some inventory that we bought at prior higher prices, as you mentioned, and that's going to bleed through over the next few quarters. But each quarter, we're getting more and more of that benefit or less and less of those additional fees on the expedite side. Logistics has effectively recovered completely, right, where the logistics cost that we were paying -- the elevated logistics costs have completely normalized. And that's obviously benefiting our current gross margin results and our expectations going forward. The one area that has gone negative, if you will, or have gotten worse over the last 12 months are those inventory carrying fees that I mentioned. And that's really just a factor of the balance sheet and inventory that we're carrying. So I would expect those costs to remain for the next few quarters higher-than-normal levels as inventory remains higher-than-normal levels, but I do see a path to recovery on those as well. All this is factored into our guidance, obviously, for Q4 as well as our expectation that next year, we expect to grow gross margin.
George Notter: Got it. Okay. That helps. And then also back to the services gross margin strength this quarter, I guess, I'm just curious for more detail on what drove that strength. It sounds like it was probably the SaaS business. But that services gross margin really did step function up in Q3. I guess I'm wondering exactly if that was the driver or there's other things at work there. Thanks.
Ken Miller: Yeah. The revenue -- SaaS was definitely a part of it and has been a continual part of it for the last few years as SaaS is becoming a bigger part of our overall business. we disclosed on the call, our ARR business at $357 million at an all-time high and growing quite nicely. So that is becoming a bigger factor of overall services. However, I don't want to discount the maintenance business, which also grew nicely in the quarter and the efficiencies we're getting within our services organization. So really, this is a situation of revenue growth and cost of revenue decline, and that's resulting in the margin expansion that you're seeing.
George Notter: Got it. One last one. Is it fair to say there's no one-time items driving that gross margin this quarter that's related baseline that you should continue to kind of move off of going forward? Is that fair to say?
Ken Miller: I think it's fair to say that directionally, we should be moving up as we move forward. Any given quarter, you might see some small anomalies, but I do feel good about the ability to continue to grow gross margin in a more of an aggregate time period basis.
George Notter: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from James Fish from Piper Sandler. James, your line is live.
James Fish: Hey guys. Kind of working back on Simon's question before on Mist. It's been a huge behemoth. We constantly hear the need to upgrade wireless LAN due to specifically going back to work, actually, and all of us having Zoom and Teams meetings still actually in the office with those that are not in the office. Those apps obviously are showing bandwidth improvements. And we've been seeing the strength in wireless LAN for a while now. And really the core of this, Rami, is how much more is left in this business from a -- let's separate the market perspective, as Simon pointed out, like the decline potentially for next year versus the outright share gains. What do you see left in the pipeline and opportunity? And Ken, just for you, I mean, just round out this discussion, prior to the supply chain glut and as you guys matured, it looked like you averaged about 12% to 14% declines in Q1. And Q1s have been about 22% to 23% of your year. That kind of backs me into about a 2% decline for next year. And I know you're not going to less that number necessarily, but you're talking about orders growing, as you said. So I guess, what kind of order of magnitude are you looking for, for growth? And are you thinking of it as low single-digit decline for next year is the way we should be modeling? Thanks guys.
Rami Rahim: Okay. Let me start with your first question. And Ken, I'll let you talk a little bit more about the commentary for next year. So I'll address the Mist question from both the standpoint and sort of market dynamics and then what's happening with our business more specifically. From a market dynamic standpoint, I think it's really important to understand that the -- if you look at the campus and branch market all up, that's sort of a slow, maybe flattish-type market opportunity. Within the campus and branch market, there's actually a segment really ran cloud-managed. These are basically enterprise solutions where the control and the management of that solution is really done through the cloud. And that part of the market is actually growing at a healthy clip, and I expect that it will continue to grow through next year as well. And that is the opportunity that we are entirely focused on, at least when it comes to campus and branch. Every single one of our access point is connected to the cloud, managed through the cloud with an AIOps engine, Marvis in the cloud. And all of the growth that we're seeing now in the wired switching as well as in the WAN is happening through the cloud. And even the security capabilities, such as network access control that we've introduced, is a cloud-based solution as well. So I think it's a little bit -- it's wrong to look at the growth of just the campus and branch market all up. It's actually more useful to look at it from the standpoint of that cloud-connected portion of the market that's actually growing at a much faster clip. Then in terms of the solution itself, really, when it comes to harnessing the power of AIOps, and I know it's a bit of a used and abused words out there. I mean the proof is in the pudding. Our customers today are seeing real benefits. Reduction in number of tickets by 90-plus percent, reduction in total -- the time frame it takes to deploy a new solution from what used to be a year to a matter of weeks, if not maybe a month or so. The root cause analysis that used to take days with all of the frustration of people that are trying to use the network to do whatever they want to do has been reduced to essentially no time at all because most of the time, we're proactively identifying issues and fixing them. You mentioned Zoom. We have already integrated Zoom visibility into our Mist solutions so that when there is, in fact, some sort of a video issue, we can, if not proactively, instantly provide the IT staff visibility into whether the issue is more in the application side, the wireless side, the wired side, the cloud, et cetera. And that's the capability that our IT customers are really, really happy to see. So I know I'm maybe beating a little bit of a dead horse here. I'm very optimistic about the competitiveness of our solutions in the market, whether it be a challenged market or not.
Ken Miller: And when it comes to 2024 revenue growth, it's a little too early to provide guidance for 2024, particularly with some of the weakness we're seeing with the Cloud and Service Provider customers. But let me walk you through some of the puts and takes. I mean, clearly, the backlog drawdown that we're going through in 2023 is going to provide a pretty significant headwind to revenue in 2024. Orders are going to need to accelerate just to offset some of that backlog-related headwind that we're experiencing from a revenue perspective in 2023. With that said, I do expect orders to accelerate in 2024. I expect full year growth across all of our verticals. I also expect Enterprise revenue to grow in 2024 on a full year basis. So really it comes down to Cloud and SP and the timing and pace of that recovery. And that's a little bit too early to call at this point. So we're not giving specific guidance on 2024 other than based on the backlog expectations and our order expectations in Q1, we do expect to see a return to more traditional patterns.
James Fish: Very helpful color guys. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Karl Ackerman from BNP Paribas. Karl, your line is live.
Karl Ackerman: Yes, thank you. I have two questions. Rami, perhaps a question for you to start. So the upside in the quarter appears to be on the services side, while product growth is going the other way. I understand there is a mix dynamic at play on services given the growth that the company is seeing in Enterprise. But where do you think we are in the cycle for Service Provider and Cloud spending on product hardware?
Rami Rahim: Yeah. So Cloud and SP, as I mentioned, they're definitely going through a period of digestion after they -- for the last couple of years, have bought a lot of equipment. I mean, if you recall, in the Cloud Provider segment for us or vertical for us, there were a few quarters where their order growth was in the 100% year-over-year sort of range. So the fact that they're going to take some time to go and to consume that inventory to deploy it is as expected. And this is also happening within the SP space as well. The other thing that I can say is, if you look at these businesses over the years, there have been ebbs and flows. They have always been lumpy. And I do not believe that there's anything structural that is happening right now in either the SP space or the cloud space that would suggest that this is the new normal. I expect that they will both bounce back. And as Ken mentioned, orders in both of these verticals will recover next year. In terms of the timing, the time frame, it's difficult to say. All I can tell you at this point is that it's going to take a few more quarters of digestion before we start to see a meaningful recovery, meaningful rebound, but I'm optimistic it's going to come. And maybe the last thing I would say is the following. It's the very fact that these verticals, Cloud and Service Providers, have traditionally been lumpy that we, several years ago, decided very strategically, very deliberately to pursue the Enterprise and to diversify our business into the Enterprise. And it is, in fact, now the Enterprise, which, for the first time in our history, represents over 50% of our revenue this past quarter is giving us the resilience that we need to weather challenges in SP and Cloud. Those challenges are going to go away. It's not going to be the new normal, as I mentioned. And eventually, we'll have the benefit of a rebounding SP and Cloud business in addition to an Enterprise business that I believe will continue to perform well without all of the typical gyrations of the business that we have endured in SP and Cloud historically.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question is coming from Atif Malik from Citi. Atif, your line is live.
Atif Malik: Hi, thank you for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is for Rami. Rami, in your prepared remarks, you sounded quite instructive on the Ethernet adoption for AI clusters. You talked about front-end, back-end, infill storage. Can you talk about the timing of the Ethernet adoption? Is this something like 2025 event? Or are you seeing rail pilot or volume rollout?
Rami Rahim: Yeah. So I'm actually quite bullish about the AI cluster opportunity. As I mentioned in the last call, I think we all have to acknowledge that today, the technology of choice for connectivity between GPUs and either inference or learning clusters is InfiniBand. It's not Ethernet. However, the momentum behind Ethernet in the industry is very strong. And so I believe it is a matter of time before Ethernet reigns as the fabric technology of choice in AI clusters. And I do believe this will present opportunities for us. In terms of timing, I think next year, 2024, maybe closer to the second half of the year and in particular, what we're seeing, especially among the cloud majors customers for us, there are a lot of projects. There are a lot of opportunities out there where we are being asked. There have been some good technical dialogue about how we move Ethernet to become sort of that cluster technology of choice for either learning or inference for their solutions. And in fact, even large enterprises, we're seeing that more and more large enterprises, financial services, insurance companies, even healthcare, they're pursuing these private clusters. All up, I'm optimistic about the opportunity. I like how we stack up from a technology standpoint with the combination of our customer and merchant silicon, our Junos operating system feature that we developed specifically for the Ethernet cluster solution and Apstra, which provides the automation and the visibility into it, Ethernet AI cluster solution, that gives me good optimism for capturing our fair share, if not more, in this market opportunity.
Atif Malik: Great. And then, Ken, when you guys talk about your Enterprise revenues to grow next year, is that growth mostly attributable to the market share? Or are you seeing the overall market also grow for Enterprise?
Ken Miller: Yeah. So I expect our Enterprise revenue -- I expect our Enterprise business to grow faster than market. So I do think we will take market share. The market, as many are predicting, is expected to slow down pretty significantly next year as compared to this year, but we expect to be able to grow -- even if the market is slightly down, we would expect to grow our Enterprise business. So we are absolutely expecting market share taking.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. Meta, your line is live.
Meta Marshall: Great. Thanks so much. Maybe first question, I know on the Enterprise side, you guys are not as tied to macro just given kind of the share gain position you're in. But just wanted to get a sense of any commentary around time from initial Wi-Fi sales to kind of the upsell of additional campus switching or additional SD-WAN, just whether you're seeing an elongation of that in a more challenged macro or if it's actually shorter just given the compelling ROI. And then maybe just as a second question, just the visibility. As we've kind of extended this inventory digestion period on Cloud and Service Provider, just the visibility that you have within those customers of just how much inventory they have. What is kind of the ongoing dialogue to get a sense of just when you guys could have a little bit more sense of visibility there? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Thanks for the questions, Meta. So let me start with the first one on macro, and I think specifically the timing between sort of initial sale of a Mist solution to subsequent use cases. It honestly is all over the map. We have seen accounts that have traditionally been Wi-Fi customers have loved the technology, the ease of operations and years later, have come back to us saying, hey, we'd like to introduce wired, WAN, et cetera. But in many cases, we're actually selling the full technology stack day one. In fact, we are deliberately tracking sales of full-stack solutions, and we hit a record -- another record in Q3, where a full-stack solution would be some combination of use cases, wired and wireless, wired and WAN, wireless and WAN, et cetera. And we're continuously adding more and more of these capabilities, an example of which would be the NAC, network access control, where in the Q3 time frame alone, we added around 15 new customers and it's starting to grow quite rapidly. We're incenting our sellers to cross-sell. We're enabling them to cross-sell. It's definitely part of our sales motion. On the visibility, I guess, it really goes back to the question I just answered recently. It's difficult to know exactly how much inventory levels our customers have, but we do know that, at least for the next few quarters in both SP and Cloud, their focus is going to be on deploying what they have bought -- first receiving what they have bought, deploying it, getting it up and running before they start to feel the need to make meaningful orders again. It's just going to be measured in a few quarters.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question is coming from Tal Liani from Bank of America. Tal, your line is live.
Tal Liani: Yes. Hey. Two questions. Number one is the Cloud decline -- Cloud vertical declined 28% this year -- this quarter. Can you tell us what's the basis for the decline? Is it the absorption of historical orders? Or is it delays of projects? Or what's kind of the basis? That's number one. And number two, the Enterprise vertical, this is the fourth quarter of very, very strong growth, 37%. And if I look back, it's four quarters that you doubled the growth from the previous four quarters. And the question is the same, more or less, here. What is driving it? And then once we get to next quarter and the following four quarters, the comps are very tough. What do you think is going to happen to the growth rate? And again, I'm asking qualitatively just to understand what's driving it. Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Okay. Thanks for the questions, Tal. Let's start with Cloud Providers. The biggest thing driving the decline today is the fact that lead times have gone from what was over a year to normal, just a few weeks. And so the need for them to purchase in sort of like way upfront from when their needs are is just not there anymore. And therefore, they've just reduced the orders that they're placing. So that is the number one thing that's affecting our business. It's not the only thing. There are definitely -- there have definitely been some project pushouts. I think macro has affected their own businesses and the need for equipment. So that would be the second thing. And I think the other thing is they have shifted some of their priorities to, for example, AI, GPUs, which, as you know, are extremely expensive. So those are the main reasons. I again feel the need to reiterate: I'm optimistic long term. I do believe that nothing has changed structurally, and I believe that I would not bet against the businesses of Cloud Providers. And therefore, it remains an incredibly important and strategic part of our business. It's just going to be a matter of time before we start to see the rebound in the recovery there. In Enterprise, yes, we have seen and I believe we'll continue to see strength. I've talked at length about Mist. So I'd be remiss not to mention also what's happening in our data center business. We had record Apstra revenue. Each Apstra sale, which is our automation solution for the data center, intent-based automation solution, is pulling meaningful hardware at this point in time. Apstra new logos have grown by 80% on a year-over-year basis, and the pipeline remains incredibly solid. Next year, the compares become more difficult in the Enterprise, no doubt. And this backlog draw in 2023 that Ken and I have both mentioned does affect Enterprise as well. It's just that in the Enterprise space, orders continue to be very robust, and we expect order growth next year. So the path to revenue growth next year is much clearer. But obviously, yeah, it becomes more difficult from a year-over-year standpoint. So you should just factor that into your model.
Tal Liani: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. That was all the questions we had today, and that does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-07-27 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings. Welcome to the Juniper Networks Q2 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Jess Lubert. You may begin.
Jess Lubert: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to our second quarter 2023 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer, and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results might differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release furnished with our 8-K filed today, the CFO commentary posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website today, and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today and Juniper undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the Company's financial results is included in today's press release. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question, so that as many people as possible who would like to ask a question have a chance. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami.
Rami Rahim: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss our Q2 2023 results. We delivered better-than-expected results during the second quarter, with total revenue of $1.430 billion, growing 13% year-over-year and exceeding the midpoint of our guidance. Product revenue grew by 15% year-over-year and we saw year-over-year growth across all geographies. Profitability was also strong in Q2, as our non-GAAP gross and operating margin, both exceeded expectations, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.58, towards the high-end of our quarterly guidance range. Our Q2 results reflect strong execution by our team, as well as the improvements we're seeing in the availability of supply. We remain confident in our positioning from a technology perspective and our ability to capitalize, as our customers build their networks for the next decade, which we believe will leverage AI powered software automation, an area where we have invested meaningfully over the last few years. We believe these investments, along with our go-to-market focus, will enable us to not only deliver sustained top-line growth, but also improve profitability, even in a challenged end market environment. With respect to demand, total product orders grew nearly double-digits on a sequential basis. And while the year-over-year rate of decline improved relative to last quarter, it was still meaningful due to the strong sequential performance in Q2 2022. While we are continuing to see positive momentum in our Enterprise business, we experienced weaker-than-expected trends with our Cloud and Service Provider customers, which we believe is due to the timing of project and the digestion of prior purchases. Despite these trends, we continue to expect the decline in orders to moderate further over the next few quarters and return to year-over-year growth potentially as soon as Q4 of this year. From a vertical perspective, I remain extremely encouraged by the momentum we're seeing in our Enterprise business, which delivered record revenue results and accounted for more than 45% of our total revenue, representing both our largest and fastest growing vertical for a third consecutive quarter. Not only did our Enterprise revenue grow by nearly 40% year-over-year in the Q2 time frame, our Enterprise product orders also saw healthy year-over-year growth despite a 20%-plus comp in the year-ago period. Importantly, new logos grew by more than 30% year-over-year, which we view as an important forward indicator, given the opportunity to expand after landing many of these accounts. Not to be overlooked, deal registration through the channel and commercial orders both grew by more than 40% year-over-year, which we think speaks to the differentiation of our products and our ability to capture share. Within the Enterprise, our campus and branch business had another record quarter in Q2 with our AI-driven Enterprise revenue growing more than 60% year-over-year. Customers are recognizing Juniper's clear and defensible leadership when it comes to AI driven operations delivered via a modern microservices cloud. While the rest of the industry continues to talk, we have real AI solutions that deliver real results, including a 90% reduction in worldwide trouble ticket at a global software company, 85% fewer store visits by IT at a multinational retailer and the fastest branch network rollout in the history of a national mobile operator. Revenue from the Mistified segment of our business, which are products driven by Mist AI, had a record quarter, growing by nearly a 100% year-over-year in the Q2 time frame, with orders growing by nearly 40% year-over-year. Strength was broad across the portfolio with a record wireless, wired and SD-WAN revenue in the quarter, as well as record full stack wins where customers purchase several of these campus and branch products together. We view momentum with these full stack wins as a positive forward-looking indicator, given our belief that for every dollar of wireless, there is $2 to $3 of wired switching and additional SD-WAN opportunity. Marquee new AI-driven Enterprise customers this quarter include a Fortune 10 technology company, a Fortune 50 financial institution, an American supercenter chain, the UK's largest cycling retailer and a multinational manufacturing company. We introduced several new innovations to the Juniper Mist portfolio this past quarter, including the industry's first AI-driven, Cloud-based network Access Assurance solution, which we believe has the ability to revolutionize a very dated NAC industry. In addition, we expanded our AIOps leadership by integrating the Marvis Virtual Network Assistant with ChatGPT for enhanced knowledge-based queries using large language models. And we integrated with a leading Internet collaboration platform for superior video performance. Our Enterprise datacenter business also performed well in Q2, with Apstra reporting a record quarter, both from a revenue and an orders perspective. The Apstra pipeline continues to grow with new logos more than doubling year-over-year for a second consecutive quarter, and we continue to see strong hardware pull-through for every dollar of software, which we view as a positive indicator for our Enterprise data center prospects. Our automation driven data center revenue in the Enterprise posted a record quarter, primarily due to the increasing adoption of Apstra. New Cloud-ready data center wins this quarter include a Fortune 250 financial services firm, a large US restaurant chain and a large US government agency. The performance of our Enterprise business shows our diversification strategy is working and given our level of portfolio differentiation, balanced against our relatively modest share in the large markets where we compete, I expect us to grow both our Enterprise revenue and orders during the year, even in a more challenged macro-environment. As highlighted over the last few quarters, we continue to see accounts across each of our customer verticals more closely scrutinizing budgets and project deployment timelines due to the macro uncertainties that are happening around the world. This is proving to be particularly true in the Cloud where we're seeing more customers digesting prior purchases and pushing projects to future periods. While these dynamics are likely to pressure our Cloud business for the next few quarters, we remain optimistic regarding our longer-term growth prospects in the Cloud, given our strong wide area footprint, the rapid traffic growth that continues in many of these customer environment and the opportunity to capitalize on the adoption of large language model and the build-out of AI clusters. To this last point, we expect AI adoption to drive a meaningful uptick in traffic growth that is likely to benefit our Cloud wide area footprint over time. However, we also see an attractive data center opportunity emerging, where we believe the performance and power efficiency of our custom silicon, the congestion management capabilities embedded within our Junos operating system and our support for technologies such as RDMA networking will position us well to capture share, particularly with Cloud Major accounts that are likely to bet on Ethernet as the protocol of choice to support their AI cluster investment. In fact, we've already begun to see successes in non-hyperscaler accounts. Our Service Provider business performed as expected in Q2, but moderated on both a sequential and year-over-year basis, following the strong shipments we experienced in the Q1 time frame. We expect this business to remain lumpy going forward, as the continued momentum we're seeing with respect to 400 gig deployments particularly with some of our larger Tier 1 customers is being offset by incremental weakness with Tier 2 and Tier 3 carriers that are being impacted by the softer macro-environment. Despite these headwinds, we remain encouraged by the momentum we're seeing in our cloud metro portfolio, where our new ACX7K platform experienced a record quarter, both from a revenue and in orders perspective, and the pipeline of opportunities remains strong. We expect this business to build through the remainder of the year and become more material to revenue in 2024 and beyond. In summary, I remain confident in our strategy and optimistic regarding our long-term growth prospects. My enthusiasm is fueled by our continued Enterprise momentum and the attractive longer-term opportunities we continue to see in the Cloud, as well as the SP metro opportunity. However, given the digestion of prior purchases and the uncertain timing of customer deployments, particularly amongst some of our larger Cloud customers, we have less visibility and our revenue results are likely to be pressured over the next few quarters. Based on these dynamics, we are reducing our full-year revenue growth forecast. We remain committed to delivering improved profitability and still expect to deliver greater than 100 basis points of operating margin improvement in 2023. I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail.
Ken Miller: Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start by discussing our second quarter results, then provide some color on our outlook. We ended the second quarter of 2023 with $1.430 billion in revenue, above the midpoint of our guidance and up 13% year-over-year. We delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.58, towards the high-end of our guidance range driven by higher-than-expected revenue and gross margin. From a customer solutions perspective, on a year-over-year basis, AI-driven Enterprise led the way with revenue growth of 63%. Automated WAN solutions grew 3% and cloud-ready data center revenue was flat. Looking at our revenue by vertical, on a year-over-year basis, Enterprise increased 38%; Service Provider increased 1% and Cloud decreased 6%. Total software and related services revenue was $318 million, which was an increase of 49% year-over-year. ARR was $319 million, and grew 37% year-over-year. We were pleased to see nearly 60% year-over-year growth in our SaaS and software license subscription portion of our deferred revenue. We remain confident in our outlook for total software and ARR growth. Total security revenue was $168 million, up 6% year-over-year, due to the timing of shipments related to improved supply. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, six were Cloud, three were Service Provider and one was in Enterprise. Our top 10 customers accounted for 27% of our total revenue as compared to 34% in the second quarter of 2022. Non-GAAP gross margin was 58.3%, which was above the midpoint of guidance, primarily driven by favorable software revenue mix and higher revenue volume, partially offset by higher inventory-related expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 10% year-over-year, primarily due to headcount-related costs, but were flat sequentially. Non-GAAP operating margin was 16.9% for the quarter, which was above our expectations, driven by higher revenue and better-than-expected gross margin. Cash flows from operations were $343 million, which was benefited by approximately $200 million in deferred federal tax payments that will be paid later in the year. We paid $70 million in dividends, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share. We also repurchased $120 million worth of shares in the quarter. We exited the second quarter of 2023 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $1.3 billion. Despite the challenging macro-environment, our results for Q2 were very strong, and I'm pleased with our team's dedication and commitment. Now I would like to provide some color on our guidance, which you can find detailed in the CFO commentary available on our Investor Relations website. For the third quarter, we expect to see continued weakness in orders, particularly with our Cloud and, to a lesser extent, our Service Provider customers. We believe the softness in orders is largely attributable to customer digestion of previously placed orders and certain projects being pushed to future periods. We expect the macro-environment to remain challenged which may continue to impact customer spending. These factors are negatively impacting our revenue expectations. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to modestly increase sequentially in the third quarter 2023. This forecast assumes supply-chain related cost improve but remain elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels. We will continue to manage non-GAAP operating expenses prudently and expect a sequential decline in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter of 2023. Turning to our expectations for the rest of 2023. As mentioned previously, we experienced weaker-than-expected order activity in the second-quarter, particularly with our Cloud and to a lesser extent our Service Provider customers. We expect this weakness to continue into the second-half of the year. As such, we are amending our full-year revenue guidance to approximately 5% to 6% growth. However, we are raising our non-GAAP gross margin guidance from approximately 58% to greater than 58% on a full-year basis, primarily driven by anticipated improvements in supply chain costs. Additionally, we still expect to deliver non-GAAP operating margin expansion of greater than 100 basis points as the benefit from higher non-GAAP gross margin and prudent non-GAAP operating expense management should offset the impact of lower revenue. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to grow double digits in 2023. Our long-term financial objectives have not changed. We plan to deliver sustainable revenue growth, improved operating margin and earnings expansion over time. Finally. I am pleased to announce we have declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per share to be paid this quarter to stockholders of record. In closing, I would like to thank the Juniper team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper’s success, especially in this dynamic environment. Now I'd like to open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please proceed.
Simon Leopold: Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to discuss the weakness you called out on the Cloud orders. I'm wondering if you see this as an issue actually stemming from AI projects pulling budget from the areas where Juniper has its use cases. And if so, how do you think about really the timing and extent of the eventual knock-on effect which you mentioned? So I understand AI could be a longer-term tailwind. I'm looking for a little bit more substance on that comment? Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Simon. I think the biggest issue right now that we're facing in the Cloud provider segment is the period of digestion. It's not specific to any one customer. It's broad-based It's not even just hyperscalers. It includes the Cloud Major segment as well. To the question around AI and it being a priority, I definitely see it. There is no doubt that our Cloud customers are focusing pretty intensely on artificial intelligence, making sure that they're equipped to deal with the additional services they're going to be offering and the demand that's going to place on their network while in the short term that might have a bit of a negative impact, I think to your point in the long term, it's actually quite attractive for us for two reasons. To the extent that AI is a new killer app that's going to be offered by cloud providers to their customers, it's going to result in an increase of traffic across the board, in areas in the wide area where we have significant footprint and, of course, in the data center. And I do think as I mentioned in my prepared remarks that it could offer a nice new opportunity for us to participate in, in the data center with AI clusters being built increasingly over time with Ethernet as an alternative to what is today the technology of choice which is InfiniBand. That said, the timing to your question is -- it's difficult to call right now, but it's really in the several quarters.
Simon Leopold: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Samik Chatterjee: Yep. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, I wanted to get a sense, you're trimming your revenue guide for the full year today by about $150 million or so. I mean, the incremental weakness that you're mentioning to the last quarter is Service Provider, but if you can break down sort of how much of that revision on the guide is really coming from Cloud versus Service Providers and maybe just in terms of thinking about sort of the reduction here, I think investors are going to question sort of the discussion or elevated backlog that most companies have discussed for a while just given that even with the elevated backlog, the visibility into revenue remains pretty limited. So how are you guys thinking about sort of backlog in terms of what that backlog implies going forward, particularly given that some of the macro trends are still influencing revenue on a more real time basis? Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Sure. Thanks for the question. Yeah, so for the guidance, the reduction in revenue expectation for the year is largely Cloud. Right? I would say to a to a lesser degree, Service Provider, but the vast majority of that reduction would be attributable directly to our Cloud business. On a on a year-to-date basis, our cloud business is down 10%. I think it's likely that it ends the year down double digits. And really due to the weakness we saw in orders late in Q2 as well as what we expect to see for the rest of the year. So the vast majority of that is Cloud. I believe our Service Provider business will stay within kind of our guidance range of plus or minus 2%. So that's going to be largely intact with our long-term model. And Enterprise clearly way ahead of our long-term model and I expect it to remain way ahead as we exit the year. So the revenue decline is really mostly a Cloud phenomenon. From a backlog perspective, clearly backlog is coming down as we expected it to this year. I'll tell you it came down a little bit more than we expected given that the order weakness that we called out in Q2. So backlog is coming down. However, it still remains about 3x, what we would normally expect in kind of a pre-pandemic historical level. And I expect to exit the year -- I still expect to remain elevated as we exit the year at approximately 2x kind of normal historical level. So it's coming down quickly, but it still remains quite elevated. It is going to put some pressure on 2024 revenue growth. The backlog is a tailwind in 2023. It would be a headwind to 2024 at the backlog, but we will not have as elevated backlog entering next year as we did this year. It's going to require us to have a recovery in bookings and orders. The good news is I expect that we will have a recovery in orders. I expect next year to be a strong bookings year for all of our verticals as we kind of go through this backlog digestion period and react to the current lead time. So this year is obviously putting a lot of pressure on bookings. It's resulting in a declining backlog. I think next year would be a little more normal, but bookings will drive revenue growth.
Samik Chatterjee: Thank you.
Operator: Up next, we have Tim Long with Barclays. Please proceed. Tim, your line is live.
Tim Long: Thank you. Yeah. I wanted to touch on the Enterprise business Obviously, good numbers there, still a lot of new customers. Could you talk a little bit about kind of where we're at with kind of win rates, deal sizes, kind of cross selling if you could just give us a little more color on what's driving that? And related, if you can just touch on -- we're seeing macro impact a lot of other places. It looks like it's starting or going to start hit that Enterprise networking area soon. How do you view the success you've had in the market share gain in a backdrop where we might be seeing more pressure overall on the industry? Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Okay. Thanks for the question, Tim. Yeah. So I'm obviously very pleased with the performance of our Enterprise business. And really, this is in the face of macro-related headwinds. Enterprise is now our largest, our fastest growing segment in Q2 with over 45% of total revenue. The level of differentiation that we have in our Enterprise portfolio has never been stronger. You see it in the numbers. Our AI driven Enterprise business grew at over 60%, Mistified revenue grew at over approximately 100% year-over-year and we also saw some really encouraging signs with Apstra in the data center, specifically again for the Enterprise. The question around -- really it's around durability. What happens if there were going to be sort of signs of weakness in the market? I'd just say that the Enterprise market if it was -- it's -- there are headwinds in the in the market today. Absent those headwinds, we'd actually be doing even better. We'd be posting even better results than we have right now. And as a -- just a point of consideration, take a look at how our Enterprise business performs even during the early days of the pandemic where peers in the industry were not seeing growth we were seeing growth. And that was through new logos, share taking, which is really happening right now. I'm very encouraged with the forward-looking metrics, things like 30% growth in new logos, deal registration up 40%. This is really an indication of how much opportunity our channel partners are bringing to Juniper, commercial business up at over 40%. This is -- these are signs I believe of success to come in the Enterprise. So for that reason, I'm encouraged by the business traction thus far, revenue growth and order growth this year, and it's I think fairly easy to call revenue growth for next year in the Enterprise.
Tim Long: Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question is from Alex Henderson with Needham. Alex, please proceed.
Alex Henderson: Great. Thank you very much. A couple of just mechanics issues. Can you talk a little bit about linearity in the quarter, pricing in the quarter? Whether the push outs were both in the Cloud and in the Service Provider. And when you talked about the scale of the 24 headwinds, can you give us some sense of what the scale is on that? Is it a 2% headwind, 4%, 6% more? And what's the split there between Enterprise, Service Provider and Cloud? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Maybe I'll start with the 2024 view and then, Ken, I'll let you comment a little bit more about linearity and pricing. And Alex, I appreciate the question. So it's a little too early to provide guidance on 2024 all up, especially given some of the digestion that we're seeing in the cloud and to a lesser extent in the SP segment. However, I do think it is possible for us to grow revenue in 2024, and I'll just walk you through just some of the puts and takes to that. Backlog draws, Ken just mentioned in 2023 creates a pretty meaningful revenue headwind for us in 2024. So if you think about it, orders would need to accelerate from here to overcome the backlog related headwind that this year is presenting to next year. Now the good news is we do expect orders to grow and in fact to accelerate for the full year in ‘24. And in fact, we see the order growth to happen across all customer segments, in Cloud, in SP and in Enterprise. And the Enterprise, as I just mentioned, which is the bulk of our business continues to do well today both from an order and the revenue standpoint, it's very easy to call revenue growth for Enterprise next year. Cloud and SP, I’d just say it's a little bit too early for us to call right now. Orders will accelerate. We don't know if they're going to accelerate fast enough to overcome the backlog related headwinds for next year. So the summary, what I would say is, so while 2024 full year revenue growth is possible, it really is going to depend on the timing of order recovery for Cloud and SP. And I would say, I'm sure Ken would say this if I don't, we're committed to both margin and EPS growth next year in 2024 irrespective of what Cloud and SP does.
Ken Miller: Yeah. From a linearity perspective, I'm actually going to answer a couple of things. First from our Q2 orders, the weakness in orders really showed up late in the quarter. So that was something that happened late in the quarter. And our current visibility is that the second half of the year are also going to be down as compared to our previous expectations in the Cloud and to a lesser degree, Service Providers. So it really did kind of show up late in the quarter. I do want to touch on linearity for next year as well. I do believe it's going to be more of a back-end loaded year, a little bit different than, say, this year. So the first half of next year is going to be, I would say, particularly challenged from a growth opportunity perspective. And full year growth is too early to call. It is possible, but there's a lot of moving parts there. But I would set up a back-end loaded year, given the current situation we see and the weakness we see now is likely to bleed into the first half of next year. The other question you asked a little bit on, Alex, was pricing. We really didn't notice a material change in pricing activity. It's always been a very competitive pricing environment. It's kind of deal to deal, hand-to-hand combat in many ways. So it's really nothing to call out from a more holistic point of view on the pricing side.
Alex Henderson: Great. Thanks.
Operator: The next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please proceed.
David Vogt: Great. Thanks guys for taking my question. Maybe, Rami, can I just follow up on the Cloud digestion sort of train of thought here. And how are you thinking about where Juniper kind of fits in or slots in as either the hyperscalers or the major cloud providers really start to accelerate maybe CapEx next year in terms of where you slot in maybe from a timing perspective? And along those lines, are you seeing some of the order digestion or maybe pushouts being driven by maybe a reallocation of CapEx from Cloud customers, whether it's the hyperscalers or main cloud providers? Are they spending more on GPU-enabled servers and compute and maybe that's putting pressure on other parts of network spend? And would you just kind of give some thoughts and color on what you're hearing from your customers at this point? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Yeah, I appreciate the question, David. I think the biggest factor right now that's impacting our Cloud business is digestion. It's just unprecedented order growth over the last couple of years now being followed by a period where they need to work through the products that they've ordered, they need to receive them, they need to deploy them, and then revenue will catch up. Orders -- or recovery in revenue will catch up afterwards. As I mentioned earlier, there definitely is a lot of attention and maybe even some diversion of capital investments to AI clusters, GPUs, that sort of thing. And yes, I think that can have a short-term negative impact, not the biggest impact. Again, it's not as big, I would say, nor as near as big as that -- just of digestion. But the long-term impact of that AI cluster investment, in my view, is a net positive. And this is true for areas of the Cloud provider network where we have significant market share in hyperscale WAN, for example, but it also presents opportunities for Juniper to participate in a AI cluster Ethernet networking, which I believe becomes more dominant in time.
David Vogt: Great. Thanks, Rami.
Rami Rahim: My pleasure.
Operator: Up next, we have Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas. Please proceed.
Karl Ackerman: Yes. Good afternoon, gentlemen. I was hoping to tie in or have a follow-up question with regard to some of the comments you asked -- or discussed earlier. One is, I understand that pricing has not really changed yet. At the same time, you indicated that orders were toward the end of the quarter. So I guess are Service Provider and Cloud customers pushing back on price towards the end of the quarter? Is that some of the reason for your cautiousness? And then that's a clarification. I have a short question as well.
Ken Miller: Yeah. So just to clarify, I was mentioning that at the end of the quarter orders, the weakness showed up late in the quarter. So actually, our orders were weaker at the end of the quarter than we would have expected as we started the quarter. So linearity was not back-end loaded. In fact, it didn't come in as strong as we thought it would over the last few weeks of the quarter from a bookings perspective.
Karl Ackerman: I see. And I was hoping you can just maybe address why hardware maintenance and professional services have moderated the last two quarters despite the improving strength in Enterprise? I suppose, should we expect that to flip going forward? Thank you.
Ken Miller: Yeah. So our hardware and maintenance business really is an installed base business. So although current period in revenue and recent period revenue obviously matters, it really is about the installed base. And we have seen significant strength in that business over the last several years, where it's been growing pretty routinely, maybe not as much as product when product is growing well, but it grows -- it still grows even when products has a down period. So it's a pretty stable business that's growing in line with our expectations, to be honest with you. There is a shift happening as well to more software. So when you isolate just hardware maintenance and support, you are kind of underestimating that the true power of our services business, which is on the software side, which shows up in a different line item.
Karl Ackerman: Thank you.
Operator: Up next is George Notter with Jefferies. Your line is live.
George Notter: Hi, guys. Thanks very much. If I go back to last quarter, if I remember correctly, you guys were also pointing to Cloud customers going through a period of inventory digestion. And I guess it seems like it really intensified over the last three months. I guess my question for you is that, is that the right observation? And do you get any commentary from them about why that's intensified? And then also, I just want to make sure this isn't a market share issue. Any sense for market share or your participation share-wise in some of these accounts? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Yeah. So to answer the second part of the question first, no, we do not believe this is a market share issue. Just keep in mind that in hyperscale, our dominant footprint is in the wide area. So it is very much around sort of capital intensity, specifically for wide area investment and so on. The first part of your question, the answer is yes. I mean, it did intensify. We obviously had some expectation of how long the period of digestion would take, how long it would take to deploy new projects and it has elongated. Having said that, it's important to say that projects that we have been working on and competing for remain intact. We have not seen Cloud providers cancel projects. 400-gig deployments in the wide area, for example, remain incredibly important, especially with cloud providers having to invest in new AI capabilities. Ultimately, that's going to generate more demand, traffic growth on their network across every use case. And the projects that were in place might have moved out in time, but they have not been eliminated. And it continues to be an intense area of focus for us at Juniper.
George Notter: Got it. And then just a quick follow-on. I know you guys are working on new silicon for the PTX. I'm just curious about where that is. That's obviously, I think, an important new product delivery for Cloud customers. Just wondering where that is.
Rami Rahim: Yes. So I mean, it's looking great, honestly. I mean the level of innovation and just the sophistication of the silicon technology that we've developed, and the latest express silicon looks just absolutely remarkable. Customers that have had an early view of what we've developed, are incredibly excited about it. I believe from a market fit standpoint, it absolutely is addressing some of these big cloud provider use cases that I just discussed, and we're getting close. So stay tuned.
George Notter: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed, Mike.
Mike Ng: Hey, good afternoon. Thank you for the question. I just had some follow-ups to your comments on Samik's question on backlog. So you started the year with over $2 billion in the backlog. Are you still expecting to exit the year with backlog levels around $500 million to $1 billion? Any comments on where those net backlog reduction sat in 2023 by customer vertical? And then I just have a quick follow-up. Thanks.
Ken Miller: Yeah. So we still expect to exit the year on an elevated level, about 2x normal. And we define normal historically as -- we were $400 million plus or minus a bit for quite a period of time. So I'm talking about maybe the middle to the high end of that $500 million to $1 billion range that you talked about, $800 million, plus or minus $100 million or $200 million would be where I'd expect our backlog to exit for the end of the year. So still elevated. To date, it's been coming down fairly proportionately across all verticals. We entered the year with a pretty balanced backlog as compared to what our revenue is. That said, I think we'll exit the year with a little bit more in the Enterprise side, and we'll probably burn through the Cloud backlog at a little faster rate than the other verticals, given some of the weakness that we've mentioned on the new orders.
Mike Ng: Great. Thank you. That's really helpful. And just a housekeeping question. Orders being up nearly double digits sequentially, my model kind of suggests that implies down mid-20s on a year-over-year basis. Is that kind of in the ballpark?
Ken Miller: Yeah, we did see a modest improvement from last quarter on a year-over-year basis, and we expect modest -- we expect improvement going forward. And we could return to growth as soon as Q4. So yes, we are -- we did see some modest improvement. So that's in line, I think, with kind of where you are.
Mike Ng: All right, great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Meta, your line is live.
Meta Marshall: Great. Thanks. I noted that you guys were saying that there was some elongation with maybe Tier 2 and Tier 3 Service Providers and Cloud. Those have been areas where you had a lot of new customer wins in the last year. And so I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of -- is this some of the new wins that you had over the last year just taking longer to implement or is it kind of broader across all of the customers within that area? And then the second question is just if you could give a sense of kind of what the overhang on gross margins is still from kind of expedite fees or kind of supply chain costs? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Okay. Thanks, Meta. So the period of elongation has been mostly at Cloud, to a lesser extent in SP. You are right, we have won, we've secured new projects over the last year or two that we have mentioned on these earnings calls. And even there, where we have started deployments, some of the deployments have just moved out in time. So it applies to areas where we have existing footprint and net new wins where we've started to see some benefit, but maybe not as much benefit as we would have otherwise enjoyed had these -- had this elongation not taken place. And again, it's mostly a Cloud phenomenon to a lesser extent, in the SP. And then the second part of the question, I'll leave it to Ken on the gross margin.
Ken Miller: Yeah. On the gross margin side, we are starting to see some recovery in those costs. I would point to logistics, in particular, that we're seeing some recovery there as well as some of the expedite fees. I still think there's 70 basis points, maybe a little more, maybe a little less, impact to supply constraint costs. So there's still opportunity for it to get better. The other thing I would add is we did call out -- I called out in my prepared remarks, we are seeing some higher inventory-related expenses that were in Q2, and I expect some of those to persist into the second half, but that's been factored into the guidance that we provided on gross margin.
Meta Marshall: Great. Thanks.
Operator: The next question is from Atif Malik with Citi. Atif, your line is live.
Atif Malik: Hi, thank you for taking my question. And good to see orders growing double digits sequentially. I have a question for Ken, and I apologize, I'm a bit new to covering Juniper. Ken, why provide a full year outlook given Cloud and Service weakness? Is this because of supply chain tightness that you guys saw during COVID, which stretch your lead times? I'm just trying to understand the rationale behind providing the outlook for this year and even commentary into next year. Thank you.
Ken Miller: Yes. So with the commentary next year, just to be clear, we are not providing an outlook for 2024. We're trying to provide you with the puts and takes, right? And we do think Enterprise -- that is the one outlook we did provide. We do expect to grow Enterprise next year given the strength of our products and the differentiation we enjoy there. But Cloud and SP, way too early to call, therefore, too early to call the aggregate number. For this year, the rest of it really is just about Q3, what we're providing guidance for and really Q4. And we did provide a range, 5% to 6% for the full year. I do think that's -- based on current visibility, we feel comfortable with that guidance. We still have the elevated backlog that I mentioned earlier. That really does drive a good chunk of the revenue that we're going to recognize for the rest of the year. So it's just really the visibility we have now, we felt comfortable with that type of a range given where we are in the year.
Operator: Okay. The next question is from James Fish with Piper Sandler. James, please proceed.
James Fish: Hey guys. Thanks for the question. Look, I know you guys are highlighting digestion and also highlighted Ethernet as the kind of the main protocol over InfiniBand. But Rami, for you, just any updated view why Ethernet will be best for AI workflows? And secondly, given the increased networking demand with AI, is this part of the reason for the optimism for orders to reaccelerate in 2024? And if so, why do you think Juniper's portfolio is best positioned to handle those AI workloads?
Rami Rahim: Okay. So the optimism, I would say, is not just rooted in Ethernet being sort of the technology of choice for AI clusters, that's a component of it. But the optimism really is around the fact that traffic growth in Cloud providers continues to grow. Digestion can't happen forever. Eventually, they're going to deplete through their inventory and they're going to -- and Cloud providers are going to need to invest in their networks. To the extent that they invest in the wide area, we will benefit from that just based on our footprint. And then in the data center, as you know, we've got a very good footprint in the top 10 and on the broader cloud majors. And I would add to that, and it's in addition that AI clusters moving to Ethernet would present a net new opportunity for us. And to your question about why Ethernet and not InfiniBand, I mean, obviously, today, most AI clusters are built with InfiniBand. In the future, however, Ethernet present has some distinct advantages. From an economic standpoint, it's got a broader ecosystem. So it's not just Juniper. There will be a number of players. They're going to be innovating in the Ethernet space to capture the requirements of AI clusters. That means from an economic standpoint, customers that want to deploy large language model type clusters are going to benefit economically from moving to Ethernet. But I want to just highlight that this does not happen overnight. This is going to be something that will take several quarters, likely over a year or so, in order for Ethernet to start having a meaningful volume of business tied to AI cluster networking.
James Fish: Helpful. And if I could just follow up there on your comments. Any sense as to how much excess inventory the Cloud and Service Providers are holding versus normal? Is it more the inventory issue is on the Cloud side with kind of the deployment issue on the Service Provider side? Or is it kind of the same theme across both? Thanks guys.
Rami Rahim: Well, it's mostly a Cloud provider thing. It's to a lesser extent in the Service Provider space Obviously, they're sitting on elevated inventory. When we talk about digestion, really, it means that they are drawing down that inventory and deploying it into their networks. I think your question is really getting to the timing. And we don't know with certainty at this point in time. I can tell you there's going to be several quarters before, as they draw down inventory, do that deployment and they start to see the acceleration -- and we start to see the acceleration of orders again.
Operator: Okay. The next question is from Tal Liani with Bank of America. Please proceed.
Tal Liani: Yes. Hi, guys. Sorry to ask third question on the same topic. I just wanted to get the numbers right. Last quarter, you said that backlog was roughly $1.7 billion and the drawdown was about $350 million. This time -- and in the past, you said that the normal backlog is $300 million to $400 million. So this time, you're saying 3 times the backlog. So if I take the $400 million, at high end, it's $1.2 billion, and it means that the backlog drawdown went up from $350 million to $500 million sequentially. But then you're saying that by the end of the year, it will be $800 million to $1 billion. So that means that the -- you expect the backlog drawdown to slow down materially in the next two quarters. Just want to make sure that the numbers that we have are correct? Or if you can give us -- be a little bit more specific with that because I'm sure everyone is doing the same math to understand the backlog drawdown. Thanks.
Ken Miller: Yeah, let me add some specificity to the backlog. So we have talked about we ended the last quarter Q2 at approximately 3 times number of levels. We're between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion, right? That would be our current backlog position between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion. And I do still expect to exit the year at approximately 2 times. I'm using $400 million as my average. So that means approximately $800 million. So currently, $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, expect to exit the year at approximately $800 million. That does presume a bit of a slowdown in the second half as compared to the first half. But that's at -- that's obviously based on our expectations of shipments and bookings for the rest of the year.
Tal Liani: Got it. on the same topic, but differently, if the weakness is coming -- the order weakness is coming mainly from Cloud and a little bit less than in Service Providers. And on the other hand your Enterprise is very strong. So does it mean that the backlog drawdown is much more meaningful as a percentage of your revenues in these verticals? So I'm just trying to understand if we should assume that the backlog drawdown is mostly tilted towards the Service Providers and Cloud and less to the Enterprise, given the difference in the revenue performance?
Ken Miller: Yeah. So I do expect this year, we'll exit with elevated. I think the proportion will be more Enterprise versus how we entered the year, which was more proportional to our revenue. That said, our revenue is also starting to slag much more towards Enterprise as well. So that backlog is getting the bookings growth. So the decline in that backlog is less than the other verticals, which are actually declining on a year-over-year basis from a bookings perspective, revenue is holding up a little bit better, particularly Service Provider revenue, which is up on a first half basis. So yes, we are burning a little bit more in those two verticals as compared to our Enterprise vertical.
Tal Liani: Got it. Great. Thank you.
Operator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-04-25 12:45:00) =====
Operator: Greetings. Welcome to the Juniper Networks Q1 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Jess Lubert. You may begin.
Jess Lubert: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to our first quarter 2023 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today’s call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results might differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-K, the press release furnished with our 8-K filed today, the CFO commentary posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website today and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and Juniper undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the Company’s financial results is included in today’s press release. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question so that as many people as possible who would like to ask a question have a chance. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami.
Rami Rahim: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today’s call to discuss our Q1 2023 results. We delivered better-than-expected results during the first quarter with total revenue of $1,372 million, growing 17% year-over-year and exceeding the midpoint of our guidance. Total product sales grew 23% year-over-year and we saw year-over-year growth across all customer solutions and all geographies. Profitability was also strong in Q1 as our non-GAAP gross and operating margin both exceeded expectations, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.48, above the high end of our quarterly guidance range. These results reflect healthy customer demand for our solutions as well as the improvements we’re seeing in the availability of supply. Our teams continue to execute extremely well, and we remain confident in our positioning from a technology, go-to-market and supply chain perspective, to capitalize on our customers’ digital transformation and cloudification initiatives that are likely to further increase network requirements over the next several years. As expected, total orders softened during the March quarter, declining more than 30% year-over-year. I do not believe this reflects true underlying demand due to our customers’ consumption that previously placed early orders and the reduced need for new early orders as lead times have improved. With that said, we believe customer ordering patterns are normalizing and we would expect to see a return to more traditional seasonal patterns on a sequential basis starting this quarter. This would imply that our year-over-year order declines should improve on a go-forward basis, and return to year-over-year growth potentially as soon as Q4 of this year. From a vertical basis, I remain extremely encouraged by the momentum we’re seeing in our enterprise business, which grew nearly 30% year-over-year in Q1 with double-digit revenue growth in both the campus and branch and the data center. We also saw strong momentum in the channel where deal registration grew by more than 30% year-over-year, and in the commercial market, where orders grew by 40% year-over-year. As of the March quarter, the Enterprise accounted for more than 40% of our total revenue and represented both our largest and our fastest-growing vertical for a second consecutive quarter. Our Enterprise campus and branch business performed exceptionally well in Q1 with revenue growing nearly 50% year-over-year. Our customers are clearly recognizing the value of our cloud-native AI-driven architecture, which helps them optimize user experiences from client to cloud and minimize operating costs through proactive automation. Revenue from the Mistified segment of our business, which is defined as products driven by Mist AI grew by nearly 60% year-over-year in the Q1 time frame with new logos increasing by nearly 30% year-over-year. Wi-Fi momentum continues to outpace the market and we are seeing record pull-through of wired switching as well as increased attach of our AI-driven SD-WAN offerings. Important wins this quarter included a top-tier U.S. bank, one of the largest U.S. retailers, a leading global logistics provider and a top pharmaceutical company just to name a few. Not to be overlooked, our Apstra pipeline continued to build as new logos more than doubled on a year-over-year basis and we experienced strong hardware pull-through for every dollar of software, which we view as a positive indicator for our Enterprise data center prospects. Given our level of portfolio differentiation, balanced against our relatively modest share in the large markets where we compete, I expect us to grow both Enterprise revenue and orders during the year even in a more challenged macro environment. Our service provider business also performed well in Q1 due in large part to the timing of supply which enabled us to fulfill prior orders with some of our larger Tier 1 Service Provider customers, particularly for our MX and PTX platforms. While revenue with these customers is likely to remain lumpy on a quarter-to-quarter basis, I’m optimistic about our ability to grow this business during the year based on the momentum we’re seeing around customer 400-gig wins, many of which remain large opportunities in the early stages of deployment. We also continued to see strong early interest in our cloud metro portfolio, led by our Paragon automation suite. In fact, our ACX7K platform saw another quarter of triple-digit year-over-year order growth. With further enhancements to this portfolio expected later this year and next, we expect momentum within this business to build through the year and become more material to revenue in 2024 and beyond. I’d like to acknowledge we continue to see accounts across each of our customer verticals, more closely scrutinizing budgets and project deployment time lines due to the macro uncertainties that are happening around the world. While order cancellations continue to remain extremely low, as supply improves, we are seeing more customers reschedule delivery dates to better match current project time line. This is proving to be particularly true in the cloud vertical, where certain customers are digesting prior purchases, and we saw a series of projects pushed to future periods during the March quarter. While these delays may negatively impact our ability to grow our cloud business in the current year, based on the conversations we’ve had with many of these accounts, we’re confident these delays are a function of timing and remain positive regarding our long-term growth outlook in cloud. In summary, I remain confident in our strategy and optimistic regarding our ability to navigate market uncertainty. My enthusiasm is fueled by our continued Enterprise momentum, the success we’re seeing around Service Provider 400-gig deployments, the ongoing strength of our backlog which remains well above historical levels and the improvements we’re seeing in supply. Longer term, I continue to see attractive growth opportunities in the cloud, while we already maintain a meaningful footprint and remain closely engaged with many of these customers on potential new opportunities both in the wide area and the data center that could present additional growth drivers. Finally, I remain encouraged by the improved diversity of our business which is lessening our sensitivity to any one customer or vertical and enabling us to navigate pockets of weakness in the market by pivoting resources to the greatest areas of opportunities. Based on these dynamics, coupled with our Q1 actuals and expectations for Q2, we are raising our full year revenue outlook and currently expect to deliver at least 9% growth for the year. We continue to remain focused on delivering improved profitability and expect to deliver greater than 100 basis points of operating margin improvement in 2023. I will now turn the call over to Ken who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail.
Ken Miller: Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start by discussing our first quarter results, then provide some color on our outlook. We ended the first quarter of 2023 with $1,372 million in revenue, above the midpoint of our guidance and up 17% year-over-year. We delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.48, which is above the guidance range, driven by the higher-than-expected revenue and gross margin. From a customer solution perspective, we saw year-over-year revenue growth in all areas. AI-driven enterprise led the way with revenue growth of 48%, automated WAN solutions revenue grew 21% and cloud-ready data center revenue increased 3%. Looking at our revenue by vertical. On a year-over-year basis, Enterprise increased 29%, Service Provider increased 28% and Cloud decreased 14%. Total software and related services revenue was $232 million, which was an increase of 2% year-over-year. Annual recurring revenue, or ARR, was $293 million and grew 39% year-over-year. Deferred revenue from our SaaS and software license subscriptions grew 68% year-over-year. We remain confident in our outlook for total software growth and ARR growth. Total security revenue was $182 million, up 13% from the first quarter of last year due to the timing of shipments related to improved supply. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, 5 were Service Providers, 4 were Cloud and 1 was an Enterprise. Our top 10 customers accounted for 30% of total revenue as compared to 32% in Q1 2022. Non-GAAP gross margin was 57.8%, which was above the midpoint of our guidance, primarily driven by favorable customer mix and higher revenue volume. While supply has improved for the majority of our products, we continue to experience supply constraints for certain components and supply chain costs remain elevated. If not for those elevated supply chain costs, we estimate that we would have posted a non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 59%. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 10% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, primarily due to headcount-related costs. Non-GAAP operating margin was 14.8% for the quarter, which was above our expectations, driven by higher revenue and better-than-expected gross margin. As Rami mentioned, bookings were down more than 30% year-over-year in the first quarter. As a reminder, in Q1 2022, we were still getting a lot of early orders as customers were dealing with supply constraints and extended lead times. In Q1 2022, our product orders were over $1.1 billion. Now customers are consuming those early orders and are no longer placing early orders as supply constraints have improved and lead times are shortening. This combination is resulting in a year-over-year decline in bookings, which we expect to moderate going forward. Our backlog remains elevated but declined by more than $350 million due to improvements in supply and order patterns normalizing. Due to the continuation of these factors, we expect backlog to further decline in 2023, but remain elevated relative to historical levels exiting the year. Cash flows from operations was $192 million in the quarter. We paid $71 million in dividends, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share. We also repurchased $140 million worth of shares in the quarter. We exited the quarter with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of approximately $1.2 billion. I’m very pleased with our financial performance in the first quarter. This is a testament to our team’s dedication and commitment to delivering excellence. Now, I would like to provide some color on our guidance which you can find detailed in the CFO commentary available on our Investor Relations website. At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect second quarter revenue of $1,410 million, which is 11% growth year-over-year. Our confidence is driven by the strength of our demand forecast, our elevated backlog and an improved supply outlook. Second quarter non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 58%. We expect second quarter non-GAAP operating expenses to be flat sequentially. Turning to our expectations for the rest of 2023. With the order and backlog visibility we have and our current expectations for supply, we are raising our full year revenue guidance from at least 8% to at least 9% growth. This increase in our revenue expectation reflects the Q1 overachievement and the expectations embedded within our Q2 guidance. For the remainder of 2023, we expect to see sequential revenue growth more in line with normal seasonal patterns. However, the degree of seasonality will be impacted by availability of supply and the timing of customer requested delivery dates. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to slightly expand to approximately 58% in 2023. This is above the prior guidance of flat to slightly up versus 57.4% in 2022. However, gross margin results will depend on revenue mix and the future trajectory of supply chain costs. With this in mind, we expect non-GAAP operating margin to expand by greater than 100 basis points on a full year basis. Our non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow double digits on a full year basis. Finally, I’m pleased to announce we have declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per share to be paid this quarter to stockholders of record. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper’s success, especially in this dynamic environment. Now, I would like to open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.
Amit Daryanani: I guess the question I really have is around the order decline that you’ve seen of about 30%. It’s obviously notable here. Could you just touch on what do the order trends look like across three segments? I suspect there’s some variance there. And then maybe just related to that, I think the backlog number right now might be around $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion. What do you think the normalized level looks like? What is -- the normalized level is for backlog in a post-COVID world?
Ken Miller: Yes. So from an order decline perspective, I would want to remind you that it really is about the comparison. So a year ago, we were still receiving a lot of early orders, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, a year ago, the orders were over $1.1 billion. Now what’s happening is customers are actually receiving those orders and are no longer placing early orders as lead times are now coming in. So, you’re really seeing last year the orders were actually greater than real demand, if you will. This year, as we normalize, they’re less than what I would say is real demand as they’re leveraging what they already booked and no longer booking early orders. So that’s why you’re seeing those year-on-year declines. From a vertical perspective, we did see a slight decline in Enterprise, a very slight decline there. The majority of the client was in Service Provider and Cloud as those were the ones that were having the more normalization required compared to prior bookings. And I would say, in particular, in Q1, we did see Cloud was our weakest vertical from an orders perspective for some of the reasons that Rami mentioned in his prepared remarks. On the backlog perspective, we definitely expect to exit the year at elevated levels. I would say more than twice what we normally were from a backlog perspective pre-pandemic. So we used to be around $400 million, give or take, a little bit. I expect to exit north of $800 million, more than double normal levels as we close the year out.
Operator: The next question comes from Tim Long with Barclays.
Tim Long: I was hoping you could just dig into the cloud and the push-out there a little bit. Maybe one, just keeping on the orders, as those push out into later periods, what do you think impact that will have on future period orders? And then, anything you could tell us secondly on kind of products or technologies or any other tidbits on why these push-outs are happening? Is it just a straight digestion, do you think it’s happening across the board, or anything more in your pieces of the network with the larger players?
Rami Rahim: Yes. Let me take that, Tim. So first, I want to highlight that in Q1, what we saw mostly was a function of our ability to ship products that our customers in the Cloud segment wanted. Your question, I think, is more around sort of the demand dynamics in the Cloud. And on that, I’d say that there definitely is a bit more scrutiny of certain projects. There were some projects that did move out in time. It’s not specific to any one customer. It’s not even specific to the Tier 1 hyperscale cloud provider. I would say it’s a little bit broader than that. Having said all that, I want to emphasize that the projects that we have been engaged in around 400-gig upgrades, for example, data center interconnect, data center fabric, pluggable optics, DR, DR-plus type of use cases remain intact. I mean, I have not seen project cancellations in cloud. I’ve only seen an adjustment in the timing of those projects, which is sort of impacting the demand environment in the Cloud segment. So I expect that that -- sort of that impact to last for the next few quarters, but I do fully expect that it will recover.
Ken Miller: Yes. And from a revenue perspective, I’ll just reiterate what Rami said that the quarterly results is largely due to just timing of supply and timing of deployments. We do expect cloud revenue to recover from Q1 levels. I don’t think the Q1 levels for cloud is going to be the new norm. You saw a little bit of a shift from a supply and timing of projects towards Service Provider in Q1 with a large growth in Service Provider. Cloud was down more than expected in Q1. That will normalize as we proceed to burn through the backlog and demand.
Operator: The next question comes from Paul Silverstein with TD Cowen.
Paul Silverstein: Returning to this issue on customer delays and downsizing if not cancellations. Ken and Rami, hoping -- I was hoping for some more insight, beyond Tim’s question, just focused on Cloud, what are you seeing over time and what are terms of those delays, the increased scrutiny, how severe is it and how does that compare to 90 days ago and how has it trended recently?
Rami Rahim: Okay. Paul, thanks. So I’m not sure if I can give you that much more color than I just provided. I’ll say that we started to see some of the delays early in the quarter. Like I said, I don’t think it’s specific to any one customer. The most important thing I want to highlight to you all is that I do not believe that this is permanent. So, if it was permanent then the projects that we are engaging in -- when I say engaging in, I mean, in labs, testing specific features, capabilities, 400-gig density, power efficiency, all of these things that matter a lot to our cloud customers are still very much active. They are in motion. And so what we thought in terms of certain ramp for some projects has simply moved out in time. And by how much, it’s sort of difficult to know exactly, but I’d say sort of a few quarters. And I fully expect that the cloud demand environment is going to come back and if not by the end of this year, then next year.
Paul Silverstein: Rami, just to be clear, you specifically referenced cloud demand environment. But if we look beyond Cloud to Enterprise and carrier, is it the same comment?
Rami Rahim: Okay. Thank you, Paul. I actually didn’t catch that. I thought this was more around Cloud.
Paul Silverstein: No, it’s a broader question. Looking at the totality business, including Enterprise and Cloud.
Rami Rahim: Okay. So I appreciate that clarification. So let me say a few things about the broader environment. We did mention that customers, IT professionals, CIOs are scrutinizing orders all up. I think that’s a generic statement that really applies across all verticals. Having said that, I feel very good about our enterprise business, about the enterprise demand environment itself in that there are still large strategic projects around digital transformation for which our solutions are very well suited for both in the AI enterprise client to cloud as well as in the data center. And I also feel very good about the fact that we are a very differentiated player in a massive opportunity with relatively modest share. So, the opportunity even in a challenged macro environment for us to see growth in this segment or in this vertical, I should say, is very good, which is why Ken just mentioned that we anticipate that we can grow revenue and orders in our enterprise business for the year. And certainly, I believe beyond that as well. I will then just add to that, in the service provider space, 400-gig projects for core and edge upgrades are also still there. I’m actually feeling quite good about our service provider business for this year. You’re going to -- I don’t think you should expect the same sort of revenue we saw in the Q1 time frame to repeat because that’s very much a timing of -- a function of the timing of supply. But all in all, we’ve beaten our long-term model for the service provider’s vertical for the last two years in a row. And actually, based on current trends, expect to beat it again this year.
Paul Silverstein: All right. My follow-up question. I appreciate it’s hard enough forecasting margins in a good environment, I appreciate that much hard in this environment. But the question is, Ken, if you look beyond this year in terms of ever getting back to that 60-plus, 20-plus gross operating margin model. Any thoughts you can share? Presumably, things will improve over time. It will be a more hospitable environment. But any thoughts that you could share as to the longer term trajectory? And one quick clarification. Historically, you were kind enough to give this normalized order number where you made some adjustments. I might have missed -- I didn’t see it in this shareholder letter. Did I just miss it?
Ken Miller: Yes. So normalized orders, we talked on the last call that really what we did to create normalized orders or adjusted orders was removed early ordering. Since there are no longer really early ordering happening, in fact, the opposite is happening is they’re consuming previously placed early orders, we are no longer providing orders just because we no longer have customers ordering ahead, right? Lead times are coming in, -- so that phenomenon is no longer necessary. That’s why we stopped disclosing adjusted orders. It’s just not a phenomenon…
Paul Silverstein: I thought you made an adjustment also in the backward looking, but I apologize.
Ken Miller: No problem. On the margin perspective, we expect to expand operating margin greater than 100 basis points this year. That is not a one-year phenomenon. I expect to expand operating margin for years to come. There’s absolutely no reason why we won’t get back into the 20-plus operating margin situation in due course. It’s something we’re very focused on as we add leverage to this business as we continue to grow sustainably on the top line perspective, and actually growing expenses lower than revenue and expanding our operating margin leverage for years to come. Gross margin is a little more difficult to predict. I’ll just give you some of the levers. Clearly, volume will help, software will help but we obviously have the headwind of the mix, right, where we are going to be expanding at a faster rate, some of our lower-margin systems which will have a bit of a headwind to overall margin capability. Last but not least, would be some of the normalization and transitory costs that should also give us a lift into the future. So without giving a number, I think there’s opportunity to expand gross margin, but the one I’m really focused on and feel very confident about is expanding operating margin.
Operator: Next question comes from David Vogt with UBS.
David Vogt: Just trying to maybe kind of parse out and Ken, maybe we can go back to the order comment. I know you’re not giving adjusted orders. But what I’m trying to figure out is if I kind of use your signposts from the first quarter of March of last year, just based on the backlog commentary in the release in your commentary, it would suggest sort of order growth rates maybe a little bit below that 30% number that you’re talking about in the release. Just any help there would be great. And then second, when you think about operating margin expansion, obviously, you feel more confident to be able to do at least 100 basis points. Is there anything that you see over the next couple of quarters that sort of limit your visibility? And I’m a little bit surprised that maybe given the strength in the gross margin, you didn’t take that up to something maybe a little bit more than at least 100 basis points. Thanks.
Ken Miller: Yes. So for the order growth it’s kind of difficult to provide more color. I mean I tried to provide -- I did provide last year’s number of greater than 1.1, and we did decline this year by greater than 30%. So that’s really how the math works. I mean, one thing I will point out that I know some folks models don’t account for is our SaaS business. So our SaaS business shows up in bookings, but does not show up in backlog. It’s only a product backlog number. And since SaaS is a service revenue stream, it is missing from a lot of the model. So that might help you translate kind of your model versus our actual results. On the operating margin question, we haven’t really provided a guide or a target for the year. We’re providing a floor, right, greater than 100 basis points. Yes, I did up the gross margin guide, but there’s still a plus or minus factor there. If we deliver 58% or gross margin, our current estimate is approximately 58%, give or take, that should translate to more than the minimum on the operating margin line of 100. So, we haven’t really provided an operating margin target, just more of a floor of greater than 100.
Operator: Next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan.
Samik Chatterjee: I guess on the commentary that you had relative to seeing a more seasonal increase in orders going forward, I just wanted to dive into that a bit. Is that consistent across the three customer verticals, particularly I think in relation to enterprise, I think there’s an impression here that things have deteriorated more recently, particularly given some of the challenges and more recently on the banking or financial services side. Have you seen any of that? Is there a more consistent sort of seasonal improvement across all the verticals? Maybe you can touch on that. And secondly, I think, Ken, for you, in terms of orders getting back to growth in Q4, just wanted to check that. I mean, on my math, you need about sort of a mid-teens improvement from the order levels from Q1 to get back to growth in Q4. I just wanted to check if we sort of are doing the math, right?
Rami Rahim: So let me start, Samik. So, in terms of the return to seasonally, it was more of a broad statement around our revenue for the year. I’d say that it definitely applies to our Enterprise and our Service Provider. Cloud provider will depend a little bit on some of the project push-outs that I just highlighted that, I think, again, will be temporary. So that might change things for the next couple of quarters in Cloud. I think you also touched on some of the banking fears, et cetera, and impact of that to the demand environment, and where you would expect it to impact us would be in our enterprise business. And I’ll say that, no, we have not seen anything material or significant to the demand environment for our Enterprise solutions. And in fact, in some ways, I kind of view that the challenges that do exist in macro today is forcing enterprises to take a hard look at digital transformation as a means of creating greater levels of efficiency in their operations by leveraging automation, artificial intelligence, and AI is in fact the biggest element of differentiation in our enterprise solutions. So, it’s creating a bit of a -- somewhat of a positive effect in certain parts of our enterprise business that we’re taking advantage of.
Ken Miller: Yes. And on the kind of seasonality of the order rates, I just want to make sure -- we’ve talked about it, but I want to make sure people really understand the Q1 2023 orders were below normal. I mean, I think that’s the best way to think about it. If normal orders were $100 and prior year orders were greater than normal, say, 120, this quarter, they’re below normal, say, 80, just to get back to the normalized true growth of 100. So that’s what’s happening in Q1 results, which is why you’re seeing the year-on-year decline that we mentioned. I expect orders to get back to closer to normal, closer to that 100 normalization by the end of the year, by Q4. And by the way, Q4 is typically our seasonally our largest quarter. So I do expect sequential growth from here possibly returning to growth by Q4. And those growth rates you’ve mentioned between Q4 and Q1 are absolutely directionally correct. I mean, we expect to see fairly significant growth from this Q1 order level.
Operator: The next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.
Aaron Rakers: I’ve got two as well, if I can. I guess, I want to go back to the operating margin trend and the trajectory here. One thing that stands out to me is that it looks like your headcount growth is the highest level sequentially that we’ve seen in quite some time. So I’m curious, I think it was up -- 340 employees sequentially. I’m just curious is there a change going on as far as investing in the headcount? If so, is that sales capacity? Just how do I kind of think about that investment you’re making in headcount and I guess tied back to that operating margin returned back to 20%.
Ken Miller: Yes. So headcount is up year-over-year, and there’s really a couple of things happening. One, we’ve been talking about quite a bit, which is we are investing in sales, particularly enterprise sales, as we believe we have a lot of opportunity to take advantage of the product differentiation we have and scale that business and grow much faster than market, which we’ve been doing, obviously, and expect to continue to do for quite some time. So there is an intentional investment in enterprise sales globally. The other thing I would mention is really it’s about -- some of it is about low cost, high cost as we continue to grow predominantly in lower-cost regions. So you’re not seeing the dollars necessarily tied to the headcount growth that you might expect. And the big focus is operating margin leverage. And we’re seeing that. We have been delivering that from a revenue to expense ratio perspective over the last couple of years, and we expect to continue to do that this year. So we are very committed to managing the bottom line and expanding operating margin.
Aaron Rakers: Okay. And then a quick follow-up. Not asked earlier. Just curious, though, it seems like it’s garnering increased amount of traction with logos up by over 2x year-over-year. The Apstra business, can you help us appreciate the size of that? And again, I guess the real crux of that is the pull-through effect that you’re seeing on the hardware side. Just maybe unpack that a little bit further.
Rami Rahim: Yes. We haven’t really broken out that part of the business. But I will say that Apstra for us, the measure of success that matters the most is data center sales -- data center competitive displacements. And what Apstra does is to give us like a sort of a weapon that enables us to do just that because it is truly a unique solution in the market and that it is the only open solution, it’s a truly scalable solution, it’s the first really pioneered the concept of intent-based networking that makes fabric management ongoing operations data center super simple. So from that standpoint, it’s becoming increasingly meaningful. New customer wins are growing meaningfully on a year-over-year basis. And even if the software component of the sale is relatively small, what we’re finding is that the hardware pull-through can actually be quite large. And in those deals, Apstra is the tip of the spear in terms of how we compete effectively.
Operator: The next question comes from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes. Francis on for Sami Badri. The first question that I had was what is giving you confidence or what type of customer verticals are giving you confidence that product order growth will return to year-on-year growth by 4Q ‘23, considering the recent demand trends from other company reports?
Rami Rahim: This really comes down to the customer conversations that we have each and every day in the normal due course of business. The competitiveness and differentiation of our solutions right now, really across the board. Enterprise 400-gig offerings for SP and Cloud, of course, we also have a pipeline of funnel that we scrutinize carefully. All of these factors give us confidence that order patterns should improve from here and could, in fact, result in year-over-year growth by the end of the year.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks. And one last question. Could you actually walk us through why software and related services only grew 2% and how ARR grew 39%. There’s just a little bit of a difference between those two growth rates. So maybe just a little bit more color between the puts and takes between those two growth rates?
Ken Miller: Yes. I think the primary driver there is our perpetual software, which does tend to be lumpy. And we did see a little bit less of that in this particular period than, say, a year ago period. The more ratable software is clearly growing sustainably, but it’s still -- it’s the minority of our overall software business as our on-box Flex model -- Flex licenses is still the lion’s share of our software overall, the fastest-growing piece is the SaaS piece, which is why you’re seeing ARR grow like it did.
Operator: The next question comes from George Notter with Jeffries.
George Notter: I guess I wanted to ask about your content provider or cloud provider revenue stream and orders, obviously, quite a bit softer here this quarter. It seems like the conditions are here for an inventory correction. Is it possible that you were seeing customers build inventory of your products as your lead times were longer. And now as lead times are shortening their appetite for holding inventory is reduced. And maybe that’s physical inventory, maybe that’s an inventory of excess capacity that’s built in the network. Any sense that that might be going on would be helpful. Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Well, I think Ken touched on this, but I think the biggest factor in terms of just the order dynamics, the demand environment is that a year ago, they were placing orders for extended lead times for a year-plus out. Today, if the same cloud provider were to make an order -- and Juniper product, they would not have to wait as long. So the combination of these two things results in them going through a period of digestion. Basically, there is no need for them to place as many orders this quarter Q1 compared to Q1 of last year. I think honestly, that is the simplest way I can say what is happening in the Cloud segment right now.
George Notter: I guess the follow-on to that is, do you think that the product you shipped in recent quarters to those customers went into networks, or do you think it went into inventories?
Rami Rahim: I don’t have full visibility, to be honest. I mean, I suspect some of it did go into a network, some of it did go into some level of inventory. But the net effect of it is they are going to -- for the next couple of quarters or so going to place less orders, consume the orders that they placed a year ago for which they do not need to place additional orders because they’re going to be getting actual gear working through deployments. In the meantime, they are engaging with us on future projects, future build-outs. And that gives me a lot of optimism that we will get back to a normal state of affairs in Cloud by the end of this year or, let’s say, early next year.
George Notter: Got it. That’s great. And then also, any sense for your lead times? I realize it can vary by product line and SKU. But maybe you have a sense for where lead times were generally back in the summer of last year versus currently, I’d be curious. Thanks a lot.
Ken Miller: Yes. So we’ve kind of talked generically that average lead times were kind of in the kind of 9 months range. Some products were actually 12 months or even slightly greater kind of back in the height of the lead time extension, which was about a year ago. Now, we’re seeing on average something less than 6 months, right? We’re seeing, I would say, kind of 4 to 6 months would be kind of a better average. So that’s basically 3-plus months or a full quarter where a customer that was buying consistently quarter in and quarter out, could literally skip a quarter and provide no bookings and still be fine with our new lead times coming in to the degree that they have.
Operator: Next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.
Meta Marshall: Maybe first question for me somewhat builds on George’s question. Just on -- if you can give a sense of how much of the portfolio is still constrained. I guess I was a little bit surprised that inventory was still a use of cash this quarter. So just when you would expect to kind of be out of an inventory build situation or just able to work down some of the inventory because you’re not constrained on other products?
Ken Miller: Yes. So, the inventory constraints are getting lessened. As I mentioned, on average, the amount of constraint is less. That’s why lead times are coming down, our lead times to our customers are coming down fairly materially. So we’re starting to be able to turn inventory quicker. But what you are seeing is the backlog of purchase orders, right? I’m sure you’ve been tracking our purchase order commitments. A year ago, they were north -- almost $3 billion, $2.8 billion. They’ve come down quite a bit. They’re about $2.3 billion expected this quarter, but we’re still receiving those orders, right? So, we are going to see, I think, inventory plateau in the summer, probably Q2 or Q3. And then, you’ll start to see the outflows of inventory faster than the inflows of the previously committed purchase orders that we, in many cases, put on the books upwards of a year ago because the lead times to our component providers are over a year long. So, you’re seeing that flow through the inventory.
Meta Marshall: Great. And maybe just as a follow-up question. You guys had a very sizable cloud win that you announced at least in Q1 of last year. Just trying to get a sense of how much of an additional headwind kind of maybe comping that customer’s initial order, has -- or is that not worth calling out, it’s really this inventory across the board, across your cloud customers?
Rami Rahim: Well, all of the wins that we’ve cited in past quarters are meaningful, and they remain important, and they will help us even in the event of some slowdown or push-outs some projects. I mean having the win is still something that we’re very proud of and will help our cloud business. If not, as soon as we expected, maybe a little later, but it will still help. I think beyond that, I wouldn’t read too much into it.
Ken Miller: Yes. I think that’s really a bookings commentary, right, where you’re going to see some lumpiness at large cloud on a year ago. They might have had to book 12 months’ worth of demand a year ago because our lead times were what they were. Now they no longer need to book that level of demand. So that could result in some of this normalization we’ve been talking about on the bookings side. On the revenue side, it’s really about timing of supply. I mean you’re going to see ups and downs. You’ve seen in the past quarters, you’ll see it going forward. The revenue decline of 14% for cloud is not what I believe the new norm is going to be. It just is a factor of what we shipped in Q1, and I’m sure it will recover from there going forward.
Operator: The next question is from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs.
Mike Ng: With plans to exit this year with an elevated backlog and orders to become positive exiting the year, I was just wondering if you could give us some directional expectation around revenue growth for 2024 or discuss some of the key factors you’re considering. Certainly appreciate that it’s early in the year. How much does that backlog burn this year, just make it more challenging to achieve growth for next? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Let me start, and Ken, you probably want to jump in here as well. So I do think that we can grow revenue in 2024. We are not going to provide a number on this call, but certainly, as we get closer, we will provide. And I also do think that we can achieve good profitability in 2024. And the reason for my optimism would be, first, the Enterprise business is now our largest segment and our fastest growing. And I’ve already provided commentary on how bullish I am about Enterprise even in a weaker economic environment. The Cloud provider weakness, I believe, is temporary, and I am a big believer in the growth potential of Cloud in the mid- to long term. Order patterns are going to improve from where we were in Q1. I think we’ve hit a trough in Q1, and we should start to see better order patterns going forward, and still elevated backlog relative to historicals by the end of the year. All of these factors lead me to believe that profitable revenue growth for ‘24 is absolutely possible, and we can do it.
Ken Miller: I mean I agree, we did raise the revenue guidance for this year to at least 9%, reflecting really the Q1 overachievement as well as the expectations embedded in Q2. We are comfortable with the second half estimates as they currently are for this year, and we encourage you to keep those estimates unchanged. But that does result in a raise for this year. But that doesn’t come at normalizing backlog completely. We still expect to exit the year at least twice what we would consider to be normal backlog levels, probably greater than double backlog levels. So, that’s something that will also lead into next year as well.
Operator: Up next, we have James Fish with Piper Sandler.
James Fish: Hey guys. Most of mine have been asked. But I did want to ask, you guys raised prices about a year ago now versus kind of the backlog then. It would imply that we should be starting to get a benefit from that price increase on really gross margins now. So why shouldn’t, Ken, we get a bigger gross margin uplift in the back half of the year as a result of this kind of greater backlog flush freeing up that order that would have a higher price to it then? And what are you guys seeing with supply prices in terms of availability as well as the price itself versus the last year?
Ken Miller: Yes. So the pricing actions we took over the past couple of years are playing a benefit. If you were to look at our revenue growth this year that we just posted, 2% to 3% of that growth was likely you could attribute to pricing increases. And I think that’s going to roughly be the impact to revenue this full year, roughly 3%, give or take, of our growth of at least 9% would likely be tied to pricing. You’re also seeing that show up in the gross margin line. But just to remind you, our price increase wasn’t intended to recover gross margin. It was really about gross profit. So although gross margin is under pressure, we are offsetting the costs that we’re getting on a one-for-one basis. We’re just -- we’re not creating 60% margin on the cost increases that we’re having to absorb, but we’re actually trying to offset those costs and make them one for one, which does result in margin, not necessarily bouncing back, but it does help the bottom line and obviously EPS. So, as costs were to normalize and we could still hold price, that’s when you would start to see margin expansion because of the actions we took. So far, we’re not seeing supply costs come down materially at all. And maybe there might be a couple of components where you’re seeing some reductions, but for the most part, component pricing are staying fairly stable. We are seeing some good signs on the freight side. I will point out that we did see a reduction in freight costs on a per kilogram basis in Q1, and that was encouraging. So, some of those transitory costs on the freight side, we’re starting to see normalized, but on the other parts of the transitory costs, we have yet to see a meaningful reduction.
Operator: The next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Victor in for Simon. Thanks for taking the question. In the past, you’ve discussed being intentional about taking share in metro edge routing. Can you tell us where you see your current share position and kind of what your targets are longer term? And maybe help us understand the key product differentiators in Juniper’s plan for displacing incumbents like Huawei?
Rami Rahim: Yes, certainly. So let me first talk a little bit about the market opportunity because if you look at the Service Provider vertical all up, there are different layers of that network, the layer of the network that, in fact, is growing the fastest from a total addressable market standpoint is the Metro, which is why we think it’s such an interesting area for us. Second, it’s relatively straightforward for Juniper to enter into this market segment because we have great customers that leverage our solutions in the core, in the edge, love our network operating system, Junos, and would love to see us extend that into the Metro layers of their network. In fact, we’ve already seen a number of wins with our ACX portfolio, which is the name of the product family that serves the Metro market as a result of customers just being familiar with and very much liking the operational aspects of our network operating system. In terms of the opportunity, it’s still way more ahead of us than behind us because really the solution is just now coming together. The differentiation has to do with the fact that we’ve really built a sustainable portfolio that’s very power efficient, leverages the latest silicon technology, has certain embedded security capabilities. And very importantly, many of the lessons that we have learned in terms of the operations and automation of a network in our Enterprise segment with our Marvis AI ops engine, we are taking and applying to the Metro. And the customer feedback on that strategy has been phenomenal. So again, I feel really good about this part of the -- this part of our strategy, and I think it can be very successful for us in the future. And that weighs into why I’m somewhat bullish about SP for the year.
Unidentified Analyst: That’s helpful. And I think you touched on this a little bit earlier, but can you give us a little insight into the composition of the software? How much is hardware attached versus stand-alone, kind of what are the primary factors driving the demand for the software solutions?
Rami Rahim: Well, so software is pretty much an element of every strategic solution we’re selling across our three solution areas, right? In the enterprise, the Mist SaaS software is a necessary component of every solution that we sell across wireless, increasingly wired and WAN. In the data center space, the Apstra is an optional attach. However, it is the way in which we are competing and taking share most effectively in the data center segment today, and I’ve provided some color as to the growth that’s happening with Apstra-led data center wins. In the Service Provider space, this is a software solution we call Paragon that we’re really now sort of putting together, and we are seeing early sales in the Metro. But like I just mentioned, it’s still relatively early days right now in terms of the Metro opportunity. I’m not sure if I addressed your question, but I hope I did.
Unidentified Analyst: That’s good. That’s helpful. Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey. This is Tom Zilberman on for Tal. So going back to backlog, last quarter, your backlog declined between $250 million to $300 million sequentially, and you noted that you expected it to come down, but this quarter it accelerated to $350 million. So, any color on the acceleration of the drawdown versus your expectations 90 days ago? And does it -- and do you think that we can reach that new or that normalized target by the end of this year? Thanks.
Ken Miller: Yes. So backlog came down largely in line with our expectations, right? We knew the normalizations of ordering was coming as lead times were coming in and the need to place early orders was effectively gone, and customers are now comfortable consuming previously placed orders and no longer need to place new orders. So we knew that the bookings pattern was largely going to play out the way it did. Supply was also a little bit better than we expected, which is why we beat the Q1 revenue guidance. But we’re talking about an extra $30 million there. So maybe backlog is down about $30 million more than I expected. But overall, it’s pretty much in line with my expectations. I do think it will continue to come down. I do not believe it’s going to be $350 million, give or take, every single quarter. I think as booking starts to normalize, and we’ve been talking about how we think that could start happening throughout this year, starting now, and we actually could return to growth in Q4 and be effectively normal by the end of the year, you will then see backlog moderate. The decline in backlog start to moderate. We expect to exit the year with elevated backlog, not normal, elevated backlog, greater than $800 million, which is more than 2 times kind of our normal backlog levels.
Operator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I will now turn the call over to management for closing remarks.
Rami Rahim: So I’ll just end by saying despite the macro challenges that are out there, I remain very confident in the business. This is why we’ve, in fact, increased our 2023 revenue outlook to at least 9%. And also, we are -- we believe that we will deliver over 100 basis points of operating margin expansion. But most importantly, I think that we can achieve sustainable revenue growth and profitability in this business, not just this year, but 2024 and beyond. And thanks, everyone, for participating in the call today.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-01-31 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings. Welcome to the Juniper Networks' Q4 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Jess Lubert, you may begin.
Jess Lubert: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2022 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer.  Today's call contains -- these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties -- in 10-Q, the press release and CFO commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and Juniper undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results is included in today's press release.  Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question so that as many people as possible who would like to ask a question have a chance. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami.
Rami Rahim: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss our Q4 and full year 2022 results. We delivered record revenue during the fourth quarter, although total sales of $1.449 billion were slightly below the midpoint of our guidance due to the timing of supply and some logistical challenges at the end of the quarter.  Despite these challenges, we achieved a second consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth. A record performance by our Enterprise business and our second highest Cloud revenue quarter.  Our non-GAAP gross and operating margin also exceeded expectations resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.65, which was above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance.  Our Q4 results capped a record revenue year for Juniper in 2022, which saw us accelerate our growth despite the challenged global supply chain environment. The diversity of our strength was also a highlight during the year as we grew our Enterprise business by more than 20% year-over-year. We grew our Cloud business by more than 13% year-over-year, and we grew our Service Provider business by approximately 3% year-over-year with the revenue growth for each of these verticals, exceeding the high end of our long-term model.  I believe these results speak to the strong execution by our teams, the strength of our portfolio and our ability to win across each of the customer verticals and use cases where we compete.  While revenue growth was healthy in Q4 and for the full year of 2022, as we expected, overall demand moderated in the December quarter, with total orders declining more than 20% year-over-year. Although our Enterprise orders were flat year-over-year despite a very difficult comp.  This moderation in total orders was primarily driven by a normalization of buying patterns amongst our Cloud and Service Provider customers. This follows a year in which many of these accounts placed multiple quarters of demand in advance of knowing requirements to account for extended lead times.  Now that many of these orders placed in prior periods are shipping and with significant orders on the books for the upcoming year, Cloud and Service Provider customers are placing fewer new orders which is a trend we expect to continue through at least the first half of the current year.  As this order normalization process continues, we think revenue growth will be the most important metric to gauge customer demand over the next several quarters. I'd like to acknowledge that we are seeing some customers across each of our customer verticals, more closely scrutinize spending plans and deployment time lines due to the economic uncertainties that are happening around the world.  Order cancellations continue to remain low and our customers' appetite to receive orders that were placed in prior periods remains high. As a result, we remain confident in our ability to monetize our backlog as supply improves. That said, we're watching these strengths closely and have factored the certainties into our financial outlook.  Despite these current macro uncertainties, I remain optimistic regarding our prospects for the upcoming year. Five reasons driving my optimism include: First, our focus on leveraging AI-driven cloud-based automation tools to simplify customer operations and improve the end user experience. What we call Experience First Networking continues to resonate across the customer verticals we serve, whether it be Mist in the campus to Apstra in the data center to Juniper Paragon in the service provider market, these software automation tools are enabling customers to achieve superior scale cost effectively to rapidly identify and remediate network problems in many cases, without the need for human intervention and to accelerate the time line for network deployments.  These capabilities deliver tangible value to customers which is enabling us to win in the current market environment and may resonate even more if return on investment plays an increasingly important role in customer decisions.  Given our level of portfolio differentiation, balanced against our relatively modest share in the large markets where we compete, I remain optimistic regarding our ability to grow revenue even in a more challenged macro environment. Second, we continue to invest in our go-to-market organization to capitalize on our product differentiation and take share, particularly in the enterprise. To this point, since the beginning of 2019, we have steadily increased our quota carrying headcount, meaningfully increased our channel presence and invested in both demand generation and modern selling tools that are creating more effect and more wind in the market. While these investments have enabled us to accelerate our growth over the last several years, particularly in the enterprise vertical, they are also continuing to provide tailwinds with deal registration from the channel growing 18% year-over-year and order momentum in the commercial market growing 43% year-over-year in the Q4 time frame. We expect this momentum to continue and further benefit growth in future periods. Third, we continue to see strong 400-gig progress with more than 100 new wins across wide area and data center use cases since our last quarterly update. Many of these wins constitute franchises that are likely to present tailwinds for revenue over a multiyear period. While 400-gig solutions are critical to enabling customers to meet the continuous growth in the network bandwidth, they are also critical for improving the power efficiency and cost of operating network, which we think is likely to add resilience to these important projects.  Fourth, we continue to make progress transitioning our business to a more software-centric model. This includes transforming more of our perpetual offerings to term-based licenses, introducing more ratable subscription offerings and training our sales organization to better monetize the value of our software stack.  While these efforts remain in the early innings, we experienced encouraging momentum in the Q4 time frame, which saw total software and related services revenue grew 26% year-over-year and accounts for 21% of our total sales.  Our annualized recurring revenue, which solely consists of truly ratable software subscriptions and related services increased 43% year-over-year due to strong demand for Mist and certain security subscriptions.  We are encouraged by the progress we are making in our software transformation strategy as many of these revenue streams are recurring, pull-through infrastructure and improve margin.  Finally, we exited 2022 with an exceptional backlog of more than $2 billion, which is up approximately $200 million from where we entered the year and remains well above historical levels. This backlog is providing us with exceptional revenue visibility and should enable us to deliver another year of healthy growth.  Based on our current backlog, customer demand and our assumptions regarding supply, we currently expect to deliver at least 8% revenue growth and at least a point of non-GAAP operating margin expansion in 2023. Our expectations for 2023 assumes the availability of supply only modestly improves and that the end market environment remains uncertain.  Now I'd like to provide some additional insights into the quarter and address some of the key developments we're seeing from a customer solutions perspective. Starting with our automated WAN solutions.  This business experienced revenue weakness during the fourth quarter due to the timing of supply following very strong shipments during the prior quarter. That said, our automated WAN business grew 12% on a full year basis, which exceeded our expectations and the high-end of our long-term model.  We remain optimistic regarding the long-term outlook for our automated win business based on the momentum we're seeing for several of our newer products. To this point, our new 306-based MX 304 and LC 9600 line card continued to perform exceptionally well; with the MX 304 securing 150 new logos in Q4 and emerging as one of our fastest ramping products over the last five years. Our PTX portfolio also continues to perform well across Cloud, Service Provider and Enterprise accounts. In Q4, our PTX platform secured more than 15 new use case wins that we expect collectively will drive more than $200 million of incremental opportunity over the next three to five years. Not to be overlooked, we're continuing to make progress with our new cloud metro portfolio, which saw orders more than double on a year-over-year basis. Our pipeline of opportunities is strong, and we remain encouraged by our ability to win in the market, especially as we add new AI-driven cloud-based automation capabilities to the portfolio over the next few quarters.  Our cloud-ready data center revenue experienced an exceptional performance in Q4 and grew more than 20% on a full year basis. 400-gig momentum remains strong, and we now have more than 120 400-gig data center wins that include Cloud majors, large Enterprise and Service Provider accounts.  Our Apstra pipeline continues to build as new logos increased meaningfully on both a sequential and a year-over-year basis, and we experienced strong hardware pull-through for every dollar of software. Interest in our new Apstra freeform capability, which provides more flexible deployment options and expands the list of potential customers we can address is encouraging, and we plan to introduce new software capabilities that will further expand the use cases we can address in 2023.  Customer interest in our cloud-ready data center portfolio remains healthy. And given the wins we've already secured, I'm optimistic about our ability to capitalize on the attractive growth within this market over the next several years.  Our AI-driven enterprise revenue continued to significantly outpace the market, growing more than 30% year-over-year in Q4 and 24% on a full year basis. This strength was led by our mid-to five business, which is the segment of our campus and branch portfolio driven by Mist AI and the cloud. This area saw both revenue and orders grew more than 50% year-over-year, with record sales of AI-driven WiFi and EX switching in the Q4 time frame.  On a full year basis, our Mistified revenue was $500 million in 2022, which was up from approximately $300 million in 2021. Our Mistified orders also continued to see strong momentum with fourth quarter results surpassing $900 million on an annualized basis. The industry is clearly recognizing the differentiation of Juniper's campus and branch offerings, driven by Mist AI. We believe this is reflected in Gartner's latest Magic Quadrant for Enterprise wired and wireless LAN infrastructure that was released in December of 2022 where Juniper was named a leader for a third consecutive year and was ranked highest in both completeness of vision and ability to execute for a second consecutive year.  Additionally, the Gartner Enterprise wired and wireless LAN infrastructure critical capabilities report that was published in January 2023, Juniper received the top score in four out of five of the use cases.  On the product side, we continue to invest heavily in new key areas that drive real value to customers and partners, including WiFi 60 and new AI-driven EX switch variants such as the 41 Hybrid both of which are seeing strong early adoption in the market.  We're also continuing to make enhancements to Marvis, the industry's only virtual network assistance driven by Mist AI. Lastly, customer traction for the AI-driven enterprise remains exceptionally strong. For example, we saw a nearly 80% increase in the number of accounts purchasing at least two Mistified products during the most recent year. This highlights the attractiveness of a full stacked Juniper offering managed via common AI engine and cloud as well as the land and expand opportunities available to our sellers and partners, which we believe remains in the early innings.  Our security revenue returned to growth in Q4, although we expect this business to be pressured over the next few quarters as we transition from an appliance to a ratable software subscription model. We remain optimistic regarding the long-term outlook for our security business as we believe the convergence of networking and security provides us with a competitive advantage in the portions of the market where we are currently focused.  We're also encouraged by the interest in our software security offerings, most notably our Security Director cloud platform. This product provides customers a single policy framework to manage all their firewalls, whether in the data center or at the edge or whether on-premises or in the cloud, which is essential to help customers migrate to Zero Trust and SASE architecture.  This platform was recently named CRN Magazine's Edge Platform of the Year and already has secured more than 300 wins, which we view as an encouraging sign of future success.  I'd like to mention that our Services team delivered another record quarter, and our Services business continued to grow year-over-year due to strong renewals and attach rates as well as the growth of our SaaS business.  Our customer satisfaction scores remain at all-time highs, and our service margins came in better than expected due to higher revenue and lower costs. On a full year basis, our service margins achieved a new all-time record of 67.3%, up 150 basis points as compared to the prior year.  Our Services organization continues to execute extremely well and is focused on driving incremental efficiencies through automation and cloud-delivered insights that not only create new revenue opportunities, but also benefit margin and customer experience.  I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss the quarterly and full year financial results in more detail.
Ken Miller: Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start by discussing our fourth quarter results, then cover our fiscal year 2022 and end with some color on our outlook.  We ended the fourth quarter of 2022 with record revenue of $1.449 billion, up 11% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. This was below the midpoint of our guidance due to the timing of supply and some of the logistical challenges towards the end of the quarter. Despite the slight revenue shortfall, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.65 and which was above the midpoint of our guidance, driven by a better-than-expected gross margin result and prudent operating expense management.  In terms of product orders, as expected, we saw a decline due to buying patterns normalizing and customers consuming previously placed orders. This was more pronounced with our Cloud and Service Provider customers. We expect this dynamic to continue as supply improves and backlog normalizes.  During the fourth quarter, total product orders declined more than 20% year-over-year. Adjusted orders placed to accommodate for the extended lead times, declined single digits year-over-year versus a difficult comparison, but grew sequentially. Our adjusted orders calculation only includes a one-way adjustment to reduce bookings due to accelerated ordering.  During the entire time that we've reported adjusted orders, we have not added those orders back into future periods where they would have normally been placed. We believe that if we were to add back those accelerated orders, adjusted orders would have grown in Q4 of 2022.  We exited 2022 with backlog of slightly more than $2 billion, which is down sequentially but up approximately $200 million on a year-over-year basis.  Looking at our revenue by vertical. Enterprise had record revenue and was our largest vertical in the fourth quarter. increasing 32% year-over-year and 16% sequentially. Cloud grew 14% year-over-year and increased 1% sequentially. Service Provider declined 8% year-over-year and 10% sequentially.  From a customer solutions perspective, AI-Driven Enterprise revenue grew 30% year-over-year and 19% sequentially. Cloud-ready data center grew 50% year-over-year and 13% sequentially and automated WAN solutions revenue was down 4% year-over-year and 10% sequentially.  The total software and related services revenue was $305 million, an increase of 26% year-over-year. Annual recurring revenue, or ARR, grew 43% year-over-year, and we exited the year with $294 million in ARR. Total security revenue was $169 million, up 5% year-over-year and up 21% sequentially.  In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, six were Cloud, 3 were Service Provider and 1 was an Enterprise. Our top 10 customers accounted for 34% of our total revenue as compared to 33% in the fourth quarter of 2021.  Non-GAAP gross margin was 58.5% in the quarter, which was above our guidance midpoint, primarily driven by the favorable software mix and to a lesser extent, some improvement in transitory supply chain costs which more than offset an unfavorable product mix. Supply chain continues to be constrained with long lead times and elevated costs. If not for the elevated supply chain costs, we estimate that we would have posted non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 60%.  Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 7% year-over-year and was up 1% sequentially, primarily due to headcount-related costs. We exited the quarter with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $1.2 billion.  Cash flow from operations was $120 million for the quarter. Turning to capital return. We paid $68 million in dividends, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share. We also repurchased $88 million worth of shares in the quarter.  Moving on to our full year results. Our revenue for 2022 was a record, coming in at $5.301 billion, which is 12% growth versus 2021. Despite the impact of supply chain constraints, we saw growth across all verticals, customer solutions and geographies.  Our Enterprise business became our largest vertical and grew 21%. Our Cloud business grew 13%, while Service Provider grew 3% year-over-year. From a customer solutions perspective, AI-driven enterprise revenue increased 24% and Cloud-ready data center revenue grew 21% and automated WAN solutions revenue grew 12% on a full year basis.  Total software and related services revenue was $994 million, which was an increase of 31% year-over-year. This exceeded our expectations as we continue to make meaningful progress in transitioning our business to more of a software and SaaS-centric model.  Total security revenue was $629 million, which was down 4% year-over-year. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the year, six were Cloud, three were Service Provider and 1 was an Enterprise. Our top 10 customers accounted for 33% of our total 2022 revenue as compared to 31% in 2021.  Non-GAAP gross margin was 57.4%, a decline of 230 basis points versus 2021, primarily due to the product mix and increased supply chain costs. If not for elevated supply chain costs, we estimate that we would have posted non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 60% in 2022.  Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 6% year-over-year primarily due to higher headcount-related costs. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.95 in 2022, an increase of 12% versus 2021. During 2022, we repurchased $300 million worth of shares and paid $270 million in dividends.  I am very pleased with our financial performance, both in the fourth quarter and throughout 2022. Now I would like to provide some color on our guidance, which you could find detailed in the CFO commentary available on our Investor Relations website.  At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect first quarter revenue of $1.34 billion, which is 15% growth year-over-year. We are still experiencing supply chain-related headwinds associated with shortages as well as elevated components and freight costs, which are expected to modestly improve through the course of 2023.  First quarter non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be down sequentially to 57% due to a normalized software mix and seasonality. We expect first quarter non-GAAP operating expense to increase sequentially, primarily driven by the typical seasonal increase of fringe costs. Despite these increases, non-GAAP operating margin is expected to increase more than 100 basis points versus Q1 2022.  Turning to our expectations for the full year 2023. Given the ongoing customer demand for product, solid exiting backlog and improved supply, we're updating our revenue growth expectations for 2023 from at least 7% to at least 8%. Beyond the first quarter of 2023, we expect revenue to grow sequentially throughout the course of the year. This assumes the current supply chain environment modestly improves but remains challenged.  This forecast as soon as we reduced backlog during the course of the year. However, we expect to exit the year with elevated backlog compared to historical normal levels. While non-GAAP gross margin can be difficult to predict, we expect full year non-GAAP gross margin to be flat to slightly up year-over-year. We remain committed to disciplined expense management and full year non-GAAP operating margin is expected to expand by at least 100 basis points versus 2022.  That said, we will continue to invest to take advantage of market opportunities and non-GAAP operating expense is expected to be up on a full year basis. Our non-GAAP tax rate on worldwide earnings is expected to be 19%, plus or minus 1%. Our non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow double digits on a full year basis. Finally, I'm pleased to announce we have declared a 5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.22 per share to be paid this quarter to stockholders of record.  In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success, especially in this dynamic environment. Now I'd like to open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question is from Tim Long with Barclays.
Tim Long: Yes, just a two-parter on the orders, if I could. Maybe, Rami start with you. You're obviously coming up tough compares in a strange environment with the multi-quarter ordering. Is your view that the Service Provider and Cloud customers are going to, over this period, over the next six months or so, be well below trend line and kind of ordering well under consumption? Or is it just something that works out over time? And then maybe, Ken, if you could just give us a little more on the math here. I think if it was $2.3 billion or so last quarter for backlog and a little over $2 billion this quarter, implies a lot more than a 20% decline. So is there something else in the order backlog math there that we're missing?
Rami Rahim: Tim. Okay, I'll start, and then Ken, I'll pass it on to you. So what we saw from an order standpoint in Q4 is pretty much expected. Yes, the compares are getting very difficult. A year ago period, definitely Service Providers and Cloud providers were placing orders for multiple quarters in order to get ahead of supply constraints. Enterprise is a little bit of a different story. We actually saw flattish type order momentum on a year-over-year basis in Q4, but that was off of a very difficult compare in the Enterprise segment, where a year ago period in Q4, this would be in '21, orders grew over 40% year-over-year.  So looking forward to your question, I do think there will be for the next at least couple of quarters, a re-normalization of order patterns for Service Providers and Cloud providers as they consume orders that were placed a year ago period and in the Enterprise, I actually think that order momentum will continue. I think if I look at it to 2023, we should continue to see solid Enterprise growth, both from an order standpoint as well as from a revenue standpoint.
Ken Miller: Yes. And I think it's worth reiterating, even though I made a comment in my prepared remarks that when we talk about adjusted orders, which were down for the first time on a year-over-year basis, but up sequentially, we really are just doing that one-way adjustment that I referred to. So if you were to normalize and add back those accelerated orders in the proper period, if you will, some of that would have been added back to the last quarter, Q4 '22, and we believe it would have actually shown growth, had we made those adjustments on both sides of the equation, we only did the takeaway side. So I want to make sure that's clear to folks.  From a backlog perspective, I mean, the math really is -- the primary driver of why the backlog decline was orders being down greater than 20% on a gross order basis. We also did see some growth in revenue as well as growth in deferred revenue that I would point to that some of the backlog doesn't get recognized immediately, particularly some of the software subscriptions and SaaS business that is in backlog until we actually invoice or execute that delivery which gives to deferred revenue versus revenue. So that growth also has an impact on backlog.
Operator: The next question is coming from Alex Henderson with Needham.
Alex Henderson: The first question I wanted to ask was on the Services side of the equation. Obviously, there's a clear tie to future services as you ship more product. And with the product sales accelerating, it's hard for us to determine how rapidly that rolls into the income statement.  So I was hoping you could give us a little bit more granularity around what you think Services revenues are going to do in the first quarter kind of growth and for the year, what kind of growth might we anticipate there? How much is that contributing to the increase.
Ken Miller: Yes, I'll take that one. So we are seeing -- as you mentioned, Alex, the Product revenue does have a direct correlation to our Service revenue opportunity as our installed base gets bigger, given the pretty positive product revenue results of both 2022 and 2021, you are going to see, I believe, that have a positive impact on Services going forward.  So Services is a bit of a lagging indicator. It doesn't -- is not as volatile. Typically, you won't see as large of increases or as large of decreases as product kind of gets a little bit normalized, but trying to convert it to installed base and services. But I would expect our Services business to continue to be strong in 2023 as it has been strong in 2022. And the other thing I would point to is our margin is also quite positive in our Services business. The team has done a great job there. Not only satisfying customers and renewals, et cetera, but also really working down the costs.
Alex Henderson: The growth rate accelerated from 4% to 7% to 8%. Is that kind of high single digits, the rate we should be anticipating both in the March quarter and the year?
Ken Miller: Yes. We're not giving specific guidance on Services, but I would say, as I mentioned, it is kind of -- it's a lagging unit care, it's not that volatile. So I wouldn't expect significant step function changes anytime soon. That said, maintenance business is the vast majority, but there also is a software element which is our SaaS element, which has been a big part of the growth of our services business over the last few years as more of our software revenue is getting recognized in the form of SaaS revenue.
Alex Henderson: Okay. The second question I wanted to ask is you had a very significant increase in the cloud-ready data center year-over-year in the fourth quarter. That looks like it's somewhat of a spike versus a decline in the year ago, but nonetheless, a significant increase. Is that a function of that segment getting more of the available supply? What's the reasoning for that?
Rami Rahim: Yes. Alex, I'll take that one. So obviously, very pleased with our cloud-ready data center momentum and success that we saw in Q4 time frame. Over the last several quarters, we did highlight a couple of meaningful wins, one in particular, in a Top 10 cloud provider that was a data center win. So this would be a part of our CRDC business and the solutions that we're developing in that business. So whereas in prior quarters, that was sort of shown in terms of orders, now we're actually starting to see the revenue contribution.  There are other elements as well. I think our focus on software-led data center sales in much the same way as we've seen Mist lead to success in the AI-driven enterprise. Cloud-ready data center is still in the earlier phases of that growth period, but we're starting to see a pickup in Apstra-led type opportunities where the net new logos and the sort of the strategic nature of those logos are actually starting to contribute nicely as well. I would not expect this kind of cloud-ready data center performance on an ongoing basis, but again, I do think that I'm optimistic about the overall growth prospects for this business.
Operator: The next question is from George Notter with Jefferies.
George Notter: I guess I wanted to ask about your thoughts on the composition of the growth this year. You said at least 8% revenue growth and I know if we look back, you guys have instituted some price increases, I think Q3 included. But how much of that 8% plus growth do you think really comes from pricing versus units? How do you think about it?
Ken Miller: Yes. So pricing is factored in, obviously, to our outlook. And the way I would describe it, George, is we expect the majority of that 8% to be volume based. There is definitely a pricing element, but it would be less than half, assuming we did revenue at 8%. Obviously, as we grow, if we were able to grow faster than eight, we did put 8% out there was a bit of a floor, but we talked about at least 8%. The majority of that incremental would also be volume related.
George Notter: Got it. And then as I think about the unit volume piece. Is that really driven by new products, Mistified or ACX or some of the other new initiatives you've got? Or do you think it's -- what's the dynamic between sort of existing versus new products?
Ken Miller: Yes. We're not giving too much detail on exactly the composition of 2023. But I would say this, though. I mean, I think the relative growth that we've outlined in our long-term model and actually that we've delivered for the last couple of years. So if you look at it by vertical, I would expect Enterprise to be our fastest-growing vertical and the products associated with Enterprise are predominantly AIDE and campus and branch, as well as some of our CRDC products.  Then you could follow that by Cloud, which is predominantly routing and data center switching and then followed by Service Provider would be our slowest-growing vertical. So I do think relative mix of our products and the mix of our verticals from a growth rate perspective is likely to play out similarly in 2023. But at this point, it's a little bit too early to call the exact components of revenue growth.
Operator: Okay. The next question is coming from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.
Samik Chatterjee: I guess my question was going to be about Service Provider revenues and if you could give us some more color there. It was down year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. And Rami, I think in your script, you mentioned sort of revenue is going to be the driver or sort of the metric to judge sort of demand from. So what are you seeing in relation to sort of demand from that vertical? You mentioned scrutiny from customers. So are telco customers scrutinizing budgets a bit more than the other verticals? And how should we think of the CapEx positions impacting you here over the sort of next 12 months?
Rami Rahim: Yes. Thanks for the question, Samik. So what we saw in Q4 was mostly, if not entirely a function of supply. And that's not totally unusual to see this kind of a pullback after a very strong quarter. And if you recall, Q3 was actually a great quarter for Service Provider because we happen to be able to ship quite a large volume of products that was required that was on our balance sheet and also new orders that came in, in the quarter.  So -- but there's more that's happening in the Service Provider segment. First, we're monitoring closely new products that we have introduced over the last, let's say, a year or a couple of years or so. and we're seeing some really strong pickup, which I think gives us confidence in the next few years, if you will, in terms of the dynamics for this segment.  The MX 304 is the fastest-growing product in the last five years, the PTX product family, which really goes to the heart of the 400-gig opportunities that are out there is performing really well as well. I just finished answering questions about the cloud-ready data center. One of the things that's actually driving momentum in our CRDC solutions is the fact that there is a strong diversity of interest among all of our segments especially including Service Providers that are moving to more of a virtualized approach to delivering the kind of services that we're delivering in the past.  So there's a number of elements of this business that I think are positive for us long term. In the short term, we're going to get through this normalization of order patterns to revenue, as we just discussed. But long term, being in line with our long-term model, minus two to plus two or even better is definitely possible.
Operator: The next question is from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse.
Sami Badri: I had two questions. When you talk about 8%, you're using the words at least versus prior, I believe the word you would use is floor. Is it -- should we assume 8% is the floor of growth for 2023? So that's the first question. And then the other question is of the product orders that were submitted in 4Q of '22, how much of the growth was driven by price increases versus volume just so we can get a better idea on composition of the backlog and how that change in 4Q?
Ken Miller: Yes. I'll take both of those questions. So when we do -- the words we use officially is at least 8%. And when I describe it often times, I referred to that as the floor, right, because we're setting a range starting at 8%, and we're not really putting a ceiling on it. That's why I described the at least 8& as the floor. But if not, much confuse you, it's meant to be really -- it's the same guidance.  As far as price versus volume, again, I would say we are definitely getting a benefit from the pricing actions we've taken. It is impacting growth, but it is the minority of our growth, right? And the vast majority of our growth is tied to volume sales and quite honestly, taking shares in some of those markets that we're absolutely taking share and such as AI-driven enterprise in the campus branch base and I think we had a very strong quarter in data center as well. So I do prescribed our growth to the success and execution of the team much more than I do the pricing actions we've taken.
Operator: Okay. The next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James.
Simon Leopold: I wanted to get a better sense of the trends coming from Service Providers in that. It sounds like you're blaming this quarter's relative weakness on supply chain, but there's been some others exposed to that vertical that have talked about. Inventory absorption and some of the operators slowing down either in the fourth quarter or first half of '23 as they maybe manage their own cash flow or manage their inventory of gear. I'm presuming that your customers haven't been able to stockpile your equipment and warehouses and don't have that inventory issue for you in the first half of '23. But I just want to get a sense directly from you if that's a factor of what's going on here or whether it's really concentrated around component shortages.
Rami Rahim: Let me start, and then, Ken, you might want to weigh in as well. So are there macro sort of challenges weighing in on the Service Provider segment. As I said in my prepared remarks, there are definitely customers across all segments, including in Service Providers that are, let's just say, scrutinizing orders a bit more, looking at time lines for projects, making sure that they're spending as efficiently as possible. So that is happening without a doubt. Having said that, our outlook, our long-term model for Service Provider is a minus two to sort of plus two range. We've managed to exceed that over the last couple of years. I actually think we can still, even with these sorts of macro challenges that are -- that we're seeing out there, maintain that sort of long-term range. Just based on some of these factors that I just mentioned in answering the prior question, right, there are still 400-gig projects that are out there that remain exceptionally important for Service Providers in order to keep ahead of their demand pattern in their networks.  Metro opportunities are definitely still there. The need to carry an increased amount of 5G traffic in fiber optic networks. The need for highly automated Metro solutions continues to be there, and this is a net new market opportunity for us. So net-net, I actually am long term, quite optimistic about this segment despite some of the macro concerns that might be out there?
Ken Miller: The only thing I would add is as I've said before, any 90-day period, you're going to see a little bit of lumpiness Q-to-Q based on either vertical cuts or customer solution cuts. That really is a factor of inventory and supply and what we're able to ship in any given quarter. I think a longer-term view of FY '22 was more indicative of what our Service Provider business is doing, and we did post 3% growth, as Rami mentioned, above our model. So I feel good about the space overall. Based on the customers conversations we've had and the supply constraints, quite honestly, that we've had over the last few quarters, we do not believe customers are sitting on excess at inventory levels. It's not something that we're particularly worried about at this point. They clearly are able to not book as much as they did prior because they're no longer accelerating orders and are actually -- we're actually delivering the orders they booked previously. So the bookings is getting impacted. But from a revenue perspective, we're not seeing that impact.
Operator: Okay. The next question is coming from David Vogt with UBS.
David Vogt: You guys were pretty clear, I think, on all the puts and takes in '23, but I wanted to ask a question about normalization. And so if you think about your order growth pattern over the last couple of years, it's been incredibly strong, but your backlog exiting 2020 was roughly about $400 million, and your business is about 20% bigger today. So when we start to think about what normalized order growth rates look like and backlog looks like, how should we think about where backlog should be relative to where you were, let's say, two years ago or 2.5 years ago and your desire to obviously build some buffer stock to meet customer demand. Should we expect backlog to be a normalized period sort of commensurate with sort of the ratios that we've seen in the past? Or should we expect a slightly higher uptick in the backlog going forward when things normalize?
Ken Miller: Yes. It's a really good question. And quite honestly, if something, I don't have a perfect answer to you, but I'll let you know what I expect to happen. So I absolutely expect backlog to start to normalize, and I expect us to -- backlog to reduce in 2023. I still expect that we'll exit the year with what I refer to as elevated backlog. I don't exactly have the number for you, but I do think we'll exit the year elevated. So it will start to reduce, but remain elevated, would be my expectation. And what the new normal is hard to say.  And as you mentioned, historically, we've been in that kind of $400 million to $450 million range for quite some time. I would like to think that the new normal is going to be greater than that, maybe closer to somewhere between $500 million and $1 billion as I think customers understand the value of giving us orders a little bit earlier, giving us a little longer lead times to react. I'm hoping that the new normal is a little less frantic as it was just a few years ago when we were starting the quarter with not enough backlog. So I feel good about our backlog position, obviously, the variability of it. I think it will decline throughout 2023 but remain elevated and work finally settled a couple of years from now, it's hard to predict, but I would like to speak more than where we were in that 400-level.
Operator: The next question is coming from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.
Amit Daryanani: I guess the first one I had was when you put talked about the order trajectory, you talked about auto going down on Service Provider and Cloud side, but they've be running to be flattish on the Enterprise side. I was wondering if you can talk about why are you seeing such a deviation in auto trends between those 3 buckets? And on the Enterprise side, is it flat because you're picking up share? What's to the better performance there versus other 2.
Rami Rahim: Yes, I'll start. So SP and Cloud, primarily because of the fact a year ago period and before that, they were just doing more ordering for multiple quarters to get ahead of the supply constraints that we were facing. And I think it's not unusual because typically the kinds of projects that SPs and Clouds are engaging and tend to be just very strategic, very large. They require a lot of upfront planning and for that reason, that early ordering was just happening in more abundance. It also did happen in the Enterprise just not to that same extent.  I think the second part of your question is about sort of the order momentum we're seeing in the Enterprise and why. I think we're just executing exceptionally well on the Enterprise across the board, pretty much every solution area, whether it be data center, are, of course, our AI-driven enterprise solution, even in the WAN, we had a great federal government quarter, for example, we're sort of firing on all cylinders. Our competitive differentiation and our solutions, especially in our AI-driven enterprise solution continues to work really well for us. And for that reason, Enterprise is now Juniper's is the largest segment. A few years ago, there was actually some doubt about whether Juniper can win or succeed in the Enterprise, and I think those doubts are pretty much behind us at this point.
Ken Miller: The only thing I would add is we've had a lot of momentum in Enterprise for the last several years, and we actually expect 2023 to be a growth year for Enterprise, both from a bookings, order perspective as well as a revenue perspective and I know we aren't naive to some of the macro conditions out there. But given the product differentiation we have, kind of the market share we have, the opportunity in front of us, we feel pretty confident we can continue to grow the enterprise in 2023 despite kind of some of the macro conditions.
Operator: The next question is from Tal Liani with Bank of America.
Tal Liani: I have two questions on -- related to the backlog. If the backlog is down $300 million or $250 million in Q4. Do you -- and we are entering into a year that is supposed to be tougher for spending because it's really only -- really only starts this year. Does it mean that the backlog declines could accelerate this year on a sequential basis, dollar basis, et cetera? That's the first question.  And the second question is how should I think about the adjustment of backlog? I'm trying to think about what could the growth rate be after the backlog is adjusted down if the order -- if the environment is not changing. So when I look at the sequential basis of 4Q, last year, it was up 10% roughly. And this year, if I remove this quarter, if I remove the backlog, there is a 25% delta between the growth you had last year and the growth you have this year because without the backlog, you were down 15% instead of being up 10%.  So the question is, is the order environment deteriorate that much between 3Q and 4Q? And then how does it carry on to 1Q, 2Q, 3Q, when the year progresses and the spending environment worsened in some sense. So again, my question is more about understanding how could the environment look like once you consume the backlog if the order environment doesn't change much.
Ken Miller: Yes. So let me start with that. So from a backlog perspective, we did see a decline in the fourth quarter, as you noted, sequentially. However, I think it's important to note, backlog was up approximately $200 million year-on-year, right? So for the full year, we had a pretty strong bookings year and actually grew backlog, but you are starting to see that decline and you're starting to see orders, I would say, normalized, but actually, that's really not the right way to say it.  Customers have already placed orders, and we are now shipping those orders. So actually orders are understated, if you will, the true demand whereas the past 3 quarters, orders have been overstating through demand because they've been accelerating orders to account for multiple periods of time to adjust the lead times, now kind of the opposite is happening. And as I mentioned, we're not adding that back in.  So the bookings number is going to be very unusual, I believe. This like it has been on the positive side. I think you're going to see something similar on the negative side going over the next couple of quarters, which is why we think revenue is really the best demand metric you have. And backlog will come down, we haven't stated exactly how much and the timing of it, it really does depend on our ability to capture supply, which is uncertain at this point, but we do expect it to come down throughout 2023, but remain high as we exit the year as customers are basically consuming orders we've already received.  So I look at it as kind of a burden hand better than two in the bush scenario, where we already have the orders that really is the demand for 2023 in-house. And as we shift that it's going to play havoc on growth rates for current period orders.
Rami Rahim: And I'll just add on this. I think Ken summarized the situation for Q4 really well. Orders that we would have otherwise received in Q4, we already had them in hand because of customers that were early ordering, especially in SP and Cloud.  As we look at it to 2023, orders don't need to grow in order for us to hit the at least 8% in revenue growth for the year. But I actually think they can grow. And in the Enterprise, I believe they will grow.
Operator: Okay. The next question is from James Fish with Piper Sandler.
James Fish: Rami, for you, a big topic that's coming up is AI workloads. Is there a way to think about the opportunity -- or is that going to be out throughout the course of the year? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: 2022 and I think it's a demonstration -- that drive market share taking for our Enterprise business, and that -- our Paragon automation for the metro within the Service Provider debate.  Now having said that, I think your question is more around cloud providers and the opportunity that AI presents to us in terms of supplying the infrastructure necessary to keep up with demand. And earlier in this call, I mentioned how long term, I'm actually quite bullish about long-term cloudified businesses. And one of the reasons is because of AI. I believe that this is going to be yet another big initiative or a catalyst to increase traffic within the data centers and in the WAN leading or ending in their data centers among all cloud providers that they will have to get ahead of. And they get ahead of that by building higher performance, more cost effective, more cost-efficient networks, both within the data centers and in the wide area network. We will benefit from that because of the existing footprint that we already have within the cloud space -- as you know, we're in pretty much all of the major cloud providers, hyperscale and the top 10 cloud providers as well.  Add to that the new 400-gig opportunities that become exceptionally important to carry all this traffic cost effectively. And I think it bodes well for our cloud provider business in the long run.
Ken Miller: Yes. And to your second question, so from a backlog perspective, we believe our backlog remains extremely durable. Level of cancellations remain extremely low compared to the backlog levels, and I expect that cancellation level to remain low going forward. From a Q4 kind of timing of revenue mix perspective, you're right in that the Q4 miss basically made -- we made that up in Q1. So it really was a timing thing. We had a few more days. We would have made the quarter's expectation, but that rate did slip into Q1. We've already made that up. You can see that reflected in the Q1 guide of $13.40 which lower sequential than we normally see from a Q4 to Q1. So I believe that has been made up.  And other thing I'd mention is on the Q4 margin, which wasn't asked about, we did see some favorableness in the Q4 margin. Some of that is due to software mix and quite honestly, some of that's because we couldn't ship some of the hardware we were expecting to ship, which was at a lower margin. So that also has an impact on Q1 guidance where you're seeing margin come down seasonally a little more than normal off of Q4. It always -- it normally comes down, it comes down a little more to that software mix and as it relates to margin in 2023, I do think there's opportunity for margin to be flat to modestly up. I do expect there to be some improvement in some of those expedite fees and freight costs. That said, there's a lot of uncertainty with gross margin, and I feel that the street models as they are, the expectations there currently has, I would encourage you to keep those as they are for 2023. Operator, we'll take two more questions.
Operator: The next question is coming from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Jake on for Aaron. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the momentum you're seeing in 400G and any changes in the competitive landscape there?
Rami Rahim: Yes, I'd be happy to. So for 400-gig there's been 100 new wins between Service Providers and Cloud providers since our last update, which was a quarter ago. In terms of competitive landscape, it's always been a competitive environment. I believe that we have real strength, experience and know-how, especially in the WAN for service providers and hyperscale cloud providers where we can leverage our existing footprint in order to basically understand the specific feature by feature requirements and do sort of incremental upgrades to 400 gig.  But we're actually also seeing some really promising success, if you will, in the cloud-ready data center space, and they basically inside the data center switching fabric with 120 cumulative total 400-gig data center wins now and I do believe that we're in the early innings right now. I get this question quite a bit, where I know it feels like we've been talking about the 400-gig opportunity for a while. But actually, it's still early periods because there's sort of this time period in the early part of any new Ethernet speed inflection point that starts with the introduction of optics, the optics have to become cost-effective. Then the project need to actually start to kick in. There's a testing period and there is a deployment period. I actually think that we're sort of right now in the early stages of that growth, and I do believe that it's going to be a wonderful opportunity for us, especially in SP and Cloud.
Operator: This completes the -- absolutely. Last question is coming from Fahad Najam with Loop Capital.
Fahad Najam: I hate to go back to the topic of order normalization. Can you maybe help us maybe add a dimension of where lead times are? And should we expect as lead times now, customers will place orders as they normalize. Any indication on how lead times are trending? And then I have another question on what you're seeing on the broader market in terms of demand trends. You cited some macroeconomic challenges. Is it more pertaining to site segments like high tech or is it more broad? Any color there would be also very helpful.
Rami Rahim: Let me start with the second part, and then I'll hand it over to you, Ken, for the first part. When we say some uncertainty that's out there, it's really more in conversations we're having with customers, the scrutiny that they're placing on budgets. There have been some, a few project push-outs, no cancellations really. But despite that, I think that there are plenty of reasons for us to be optimistic. The strategic importance of the network, digital transformation projects, the 400-gig opportunity that I just talked about, our Enterprise momentum that I think, in many ways, is unique to Juniper because of the differentiation, especially in artificial intelligence that we have and then the backlog that we're sitting on. Ken?
Ken Miller: Yes, from a lead time perspective, it's hard to get specific because the reality is all products have different lead times. But the range really is from 30 days to upwards of 9 months, even 12 months in some cases. One way to look at it would be our overall backlog. If you just went on a FIFO basis, we have roughly two quarters of backlogs. So lead times on average roughly six months as one might look at it and it's down a bit from where we entered the quarter. So we are seeing some improvements there.
Jess Lubert: Thank you, everyone, for your time. That concludes today's call.
Operator: Thank you, gentlemen. This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-10-25 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Juniper Networks Third Quarter 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode, and we will open the floor for your questions and comments after the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Jess Lubert. Sir, the floor is yours.
Jess Lubert: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter 2022 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results might differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release and CFO commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and Juniper undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results is included in today's press release. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question so that as many people as possible who would like to ask a question has a chance. With that, I’ll now hand the call over to Rami.
Rami Rahim: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss our Q3 2022 results. We delivered better than expected results during the September quarter as total revenue of $1.450 billion not only exceeded the high end of our guidance but also set an all-time quarterly revenue record for Juniper. Total product sales grew 25% year-over-year and we saw double-digit year-over-year revenue growth across all customer verticals and all customer solutions. Our gross and operating margin also exceeded expectations, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.58, which was above the high end of our quarterly guidance. Our Q3 results reflect the strong demand we've experienced across customer verticals and solution since the beginning of last year as well as the actions we have taken to procure incremental supply and overcome the many supply chain challenges that continue to exist in the market. Our teams have executed extremely well over the course of the past year and these results are only possible due to the exceptional efforts from our go-to-market, product management, engineering, services and supply chain organizations, along with many others. This alignment across the company has not only helped us achieve strong Q3 results, but also should position us to deliver continued strength in Q4 and sustained growth in 2023 and beyond. Overall demand remained healthy in the September quarter with product orders being high single-digit year-over-year growth when adjusted to account for customers placing orders early due to the extension of the lead time related to supply chain challenges. While gross orders experienced a mid-teens year-over-year decline, this was primarily due to a difficult comparison in the same quarter of last year, when there was a large amount of this early ordering, particularly amongst our cloud and service provider customers, where order patterns are now beginning to normalize as supply improves. We're paying very close attention to customers' willingness to both invest in new network projects and consume prior orders as supply becomes available, given the various economic uncertainties happening around the world. While we have seen some customers more closely scrutinizing budgets as well as the time line for certain projects by and large, we remain encouraged by the overall momentum we are seeing, which remains well above pre-pandemic levels and the expectations we had entering the year. We believe this momentum reflects the network's growing strategic importance to our customers digital transformation and cloudification initiatives, as well as certain cyclical tailwinds surrounding early-stage opportunities, such as 400 gig upgrades, where we saw accelerated momentum this past quarter with nearly 100 new wins spread across wind and data center environment. Bolstering our momentum is the most differentiated solution portfolio Juniper has ever had. Our focus on delivering solutions that dramatically simplify customer operations and enhance end user experience, what we call Experience First Networking continues to resonate across each of the markets we serve. This is particularly true in the enterprise, while we not only achieved record revenue results in Q3, and a third consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth, but we also saw continued demand strength with orders growing mid-teens year-over-year. We believe our portfolio of campus, data center and wide area solutions is truly differentiated which, along with the investments we've made in our go-to-market organization is enabling us to capitalize on our customers digital transformation and network modernization initiatives and, in many cases, shift share from the competition. We remain focused on scaling our enterprise business, and I'm confident that our new Chief Revenue Officer, Chris Kaddaras, will bring valuable insights and experience that will further accelerate our enterprise success. Our cloud business also delivered solid Q3 results with revenue growing 24% year-over-year. Many of our cloud customers are early in their deployment of large-scale 400-gig upgrade and data center builds that are likely to present multiyear revenue tailwinds as supply improve. These customers are consuming prior purchases and forward revenue visibility remains high. The large deals we announced previously are performing, and we are competing well for several additional large opportunities that could result in additional growth in future periods. I continue to be encouraged by the increased diversity of our cloud business as we saw strong growth from four of our top five cloud accounts and continued momentum amongst cloud majors during this past quarter. I view this increased diversity and reduced reliance on any one customer as an important positive development that is providing increased confidence in this vertical's long-term growth prospects and our ability to navigate any potential lumpiness in customer spending. Our service provider business also delivered strong results in Q3, with revenue rising 17% year-over-year. We remain confident regarding our ability to grow our service provider business as our customers consume prior purchases, and we make traction with the metro routing market where our new cloud metro solutions bring superior scale, power efficiency and automation capabilities to the sizable and growing portion of the market. I'd like to emphasize that we continue to feel good about our ability to capitalize on big opportunities tied to enterprise digital transformation and clarification initiatives, 400-gig upgrades at cloud and service provider customers and the broader adoption of cloud-based services and network architectures. Based on my recent conversations with customers, these opportunities represent key strategic initiatives that we believe will present durable tailwinds for our business over the next several years, even in the event macro conditions soften. We also believe our focus on leveraging artificial intelligence and software automation tools to improve network operations and reduce cost is truly differentiated and creating opportunities to shift share. In summary, overall demand remains healthy. And given the backlog we've built, along with the actions we've taken to secure more supply, we are now incrementally more confident regarding our top line outlook and our ability to ship products to customers. As a result, we now expect to deliver approximately 12% to 13% year-over-year revenue growth in 2022 and at least 7% year-over-year revenue growth in 2023. We remain focused on delivering improved profitability and expect non-GAAP operating margin to expand by at least 100 basis points in 2023. Now I'd like to provide some additional insights into the quarter and address some of the key developments we're seeing from a customer solutions perspective. Starting with automated WAN. We delivered strong results in the Q3 time frame. Revenue saw double-digit year-over-year growth across all customer verticals with particular strength in our MX product family where our newer Trio 6-based products such as the MX10K, the LC9600 Line Card and the MX304 continued to perform exceptionally well. We are continuing to see strong demand for our 400-gig products with our cloud and service provider customers and now have nearly 400 wins for wide area use cases across our MX, PTX and ACX products. We also saw another quarter of strong order growth for our ACX cloud metro portfolio, and our Paragon software automation suite. We plan to introduce new hardware and software automation capabilities in future quarters that will further enhance our competitive position in this attractive portion of the service provider market. Our cloud-ready data center revenue also saw a strong year-over-year growth in Q3 due to the momentum with cloud major accounts. Orders with these accounts also remained strong and saw solid double-digit growth year-over-year as we continued to successfully develop new franchises and generate strong momentum with deals greater than $1 million. Our 400-gig data center solutions are resonating in the market, and our solutions have now secured approximately 100 data center switching opportunities that span across cloud majors, enterprise and service provider accounts. Our Apstra pipeline continues to build with qualified leads approximately doubling on a sequential basis. New logos saw healthy momentum, and we're seeing strong hardware pull-through for every dollar of software, which is a positive indicator for future growth. With the recent launch of Abstract Freeform, which provides more flexible deployment options and expand the list of potential customers we can address, we remain optimistic regarding the outlook for Apstra and our data center opportunity. Customer interest in our cloud-ready data center portfolio remains high. And given the wins we've already secured, I'm optimistic about our ability to capitalize on the attractive growth within this market over the next several years. Our AI-driven enterprise business continues to materially outpace the market with revenue growing 16% year-over-year and orders rising more than 25% year-over-year. This strength was led by our mystified business, which is a segment of our campus and branch portfolio driven by Mist AI and the cloud. This area saw both revenue and orders grew more than 50% year-over-year, with record sales of Mist WiFi and EX switching. On an annualized basis, our Mistified order run rate surpassed $850 million in the Q3 time frame, which is up meaningfully from the run rate we last disclosed during Q4 of 2021. We remain encouraged by the traction we're seeing with large customers, especially those choosing Juniper for full stack wins, which we define as a combination of wired access, wireless access, SD-WAN and/or edge security products managed via Mist AI. Notable wins for the AI-driven enterprise this quarter include the largest health care provider in the US, a large US service provider, a top global logistics provider, a global 10 international energy provider and several top universities around the world. We also saw a large renewal with a Fortune 10 retail account. Juniper continues to remain highly differentiated in the industry with our full breadth of wired, wireless, SD-WAN and indoor location product, all managed via common microservices cloud and sixth-generation AI-driven operations. This provides industry-leading insight and automation, resulting in amazing user experiences from client to cloud. Juniper continues to innovate aggressively in these areas as evidenced by several exciting product announcements this quarter, including a new AI-driven access switch, the EX4100, enhancements to Marvis AIOps that deliver even more insights into client experiences and groundbreaking new features that combine AIOps with indoor location services to save time and money, when deploying new wireless networks. In addition, we announced new features and payment options that facilitate the consumption and operations of Juniper AI-driven network as a service, bringing even more flexibility, agility and insight to Juniper customers and partners. Our prospects for the AI-driven enterprise have never been stronger. We're taking market share in key areas such as wireless, where the 650 Group recognized Juniper as the fastest-growing enterprise and outdoor wireless vendor in their most recent market research report. And we continue to be distinguished by respected third parties like Gartner, who have us in the leader position in two most recent Magic Quadrant for wired wireless LAN access infrastructure and indoor location services. As a result, the AI-driven enterprise remains a cornerstone of our enterprise go-to-market efforts and promises to be a key catalyst for the growth Juniper expects in the enterprise in coming years. Our security revenue declined in Q3 due to the deliberate shift from upfront appliance sales to a ratable software subscription model, which is likely to present headwinds to revenue over the next few quarters. While we also saw some lumpiness in our high-end security business, we continue to see strength in our midrange firewall portfolio as well as our software-only security and cloud offerings. Customers appreciate the value of Juniper's Security Director Cloud platform to provide a single policy framework to manage all their firewalls, whether in the data center or at the edge or whether on-premises or in the cloud, which is essential to help customers migrate to Zero Trust and SASE architectures. This platform launched in Q1 and already has more than 200 customers. We remain confident in our connected security strategy and expect this business to return to growth during the second half of 2023, as we build up more ratable software revenue. We experienced strong software momentum in the Q3 time frame, which saw total software and related services revenue grow by 21% year-over-year to account for 18% of our total revenue. Our annualized recurring revenue, which solely consists of truly ratable software subscriptions and related services increased 38% year-over-year due to the strong demand for Mist and security subscriptions. We believe the outlook for our software business remains strong, and we are encouraged by the momentum we are seeing with our Junos-based Flex software, off-box subscription software and software-as-a-service offerings such as Mist. Much of this momentum can be seen in our deferred revenue from customer solutions, which grew 11% sequentially and 50% year-over-year. The truly ratable component of this deferred revenue, which accounts for more than half of the total grew even faster, doubling on a year-over-year basis. I'd like to mention that our Services team delivered yet another record quarter due to strong renewals and attach rates. In addition to strong revenue, we also achieved another quarter of solid services margin. Our services organization continues to execute extremely well and is focused on driving customer success through automation and cloud delivered insights, creating new revenue opportunities and also benefiting margins. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results.
Ken Miller: Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start by discussing our third quarter results and end with some color on our outlook. We delivered record revenue during the third quarter of 2022, at $1.415 billion in revenue, which was above our guidance range and growth of 19% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.58, also above our guidance range due to the higher-than-expected revenue and gross margin. Product orders were in line with our expectations in the third quarter. As a reminder, we have experienced order strength from customers placing orders at an accelerated pace to account for extended lead times related to industry supply chain challenges over the course of the past year. The impact of accelerated ordering decreased in the third quarter of 2022. We expect this impact to continue to dissipate over time. While total product orders declined in the mid-teens year-over-year, due to difficult comparisons, adjusted orders grew high-single digits year-over-year. Strong demand in the enterprise vertical continued with total orders growing mid-teens on a year-over-year basis. Our backlog remains elevated, but declined sequentially due to improvements in supply. We would expect backlog to further decline as supply improves. We are very pleased with the balance of revenue growth in the third quarter across customer solutions and verticals. We saw double-digit revenue growth in all customer solutions on a year-over-year and sequential basis. Automated WAN solutions increased 39%. Cloud-ready data center increased 18%, and AI driven Enterprise increased 16% on a year-over-year basis. On a sequential basis, automated WAN solutions increased 15%. Cloud-ready data center grew 14% and AI-driven Enterprise revenue was up 17%. Looking at our revenue by vertical. All verticals grew double digits on a year-over-year and sequential basis. Enterprise and service provider revenue grew 17% versus last year and our cloud business increased 24% year-over-year. This was a record revenue result for our enterprise vertical. On a sequential basis, Enterprise grew 10%, Service Provider increased 11%, and cloud increased 13%. Total software and related services revenue was $248 million, which was an increase of 21% year-over-year. Annual recurring revenue, or ARR, was $261 million and grew approximately 38% year-over-year. Total security revenue was $140 million, down 13% year-over-year. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, five were cloud, three were service provider and for the first time, two of our enterprise customers. 34% of our total revenue came from our top 10 customers in the third quarter of 2022 as compared to 31% in the third quarter last year. Non-GAAP gross margin was 57.2%, which was above the midpoint of guidance, primarily due to favorable product mix and higher revenue volume. The supply chain continues to be constrained with long lead times and elevated costs. However, we have seen some improvement in the volume of supply. If not for those elevated supply chain costs, we estimate that we would have posted non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 60%. Operating expense increased 10% year-over-year and 5% sequentially on a non-GAAP basis, primarily due to headcount-related costs and higher-than-expected variable compensation. Non-GAAP operating margin was 17.2% for the quarter, which was above our expectations due to the higher revenue and gross margin. Cash flow from operations was $52 million. We paid $68 million in dividends, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of the third quarter of 2022 was $1.3 billion. Now, I would like to provide some color on our guidance, which you could find detailed in the CFO commentary available on our Investor Relations website. We continue to work to resolve supply chain challenges and have increased inventory levels. We are working closely with our suppliers to further enhance our resiliency and mitigate the effects of disruptions outside of our control. We believe that even with these actions, extended lead times and elevated costs will persist into 2023. While the situation is dynamic, at this point in time, we believe we will have access to sufficient supplies of semiconductors and other components to meet our financial forecast. For the fourth quarter of 2022, we expect to see revenue of $1.475 billion at the midpoint of our guidance, which is growth of approximately 14% year-over-year driven by the strength of our demand forecast, our backlog and an improved supply outlook. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 57%. Our non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be $0.64 on plus or minus $0.05, assuming a share count of approximately 330 million shares. While the current global macroeconomic environment poses some uncertainty, we would like to provide some additional color regarding our current outlook for 2023. With the order momentum we are seeing as well as our backlog visibility and current expectations for supply, we expect revenue growth of at least 7% on a full year basis. We see an opportunity for non-GAAP gross margin to stabilize or slightly expand in 2023 on a full year basis. However, this will depend on revenue mix as well as the future trajectory of supply constraint related costs, which we expect to modestly improve over time, but to remain elevated relative to historical levels. With this in mind, we expect non-GAAP operating margin to expand by at least 100 basis points on a full year basis. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to grow double digits in 2023. At this point in time, we expect to see revenue seasonality in 2023. However, the degree of seasonality will be directly impacted by availability of supply and may vary relative to historical trends. As a reminder, our gross margin tends to be seasonally lower in the first quarter with gradual volume related improvements throughout the course of the year. Any improvement in supply constraint-related costs is expected to be weighted toward the second half of the year. Our long-term financial objectives have not changed. We plan to deliver sustained revenue growth, improved operating margin and earnings expansion over time. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. Now I'd like to open the call for questions.
Operator: Certainly. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your line is live.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks guys. Congratulations on the great quarter, good execution. I guess what I wanted to ask you, Ken, was I think last quarter, and correct me if I'm wrong, you had alluded to an expectation that backlog would kind of remain flat through the back half of the calendar year. So it sounds like that maybe supply is loosening up a little bit quicker than you previously expected. Maybe you can just dive into the supply chain and how much of that backlog, if you will, kind of unlock or recognition is kind of helping drive your updated expectations, not just for this year, fiscal 4Q, but also through 2023. How do you expect backlog to kind of trend here as we move forward?
Ken Miller: Yeah. That's a good question, Aaron. Thanks for the question. So yes, backlog declined approximately $100 million in this quarter, down to $2.3 billion, still an extremely high number relative to our past, and we're still enjoying a lot of visibility, great to the great demand in the backlog we built over the past several quarters. It did decline a bit, and that was really a factor predominantly of more supply, quite honestly. And you saw that in the revenue result as well. And we also raised Q4 revenue guidance a bit and raise next year. So we are seeing volume of supply start to improve. That should result in backlog declining over time. I mean, blacklog at $2.3 billion or at these levels is not sustainable, quite honestly. I do expect backlog to normalize over hopefully, a long period of time. At this point, I would expect backlog likely to decline a bit in Q4 as we continue to enjoy a little bit more supply and satisfy customer demand a little better than we were in the past. So I'm not surprised by the backlog performance. I still expect it to be up as compared to the beginning of the year and still extremely elevated, but do you think we'll start to see a decline here over the next couple of quarters. And next year, I think backlog, we're likely to decline as well at some point throughout the year. Our supply improved and lead times normalize, which I hope happens, we will see a normalization of backlog, I would expect next year at some level. Again, I still expect we'll enter – or exit next year elevated significantly elevated for that matter, but I think it will come down off of kind of record levels that we're at now.
Aaron Rakers: Thanks, Ken. I'll stick to the one question.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. Your line is live.
Samik Chatterjee: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I had – the first one that, I wanted to start with, as you did mention earlier on in your prepared remarks about seeing some sort of scrutiny from your customers. But wondering, sir, what you're seeing from the service provider as well as the cloud vertical? I know, there's been a lot of discussion on enterprise customers evaluating spend more, but what are you seeing from the other two vertical service provider and cloud in response to the macro? And if I can just squeeze in a second one here, which is just trying to think about the gross margin guide for fiscal 2023 here, which does look a bit more modest than we were expecting? And sort of trying to think about supply visibility that you have and what could potentially drive upside to that number? What you probably like baking in, in terms of going back into the broker market for supply into that number? And what could potentially drive some upside to that gross margin for next year? Thank you.
Rami Rahim: So Samik, thanks for the question. I'll start with the question around customers, and then I'll pass it on to Ken to talk a little bit about gross margins. So as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, demand remained healthy for the quarter. I think it remains above pre-pandemic levels. It remains above expectations that we had entering into the year. If you want a little bit more color about sort of SP cloud versus enterprise, I do think the dynamics of demand are a little bit different between those two segments. So if I look at SD and Cloud first, there was a huge amount of early ordering that was happening just a year ago. And that's starting to normalizing -- to normalize. I don't think it's completely normal at all, but it's starting to normalize. And so for that reason, I think if you want a view of demand, you really have to look at both orders and revenue. And the combination of both, I think are very positive for SP and Cloud and give us great visibility into next year, and it's why we feel good about raising our outlook for the following year. In the enterprise, there was some early ordering that was happening a year ago, but nowhere near as much as what was happening in SP and Cloud. And we continue to see great order growth, mid-teens order growth in the enterprise. I do think there's a market component to why that is. I also think there is just a differentiation, execution, the competitiveness of our offering, especially our AI-driven enterprise, our mystified solution that is doing so well in the market right now.
Ken Miller: Yes. And from a gross margin perspective for 2023, I'm going to have to remind everybody, it's still a very challenging environment in supply chain world and very unpredictable. So I wanted to have a certain level of prudence. I do believe we have an opportunity to stabilize gross margin and modestly improved gross margin. A lot of that's going to depend on the timing of the transitory costs, the expedite fees and the freight cost, when and if those do come down, I think they will. The question is really when it comes down quicker than we're expecting in these forecasts, and we should see some margin upside next year. But I want to plan prudently from a gross margin expectation for next year.
Samik Chatterjee: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Your line is live.
Simon Leopold: Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if maybe you could give us your insights or thoughts on what your product mix assumptions are for 2023 revenue. So, understanding that the sort of low end of 7% growth. But if you can maybe rank order your reported segments to give us a sense of how you expect it to perform relatively?
Ken Miller: Yes. Thanks, Simon. Good question. So I think probably the best indicator would actually be our long-term model. Now the number of at least 7% is likely to outperform the long-term model. But from a relative basis, I still think the model pretty much applies. So I would expect enterprise to be our fastest-growing vertical followed by cloud and then the service rider be our slowest-growing vertical. If you look at the customer solutions perspective, I would expect to add driven enterprise to lead the way from a growth perspective, followed by cloud-ready data center in an automated WAN. So I do think the relative results will hold to the model, but overall, the company has outperformed the model in all verticals, all solutions this year. And I think next year, we have an opportunity to outperform the model as well. But I think from a relative perspective, those still hold.
Simon Leopold: Thanks. And just as a very quick follow-up. EMEA was down year-over-year for you. Just whether or not you're seeing the macro really pressuring your business in that region on foreign exchange shifts or anything like that? Thank you.
Rami Rahim: I'll take it. Honestly, nothing really -- there are no patterns, I would say, that would say EMEA is weaker than other regions at this point in time. I think the performance in EMEA was related more to our ability to ship product that was necessary in that time frame and the timing of deployments of solution. So we obviously keep a very close eye to make sure things do not deteriorate. But for now, honestly, we're not seeing anything specific in EMEA.
Simon Leopold: Thank you.
Rami Rahim: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from David Vogt from UBS. Your line is live.
David Vogt: Thanks guys. Hi, Rami. Hi, Ken. Maybe just a quick question on a follow-up on backlog and what you're seeing from customers. I know this is atypical, but can you kind of share with us how you're thinking about how that backlog converts into revenue over the go-forward period? I know it's different than it's been historically. But any commentary or comments you've had from your customers in terms of when they went that backlog shipped? And then Rami, to your point about conversations about customers being a little bit maybe more cautious. Any sort of indication on early maybe cancellation rates that you could share with us or anything that you think is quantifiable at this point, although it's low. I just would love to kind of get your perspective on that. Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Yes. Let me start with the second part of the question first, and I'll hand it over to Ken. The answer to, are there cancellations, no. We're not seeing any cancellations, nothing that is atypical at this period of time. And in push-outs, there have been a few project push-outs, but there are also push-out in normal times as well. So there's nothing that I'd say is outside normal patterns. And again, this is where we obviously have to keep a very close eye on things and just to see how the market evolves. But so far, so good in terms of what we're seeing on the ground, conversations, projects that are happening with our customers. In the event that there is more macro-related headwinds, I think we have a few things that are going for ourselves. First and foremost, the diversity of our business across SP, cloud and enterprise because it's unlikely in my view that there -- all of these verticals will be impacted equally, and we can rely on some verticals that do better than others. I think that the types of solutions that we're offering our customers take, for example, our AI-driven enterprise solution that is all around reducing the cost and the complexity of running network really resonate with digital transformation efforts that are happening. And for that reason, I think there's a higher likelihood that such projects would be protected in the future, the competitiveness of our solutions. The fact that we have relatively small share in these massive multibillion dollar markets, all give me confidence that even in the event that there are going to be any sort of headwinds, we can actually do quite well through that period of time.
Ken Miller: Yes. On the backlog conversion, I mean, customers place an order, they are, for the most part, aware of our lead times, so they're not surprised that we typically ship products several months, if not a few quarters after getting their order. I'd also say, in many cases, they actually want it earlier than we able to provide it. So the vast majority of our customers are trying to get the product quicker than we're currently able to deliver. The beta we have now, I would expect to completely ship in the next three to four quarters, and it will kind of be phased in over that period of time. So it takes a few quarters for us to turn the entire backlog given the lead times that we have. But we are doing the best we can to accelerate the orders in accordance with our customers' expectations when supply improves.
David Vogt: Great. Very helpful. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. Your line is live.
Sami Badri: Hi, thank you. I wanted to kind of understand how much the effect of increasing pricing on products has impacted both your fiscal 4Q of 2022? And how that really impacts 2023? And I guess, like every company has been moving at a little bit of a different pace, pricing products and offering customers different terms and RFPs, et cetera, but we're trying to understand when all these price increases finally make their way into the actual numbers. So that's kind of the first part of the question. The second part is if we just looked at just units, right, ports, units, appliances, devices, and we look at the number in 2023, does your guide of high single digit or 7% revenue growth in fiscal year 2023 include greater amounts of units shipped, or is that increase being achieved via pricing mainly just to kind of get an idea on how Juniper is doing.
Ken Miller: Yes. So for actuals -- Q3 performance and Q4 expectations for this year, we are seeing an impact from the pricing actions we've taken over the past few quarters. It's – and it's actually increasing over time. So the impact we saw in Q3 was larger than we saw in Q2, and I would expect Q4's impact to be larger than Q3. And the impact is showing up in revenue as well as gross margin. But I would caution you on this year as well as next -- this year, in particular, the volume is driving significant growth. I mean, product revenue grew 25% year-over-year. The vast majority of that is unit based. It's taking market share. It's really not pricing that's holding up these results. Next year, if the number were to be closer to that 7%, you kind of the low end of our range, if you will, you'll see – I still believe volume would be the majority, but pricing would play a significant role in that overall result as we -- if we're able to outsize revenue with more volume, more inventory, more supply, you'll see that the volume is really the driving force.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from George Notter from Jefferies. Your line is live.
George Notter: Hi, guys. Thanks very much. Going back to the discussion on gross margins. I think, Ken, you're alluding to about 300 basis points of supply chain impact here in the Q3 results. I guess, I'm just curious about how much of that gross margin impact came from broker fees, expedite fees, that sort of thing. I'm wondering how much of that might fall off as the supply chain environment starts to get better going forward?
Ken Miller: Yeah. So it was a little bit short of 300 basis points, but it is kind of in that 250 kind of range, 250 to 300 range if you were to normalize Q3 performance. And the majority of that delta is exit fees or purchase price variance, basically paying more to get the products that we want on time or earlier than we otherwise would get that, whether it's broker markets or paying extra for the part. So that is the majority. The other factor in that number is we still believe freight costs are elevated compared to where they're going to normalize at. So those are the two big numbers in that delta. I would like to think we'll see some improvement next year. I do think we're still in a very supply-constrained environment with the long lead times, and we still are going to prioritize satisfying customer demand to the best of our ability. So I don't believe those costs are going to go away entirely or go away anytime soon. But I do think we could see some benefit next year and particularly as we get into the second half of next year. But really, it's just too early to count on that. I want to make sure that we take it as time comes.
George Notter: I know just to follow-up on that. I know you guys made a big investment in components a quarter ago. Is there a point at which some of that component level inventory will have flowed through the model? And therefore, you kind of go back to more of a market rate of pricing?
Ken Miller: So from a price -- and to us or component costs are we talking about?
Rami Rahim: I bought a bunch of stuff at cost.
Ken Miller: Yes. So I mean, our inventory will turn when we're able to ship it, right? And the cost that we'll pay has been elevated, and I think will continue to be elevated if we have it on our balance sheet. So we'll be paying for the same cost. The good news is the costs go up in the future, we won't have to pay those costs. if we're carrying it in inventory. The primary reason for getting the components, though, just to be clear, is not some – is not really a cost-driven exercise. It's really about supply and resiliency of supply and making sure we can satisfy customer demand to the best of our ability.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live.
Meta Marshall: Great. Thanks. I wanted to just kind of get a sense from you on what you're seeing in terms of cloud demand and maybe the difference between what you're seeing from your hyperscale customers versus your Tier 2 customers and if there's anything to note there? And also, just given that you had kind of a new project ramping, just how that influences how you look at cloud into 2023? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Yes. Thanks for the question, Meta. I remain very bullish on our cloud segments. Obviously, we had a great Q3 growing at 24% year-over-year. The strength is broad. It's in Tier 1 hyperscalers. It's also in the cloud majors. And it also is broad in terms of the technologies that we're selling into the cloud provider segment, our automated WAN solutions, our wide area transport solutions that is and more and more data center type wins. We've alluded to a few wins that we've had in the last few quarters. In fact, our engagement level with cloud providers across the board remains exceptionally deep at the engineering level, where we're engaging in existing as well as new opportunities and new projects. 400-gig adoption is very healthy. We've now seen roughly around 500, 400-gig wins in data center and the wide area across SP and cloud, maybe even a few large enterprises as well. And I think that speaks to the engagement but then also the strong differentiation that we have. So, all-in-all, I think cloud is going to have its ups and downs as always had but the general direction should be up and to the right.
Meta Marshall: But just from a general how your customer -- like how those cloud customers are feeling about their budgets? I understand that you're doing very well within them. Just trying to get a sense of kind of how their budgets are trending or just how you're seeing their demand activity trend?
Rami Rahim: In terms of the projects that are most meaningful for us, I think they're feeling good. As long as the cloud provider business is doing well, which they're all doing quite well, then they are going to need to invest in their network infrastructure to keep up with the demand for those cloud services. So generally speaking, I would say it's good.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Paul Silverstein from Cowen. Your line is live.
Paul Silverstein: Thanks guys for taking the question. First, a clarification and then a broader question. On clarification, Rami, if I've heard you and Ken correctly, you've got 500, 400 gig wins, 100 of which are intra-data center switching. Did I hear that right?
Rami Rahim: Yes, that's correct.
Paul Silverstein: Can you share with us what's been the growth on a quarterly or annual basis in terms of the number of wins? And what are the average deal sizes in trying to decipher what's the growth from the 400-gig upgrade cycle going forward? And then I've got a broader macro question for you.
Rami Rahim: So, Paul, it's a good question, but I don't know that number off the top of my head. It grew meaningfully just on a quarter-over-quarter basis because I think we probably added 100 or so in the -- from quarter-to-quarter. And generally speaking, because these are 400-gig wins, typically, they're going to be fairly large projects. They're not necessarily going to be all large initially, but they are typically -- they start with an initial deployment and then the they continue in time. So -- and the last thing I'll say about 400-gig, whether it be in the WAN or in the data center as much progress as we've seen, we're still early innings. The vast majority of ports that are being sold and deployed these days, whether it be in the WAN or the data center is still 100 gig. So that transition from 100 gig to 400 gig is still in the process of happening right now. We should continue to benefit from it.
Paul Silverstein: And Rami, to be clear, I assume your early innings with respect to both breadth and depth of 400-gig adoption. My broader question, if I may. And I recognize the numbers, your order book, your revenue plus your commentary relative to previous questions, it seems pretty clear, but I got to ask you, F5 reported tonight alongside you, and they referenced fairly significant, in particular, abroad, not so much in the US, North America, but they referenced a pretty significant pullback, downsizing delays, et cetera, in projects, I asked the question whether that was specific to the product market, given what you said, and they said they don't think so, given the nature of customer behavior abroad, what they're seeing in terms of the downsizing delays. But just to be clear you referenced some but it sounds like its – very – I am trying it to say for to what extent, just how meaningful in terms of number of customers, number of projects that will impact it on what that might indicate for the future, whether a downturn is coming or not for you?
Rami Rahim: Yes. I mean, all we can say is there are certainly more customers that are thinking about their budgets and the time line of projects. Have there been projects canceled? No. There's nothing that we see that has been canceled. Have there been some projects that have been delayed? Yes, some -- but honestly, not much more than we would see in normal times as well. And is there anything that we're seeing that's sort of geo-specific like more in EMEA versus Asia Pacific or North America? The answer to that question is no. It's really kind of the same worldwide at this point in time.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Your line is live.
Amit Daryanani: Thanks for taking my question. I guess maybe I think back to what you just said to the prior question. You also talked about, I think enterprise will grow the fastest in fiscal 2023 versus that at least 7% growth bogey. Maybe just talk about -- how much of that yet is networking budgets, are you growing at enterprise companies versus you picking up share? And if the share gains are happening? Maybe you can just talk but where are you seeing the share gains in a more pronounced manner.
Rami Rahim: So that's a great question. And obviously, we'll know for sure and to what extent there is share taking that's happening to enterprise once the share reports are actually out. And there's also an orders versus revenue component to this because obviously, analysts only see the revenue and they track revenue. But my strong feeling is that we're taking share in the enterprise. I think there is -- we're participating in markets that appear to be healthy. But I also believe we have some very competitive solutions that are in the market today across the AI-driven enterprise and our data center offerings as well. You heard me in my prepared remarks, I mean myst and our mystified revenue is crushing it. The last time we reported an annualized order run rate was in Q4 2021 of $600 million. We're now at $850 million in the Q3 time frame. It's no longer just about selling Wi-Fi. We're selling full stack solution. It's an enterprise architecture that's AI-driven and cloud delivered that runs across Wi-Fi, wired and SD-WAN. And if you look at our pipeline and our wins, a lot of that is full stack. I think the differentiation we have is just exceptional right now. And I think it will remain exceptional for a period of time. And we're going to benefit from that. We are benefiting from that.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Alex Henderson from Needham. Your line is live.
Alex Henderson: Great. Thanks. I think a lot of people got introduced to your AI capabilities with the Mist product, and it's obviously been a home run and really changed the dynamics for the company over time, proven effective premiums to drive business and upsell. But I think the companies as a whole seems to have gone well beyond that, taking that same microservice cloud-native AI open architecture to the data center, taking it out to even the metro area WAN for service providers. And as I look at all of the moves that you're making in terms of the acquisitions you've done and the like, it seems pretty clear to me at this point that you've made a major pivot in your strategy to one that's driven off of that set of enablement to drive the entire company. And I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about when you're going to decide to announce this is the company-wide strategy. And the differences between your ability to execute on that strategy across the entire platform by getting employee buy-in and competitively, whether you see any of your competitors being able to follow suit because I don't think, for instance, Cisco could follow suit on this strategy. It's pretty broad change you guys have executed.
Rami Rahim: Alex, thanks for the excellent question and the great insight. I think you're picking up on something that's really important. We've always at Juniper had a strategy around automation and being automation-led. But you're right, the AI-driven enterprise and the miscomponent of the AI-driven enterprise has taught us some very valuable lessons in how to take that automation and take it to a whole new level with AI capabilities, and with a cloud-delivered strategy. So, for example, in our metro solution that we're now selling to our customers, we've made the automation cloud first and AI-driven. I think we have the potential to do the exact same thing in the data center as well. So, what you've described is exactly what's happening at Juniper. We've learned valuable lessons from one segment and we're applying them to others. And we need to do a better job in sort of communicating that more broadly. I think that's great feedback and I appreciate it.
Alex Henderson: Competitively, can you talk about your -- anybody else -- do you see anybody else able to execute a similar strategy or whether it's Arista, whether it's HP or whether it's Cisco?
Rami Rahim: The more AI-driven capabilities we add to our solutions; I think the more of a competitive differentiation we give ourselves. And honestly, where there is an opportunity to sell anything AI-driven and cloud delivered to our customers is fun to compete today because we tend to win the vast majority of the time.
Alex Henderson: Thanks a lot.
Rami Rahim: Thank you, Alex.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from James Fish from Piper Sandler. Your line is live.
James Fish: Hey guys. Nice quarter given the environment. You guys made some comments that the supply chain is getting better, I would agree with you there. And if it continues to kind of improve in the step function Ken, without putting you in too much of a hole here, but w hat would prevent Juniper from growing kind of double digits next year on some of this backlog flush actually?
Ken Miller: Yeah. I mean the reality is the supply chain were to increase meaningfully enough. I would say, nothing would prevent us from growing double digits next year. Really, it is supply constrained at our at least 7%, if we see easing in the supply chain, given the backlog we have, given the visibility we have with customers and the demand we expect, the great part differentiation and the sales execution, this year is going to be north of double digits. There's really nothing holding us back next year other than supply from my perspective, and that's the reason why I want to be prudent with the model at this time. And we see a floor at – at least 7% or at 7%. We have not established a viewing at this point.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Fahad Najam from Loop Capital. Your line is live.
Fahad Najam: Hey. Thank you for taking my question. Rami, Ken, my question is around security. It declined a little bit. Can you maybe expand on what you're seeing? Is it that maybe security budgets were more first half loaded than in the second half? And are you seeing any pronounced impact in security in Europe? And is that something that is probably impacting your business more because of some macro?
Rami Rahim: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Fahad. So let me first answer the last part of it, which is no, I don't think there's anything geo-specific that we're seeing in our security business. Part of the decline is self-inflicted. It has to do with the transition that we're deliberately executing on at Juniper right now from an appliance-based model to more of a software-based model that's subscription-based and that will come with recurring revenue. And so for that reason, we expect that there's going to be sort of ongoing headwinds for a period of time, at least until we get into the second half of next year before we start to see a recovery. There's another element of our security, which is that, there's a high-end component that just tends to be lumpy. There are large customers that either buy or don't buy high-end security and Q3 was particularly weak from the high-end security standpoint. Having said all that, the way that we look at security and we measure the – our success in security is through the integration of security in our strategic solutions. We believe that more and more of our AI-driven enterprise solutions that we sell to our customers will have an embedded security component. We're starting to see that. We also believe that having strong security capabilities in our data center solution is going to be increasingly important to our customers, and we're also starting to see some of that as well. It's just that we're going to have – we're going to let – we need to let some of these sort of transitions, product transitions in particular, from hardware to software play out.
Ken Miller: Operator, we'll take two more questions.
Operator: Certainly. Your next question is coming from Jim Suva from Citigroup. Your line is live.
Jim Suva: Given your great success, coupled with the increasing backlog A little commentary was made earlier about seasonality. Can you give us a little bit more insights on that? Because I wonder if as we exit 2022, and I know it's early for 2023 given component constraints, does seasonality become less pronounced in 2023, given the orders backlog success you've had in the easing of supply chain? Thank you.
Ken Miller: Yeah, it's a great question, Jim. And at this point, I do expect you to see some seasonality, but I think your point is valid. I do think that the degree of seasonality that we see could be lessened a bit. I mean historically, we've seen kind of a mid-teens decline sequentially from Q4 to Q1. At this point, it's a little bit too early to call, but I do see a possibility of that being a little lessened on a sequential decline basis, but I do expect there to be some decline and some seasonality to remain in the business from a revenue perspective.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Tal Liani from Bank of America. Your line is live.
Tal Liani: Great for squeezing me in. Thank you. I have a very high-level question that I want to understand and it relates to something you answered before. So the biggest fear is that as we work off 2023 budgets, there's going to be weakness across the board. It's not company-specific, it's more macro related. And the question I have is just to understand how much visibility you have into the projects, into the spending plans of your customers? 2023 budgets will only be set in the next few months. How much is there involvement on your end? How much is their involvement in the future planning? I'm just trying to assess the risk of a surprise, negative surprise because of macro, nothing specific.
Rami Rahim: Yes. So it's a good question, Tal. I would say our visibility is very strong. I mean first year, the visibility that comes with the backlog. These are orders that have been made for existing projects, then there's a visibility that comes from having very strong strategic conversations with our customers, especially large customers, hyperscalers, large enterprise and service providers. And there, again, I'd say the visibility is great. The only risk would be if the -- things would change in plans that we understand today were to actually change. Again, I will say that for the most part, we don't see that happening at this point in time, but we have to, of course, stay very close to our customers to see if, in fact, things start to change. And I will reiterate here there are deliberate things that we're doing that are designed to make us more resilient in the event that there is a downturn, the diversification of our business, the competitiveness of our solutions. Even if you look in the enterprise, we've really re-honed our go-to-market muscle on enterprise sub-segments that we believe will be more recession resilient. So healthcare, college campuses, public sector would be examples of areas that I think would be less prone to a downturn, and we're making those changes and adjustments now just to prepare.
End of Q&A:
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect at this time, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-26 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Juniper Networks' Second Quarter 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode and we will open the floor for your questions and comments after the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Jess Lubert, Vice President of Investor Relations. The floor is yours.
Jess Lubert: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to our second quarter 2022 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results might differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release, and CFO commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today and Juniper undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results is included in today's press release. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question, so that as many people as possible who would like to ask a question have a chance. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami.
Rami Rahim: Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss our Q2 2022 results. We delivered strong top line results during the June quarter as total revenue of $1.270 billion exceeded the mid-point of our guidance and product revenue saw a second consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth despite ongoing challenges from a supply chain perspective. Demand remained strong and exceeded our expectations with product orders seeing double-digit year-over-year growth when adjusted to account for extended lead times. While gross orders experienced a single digit year-over-year decline, this was better than expected given the difficult comp in Q2 of last year, when the duration of customer orders began to extend. Total product backlog increased meaningfully on both a sequential and a year-over-year basis to end at a record level, setting us up well for future revenue growth as this backlog eventually begins to normalize. Our focus on delivering solutions that improve customer operations what we call experience-first networking continues to resonate across each of the markets we serve. This is evident in our Q2 results, which saw year-over-year revenue growth across all customer verticals. Demand signals remain healthy and we are seeing attractive opportunities across our Enterprise Cloud and Service Provider markets. With that said, we are particularly encouraged by the Q2 momentum in our enterprise business, which not only delivered a record revenue quarter, but also saw orders increased by 20% year-over-year. We believe this strength is reflective of our sustainable differentiation and technology and user experience, both in our campus and our data center offerings, as well as the investments we've made in our go-to-market organization. We believe these factors should enable us to gain share and deliver sustainable enterprise growth in future periods even if macro headwinds start to affect our markets. Another highlight in the quarter was the increased diversification within our Cloud vertical, where we saw improved momentum with multiple hyperscale providers and continued success with Cloud major accounts, both of which are adopting our 400 gig technology. Of our top 10 customers in the June quarter, six of them were Cloud accounts, which illustrates the diversification we are seeing. We view our increased Cloud diversification as a positive development, which should position this business for sustainable long-term growth. Not to be overlooked, we continue to see healthy momentum in the service provider vertical and just recently secured a new 400 gig core win with one of the Tier 1 U.S. carriers. We're also making progress in the Metro market where we recently introduced several new platforms that will further enhance our competitive position in this attractive portion of the market. Our teams are executing well and we continue to feel good about our ability to capitalize on big opportunities tied to enterprise digital transformation and clarification initiatives, 400 gig upgrades at Cloud and Service provider customers and the broader adoption of Cloud-based services and network architectures. Based on my conversations with customers, these opportunities represent key strategic initiatives that should present a durable tailwind for our business over the next several years. While revenue was a bright spot and customer demand remained strong, margin and EPS came in weaker than we expected due to higher than expected supply chain costs and lower than expected perpetual software revenue, both of which I'd like to address. First, from a supply chain perspective, the availability of remained extremely challenged during the June quarter, as we saw a meaningful uptick in the volume of supplier decommits. In order to secure access to additional parts and get products to customers as soon as possible, we incurred higher costs than we anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. While some of these actions will impact profitability over the next few quarters, they are also enabling us to access more parts and better satisfy customer demand, which should have positive, longer term implications for our business. Secondly, our software revenue mix came in lower than we expected, even though software revenue still grew 24% year-over-year. We believe the outlook for our software business remains strong and we are encouraged by the momentum we're seeing with our Junos Space Flex software, out-of-the-box subscription software and software-as-a-service offering, such as Mist. Much of this momentum can be seen in our deferred revenue from customer solutions, which grew 7% sequentially and 41% year-over-year. The truly ratable component of this deferred revenue, which accounts for more than half of the total, grew even faster, nearly doubling on a year-over-year basis. In summary, demand remains strong and given the backlog we've built, along with the actions we've taken to secure more supply, we're now incrementally more confident regarding our top line outlook and our ability to ship products to customers. As a result, we now expect to deliver approximately 10% sales growth in 2022 and at least mid-single digit revenue growth in 2023. While non-GAAP operating margin is likely to be flat to slightly down in 2022 due entirely to the lower than anticipated non-GAAP gross margin we now expect, we still expect non-GAAP earnings to grow. We remain focused on delivering improved profitability and expect margin to expand in 2023. Now I'd like to provide some additional insights into the quarter and address some of the key developments we're seeing from a customer solutions perspective. Starting with Automated WAN, we delivered strong results in the Q2 timeframe and orders once again, exceeded expectations, but did decline year-over-year. Revenue grew year-over-year across all customer verticals, all geographies and all major product lines, including our MX, PTX and ACX families. We are continuing to see strong 400-gig momentum with our cloud and service provider customers, including the new 400-gig core win with the U.S. Tier 1 provider that I previously referenced. This win was secured based on the strength of our PTX product family, which delivered the superior scale, embedded security and power efficiency this important customer requires. I was also encouraged to see another quarter of strong demand for our newer MX platform leveraging our 306 silicon, including the MX10K, the LC 9600 line card and the MX304. These platforms deliver the industry-leading logical scale, embedded security and power efficiency necessary to meet the needs of the most demanding multiservice edge environment. We also saw another quarter of triple-digit order growth for our ACX Metro portfolio and introduce several new platforms such as the ACX7024 and the ACX7509, both of which provide industry-leading performance and expand the number of Metro use cases we can address. We plan to further enhance our Metro portfolio with new hardware, software, and automation capabilities in future quarters that will further enhance our competitive position in this attractive portion of the service provider market. Our cloud-ready data center revenue was flat Q2 due entirely to the timing of shipments. Orders exceeded expectations, but did decline year-over-year due to an exceptionally large deal with a hyperscale account in the year ago quarter. Excluding this customer, orders experienced double digit year-over-year growth, and we continue to see healthy momentum with large enterprise and Cloud major accounts. Our 400-gig solutions are resonating in the market, and we have now secured approximately 80 400-gig data center switching opportunities that span across cloud majors, enterprise and service provider accounts. Customer interest in our cloud-ready data center portfolio remains high and given the wins we've already secured, I am optimistic about our ability to capitalize on the attractive growth within this market over the next several years. Our AI-driven enterprise revenue continued to materially outpace the market, growing 17% year-over-year. This strength was led by our Mist-ified portfolio, which grew more than 60% year-over-year, achieving another record quarter for both Mist Wi-Fi and Mist-ified revenue. We are especially encouraged by the traction we're seeing with large customers across the globe with wins at a global financial bank, a global car manufacturer, and a global furniture retailer, each of which recently purchased a combination of AI-driven wireless, wired, security and/or SD WAN products from Juniper. To build on this AI-driven enterprise momentum we continue to deliver groundbreaking new products that optimize both end user and operator experiences such as a recently launched EX4100 family of access switches. Like the EX4400 family announced last year, these are truly enterprise grade access switches born in the cloud with native AIOps ensuring easy setup and management coupled with best-in-class scalability, security and performance. In addition, we brought AIOps to indoor location services with recently announced features that simplify wireless access point placement and orientation and we are now delivering six generation AI driven actions to address even more common networking problems, such as DHCP failures and wired authentication errors. Based on our recent order momentum, third-party validation and the technical superiority of our AI driven enterprise portfolio, I remain highly confident regarding the outlook of our complete client-to-cloud campus and branch business. Our security revenue declined in Q2 due largely to supply chain constraints on our hardware platforms and a difficult comp in the year ago quarter. Despite these challenges, we saw healthy momentum in our mid-range firewall portfolio, as well as our software-only security offerings. We believe the performance of our products is industry leading, which has been validated by a number of independent tests. Most recently receiving a AAA rating from cyber ratings with a 100% block rate for our cloud firewall offerings. We remain confident in our connected security strategy and believe the convergence of networking and security provides us with a competitive advantage in the portions of the market where we are currently focused. We believe our technical strength in both security and networking will provide tailwinds in future quarters and should enable us to deliver better results over the next few quarters. I'd like to mention that our services team delivered a record quarter due to strong renewals and attach rates. In addition to strong revenue, we also achieved another quarter of solid service margin. Our services organization continues to execute extremely well and is focused on driving incremental efficiencies through automation and cloud delivered insights that not only create new revenue opportunities, but also benefit margin and the customer experience. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ken who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail.
Ken Miller: Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start by discussing our second quarter results and end with some color on our outlook. We ended the second quarter of 2022 at $1.270 billion in revenue above the midpoint of our guidance and up 8% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.42 below the midpoint of our guidance range due entirely to lower than expected gross margin. We continue to be in a supply constrained environment with unprecedented costs to procure components and deliver our products. We prioritize delivering products to our customers as timely as possible, which resulted in higher costs and lower gross margin. Product orders remained strong during the second quarter and exceeded our expectations. As a reminder, we are experiencing some order strength attributable to industry’s supply chain challenges resulting in customers placing orders ahead of their normal order rate to account for the extended lead time. While product orders declined single-digits year-over-year due to a difficult comparison. Adjusted orders grew double-digits year-over-year, and our backlog increased more than $250 million on a sequential basis. We saw particularly strong demand and enterprise vertical with both gross and adjusted orders growing on a year-over-year basis. From a customer solution perspective, Automated WAN Solutions and AI driven enterprise revenue both grew 17% year-over-year. Cloud-Ready Data Center revenue was essentially flat year-over-year. Looking at our revenue by vertical, all verticals grew sequentially and on a year-over-year basis. Revenue in Enterprise grew 15%, followed by service provider growing 6%. And our cloud business grew 3% on a year-over-year basis. Total Software and Related Services revenue was $213 million, which was an increase of 24% year-over-year. Annual recurring revenue or ARR who approximately 34% year-over-year and reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, six were cloud, three were service provider, and one was an enterprise. Our top 10 customers accounted for 34% of total revenue as compared to 33% in Q2 2021. Non-GAAP gross margin was 56.2%, which was below our guidance range primarily due to elevated supply costs related to the challenging supply chain environment and lower than anticipated software mix. We experienced a greater volume of supply de-commitments in the quarter, which resulted in increased expedite and component costs as we prioritized delivering products to our customers as timely as possible. If not for the elevated supply chain costs, we estimate that we would’ve posted non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 59%. We expect the supply chain environment to remain challenged through at least the second half of the year. Moving on to operating expense, on a non-GAAP basis, which increased 4% year-over-year, and 1% sequentially. Non-GAAP operating margin was 13.9% for the quarter, which was below our expectations due to the lower than expected gross margin result. We had $267 million in cash outflow in the quarter. The cash outflow in the quarter includes approximately $165 million of additional payments to suppliers and prepaid deposits as well as strategic inventory purchases and an attempt to meet our customer delivery demands. Approximately $115 million of lower customer collections related to invoicing linearity and approximately $75 million of additional cash tax payments related to the capitalization and amortization requirements for research and development expenditures of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017, which went into effect on January 1, 2022. While we expect to be cash flow positive in the second half of 2022, some of these items are likely to also negatively impact second half cash flow results. Over time, we do expect cash flow timing differences to normalize and our cash flow results should be relatively in line with profit levels. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of the second quarter of 2022 was $1.3 billion. Now, I’d like to provide some color on our guidance, which you can find detailed in the CFO commentary available on our Investor Relations website. For the third quarter, we expect to see revenue growth of approximately 14% year-over-year driven by the strength of our backlog, strong demand and an improved supply outlook. Our better than expected supply outlook is the result of strategic actions we have taken to improve our access to components. We will continue to prioritize delivering products to our customers as timely as possible. The higher costs we are incurring to secure supply will negatively impact margins over the next several quarters. In addition, we expect to see a similar software mix in the third quarter as we saw in the second quarter. These factors will continue to pressure our gross margin and overall profitability. Turning to our expectations for the full year 2022. Given the strong order momentum we have seen coupled with our current backlog, as well as an improved supply outlook, we are raising our revenue growth expectation for the year to approximately 10%. This assumes the current supply chain environment does not further deteriorate. We also anticipate backlog to remain at elevated levels through the remainder of the year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the full year 2022 is expected to be approximately 57% down from our original expectations of 58% to 60%. As a result of the supply chain constrained environment, we now expect to absorb approximately $155 million of elevated component and freight costs in 2022, more than 50% higher than we had anticipated at the beginning of the year. We believe these elevated costs will be transitory over time. In addition, software as a percentage of total revenue in the second half of the year is expected to remain close to Q2 2022 levels. In 2021, we implemented some pricing actions, which have begun to parse the offset some, but not all the increased costs we are incurring. We are planning to take additional pricing actions to further offset these incremental costs. However, given the size of our backlog, these actions will take time to positively impact our results. We remain committed to disciplined expense management, and we expect operating expense to grow slower than revenue. That said, we will continue to invest to take advantage of market opportunities and our non-GAAP operating expense is expected to increase on a full year basis. Given the pressure we are seeing in non-GAAP gross margin, we no longer have line of sight to at least a 100 basis points expansion of non-GAAP operating margin. Our current expectation is non-GAAP operating margin will be flat to slightly down for the full year. We still expect non-GAAP EPS to grow on a full year basis. While the current global macroeconomic environment and the ongoing pandemic posed some uncertainty. We would like to provide some early color on our outlook for 2023. What the order momentum we are seeing our elevated backlog and current expectations for supply, we expect revenue growth of at least mid-single digits on a full year basis in 2023. We also expect improved profitability and margin expansion in 2023. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper success, especially in this challenging environment. Now, I’d like to open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] First question is coming from Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Your line is live.
Paul Silverstein: Thanks. I hate to ask you about supply chain, but I guess I will. Ken and Rami, what changed and I – at the risk of asking you to speak for not just yourselves, but other companies. There appears over the last year or two have been somewhat of a randomness in terms of a general trend of either stability or in some case modest improvement, but one or a handful of companies being impacted. We just heard [indiscernible] this morning, where stability. And I'm not throwing stones. I get it that it's a challenged environment out there, but what's accounting for the difference. And what changed in terms of the decommits for you?
Ken Miller: Yes. So the supply chain environment remains very challenged as it has been for the last several quarters. Lead times from suppliers and to us are extremely extended. Sourcing supply is proving to be very difficult. And at times is coming at an increased cost. We did mention on the prepared remarks that in Q2 in particular, we did see a higher volume of decommits from suppliers. And this really forced us to pay more expedite fees and heavily leverage the broker markets more than we historically have. And that comes at a higher cost. So the good news for us is, I feel very proud of our abilities to navigate these curve balls and these situations. And we actually – as you saw, we actually beat our revenue midpoint for the quarter. And based on these actions we're taking, albeit, they do come at a cost. We feel confident that we are getting access to more supply. And we actually raised our guidance for the full year. So we do see supply getting improving from an absolute volume perspective, but it is coming at an incremental cost and it's difficult. I mean, every quarter seems to be a different challenge, but we seem to be doing a pretty good job in my opinion, navigating those challenges.
Paul Silverstein: Key, can you give us a rough idea of how many decommits you're talking about and how that compared to the previous quarter?
Ken Miller: Yes. It's difficult to quantify. I'll tell you that we had some large strategic suppliers that we were expecting supply early in the quarter than we received. We received some of it later in the quarter. The other impact we had was linearity in the quarter from a shipping perspective and invoicing perspective was also negatively impacted. So it was definitely greater than normal, Paul, but we haven't really given these numbers in the past, so it's hard to compare to historical norms.
Paul Silverstein: All right. Can I ask one follow-up on – Rami, I think I heard your reference momentum or progress with hyperscalers. Can you give us any insight – more granular insight on what you're referring to?
Rami Rahim: I'd be happy to Paul. So I'm actually really pleased with our results with our cloud providers all up. I think the name of the game for us in the cloud provider space is diversification. I think we're seeing increased diversification among the hyperscalers to Tier 1 hyperscaler. So if one of our top hyperscale accounts goes through period of digesting orders that they've placed in the past or finding is another one will step in and compensate for that with more orders. And that happened – some of that happened in Q2 and then brought more broadly, our cloud majors customers saw great momentum and not just in routing, but also in data center switching and in 400 gig opportunities. So all up, I'm very pleased with the momentum we're seeing and I'm optimistic about the cloud provider vertical going forward.
Operator: Up next we have Tim Long with Barclays. Tim, your line is live.
Tim Long: Thank you. Just wanted to talk on the enterprise business a little bit. So Rami, just if you could talk a little bit, obviously it's been a great market, good results this quarter. Talk a little bit about kind of the sustainability of the elevated growth there and a little bit on how you're continuing to invest and go to market and how you're pulling through whether it's traditional wired products or some of the SD-WAN or other new technologies that you're bringing into the enterprise. Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Yes, I'd be happy to. So needless to say, I'm incredibly proud of the team for the results that they're continuing to deliver in the enterprise segment all up, very strong growth, both in terms of revenue, but also in terms of orders that grew 20% year-over-year, diversity in terms of the technology offering. So obviously we're seeing continued momentum with our AI driven enterprise solutions, but even our automated WAN saw a really great momentum this quarter. And a lot of that was driven by a resumption in spend by the federal government, which was kind of weak for the last several quarters. And I do expect that some of that is going to continue. So I'm actually quite optimistic about that. We are absolutely keeping a close eye on any sort of early warning indicators from a macro standpoint, any sort of headwinds, but so far, and you can see it from the order momentum we're seeing, we're not seeing any of that at this point in time. And I think the team has done a really nice job of just focusing on more macro resistant segments of the enterprise market. I think that's working in our favor. I also believe that the kinds of technologies that we're offering to our customers be it cloud delivered AI driven solutions, highly automated data center solutions are the kinds of solutions that I think our customers or prospects view as very strategic to their digital transformation initiatives. And so – and of that, I think you're going to see just more resilience to any sort of issues that might come our way in the future. So for all those reasons, technology differentiation, our go-to-market team, just crushing it focusing on the right sub-segments of the market, I continue to be very bullish about our enterprise business going forward.
Tim Long: Okay. Thank you.
Rami Rahim: My pleasure.
Operator: Okay. The next question is coming from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Your line is live.
Amit Daryanani: Thanks for taking my question. I guess, one of the things that some of the companies I’ve talked about, I’d love to get your perspective is signs that macros and impact demand. Are you seeing any of that? I know the European revenues were a little bit weaker. But I’d love to just understand if you’re seeing anything in terms of elongation of sales cycles or anything on the macro side. And then just related to that I’m curious, what gives you the confidence and the conviction to give at least an initial framework for calendar 2023 this earlier in the process?
Rami Rahim: Yes. Amit, let me start and I’m sure Ken would like to weigh in as well. So order strength remains robust and it remains robust across all of our segments. So I know when it comes to macro indicators, I think people are mostly concerned about what might happen to the enterprise, but you saw there, enterprise revenue double digit growth, enterprise orders growing at 20% year-over-year. We’re not going to be immune to any sort of major macro changes that happen. But we’ve got our early warning indicators sort of – we’re sort of scoping and making sure that there isn’t anything to be concerned about. And thus far I’d say there is not. I think we are playing in markets that are large, that where we have relatively small share where there’s tons of opportunity for us to compete. And we’re competing with solutions that I think are very strategic, especially in a situation where there are going to be cost pressures and the need for IT teams to start cutting costs. So for these reasons, I actually think even in the event that there were challenges – macro related challenges we can do quite well. And with that said, I’ll just pass it on to Ken for additional commentary.
Ken Miller: Yes. On the FY2023 kind of framework, over the last several quarters, as you know, we’ve built up an exceptional backlog. This is definitely providing us much greater long-term visibility than we historically had. Our backlog is now more than $2.4 billion, which is approximately 6x normal levels, so an exceptional backlog build. Also the investments we’re making in the supply chain we believe are starting to pay off. We did raise the full year this year, the second half we raised to get to a 10% full year guide in 2022. And we believe we’ll have access to supply to get to at least mid single digits next year. We haven’t provided FY2023 guidance as of yet. The only guidance you kind of have would be our long-term model, which was at least low single digits, which we provided over a year and a half ago. And we felt at this point, given the demand signals we’re seeing, given the supply that we believe will be able to procure, we think mid single digits is the right framework at this time, at least mid single digits.
Amit Daryanani: Perfect. Thank you very much.
Ken Miller: Sure.
Operator: Okay. The next question is coming from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Rod, your line is live.
Rod Hall: Yes. Hi guys, thanks for the question. I had two for you. One is just the implied gross margin in Q4. We calculate about 1.3 percentage points, maybe 1.5 percentage points increase sequentially there off of Q3. And I’m just curious what you guys – what makes you expect that? Is it visibility on cost or is it pricing or kind of what the driver is there? And then I have one follow up.
Ken Miller: Yes. So without getting specific on Q4, I’m sure your models are pretty accurate Rod. We do think the year would be about 57%. Really we expect there to be a volume benefit in Q4. We also expect to see more and more of the pricing actions that we’ve taken play out as time passes. So those would be the primary factors. Again, I’m not providing specific Q4 guidance. I don’t have exact mix prediction at this point. But I do believe 57% for the year is the right place to be right now.
Rod Hall: Yes. Just if we plug in Ken, the Q3 guide that’s kind of what we get – what spits out of Q4.
Ken Miller: Yes. And I’m sure your models are close. Yes. I just don’t have the model in front of me.
Rod Hall: Yes. And then the other thing I wanted to ask you is DSOs are up a lot in the quarter, and I wondered if you could comment on linearity in the quarter and also, the driver for the DSOs is just supply shortage or was there’s some backend linearity there as well. Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Yes. So linearity in the quarter from an order’s perspective was very normal, right? We saw a very strong demand and bookings throughout the quarter. And we really didn’t see any sort of abnormally from a linearity perspective. That said, from a shipping and therefore invoicing, we did see a pretty backend loaded quarter. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we had some supplier de-commitments and we had to kind of recover and react to that. So we did ship later in the quarter than we normally do that had an impact on DSO. It had an impact on the cash flow, but also had an impact on freight cost as we had to take faster routes to get products to customers in the commitments we made to them. So it had a negative impact on a few of our metrics.
Rod Hall: Got you. Okay. That’s very helpful. Thanks, Ken.
Ken Miller: Yes.
Operator: Okay. The next question is coming from Alex Henderson with Needham. Alex, your line is live.
Alex Henderson: Great. Thank you very much. So $2.4 billion plus in backlog is an enormous backlog relative to the historical norms of the company. And as we look forward if I were to run what the equivalent of a bank stress test on your outlook for a CY2023, it looks like you could produce 20%, 30%, 40% declines in orders for the next three or four quarters and right through to the back end of 2023, still hitting at least mid-single-digits or plus revenue growth and still end up with a backlog that’s 250% to 300% of normal, is the backlog likely to increase as we go into the back half of the year? And how do you view these year-over-year declines versus the ability to sustain a book-to-bill somewhere in the broad vicinity of 1.0 as we go through the end of the year, because that’s are really the critical variables to the stability and visibility of the 2023 numbers.
Ken Miller: Yes. So, I mean, you’re right. The backlog is unprecedented levels and, as how I see this year playing out, I can’t give you a precise number here. I will say this, I think they’ll remain elevated, kind of similar levels to where they are now. That would be my expectation as we kind of finish the second half of this year. And you are also are correct in that, the backlog should support our revenue for the next period of time, even if gross demand orders are down. And in fact, this quarter’s a good example of that, where we mentioned on the call that our orders were actually down single digits. But we not only delivered 10% product revenue growth. We also grew backlog $250 million, right? So there was a fair amount of room there in orders. And that just gives us confidence in our ability to generate revenue for sustainable future. And that’s one reason why we raised our guidance to at least mid-single-digits next year.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes. So, the key point of the question was, can you, in fact, if you went through a stress test analysis like a bank, absorb 20% or 30% declines for three or four quarters, and still end up with that massive backlog given where you are exiting 2023, and which case the only real question then is the improvement in the supply chains, your ability to deliver on better than 5% growth and in the top line over that timeframe that you clearly have the orders. And a put note to this, just want to clarify, when you talk about the geographies in your print, that’s a function of the timing of when orders came in. I assume these are first-in, first-out, and therefore not reflective of any particular change in demand in any particular geography, because it’s, your backlog increased. So therefore I assume it’s a allocation question, not a demand question.
Ken Miller: Yes. So, you’re absolutely right. If you were to perform such a stretch, test our model, our revenue model, given the backlog, we have would still sustain at those types of declines in orders, those 20%, 30% declines. So your math is correct. And again, that gives us a lot of comfort in our revenue growth sustainability for the next couple of years here. On the geo mix, I would say it is absolutely a factor of what we’re able to ship? What supply we’re able to procure? It’s not quite as simple as first-in, first-out, because quite honestly, the supply chain is very dynamic, and we have shortages in some parts, and we have more parts available in others. So it’s really about supply availability. And that really results in the revenue profiles that you see really across the board, geographically, as well as in some level – in some cases, the vertical cuts and the customer solution views is really about supply at this point.
Operator: Okay. The next question is coming from George Notter with Jefferies. George, your line is live.
George Notter: Hi guys. Thanks very much. I guess, I wanted to ask about some of the mix items affecting gross margins. You mentioned lower software license sales in the quarter. Can you be more specific about what that was? I realize it’s lumpy, it was bigger in Q2 getting smaller in Q3 and Q4, but what precisely was that? And what drives that the cadence of revenue recognition there? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Yes, George, let me take a crack at it. And then Ken, you can jump in. So total software grew at 24% year-over-year, that’s a good result, but it was down sequentially. And that affected our margins because of mix in the Q2 timeframe. The software softness was really all in our perpetual offerings. And those can be lumpy, they can be – they can swing around positively or negatively based on orders of state certain capabilities from some of the largest customers that we have for routing and switching products. Subscription software importantly remains really strong, and you can see that in deferred revenue, you can see that in our ARR, which grew at 34% year-over-year. So, I’m actually really confident in our ability to achieve our long-term software projections [ph], as well as our ARR. And then Ken, you can talk a little bit more about the mix issues in Q2.
Ken Miller: Yeah. So as Rami mentioned, it really was a bit of a shortfall sequentially in our on-box Junos Space to perpetual licenses. These really are various features and functions of services that provide within our Junos operating system. And there is some timing of refract that's difficult to predict here. Some of it is on customer buying behaviors, whether or not some customers might buy the lowest base level operating system software at time of purchase with an upgrade to maybe an advance or premium license later. There's also some true-ups between hardware and software that happens periodically.  So the timing of this recognition, it's all perpetual software, it's all recognized immediately, but the timing could vary based on what they buy and when they choose to buy it. So that's really what we're seeing here. Overall our software business continues to perform quite well. I think we're ahead of the targets we set for ourself a year and a half ago with the Investor Day both from an overall software perspective, as well as our ARR target. So I feel very good about our software transformation and moving forward, I expect us to continue to have a very strong software story.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. And then just as a follow-up, I know last quarter, I think more of the narrative around margins was on a higher mix of missed access points, a lower mix of MX shipments, obviously components drove that mix shift, but can you talk about how MX did this quarter, how you did with access points, did the mix of those pieces go up or down in Q2? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Yeah, so MX actually went up, so our hardware mix on the routing side and automated WAN side was up, that said some of these perpetual software licenses that I was mentioning before actually were attributed up to our automated WAN solutions. So the software mix with automated WAN was down a bit, some of these perpetual licenses that we've talked about, but overall the hardware mix was up. But it wasn't at the expense of access points. We continued to sell a lot of access points as well. You saw the results in IDE up 17%, so really strength in both the MX/automated-WAN business, as well as our IDE business.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Okay, thank you.
Rami Rahim: Yep.
Operator: Okay. The next question is coming from David Vod with UBS. Your line is live.
David Vod: Great. Thanks guys for taking my question. So I have sort of two related questions on margins. So I think in the prepared remarks, you noted that supply chain going forward is getting a little bit better. So kind of against that backdrop, if supply chain is improving on the margin sort of quarter-over-quarter, along with revenue that looks like it's going to be well above trend. Why are you not seeing more gross margin leverage in the third quarter, despite the expedited fees, but it sounds like it's getting better? And if expedited fees are about 50% above your prior expectations, does that give you confidence and a line of sight into potentially a 100 basis points of margin expansion next year, just basically effectively pushing it out by year, what you'd expected for this year as we entered the year? Thanks.
Ken Miller: Yeah. So on the supply getting better, is really kind of a nuanced message I want to make sure is well understood. Access to supply is still highly constrained. Lead times into us are still extremely limited. That said we've taken some action to actually procure more supply. So I think we'll have more supply than we originally expected when we started the year, which is a good thing. So that's an improvement in supply, but it's coming at cost. And that's really the offset here is that we are paying more. We're having to pay more expedite fees. We're going to broker markets and paying several times more than we should be paying for this, for that particular component in the open market.  So it is coming at a cost. So volume is improving but costs are going up is probably the short summary on the supply side. For 2023 on the supply, was it a supply related question as well? 
David Vod: Well, I mean, Ken, I think you said, expedited fees came in about above your expectations. So that would translate into a little bit north of $50 million or almost the point of margin. So how does that play into next year?
Ken Miller: Yeah, so I do believe those expedite fees and component costs the $155 million that I referenced is transitory and exactly the timeframe is difficult to predict, but I do believe if you go out, I don't know, a couple of two, three years you'll see the majority, if not all of those costs go away. However, the timing, how many – the expedite fees we're paying, the elevator freight we're paying it's hard to predict exactly what we're going to start to see that normalize. I do think we should see some benefit in 2023, but I'm not ready to quantify how much.
David Vod: Great, thanks guys.
Operator: All right. The next question is coming from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Simon, your line is live.
Simon Leopold: Thanks for taking the question. I want to see if you could describe within your backlog, what do you see happening in terms of the major product categories and your market share? I’m trying to get an understanding of where you’re gaining market share based on your awards versus where you might be?
Rami Rahim: Hey, Simon.
Simon Leopold: Yes.
Rami Rahim: Sorry. We’re going to interrupt you. Could you repeat the question? We had a little glitch here. So we missed a part of your question and sorry to bother you, but we’re going to need you to repeat it.
Simon Leopold: No problem. You hear me, okay, now?
Rami Rahim: Yes, we can.
Simon Leopold: Okay, great. I wanted to see if you could talk about within your pipeline, your backlog, how you see your market share trends in the major category? So what major verticals or products do you see yourselves gaining share the most and where do you see yourself most vulnerable in the mix? I know we’ve talked a lot about campus as an area where we’ve seen you gaining share. I want to see if you could talk a little bit more broadly about other product categories and just confirm the campus?
Rami Rahim: Yes, I’d be happy to. So I do think the one area where we are most obviously taking share is going to be in the enterprise and more specifically in the client to cloud. So that includes wired, wireless, and increasingly it’s going to include a full stack solution of wired, wireless and SD-WAN because we’re now pretty much integrated our 128 Technology SD-WAN solution into that end-to-end AI driven enterprise capability. So the numbers speak for themselves, double-digit revenue growth, double-digit order growth and all that. Very, very pleased there. I don’t think that’s the only place where we’re taking share. I do think in terms of 400-gig opportunities now that 400-gig has moved from discussions and PowerPoints into competitive bakeoffs. I do think that we are winning share wherever there is a net new opportunity, be it for our service about our core, where I just talked in my prepared remark about our new win, new data center, cloud WAN opportunities. I do think and time will tell as this translates to actual revenue results and actual share results. I do think this is an area where we’re performing very well and we are taking share. The last area that I will mention that I think is going to be an obvious place where we’re going to take share, because we’re really starting from very little is in the Metro. 5G is a real thing. It’s driving fiber build outs by service providers. We are essentially very small players in the Metro because we’ve never really had a complete portfolio and we just announced that complete portfolio and it should essentially come together and be fully in production by the early part of next year. So even in the absence of that solution, we’re seeing a 100 plus percent year-over-year growth in orders for ACX. I think that will only accelerate once we’ve got that complete solution. I’m sure there are other areas where we’re doing very well data center for example, but those the areas that I’d say are top of mind right now in terms of the biggest opportunity for share take.
Simon Leopold: Thanks for taking the questions.
Rami Rahim: My pleasure. Thank you.
Operator: Okay. Up next, we have Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. Samik, your line is live.
Angela Jin: Hi, this is Angela Jin on for Samik. I don’t – I hate to ask the recession question, but I was curious how would each vertical respond in the event of a macro slowdown and what are the areas of a portfolio that you think are more resilient to a slowdown versus more aligned to cyclical trends?
Rami Rahim: Thanks Angela for the question. I’ll start, first, I think it’s a hypothetical question, because I said, I think order strength remains very high. We don’t see any obvious indicators that there is going to be macro headwinds, but of course it’s our job to stay very vigilant and to just make sure that we’re looking for any early warning indicators. In terms of what one would expect would be with the other challenging areas, service providers and cloud providers tend to have very strategic long-term projects. And for that reason, I would expect that they would be more macro resilient. But even in the enterprise where I would say that most people would expect that there might be the biggest risks if there were macro headwinds, there what we have going for us, as I mentioned earlier is we have massive TAMs, total addressable markets, 30 plus billions – billion dollars across our client to cloud and data center. We’re relatively small player with small share, a very differentiated solution and plenty of room to grow even if there are in fact macro headwinds that affect that TAM. And I think part of the results we’re posting are a little bit of a proof point for that.
Operator: Okay. The next question is coming from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Aaron, your line is live.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I hate to do this, but I want to go back to the backlog a little bit. You mentioned in the prepared remarks, I know you disclosed it in the past that you had implemented some price increases back, I think you said in 2Q of 2021. It sounds like you're going to implement some more actions here going forward. I'm just curious considering the significant amount of backlog that's likely been built over the past year let alone the $500 million through the first half or a $550 million through the first half the year. How do we think about those price actions starting to filter through that backlog and really starting to provide, maybe the positive effect to the gross margin understanding you've got a lot of supply chain dynamics going on?
Rami Rahim: Yes. So it is going to feather in over time. We are seeing more and more benefit each quarter. So Q2 this last quarter we saw more benefit than we saw in Q1. And I expect us to see more benefit here in the second half from the pricing actions. The actions we're about ready to take, we really aren't going to start to play until probably FY 2023, given the backlog. And again, I expect that to feather in overtime and be incremental over time as we move into the 2023 quarters. The unfortunate reality is the benefit we're seeing is getting more than offset by the cost, right? When we put the actions in place, we had some assumptions on the incremental costs, the expedite fees, great costs, et cetera, and we undershot – we overshot I should say or the cost overshot those expectations. So we are seeing some benefit. There is more of the pricing benefit in the backlog yet to come, that's going to continue to help us in the future quarters. But at this point we just don't see that help enough to really keep the margin range where we started the year at 58 to 60.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. And as – and just as a quick follow-up question on the continued traction that you're seeing in 400-gig, I know this quarter you had mentioned 80, I think last quarter you had mentioned 70 design wins. I'm curious if you were just asked like what inning do you think we're at in terms of kind of really volume deployments across those 80 design wins for 400-gig at this point? And when do you think actually we're halfway through those deployments, just kind of thinking about the trajectory of those 400-gig wins?
Rami Rahim: Yes. It's a good question. First, I want to just clarify. The 80 or so wins are data center 400-gig wins, we've actually we're now seeing close to accumulative 400 wins across data center and wide area in service provider and in the cloud provider segments. In terms of where we are, I mean, if you looked at port mix between 100-gig and 400-gig, both in terms of orders and shipments, it's still at early innings for 400-gig. There are a lot more networks that are going to be built out with 400-gig. So we viewed these sorts of network interface happen once every several years, maybe four or five years or so. We're now at the beginning stages of one of those inflections and that's good for our industry, certainly good for Juniper.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. Thank you.
Rami Rahim: My pleasure.
Operator: Okay. Next we have Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Meta, your line is live.
Meta Marshall: Great. Thanks. Maybe following up on the answer to George's question, you mentioned kind of some uncertainty on what addition might be elected in terms of kind of where the perpetual revenue comes in for software. I was just trying to get a sense of some of that volatility more – more pronounced this quarter just because of the amount of kind of cloud customers that you're servicing or just trying to get some insight into what is causing that volatility? And then maybe just as a follow-up question; just is this kind of quarter where you would consider inventory peaking, or do you still think that you'll be in an inventory kind of accumulation period for the kind of foreseeable future? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Yes. So on the software volatility, we did, I mentioned buying patterns vary and the reality is in Q4 of last year and Q1 of this year, we saw some of those above normal buying patterns where customers were either doing true-ops or maybe upgrading their software system from a base level to a more advanced or premium level. So we did see some of the, kind of the high water marks of that volatility in the past few quarters. In Q2, I think we saw a little bit more of a normal kind of hardware to software attach, and at this point I'm expecting the rest of the year to be largely similar to Q2. That said customers could surprise me and might upgrade their software stack here in the futures and will obviously be available for that when – if they decide to do that. So it's difficult to predict. I wouldn't call it out as any sort of customer pattern. It's really just more about timing of when they purchase perpetual software. And we had a couple quarters of highs and now I think we're back to kind of a normal from a perpetual perspective, as Rami mentioned, our subscription software, our SaaS software is growing well beyond normal, right. We continue to grow at extremely high levels on that part of our software portfolio. From an inventory perspective, I don't think we've seen the end of the inventory built. You know, we are still, if you look at our, open purchase orders we are absolutely putting a demand signal out there that supports what we think is our demand opportunity. And that's a, that's going to result in more inventory, what's happening out there is you're, we are definitely seeing constrained in certain parts, but there's other parts of the bill of material that are not constrained. And that's really the part of the inventory that's building up, as we start to get some of the more critical parts, we'll be able to ship, our backlog and we'll see the inventory level start to go down. So I don't think inventory's going to start to, decline until we start to see supply chains really improve and backlog levels start to come down.
Jess Lubert: Operator, we'll take two more questions.
Operator: Okay. The next is coming from Sami Badri with Juniper. Your line is live.
Sami Badri: Hi, thank you. First question is, if we were just to take the percentage of revenues in 2022, that reflect the price increase actions, what percentage of those revenues are coming through, and what is the objective of 2023, will 2023 reflect all price action increases and maybe just like a percentage mix of 2022?
Rami Rahim: Yes. I'm sorry, Sami but that's not a level of detail I'm prepared to comment on, on this call. I'll say that, I would expect it to normalize by, call of four quarters out. So by the late this year, we should see some normalization from the action we took last year. But as far as the percentage of total revenue, I'm not prepared to comment on at this call.
Operator: Okay. Next we have Tal Liani with Bank of America. Tal, your line is live.
Tal Liani: Hey, guys I want to go back to your 2023 guidance. It, I tried to look at it multiple ways and it looks to me either that you're banking or you're assuming very steep decline in revenues, in certain areas or that you're just very, very conservative. In the four quarters of this year, your growing revenues, the low is 8.3. The high is 13.5, so there is substantial growth this year. And next year we should see some of the backlog released, being released. So 5% looks, looks weak versus what we're seeing this year. And then also, if I just look at your enterprise growth, this year substantial growth, it's about 35% of your revenues plus that alone contributes 4% of revenues give or take next year. So what are your assumptions when you say 5% or better, the 5% mark, which I understand it's going to be better? What are your assumptions about the telecom market about the cloud market? When you project 5% or more, are you assuming end of projects, are you assuming declines or what are basically your basic assumptions in saying 5%?
Rami Rahim: Let me start, I think the key here is that we didn't say it's 5%. We said, it's, at least 5%, or at least mid single digits. If in fact the markets play out, as we expect, and there aren't any major sort of challenges macro wise. Yes, the opportunity is absolutely there for us, not just to meet, but to exceed that's bar that we are setting for ourselves. It's just a little early right now. I don't think we typically provide color on the next year in this timeframe, but we thought we'd start at this point in time. And yes, I mean, I've talked quite a bit, even on this call alone about some of the catalysts around 5G clarification efforts, 400 gig enterprise. Yes. I mean, I think these are all catalysts that can give us the opportunity to exceed that outlook.
Ken Miller: And I would just comment, its demand is not the primary driver of our revenue outlook for 2023. That given the backlog, given the strength, we seeing the momentum we have, all the things Rami has mentioned demand would definitely imply, a higher level than a, mid at least mid single digits. It's really a supply, a constrained view at this point. And the good news is we see the supply, constraints being lessened. We expect volume to improve, which is why we thought giving you a number greater than what you had historically, which was at least low single digits with the prudent thing to do at this point.
Jess Lubert: Thank you, Operator. That's all the questions we have. That concludes today's call.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-04-26 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Juniper Networks First Quarter 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode and we’ll open the floor for your questions and comments after the presentation. It’s now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Jess Lubert. Sir, the floor is yours.
Jess Lubert: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to our first quarter 2022 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today’s call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results might differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release, and CFO commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and Juniper undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the company’s financial results is included in today’s press release. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question so that as many people as possible who would like to ask a question have a chance.  With that, I will now turn the call over to Rami.
Rami Rahim: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today’s call to discuss our Q1 2022 results. Before I begin, I’d like to provide a brief statement on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. My thoughts are with all those affected by this tragic war, particularly our colleagues in the region and those with loved ones who have been impacted. When the war began, we quickly suspended all sales and services within Russia and Belarus. Given the complexity of the events, we’re continuing to closely monitor the situation and hope for the restoration of peace and safety. In the meantime, Juniper and its employees made contributions to support humanitarian efforts in Ukraine, and the Juniper Foundation made a donation to UNICEF to help its vital work in the region.  Turning to the quarter, we delivered strong Q1 results. Revenue growth accelerated year-over-year, and we met the midpoint of our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance, despite continued challenges from a supply chain perspective. Our teams continue to execute extremely well and are focused on delivering solutions that simplify the life of network operators and delight network users, what we call experience first networking, continues to resonate across each of the markets we serve. This is evidenced in our Q1 results, which not only benefited from a fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth in cloud, but also an exceptional performance by our enterprise business, which saw revenue grow nearly 20% year-over-year. This enterprise performance is particularly noteworthy, as it was the first quarter in Juniper’s history to enterprise what’s the company’s largest customer vertical. Cloud and enterprise strength more than offset a modest decline in our service provider vertical, which was due entirely to the timing of shipments as a result of supply chain challenges.  Demand remained strong in the March quarter, with orders estimated to have seen double-digit year-over-year growth when adjusted to account for certain large customers placing orders ahead of their normal order rate to account for extended lead times. On an unadjusted basis, orders grew by more than 35% year-over-year, and our ending backlog increased meaningfully on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. Order momentum was strong across all customer verticals and all customer solutions, with each of these categories experiencing strong double-digit order growth year-over-year.  While some of the strength reflect healthy customer spending patterns across each of our core customer verticals, where the importance of the network has never been more clear, we believe much of this demand is attributable to our strong execution across our product management, engineering, and go to market organizations, which is enabling us to capitalize on significant customer initiatives. Examples of these initiatives that continued to see strong investments include enterprise digital transformation and office reopening project, 400-gig upgrade at cloud and service provider customers, and the broad adoption of cloud-based services and associated network architectures.  As we enter the June quarter, momentum is strong and I remain optimistic regarding our prospects for the year, despite the various supply chain challenges we are facing. I continue to believe these challenges are likely to prove transitory and the strong order momentum we’re seeing and the backlog we have developed sets us up extremely well to deliver solid growth and improve profitability in the 2022 timeframe and beyond. Based on a recent order momentum, current backlog level, and our assumptions regarding supply, we still expect to deliver 7% to 9% sales growth and still are targeting at least 8 points of non-GAAP operating margin expansion in 2022. Our expectations for 2022 assume current supply chain challenges persist, and that we’re unable to work down backlog during the year, potentially creating long-term tailwind for our business once the supply chain situation improves and backlog returns to more normal levels.  Now, I’d like to provide some additional insight into the quarter and address some key developments we’re seeing from a customer solutions perspective. Starting with Automated WAN, while this solution set experienced only modest Q1 revenue growth year-over-year, due entirely to the timing of shipments, demand for these solutions remains exceptionally strong as we experienced at least double-digit order growth across all customer verticals and all major product families including our MX, PTX and ACX offerings. We’re continuing to see strong 400-gig momentum with our cloud and service provider customers, which should present building tailwind for our business over the next several years.  In this most recent quarter, I was particularly encouraged to see strong early interest in several of our newer Automated WAN solutions. To this point, our MX10k product family experienced a record quarter and our new LC9600 programmable 10-terabit, 400-gig capable line card, which leverages our latest Trio 6 silicon experienced the strongest adoption of any Automated WAN product launched over the last five years. We also saw another quarter of triple-digit order growth for our ACX Metro portfolio, and growing demand for our Paragon Automation software. With additional Trio 6 based MX products and new ACS Metro offerings expected to launch over the next several quarters, and new PTX products leveraging our next generation Express 5 silicon also coming to market next year, I am optimistic regarding the long-term growth potential of our Automated WAN solutions, and our ability to capitalize on our customers Core, Edge, and Metro requirements.  Our cloud-ready data center solutions experienced 20% year-over-year revenue growth during the March quarter due to broad base strength across customer verticals and geographies. Orders were exceptionally strong in Q1 due to the momentum we’re seeing with cloud major customers, as well as certain service provider accounts. Our 400-gig solutions are resonating in the market and we have now secured more than 70 data centers switching opportunities that span across clouds majors, enterprise, and service provider accounts. One opportunity, which I believe speaks to the strength of our data center switching systems and software capabilities is a meaningful new data center win with a top 10 cloud provider. This deal is already generating orders and is likely to drive meaningful revenue over the next few years. Customer interest in our cloud ready data center portfolio remains high and given the wins we’ve already secured, we’re increasingly optimistic regarding our ability to capitalize on the attractive growth within this market over the next several years.  Our AI-driven enterprise revenue continued to materially outpace the market growing 33% year-over-year. This strength was led by our Mist-ified portfolio, which surpassed a $400 million annualized revenue run rate in Q1, as both the wireless business and the related EX wired switching flow through more than doubled year-over-year to record level. Mist-ified revenue grew at 135% year-over-year, and we continue to see exceptional order momentum due to the success with existing customers and new logos. As a reminder, Juniper leverages the industry’s leading Mist AI engine, a modern micro services cloud, and a proven AI-driven Virtual Network Assistant Marvis to improve customer operations across the smallest to the largest customer environments. The ability to scale cost effectively, to reduce IT helpdesk tickets, to quickly remediate problems, and to rapidly introduce new business enhancing services are among the reasons customers of all sizes are swapping out the competition and standardizing on Mist AI. While many of these capabilities are well known, Juniper also delivered industry-leading location-based services based on Mist AI, which is incredibly important to certain verticals such as retail.  We’re also seeing strong interest from enterprises, as they readied their offices for return to work. Recognizing this point of critical differentiation, Gartner recently lifted Juniper mist as a Magic Quadrant leader for location-based services, making us the only vendor to make the leaders Quadrant for both wired and wireless access and location-based services, which is an important validation that we believe is likely to further benefit demand. Despite our lead, we are continuing to invest in our Mist AI differentiation.  In Q4 of 2021, we acquired WiteSand, a small private company with exceptional talents that will accelerate our development of a cloud native network access control solution. We believe this solution will prove highly attractive to many customers, which has grown frustrated by existing on-prem solutions, which are expensive and difficult to both deploy and manage. And not to be overlooked, we continue to make progress Mist-ifying our 128 Technology SD-WAN solution. The completion of this process is expected to further cement our ability to provide the industry’s best assured and secure connectivity experience from client to cloud. We continue to be encouraged by the momentum that 128 Technology is experiencing with recent wins with Fortune 200 enterprises in the US and the large financial services organizations in Europe.  Based on our recent order momentum, third party validation, and the technical superiority of our AI-driven enterprise portfolio, I remain highly confident regarding the outlook of our AI driven enterprise business. Our security revenues slightly declined in Q1 year-over-year, but I continue to expect growth for this business. My confidence is fueled by the efficacy with performance of our firewall products, which were recently ranked number one by ICSA, a leading third-party independent security testing company, for a fifth consecutive quarter with 100% detection rate against cyber threats that top results achieved but all other security peers. Customers are telling us that in light of ongoing geopolitical difficulties, 100% security effectiveness is more important than ever, and give Juniper a unique competitive advantage. I believe the convergence of networking and security will only increase across the markets we serve and I’m confident that this will present a competitive advantage in all of our strategic customer use cases.  Importantly, we continue to make progress transitioning our business to a more software-centric model by transforming more of our perpetual offering to turn-based licenses, introducing more radical subscription offerings, and training our sales organization to better monetize the value of our software stack. While these efforts remain in the early innings, we experienced another quarter of encouraging momentum in the Q1 timeframe, which saw total software and related services revenue grew by 60% year-over-year to account for 20% of our total revenue. Software orders were also strong in the period increasing by more than 80% year-over-year. Our annualized recurring revenue, which solely consists of truly ratable software subscriptions and related services, increased 30% year-over-year, due to the strong demand for Mist and security subscriptions. We’re encouraged by the progress we’re making in our efforts to capture more software revenue, which we view as critical to not only accelerating growth, but also improving customer stickiness and margin.  Our services team delivered another impressive quarter due to strong services renewal and attach rates. In addition to strong revenue, we also delivered record service margin. Our services organization continues to execute extremely well and it’s focused on driving innovation through automation and cloud delivered insights that not only create new revenue opportunities, but also benefit margin and the customer experience.  Now I’d like to provide an update on our Silicon Photonics efforts, which had been focused on disrupting the optical component market through unmatched optical integration that would result in lower cost and superior power efficiency as compared to traditional solutions in the market. Through our investment, and working closely with customers and partners, we’ve validated the advantages of our integrated hybrid laser technology and the broad market opportunity with applications and networking data center disaggregation AI, LiDAR and beyond. However, we learned that the full potential of this opportunity would be best realized if we could enable a large ecosystem of partners to design on the technology and derive volume economics. In order to capitalize on this broader opportunity set, we have created a new company that has launched the first open foundry platform for integrated Silicon Photonics. Synopsys has acquired a majority interest in this new company. They are an ideal partner to launch this company, as they bring deep expertise and customer presence, as a leader in intellectual property licensing and semiconductor design. We believe this new entity will be better equipped to target the broad array of Silicon Photonics opportunities that technology can address through both discrete components sales and licensing models. We will also maintain an ownership interest in the new entity that will allow us to benefit from its product as well as the business’s future financial success. Finally, you may have noticed our announcements that our Chief Revenue Officer, Marcus Jewell, has decided to leave Juniper for a new opportunity. Derrell James, Executive Vice President of Customer Experience, will assume the role on an interim basis. I’d like to thank Marcus for his services and the contributions he’s made to the company over the last few years. Marcus leaves our sales organization in excellent shape and I’m confident we have the talent and the organizational tools to navigate the transition and maintain our momentum without any disruption.  I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for stakeholders.  I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail.
Ken Miller: Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start by discussing our first quarter results and end with some color on our outlook. We ended the first quarter of 2022 at $1,168 million in revenue, above the midpoint of our guidance and up 9% year-over-year. Non GAAP earnings per share were $0.31, in line with our guidance and increased 3% year-over-year. Product orders remained strong in the first quarter, posting greater than 35% year-over-year growth, and we again saw double digit order growth year-over-year across all verticals and customer solutions. Some of this order strength continues to be attributable to industry supply chain challenges, resulting in customers placing orders ahead of their normal order rate to account for the extended lead time. After adjusting for these early orders for certain large customers, total product orders are estimated to have grown double-digits versus last year. Our backlog increased more than $300 million on a sequential basis. Looking at our revenue by customer solution, we saw revenue growth in all areas on a year-over-year basis. Automated WAN solutions revenue increased 1% versus the first quarter of 2021, cloud ready data center revenue increased 20% year-over-year, and AI driven enterprise revenue increased 33% year-over-year. Turning to revenue by vertical, momentum in our enterprise business continued and grew 19% versus the first quarter of last year. For the first time in our history, it represented our largest customer vertical. Our cloud business grew 13% year-over-year, our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. While service provider revenue declined 2% year-over-year due to the timing of shipments, orders increased double-digits versus the first quarter of last year. Total software and related services revenue was $228 million, which was an increase of 60% year-over-year. Annual recurring revenue or ARR grew approximately 30% year-over-year. Total security revenue was $161 million, down 1% versus the first quarter of last year. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, three were cloud, six were service provider, and one was an enterprise. Our top 10 customers accounted for 32% of total revenue as compared to 31% in the first quarter last year. In the quarter, we had one cloud customer that accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue.  Non-GAAP gross margin was 57.5%, which was below the midpoint of our guidance, primarily due to the unfavorable product and customer mix, partially offset by an increase in service margin. As expected, COVID-19 related supply costs continue to be elevated. And if not for these costs, we estimate that we would have posted non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 60%. Operating expenses on a non-GAAP basis increased 5% year-over-year and was essentially flat sequentially. Non GAAP operating margin was 11.8% for the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. Cash flow from operations was $193 million for the quarter. We paid $68 million in dividends, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share. We also repurchased $112 million worth of shares in the quarter. Total cash, cash equivalents, and investments at the end of the first quarter of 2022 was $1.7 billion. I’m very pleased with the financial performance in the first quarter. The performance is a testament to our team’s dedication and resiliency through these challenging and dynamic times. Now I’d like to provide some color on our guidance, which you could find detailed in the CFO commentary available on our Investor Relations website. We expect second quarter revenue of $1,255 million, plus or minus $50 million, which is growth at 7% year-over-year. We continue to experience significant supply chain-related headwinds associated with elevated component, freight and logistics costs, which are expected to continue throughout the year. We also expect to see a decrease in service margin on a sequential basis. Therefore, we expect second quarter non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 58%, plus or minus 8%, which is up sequentially at the midpoint. Our non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be approximately $0.45, plus or minus $0.05, assuming a share count of approximately 330 million shares. Turning to our expectation for the full year 2022, I like to echo Rami’s sentiment with respect to the war between Russia and Ukraine. In addition, I’d like to point out that we do not expect this ongoing conflict to have a material impact on our business. Given the strong order momentum and current backlog, we continue to expect 7% to 9% revenue growth for the full year. This assumes the supply chain environment remains constrained throughout the year, similar to current levels, and does not further deteriorate. We expect revenue to grow sequentially through the remainder of the year. We expect supply chain constraints to be particularly tight during the second quarter and remain challenged throughout the year. We also anticipate backlog to remain at elevated levels throughout the course of the year. Moving on to non-GAAP gross margin, which can be difficult to predict due to the uncertain macroeconomic environment. We expect to see sequential improvement through the year. However, given our current view of freight costs and other pressures on supply chain costs, we now expect full year non-GAAP gross margin to be below the midpoint of our 58% to 60% range. We remain committed to discipline expense management and will target full year non-GAAP operating margin expansion of at least 100 basis points versus 2021. That said we will continue to invest to take advantage of market opportunities and non-GAAP operating expense is expected to be up on a full year basis, consistent with the guidance we provided previously. Our non GAAP tax rate on worldwide earnings is expected to be 20% plus or minus 1%. Our non GAAP EPS is expected to grow faster than revenue on a full year basis. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper’s success, especially in this challenging environment. Now, I’d like to open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Your line is live.
Simon Leopold: Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to see if maybe you could unpack a little bit about what’s going on with your cloud customers. So notable that you talked about a 10% customer breaking in but I wanted to see if you could dig into the patterns or behaviors of the cloud majors and what’s going on with that group in terms of what are they buying and how do you see them growing in their contributions to your cloud vertical? Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Yeah, thanks for the question. What I’m seeing within the cloud vertical is strength and momentum in ordering and in just our ability to compete and win that new opportunity. I think that strength is broad based. We’re capitalizing on existing footprint that we have in both our tier one as well as our cloud major space. Most of that footprint, as you know, in hyperscale, is in routing, but beyond that, it’s in both routing and switching. So while we have footprint, I think the fact that this customer class continues to invest is something that bodes very well for our business and continues to do so.  But then the other thing that’s really notable that I think we’ve provided several updates on key wins that we’ve had of net new footprint in the cloud provider space and there’s one notable one that I mentioned in my prepared remarks. This is a top 10 cloud provider. We were already a routing supplier for this customer and then we had an opportunity in essentially one net new datacenter footprint that’s quite meaningful, from an order standpoint thus far, but eventually it will become a revenue standpoint. And I think we won based on the strength of our engagement in routing that essentially translated to an opportunity in switching. We won based on the strength of our sales engagement, and also our ability to provide equipment in a timely manner, which was very important for this project as well. So it’s a combination of real good solid industry tailwinds coupled with excellent execution of our sales and engineering team. 
Simon Leopold: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from David Vod from UBS. Your line is live.
David Vod: Great. Thanks for taking my question, guys. So just quickly on service provider and cloud ready data center growth, it looks like the timing of the shipments due to supply chain had an impact in Q4 and then a snapback this quarter. How should we think about normalized growth rate for cloud-ready datacenter going forward, given sort of the volatility in the supply chain is sort of a 5% to 9% CAGR still the right way to think about it? And then, along the same lines, it looks like SP was impacted by similar dynamics this quarter, and also heard Automated WAN. Should we expect a similar recovery next quarter, like what we saw in this quarter in cloud data? And I’ll just stop there. Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Okay, let me start, and then maybe, Ken, you can jump in as well on this one. So I’ll start with service provider. From an orders standpoint, I think we performed exceptionally well, the slight decline in revenue is entirely due to the timing of shipments, when we were basically able to provide product to our customers and this after the Q4 timeframe, where we actually saw strong service provider revenue performance, primarily, again, there because of the timing of shipments in that timeframe. All in all, I feel very good about where we are with our service provider customers, the strength of our solutions, the pickup of net new technologies that we’ve just recently introduced into the market. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, a new MX line card based on our latest generation silicon technology that we recently introduced into the market and it’s seeing the fastest adoption of any new MX products in the last five years. I think that speaks again to the health of the market, as well as to the strength of the technology that we’re offering. So, I still think that in terms of the long-term outlook for this particular vertical minus 2% to plus 2%, we’re at if not better than that going forward.  I think the other part of the question was around the cloud ready datacenter. There, from a revenue standpoint, we did very well, 20% year-over-year growth, and from an order perspective, even better. And I think there again, it’s a combination of good industry tailwinds, solid execution. I talked about the cloud provider data center win in top 10. That’s net new for us. That’s just an example of the kind of win that we’re able to achieve these days. Rapid adoption of new merchant silicon technologies in our product offerings. Apstra is a key piece of the end to end differentiation that brings industry leading automation intent-based networking to our solutions. So there’s a lot we have going for us in the cloud-ready data center vertical right now. And again, there, our long term view is 5% to 9%. I think we’ll do at if not better than that long term view.  Ken anything else you’d like to add? 
Ken Miller: Rami, I would just reiterate, I think for all of our verticals, including service provider, and all of our customer solutions, including CRBC, we haven’t given specific FY22 revenue guidance but I do believe all verticals, all customer solutions could be at or better than the long-term model that we put out there. In any given quarter, you’re going to see a little bit of anomalies, which is really going to be shipment based or supply chain based and you mentioned a couple of you saw last quarter and this last Q4 and that will continue. But for the long run weeks, we feel very good about all verticals, all customer solutions.
David Vod: All right. Thanks, Ken. Thanks, Rami.
Ken Miller: Yep. 
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs. Your line is live.
Rod Hall: Yeah. Hey, guys, thanks for the question. I just wanted to check back on the sequential product gross margin weakness. I know you guys talked a little bit about customer mix, and also the cost. But I wonder if you could dig into the mix side of it a little bit and talk about how much of that is temporary, give us any more color you can give us on the mix and how that affected the margins? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Absolutely. And if you go back, if you’re looking at on a trend basis, the biggest impact to product gross margin by far are going to be these kind of COVID-related supply constrained related costs that we’ve been talking about for a while. And even in Q1, the most recent quarter here, we posted 57.5% gross margin, it would have been approximately 250 basis points higher, nearly 60% if not for some of these costs that we do believe will be transitory. But if you compare it to the guidance, I mean, obviously, we knew about much of that cost, so we set our guide at 58% and we came in at 57.5%. That is a systems mix or kind of a hardware mix issue.  And in particular, MX was down a bit and this was from a shipping perspective, obviously, it has to do with our ability to procure the components and ship the product. We don’t have the demand issue with MX, it was actually very strong and we’re building a lot of backlog. But from what we shipped in Q1, we shipped a little bit less MX than we anticipated and we shipped a little bit more missed access points, which at the time of shipment carries a relatively low margin compared to the rest of our portfolio but obviously, as we sell more software and we recognize that software, which happens over time, it is margin positive over the long run. But in Q1 specifically, a little less MX than we expected to ship and a little more access points, not really the primary driver in the 50 basis points miss from our guidance.
Rod Hall: And then maybe follow that up with just an additional question on that same topic. Do you guys have any line of sight to that supplier? Is it just all these disruptions that make it impossible to know when supply there gets a little bit better? I know that’s been kind of an ongoing supply issue for you, so just wondering what the visibility looks like here.
Rami Rahim: Yeah, it’s difficult to predict in any given 90 days what we’re going to shoot more of or less of, it’s even difficult to predict beyond that. I mean, I would say from several quarters now, we’re seeing is kind of a series of continuous disruptions, whether it’s COVID related shutdowns or material shortages, logistics bottlenecks, even the war in Ukraine, and we’ve even had some system outages with some of our suppliers and partners. We continue to navigate through these disruptions to the best of our ability.  At this point in time, I think it’s prudent to presume we’ll have more unpredictable disruptions for the next couple quarters. I have to admit, I was a little more bullish on potentially seeing improvements in the second half of ‘22 at the beginning of the year than I am now. I now don’t anticipate significant improvements throughout the entire year and I do think we’ll see improvements in 2023. I still feel we’ll get the supply necessary, obviously, to get to our revenue goals of 7% to 9% this year, and that will be up year-on-year. We will grow revenue faster this year than last year as an example, so supply will be more plentiful and absolute, but it’ll still be very constrained as compared to what our demand signals are and our ability to ship even more.
Rod Hall: Are you guys -- given that change, are you guys expecting the 1.8 billion a backlog? I know you said to kind of exit the year with that amount. Do you -- is there upward pressure on that now? Do you think maybe the backlog you exit was a little bit higher than that or are you still thinking that you can kind of stick to that? I guess it was 1.8, if I’m remembering right.
Rami Rahim: Yeah, it was 1.8. We did grow it greater than 300 million this last quarter. It’s hard to predict, Rod, with any certainty where we are going to land. But I will tell you this, it will be significantly elevated, whether it is 1.8 or 2.1 somewhere in that order of magnitude would be my expectation as we exit the year. So if supply does not get better later this year, obviously that will result in even more opportunity in 2023 and beyond, as we exited the year with significantly elevated backlog. 
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your line is live.
Aaron Rakers: Yeah, thanks. Just following up on that last question first, just curious as I think in your 10-K filings you noted that the backlog that you’re carrying definitely extends out 12 months. That 2.1 billion plus that you’re carrying now, how would you characterize the duration of that relative to what maybe you saw coming out of last quarter? And I have a quick follow up, if I can, as well.
Rami Rahim: Yeah, I would day the duration is similar to what we saw last quarter. Just to clarify, I mean, customers are largely looking for the product sooner than we’re able to supply. So that kind of 12 month horizon is unfortunately a -- because of the supply constraints we’re seeing and the lead times that we’re dealing with, customers are actually interested in getting product sooner than we’re able to deliver.
Aaron Rakers: Yeah. And then as a quick follow up, going back to Simon’s question on the data center footprint, it sounds like a big deal. I think, Ken, in the past, you’ve been reluctant to think about data center switching wins as a big opportunity for Juniper inside some of the major cloud vendors. Has your opinion changed on that? And how would you characterize or what was the competitive -- was it a competitive displacement? Just any kind of further additional color on that seemingly large cloud win?
Rami Rahim: Yeah, Aaron, that’s a good question. So we have been reluctant to call a hyperscale data center win because there are very few number of hyperscale customers that are -- that use OEMs for their data centers. So let’s just say there are very few at that, which we are completely continuing to compete for, but at this point in time, we’re just not announcing any. That said, we’ve all along said that the opportunity beyond hyperscale is large with many at that. And we absolutely saw that is a strategic opportunity for us to go in to compete for, to take more than our fair share, and we’re doing just that.  So this net new is a perfect example of a non-hyperscale, top 10, very meaningful in terms of orders and revenue, where we competed on the strength of our switching technology, the engagement that we already have with the customer in the routing side that we were able to translate into the switching side, the ability for us to do when necessary achieve pretty difficult tasks of getting the supplies, when it was in fact required and requested by the customer. So, all of the above led to a sizeable win. And I want to be clear that we continue to see a large net new opportunities before us, both in hyperscale and in cloud majors beyond hyperscale, in routing, and in switching that we’re competing for, and I feel very good about our opportunity to win more of these types of really lucrative deals just based on all of what I’ve mentioned.
Aaron Rakers: Great. Congratulates. Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from George Notter from Jefferies. Your line is live.
George Notter: Hi, thanks a lot. I guess I wanted to ask about pricing. I think you guys looking back have taken a couple of pricing actions. But could you give us an update on where you stand there? How much extra price have you embedded into the price list and maybe talk about when that flows into the model and is there some potential for additional pricing increases going forward?
Rami Rahim: Yeah, we have taken a couple actions, pretty significant actions last year. It will take some time for that flow into the model, given the strength of our backlog, but we do expect to see some benefit of last year’s actions in the second half of this year. So we’ll start to realize some of that here in a few quarters. As far as future actions, we are always looking at opportunities that we think makes sense for us to take advantage of nothing to announce on this call, but you could count on us continuing to look at all options and making pricing decisions that we think make the best sense for Juniper moving forward. And we haven’t quantified the previous actions but really our intent here is to offset some of the gross profit dollars that we are going -- that we were losing due to the cost increases that we’re seeing. There is a timing lag here where we’re seeing the cost increases hit much sooner, and some of these pricing actions are going to take a few quarters to materialize.
George Notter: Got it. And then also one of the things I noticed you guys seem to be hiring pretty aggressively just looking at your headcount numbers. I know there was a little acquisition in here also, but can you talk about where the sales and marketing investments are going and when you expect to start to see the yield out of those investments? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Yeah, no, it’s a great question. I mean, headcount is up and we talked about this year OpEx, we expect to be up as well, on a full year basis compared to last year. We do absolutely expect to remain very prominent in our OpEx spending and we absolutely expect to outpace -- revenue to outpace OpEx this year, which is why we feel confident we could expand our operating margin, and we continue to target 100 basis points improvement in operating margin. From a headcount perspective and where are we investing in general, the majority of it is go to market, the majority of it is in the enterprise space, where we believe we have an opportunity to really take advantage of the portfolio differentiation that we have, and we want to make sure that we’re thinking beyond this current quarter and next quarter and thinking for the next several years to make sure we take advantage of the opportunity that we see in the marketplace. These do take -- when you hire sales, folks, obviously, there is a learning curve and a productivity ramp and we’ve modeled a lot of it in and we feel very good that we could continue to outpace the market in enterprise like we have been and continuing to invest everything who does give us years of revenue momentum to come. 
George Notter: Got it. Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Yep. 
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Your line is live.
Amit Daryanani: Thanks a lot for taking my question. Is just full staff is always a bit of a debater on the durability of demand that you’re seeing. So, Rami, if you look at your backlog, which is north of 2 billion, I think which you said, if you just talk about the quality of this backlog and your comfort and confidence around this, I mean, I guess if I look at the trajectory of how this backlog has built up, it should imply normally you see high single digit top line growth in ‘22 but perhaps even for the years after that. So, walk me through the puts and takes around in terms of does this enable you to see high-single digit growth on a multi-year basis versus just a one year?
Rami Rahim: Yeah, so we’re not prepared to provide you know, specifics on 2023. I will say this, last year, we did 6.5% revenue growth on a full year basis, this year we’re expecting 7% to 9% growth on a full year basis and we are expecting to exit the year with significantly elevated backlog, so that does give us a lot of confidence in 2023. We’ve been outperforming the model and I think there’s really no reason to believe we won’t just continue to outperform in 2023, especially if supply chain starts to normalize because we do have the backlog built up and the opportunity to turn into revenue, I think will be with us for not just 2023, but quite honestly, a few years to come.
Amit Daryanani: If I can just kind of follow up on this, when you think about this outperformance, it’s almost like it’s accelerating over here right now for you. What do you attribute that because I don’t think that end markets are doing some degree growth that I’m guessing. From a Juniper perspective, do you think it is share gains or is it you are just able to get somewhat better suppliers than some of your peers and that’s somewhat helping you out? So I’m just curious, what do you think are the components of enabling the share grain for you right now?
Rami Rahim: Yes, it’s a good question. I do think we have done a really good job of managing what is a difficult supply situation, but I don’t think that’s the primary factor. I think the primary factor is a number of things. One is healthy demand dynamics in the market, really strong product differentiation, solution differentiation, in the use cases that we are maniacally focused on and have been focused on for the last several years, and then solid execution. I mean, take, for example, our AI driven enterprise business grew 33% year-over-year in terms of revenue, and also exceptional order growth. That’s driven by what is as a market leading, very differentiated. No longer just Wi-Fi, it’s really an enterprise architecture that’s cloud delivered AI-driven solution based on the Mist acquisition, but expanded to include EX switching and SD-WAN, it really is the best solution in the market.  I can also say the same thing about our data center now, with the combination of Apstra for automation, and our Underlay switching technology. The differentiation is solid. It addresses the key pain point for our customers and it’s working. And an even an Automated wAN, where we have these new product introductions in the MX with brand new silicon technology, so we’re essentially starting just now a new product cycle associated with the MX and PTX continuing to perform I think the strength of that solution is helping us out tremendously in winning net new opportunities in the market.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jim Suva from Citigroup. Your line is live. 
Jim Suva: Thank you. In your prepared comments, Rami, you mentioned some new wins and I think you’d mentioned the word they could be significant or material. Were those new wins after you gave your full year 2022 guidance, are they kind of new since then? And I’m just trying to get a view when you say significant, are you talking like top 10 customer? So just any clarity to help us, I guess, that calibrate the excitement and optimism around that, that’d be great. Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Yeah, so I’ll take the question. We’re very excited about the win and the opportunity, it absolutely has been meaningful to our orders strength, and it will soon be meaningful to our revenue results going forward from a size of customer perspective. That said, Jim, honestly, our revenue guide of 7% to 9% is more based on supply than anything else and our supply picture has not changed. If anything, I would say, my optimism that might get better in the second half is probably a little lessons today than it was 90 days ago. So it’s really a matter of who gets the supply, not so much if we have incremental customers and incremental demand, can we upside our revenue, because the supply is kind of fixed at what it is. But this customer has the potential to be a very meaningful customer for us, I would say, yes, a top 10 customer for us in certain quarters, depending on when products ship.
Ken Miller: And just to add, Jim, I’m excited. Cloud-ready data center grew 20% year-over-year. I don’t think that the market is growing that fast at this point in time. And I’m excited not just by this specific win but what this win, in addition to the ones prior to this one that we’ve also talked about, means for us in our ability to win even more going forward. We’re now competing with new technology that’s in the market, technology that we have been working with our teams together on for years that’s now in the market. And so we have a much better understanding of the competitive landscape, what we’re up against in terms of pure technologies. And the fact that we are able to win these new solutions in a competitive space gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to do even more going forward.
Jim Suva: Thank you so much. 
Ken Miller: You bet. 
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live. 
Meta Marshall: Great, thanks. A couple of questions for me. One, just any additional context you could give on what you’re seeing as far as supply chain constraints on maybe more of the specialized networking tips versus some of the general componentry and just if there’s any different trends there. And then the second question may be builds upon that of last quarter, you guys had had some availability kind of free up on the service provider side. And so just kind of wondering, is it some of the constraints on the service provider side just coming from the new products or just what has kind of changed from maybe categories of semiconductors that you’re waiting for? Thanks. 
Rami Rahim: Yeah, so when it comes to kind of chips versus general components, I really -- the answer is it, unfortunately, it’s a bit of a whack a mole game. I mean, it really does kind of go back and forth a bit depending on the situation, depending on the quarter. Right now, I would say we’re constrained pretty much across the board, I would say relatively equally between some of our higher end ASICs, and some of those lower end transistors, if you will. We are scouring the market and like everybody to try to procure as many parts as we can across a broad spectrum of components. It’s -- yes, we were able to ship more in Q4, but kind of a higher end rounding portfolio as compared to say, Q1 and our Q1 expectations, but that’s really just a -- it’s just a timing of shipments thing. I don’t think there’s been a material change. I mean, we’ve been -- we would have liked to ship more in Q4 than we did, right. I would still argue we were short supply in Q4. We were perhaps a little bit more short in Q1 but the shortages are persistent. And it’s just really a matter of what we can build when we could ship and that’s going to kind of fluctuate quarter to quarter.
Meta Marshall: Got it. Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Yeah.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Paul Silverstein from Cowen. Your line is live.
Paul Silverstein: Two quick questions if I may. Guys, I recognize that Mist in and of itself seems to be a significant differentiator for Juniper and your product portfolio in enterprise is far larger than when you entered enterprise, if I recall, back in 2008. But my question is, when you entered enterprise, way back when, in 2008, you had a [indiscernible] span where you took that business from ground zero, to, if I recall, about $850 million of revenue, it was phenomenally successful. The product launch was extremely exciting at the time. Again, I recognize it was just campus switching but it then proceeded to flat line when you hit 2015, 2016. My question for you is above and beyond the breadth and depth of the product portfolio today, which is very different from back when or so it seems, what’s the risk that from a channel go to market or other factors perspective because it’s never straightforward as it appears? What’s the risk that notwithstanding the significant momentum you have an enterprise today that’s similar to what happened back when that you get to replay of that scenario? And I realize the numbers would suggest that’s far off but if you could address that question. Then I’ve got a quick question about the Aurrion, Synopsys.
Ken Miller: Okay, Paul, I’m going to take a crack at that. I think the big difference today is three key things, maybe four, actually. One, the talent that we have leading the enterprise business that has unbelievable firsthand experience in what it takes to win all up from a solution, go to market, channels, you name it, really have talent with the right depth and breadth that can do it. Second, we did not just set out to solve the technology differentiation that we know is necessary to win but we set out to solve the go to market requirements that we understood based on the lessons that we had learned some painful ones in the past on what it takes to win and to win sustainably. And this, by the way, includes not just the direct selling motion, but the channel selling motion and keep in mind, again, new talent, new leadership to understand what it takes to win, and to create a fabulous channel motion to get this technology to continue to perform well in the market.  And then finally, of course, it’s the strength of the solution itself. I think the level of differentiation that we enjoy right now in the AI driven enterprise in particular, but I would also include data center with Apstra is second to none. I have not seen this magnitude of differentiation, qualified not just by internal analysis, but by our customers, by third party independent analysts ever in the history of Juniper. So I have utmost confidence that this is not a short-term thing. This is a long-term sustainable, competitive advantage and growth vertical for the company.
Paul Silverstein: Appreciate the response. And then on the Synopsys JV, those are in assets, I assume there’s a decent amount of OpEx you’ve been putting into that since you acquired Aurrion back, I think it was in ‘16 or ‘17. But can -- is there going to be a benefit to OpEx, now that I assume it will be shown as a minority interest on the income statement, you’ll get rid of whatever R&D and any sales and marketing that you put into that and if you could respond to that. And any concerns from China lockdown? 
Ken Miller: I didn’t catch the last part. Concerns on what channel, what? 
Paul Silverstein: China. China lockdowns. 
Ken Miller: Oh, China, sorry. So on the on the RNPCS [Phonetic], if you look at just our Silicon Photonics spend, it’s going to be -- it’s going to go to zero here since this transaction was closed, so year-on-year, we wouldn’t see less OpEx spent on Silicon Photonics internally, than say last year. That said this transaction was contemplated for a while. We’ve been working on it for several months now and it was factored into our plans for the year, so factored into our long-term guidance. We talked about OpEx being up year-on-year and absolute total OpEx, predominantly in go to market, as we continue to invest to take advantage of the opportunities that Rami just mentioned earlier about our enterprise motion in particular. So it is factored into the long term targets, Paul, is the short answer.  On China, we have not seen any real impact due to the more recent shutdowns, COVID-related shutdowns, obviously something we’re watching very closely. We have reduced our footprint -- manufacturing footprint in China, but we still have some dependence there, particularly on the component side, but for the most recent shutdowns, we were so far unimpacted. Who knows what’s going to happen tomorrow, but it is something we’re watching very closely. 
Paul Silverstein: Thank you. 
Rami Rahim: Thanks, Paul.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jim Fish from Piper Sandler. Your line is live.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you guys. This is [indiscernible] for Jim Fish. Thanks for taking our question. Just thinking about the security business, we’ve seen some recent deflated growth despite the strong market demand but you noted opportunity for growth kind of longer term here. Can you help us understand what you’re seeing that makes you confident that we can return to some sort of security strength? And then any color you can provide in terms of how sustainable this is? Is it a one or two quarter bump or is it something that can kind of persist through ‘22 and ‘23? Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Yeah, it’s a good question. I’m actually glad you asked. So I think first, it’s important to understand that the way we look at our security business, primarily is that it’s an attach business, to our strategic solutions, in particular, our AI driven enterprise, and our cloud ready data center solutions. And it’s already absolutely helping and contributing to the success and growth of those particular businesses. Also, security has a strong software attached, that’s good for gross margins, it’s a profitable business, there is an element of our security business, that’s high end, that sells to a relatively fewer number of cloud and SP accounts and that just tends to be cyclical. It really depends on the purchasing and deployment patterns of these large accounts that tend to buy sort of in bulk orders every now and then that makes the security business just somewhat lumpy. So based on the fact that we continue to see strength in our solutions that competitive -- the attach of security, I think, bodes well for us in the future and why I remain confident about this business.
Unidentified Analyst: Makes sense. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes our Q&A session. I will now hand the conference back to CEO Rami Rahim for closing remarks. Please go ahead.
Rami Rahim: Thanks very much. I just want to say that I continue to be very encouraged by the strong momentum we’re seeing in our business. I believe that our end markets are performing well. They’re healthy. I think they’re even recovering in areas that were in fact affected by the pandemic. I love the diversity of the strength that we’re seeing across solution areas, across vertical market segments. And I believe that the demand strength we’re seeing as well as the execution sets us up well to do very well relative to our long-term outlook that we’ve already provided. So I want to thank everyone for the opportunity and the time today.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today’s event. You may disconnect at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for participation.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-01-27 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Juniper Networks Q4 2021 FY 2021 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode. And we'll open the floor for your questions and comments after the presentation. It’s now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Jess Lubert. Sir, the floor is yours.
Jess Lubert: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2021 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results might differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release and CFO commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and Juniper undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the Company's financial results is included in today's press release. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to 1 question so that as many people as possible who would like to ask a question have a chance. With that, I will now turn the call over to Rami.
Rami Rahim: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss our Q4 and full year 2021 results. I hope you and your families are well, and my thoughts go out to all those who continue to be affected by the global pandemic. We delivered strong results during the fourth quarter, with revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share both exceeding the midpoint of our guidance, despite continued challenges from a supply chain perspective. Demand remained strong and exceeded our expectations with orders seeing high teens year-over-year growth when adjusted to account for extended lead times. On an unadjusted basis, orders grew by more than 50% year-over-year for a third consecutive quarter, and our ending backlog increased to a record level of more than $1.8 billion. Order momentum was strong across all verticals, all customer solutions and all geographies with each of these categories experiencing strong double-digit order growth year-over-year. Our Q4 results capped a very strong 2021, which saw us grow our Enterprise business for a fifth consecutive year, grow our Cloud business for a third consecutive year and return our Service Provider business to growth. Not to be overlooked, we also expanded our non-GAAP operating margin year-over-year, despite absorbing material increases in both supply chain and acquisition-related costs. Our teams are executing extremely well, and we are entering the new year with strong momentum. This momentum is being driven by our strategic actions, and there are four pillars that give me confidence as we look forward to 2022. First, our commitment to experience first networking and delivering technologies that simplify customer operations and improve the end user experience. While our experienced first journey started with Mist and then 128 Technology in our AI-Driven Enterprise portfolio, we subsequently extended this vision to the data center with the Apstra acquisition and the service provider market with our Paragon Automation suite. These software-centric solutions give us important strategic control point that not only create new recurring revenue opportunities, but also differentiate and pull through other Juniper products, creating a multiplier effect that will benefit growth in the years to come. Our experience-first vision is a key point of differentiation for our product that we believe is resonating across customers and providing confidence in our future prospects. Second, we are highly focused and aligned to three major use cases, Automated WAN, AI-Driven Enterprise and Cloud-Ready Data Center solutions, and we are enabling security to be seamlessly embedded within all of them. Each of these use cases is likely to see attractive market tailwinds over the next several years, focusing our company from a product management to engineering to go-to-market on a handful of meaningful and growing opportunities, enabled us to accelerate our growth in 2021. This focus also enables us to continue to deliver the technical differentiation and new innovations to capitalize on the big market inflection that we see unfolding in 2022 and beyond. Third, our go-to-market transformation is yielding meaningful results. This started with a change in sales leadership back in early 2019, which was followed by a meaningful increase in quota-carrying sales reps during 2020 and incremental sales development and enablement capabilities in 2021. We have also made meaningful investments in our channel, increasing the total number of Juniper channel partners by more than 30% since 2019. This investment not only resulted in record channel sales this past quarter, but also more than 100% increase in year-over-year deal registration, which reflects robust demand generated solely by channel. These investments in our sales and channel organizations have enabled us to accelerate our growth and should position us to do so again in the upcoming year. To be clear, we view our go-to-market organization as a competitive advantage where we will continue to invest to capture share. Finally, we continue to transition our business to a more software-centric model. This includes transforming more of our perpetual offerings to term-based licenses, introducing more ratable subscription offerings and training our sales organization to better monetize the value of our software stack. While these efforts remain in the early innings, we experienced encouraging momentum in the Q4 time frame, which saw total software and related services revenue grow 41% year-over-year and orders increased by more than 100% year-over-year. Our annualized recurring revenue, which solely consists of truly ratable software subscriptions and related services increased 32% year-over-year due to strong demand for Mist and certain security subscriptions. We are encouraged by the progress we're making in our efforts to capture more software revenue, which we view as critical to not only accelerating growth, but also improving customer stickiness and margin. Our strategy is well- aligned against a backdrop of healthy end markets that should position us for growth over the next few years. This growth is being driven by the strategic importance of the network, which is only likely to increase in the coming years as enterprise, digital transformation and clarification initiatives accelerate Cloud and Service Provider 400-gig upgrade, build momentum and Service Provider 5G investments expand beyond the radio access layer to the Metro, Edge and Core portions of the network. While I'm encouraged by the market dynamics we're seeing, I strongly believe the products we are delivering, the customer engagement we've developed and the investments we've made in our go-to-market organization will position us to gain share and deliver sustainable growth in the years to come, regardless of end market conditions. As you can tell, I am very optimistic regarding our future projects, despite the supply chain challenges we're continuing to navigate. I believe these challenges are likely to prove transitory, and the strong order momentum we're seeing and the backlog we have developed sets us up extremely well to deliver solid growth and improved profitability in 2022 and beyond. Based on our recent order momentum, current backlog levels and our assumptions regarding supply, we currently expect to deliver 7% to 9% sales growth and at least a point of operating margin expansion in 2022. Our expectations for 2022 assume current supply chain challenges persist and that we are unable to work down backlog during the year, potentially creating longer-term tailwinds for our business once the supply chain improves and backlog returns to more normal levels. While we would expect gross orders to decline in 2022 as lead times stabilize and we start seeing fewer early orders, we expect adjusted orders to grow for the year. Now, I'd like to provide some additional insights into the quarter and address some of the key developments we're seeing from a customer solutions perspective. Starting with our Automated WAN Solutions, which saw strong momentum from both a revenue and order perspective, particularly with our Cloud and Service Provider customers. We saw healthy demand across both our MX and PTX product families and strong adoption of our newer products, as well as our Paragon Automation portfolio. Our 400-gig solutions are performing well, and we now have more than 200 wide area wins that should present building tailwinds from a revenue perspective in the years to come. We are continuing to invest in our Automated WAN portfolio, and just recently announced next-gen custom silicon families for our MX and PTX platform that will offer industry-leading throughput, power efficiency and logical scale, all while maintaining investment protection. We are also continuing to invest in our ACX Metro portfolio, where we continue to see strong early interest that should further build as we complete the portfolio later this year. These investments are resonating with our Service Provider and Cloud customers, who appreciate that no single silicon family is optimized for all use cases and prefer to purchase systems with silicon that is purpose built for the job at hand. We are playing to win across all areas of automated LAN solutions and making the investments needed to capitalize on our customers' Core, Edge and Metro requirements that we believe present opportunities for growth over the next several years. Our AI-Driven Enterprise revenue significantly outpaced the market, growing 29% year-over-year in Q4 and 27% on a full year basis. It has been especially exciting to see our Mist solution go from a cool technology to a leader in the 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for wired and wireless access, with top scores in both vision and ability to execute, buoyed by several unique architectural differences, including leading AIOps and a modern microservices cloud, we continue to see record numbers in our wired and wireless access business. For example, our wireless revenue more than doubled year-over-year in Q4, and the winning continues as we recently closed a multimillion dollar win with a major multinational bank based on simplified operations via AIOps and location services that leverage our patented virtual BLE technology. We're also seeing strong Mist pull-through of our EX switching portfolio, which experienced record orders and units sold in the fourth quarter. Our Mistified revenue of wireless LAN, wired access, Marvis Virtual Network Assistant and associated EX pull-through more than doubled in Q4 as compared to last year and our annualized order run rate surpassed $600 million in the quarter. On a full-year basis, our Mistified revenue was approximately $300 million in 2021 and nearly doubled year-over-year. Our AI-driven SD-WAN solution, which combines the unique Session Smart Routing technology acquired by 128 Technology, with the automation and inside of Mist AI is following in the same footsteps. We saw triple-digit year-over-year revenue and order growth in Q4, with key wins in various sectors like retail and banking and strong traction within the federal government. One new customer deployed 300 sites the week before Christmas, highlighting the ease and scale of the Juniper SD-WAN solution driven by Mist AI. With new product enhancements announced this month, including day 0 and 1 operation via the Mist Cloud, new SSR hardware platform and bundled security capabilities, we expect demand to further build in future quarters. Of special note are the full stack, multimillion dollar opportunities we continue to win and deploy where companies are turning to Juniper for a combination of their wired access, wireless access and WAN Edge needs. Based on our recent order momentum, third-party validation and the technical superiority of our AI-Driven Enterprise portfolio, I remain highly confident regarding the outlook for our AI-Driven Enterprise business during the upcoming year. While our Cloud-Ready Data Center revenue declined in Q4 due solely to the timing of shipments related to supply chain challenges, we experienced another quarter of encouraging order trend, driven by broad-based strength across verticals and geographies. We continue to see strong momentum with new logos, and we secured a record number of deals greater than $1 million. 400-gig momentum remains strong. We now have more than 60 400-gig data center wins that include cloud majors, large enterprise and service provider accounts. Key to our continued growth in the data center is Apstra, the industry's leading intent-based networking solution that provides users with a superior experience versus our competitors across day 0, day 1 and day 2 operation. Apstra remains the only open-fabric management platform on the market, which is not only creating software-only management opportunities, but also driving full stack data center win. We're investing in sales enablement and the tools needed to accelerate our Apstra-driven success during the upcoming year. Customer interest in our Cloud-Ready Data Center portfolio is high, and we continue to be optimistic about the growth prospects for this business in the upcoming year. Our security revenue was essentially flat in Q4, but orders saw double-digit year-over-year growth. We remain confident in our connected security strategy, and believe the convergence of networking and security provides us with a competitive advantage in the portions of the market where we are currently focused. We believe our technical strength in both security and networking will continue to provide tailwinds in future quarters and should enable us to grow our security business during the current year. I'd like to mention that our services team delivered another impressive quarter, and our services business continues to grow year-over-year due to record renewals and strong attach rate. Our customer satisfaction scores once again set new all-time highs, and our service margins came in better than expected due to higher revenue and lower costs. On a full year basis, our service margins achieved a new all-time record of 65.8%, up 170 basis points as compared to the prior year. Our services organization continues to execute extremely well and is focused on driving incremental efficiencies through automation and cloud-delivered insights to not only create new revenue opportunities, but also benefit margin and customer experience. Before I conclude, I’d like to state that our mission at Juniper is to power connections and empower change. Now, more than ever, we are committed to ensuring networking is a force for good in this world, that includes building global resilience to combat climate risk throughout our business and supply chain and enabling solutions for a low-carbon future. We continue to make, monitor and report our environmental, social and governance progress through our annual corporate social responsibility report and CDP responses.

I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail.
Ken Miller: Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start by discussing our fourth quarter results and then cover the fiscal year 2021 and end with some color on our outlook. We ended the fourth quarter of 2021 at $1,300 million of revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.56, both above the midpoint of guidance. Revenue grew 6% year-over-year and 9%, sequentially, exceeding our expectations despite the challenging supply chain environment. These strong results were driven by solid execution by our global team. During the fourth quarter, we continued to see significant order growth across all verticals, geographies and customer solutions. Gross orders saw a third consecutive quarter of greater than 50% year-over-year growth. Some of this order strength was attributable to ongoing industry supply chain challenges, causing certain customers to place orders early in an effort to secure supply when needed. Even after adjusting for these early orders, total part orders are estimated to have grown in the high teens year-over-year. Due to the strength in orders and the continued constraints related to component supply, we ended the year with record backlog of more than $1.8 billion. Looking at our revenue by vertical. On a year-over-year basis, Cloud grew 19%, Service Provider grew 8% and Enterprise decreased 3%. While Enterprise revenue declined year-over-year due to the timing of shipments, Enterprise orders posted strong double-digit year-over-year growth and exceeded our expectations. Turning to customer solutions. On a year-over-year basis, AI-Driven Enterprise grew 29%, Automated WAN Solutions grew 8% and Cloud-Ready Data Center revenue declined 9%. This decline was entirely due to timing of shipments as Cloud-Ready Data Center orders experienced strong double-digit order growth year-over-year. Total software and related services revenue was $242 million, an increase of 41% versus the fourth quarter of last year. Annual recurring revenue, or ARR, grew 32% year-over-year, and we exited the year with $206 million in ARR. This strength reflects our efforts to transform to a more software-centric business. Total Security revenue was $162 million, flat year-over-year due to the timing of shipments, but product orders posted strong growth year-over-year. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, four were Cloud, five were Service Provider and one was an Enterprise. Our top 10 customers accounted for 33% of total revenue as compared to 30% in the fourth quarter last year. Non-GAAP gross margin was 59.5% in the fourth quarter, which was above our guidance midpoint, primarily driven by a favorable product and software mix. If not for elevated COVID-19-related costs, we anticipate that we would have posted non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 61.7%. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 8% year-over-year and 4%, sequentially. The higher-than-anticipated costs were due to a onetime $5 million expense related to the postponement of our sales kickoff event as a result of the recent surge of COVID-19 cases. We exited the quarter with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $1.7 billion. Cash flow from operations was $116 million for the quarter. We paid $64 million in dividends, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share. We also repurchased $148 million worth of shares in the quarter. Moving on to full year results. Total revenue for 2021 was $4,735 million, which was up 7% versus 2020. Despite the pandemic and supply chain constraints, we saw growth across all of our verticals, customer solutions and geographies. Our Cloud business grew 14%, while Service Provider and Enterprise both grew 4% compared to last year. From a customer solution perspective, AI-Driven Enterprise increased 27%, Cloud-Ready Data Center grew 7% and Automated WAN Solutions grew 3% on a full year basis. The top line strength we experienced across verticals and customer solutions is driven by the technology investments we have made, as well as our focus on transforming our go-to-market organization. Total software and related services revenue was $761 million, an increase of 42% year-over-year, exceeding our expectations. Total Security revenue was $657 million, which grew 8% year-over-year. Security Product revenue was up 14% year-over-year. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the year, 5 were Cloud, 4 were Service Provider and 1 was an Enterprise. Our top 10 customers accounted for 31% of our total 2021 revenue as compared to 30% in 2020. Non-GAAP gross margin expanded by 50 basis points versus last year, primarily driven by service gross margin expansion. If not for elevated COVID-19-related supply costs, we estimate we would have posted non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 61% in 2021. 2021 operating expenses increased 7% on a non-GAAP basis, primarily due to higher variable compensation and the costs associated with the acquisitions of Netrounds, 128 Technology and Apstra. Despite these increased costs, operating margin increased to 15.9%, an improvement of 40 basis points versus last year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.74, an increase of 12% compared to 2020. For the year, we had cash flow from operations of $690 million, an increase of $78 million compared to 2020. We repurchased $433 million worth of shares and paid $259 million in dividends for a total capital return of 117% of free cash flow to shareholders during 2021. I'm very pleased with our financial performance, both in the fourth quarter and 2021. The performance is a testament to our team's dedication and resiliency through these challenging and dynamic times. Now, I would like to provide some color on our guidance, which you could find detailed in the CFO commentary available on our Investor Relations website. We expect first quarter revenue of $1,150 million, plus or minus $50 million, which is growth of 7% year-over-year. We are still experiencing significant supply chain-related headwinds associated with rising component and elevated freight costs, which are expected to continue at least through the first half of the year. While we have taken pricing actions to offset these headwinds, we do not expect these actions to have an impact until later in the year. Therefore, we expect first quarter non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 58%, plus or minus 1%, a sequential decrease. Our non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be approximately $0.31, plus or minus $0.05, assuming a share count of approximately 332 million. Turning to our expectations for the full year of 2022. Given the strong order momentum we are experiencing and our exiting backlog, we are updating our revenue growth expectations for 2022 from at least mid-single-digits to 7% to 9% growth. This guidance assumes the current supply chain environment remains constrained throughout the year, similar to current levels and does not further deteriorate. Beyond the first quarter, we expect revenue to grow sequentially throughout the course of the year. We expect supply chain constraints to be particularly tight during the first half and remain challenged throughout the remainder of the year. We also anticipate backlog to remain at elevated levels and largely unchanged throughout the year. While non-GAAP gross margin can be difficult to predict, we expect full year gross margin of 58% to 60%, which is a slight decline from 2021 levels. We expect gross margin for the first half of the year to be at the lower end of the range due to the elevated cost of components and logistics. I'd like to mention that we see potential for non-GAAP gross margins to trend to the high end of the range in the second half of the year as volume increases and the pricing actions we have taken flow through to the results. We remain committed to disciplined expense management and full year non-GAAP operating margin is expected to expand by at least 100 basis points versus 2021. That said, we will continue to invest to take advantage of market opportunities, and non-GAAP operating expense is expected to be up on a full year basis, consistent with the guidance we provided during our third quarter 2021 earnings announcement. Our non-GAAP tax rate on worldwide earnings is expected to be 20%, plus or minus 1%. And our non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow faster than revenue on a full year basis. Finally, I'm pleased to announce we have declared a 5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.21 per share to be paid this quarter to stockholders of record. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success, especially in this challenging environment. Now, I'd like to open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question is coming from Tim Long from Barclays.
Tim Long: Thank you. I did want to follow up on the orders here. Rami, if you could just talk a little bit about still over 50%, but a little down from the prior quarter. So, can you talked a little bit about what you're hearing from customers? Are they not buying out as -- ordering out as far as they were previously? And how do you see -- do you see new orders to be volatile and correct? But how do you see kind of shipments for a lot of some of these larger companies as you go forward? And then second, for the follow-up, just touch on the Service Provider business, which seems to have turned around pretty nicely this year. It seems like most are expecting a pretty solid in the next few years there as well. So, can you just touch on your outlook there and particularly as you push more into the Metro Edge? Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Yes, certainly. Thanks for the questions, Tim. So, I'll start with the first one around order momentum. And I'll just say that orders have been strong for the last year, the last three quarters over 50% year-over-year growth in orders. And they remain strong now. Our order momentum, what we're seeing in the market, the opportunity out there is very solid, very encouraging and it's true across all of our key strategic vertical market segments, Cloud, SP and Enterprise. So, I'd love to be able to say that we're going to continue to see over 50% year-over-year growth on a continuous basis forever. I mean, that's unrealistic. We have been clear that there is a certain amount of early ordering that happened over the last year. And that will eventually -- we don't know exactly when, but will eventually start to gradually decline. But that said, on an adjusted basis, our organic order, the true reflection of the health of the business will grow this year, and that's because of the strong demand environment, in addition I think to the great differentiation that we enjoy in our solutions. On the SP side of the house, I'm very pleased with the performance that we're seeing in our business. Orders grew well into double-digit territory in the Q4 time frame. Revenue grew 8% year-over-year. Orders for a full year basis was also very solid. We're exiting 2021 with record backlog in this area as well. The strength has to do with the broad-based nature of our go-to-market focus. So, it's not just Tier 1 carriers here in North America where we are actually seeing some encouraging momentum, but also Tier 2, Tier 3, cable and international accounts. 400-gig, which we've talked about a lot as an opportunity, it doesn't only apply to the cloud provider space. There are some significant opportunities out in the Service Provider space, especially in the core segment, and we are winning good amounts of those opportunities right now. And I think that will bode well for us in terms of tailwinds for revenue in the future. And last but not least, you touched on Metro. If you think about the part of the network that will benefit the most from 5G RAN deployments that are happening today, it will be the Metro, which is why we've made a strategic decision to invest in this space. And we don't yet have the complete portfolio, but we have certainly seen encouraging signs that we're on to something and something significant. And just as a data point, I'd tell you that our Metro-focused aggregation switch, which is the ACX family of products, now hit, for the first time, $100 million in bookings run rate in Q4. And that's solution, which I anticipate we will have by the end of this year. So that's a very encouraging data point that suggests that we should see some good tailwinds from the Metro opportunity later this year and especially next year.
Operator: The next question is coming from George Notter from Jefferies.
George Notter: I guess, I wanted to ask about your pricing increases. I heard what you said in terms of the timing of those coming in later in the year. But can you just talk about customer receptivity? I would imagine that some of your Enterprise customers are a bit easier in terms of taking pricing, but maybe more of a negotiation on Service Provider and Cloud. Can you just kind of walk through like what you're seeing there?
Ken Miller: Yes. Thanks, George. I think, I mean, you’re -- what you're imagining is largely playing out. I mean, we did do the pricing increases last year that we referred to. I would say customers aren't happy about price increases. I think that's an obvious statement. But they are understanding, right? And for the vast majority of the cases, we are able to implement the pricing actions as we expected to. So feel good about what we've done, feel good about the market reception overall. And it should pay off for us as that starts to go through the top line, which we anticipate more of that rolling in the second half of this year.
George Notter: Got it. And then, the Service Provider and Cloud Provider pricing negotiations, so I guess, to underline this, they are taking higher pricing from you guys. Is that fair?
Ken Miller: Yes, it is fair. I mean, we are doing it deal by deal and sometimes customer-by-customer situations, but we are seeing acceptance across the board.
George Notter: And then anything you can tell us about -- if I remember correctly, you guys raised pricing initially back in Q2 of last year or maybe towards the tail end of Q2 last year. Should those pricing increases be benefiting you earlier this year?
Ken Miller: Yes. So, we did an action in the first half of last year around June. There was a partial action, if you will. It didn't impact all of our products. The action we took in Q4 was more expansive and impacted all of our hardware products. So, we did take two actions. We are seeing some of the realization from the first action, but the second action was, I think, would be more impactful for us.
Operator: The next question is coming from Simon Leopold from Raymond James.
Simon Leopold: I want to see if maybe you could unpack the cloud vertical a little bit more in terms of maybe some color on the behaviors of what you guys have termed the cloud majors as opposed to the hyperscalers. Just give us some sense of what the contributions are like and if there are differences in their trends. And just as an easy follow-up, within the forecast of 7% to 9% sales growth, how much of that are you assuming is coming from the price increases?
Rami Rahim: Thanks for the question, Simon. Let me start on the question around the cloud, and then I'll hand it over to Ken to talk about the contribution of price increases to our revenue growth this year. So, I'm delighted with the momentum we continue to see in our cloud vertical. I think the thing that I like the most about what we're seeing in this area is the diversity of the success that we're seeing, not just within the hyperscalers and the cloud majors or between those two, within each of those categories. So in hyperscalers, we traditionally, as you all know, had a very large customer that generated a lot of the growth over the last several years. It's now really much more distributed across a number of significant hyperscale accounts. And I think that speaks to the strength of our footprint, the strength of our technology and the engagements, the solid engagement that we have with the hyperscale accounts. We have, in addition to hyperscale, been very much focused on broadening within the Tier 2 cloud provider space or what we call the cloud major space, and we've made really great progress. The good news is, much of the technology that we develop for hyperscale applies very much to cloud majors, including a lot of the 400-gig wide area networking and data center investments. But in addition to that, our automation portfolio, so the Apstra technology that makes the act of developing or deploying and running a data center very simple now actually has strong applicability to our cloud majors segment. So, it really is strength across the board, and I'm delighted to see the momentum that we have here.
Ken Miller: Yes. And on the pricing action, we have considered that when we provided the guidance of 7% to 9% growth this year. And we haven't quantified exactly how much it is. But just to let you know, the majority -- the reason why we did the pricing action was really to offset as much of the price increases as we can. So, it's really more about protecting margin and trying to offset some of those margin headwinds. It will result in some revenue growth, obviously, and is factored into the overall guide.
Operator: The next question is coming from Tal Liani from BoA.
Tal Liani: I have just one quick follow-up question before I ask my other question. The F5, when they reported, they said that there was a further deterioration in the last 30 days of the quarter when it comes to getting specialized networking gear like FPGAs and CPUs and others. Do you see the same deterioration in the ability to source supplies components, or do you see same environment today as it was before?
Ken Miller: Yes. We haven't seen anything notable in the last 30 days. I would say we've seen pretty constant supply constraints for the last few quarters, right? So we have seen, I'm not going to say it's a good environment. It still remains constrained, but we haven't seen anything noticeable in the last 30 days. We expect lead times to remain extended we expect the cost obviously is definitely going out on the cost of components, et cetera. The one thing I would point out, although we comment that it's going to be remain contained for the year, particularly in the first half, we do believe we have line of sight to absolute volume increases year-over-year, right? I mean, we're guiding to a full year growth of 7% to 9% revenue growth. So, at this point in time, even with the constrained environment, and we're not getting as much supplies as we would like to get, we do believe we're getting enough to satisfy that revenue outlook.
Tal Liani: Got it. I want to ask you about market share, specifically in routing. So, the environment is getting better. You spoke about new products in certain areas. Can you talk about, maybe break it down, your expectations, areas where you expect to gain share in routing and areas where you don't expect market share like unique market rate dynamics. And I'm referring to end markets, like Cloud, Enterprise, Service Providers, Cloud, et cetera.
Rami Rahim: Right. I want to make sure I understand the question. Are you referring to the Service Provider segment specifically and then sort of different layers or opportunities within the Service Provider space? Are you really talking about Service Provider, Cloud and Enterprise as three separate segments?
Tal Liani: We can take it anywhere. I'm trying to take the routing market after being down -- sort of flat to down for so many years, and I understand there's going to be a cycle now. I'm trying to break it down. And I'm trying to understand what are the areas -- and you can take it anywhere you want. What are the areas where you expect growth and expect share gains, and what are the areas where you believe that the market dynamics will remain kind of the same as before?
Rami Rahim: Got it. Got it. Okay. And specifically to routing. So, in routing, whenever you're talking about routing, you should really be focusing on two market opportunities in particular, and that's Cloud and SP. There is obviously also routing that goes into the Enterprise space, but I think our key focus is on Cloud and SP. The big inflection point that's happening right now in both of these segments is around 400-gig. And that is an opportunity for us to take share in that area. But in addition to that, specific to the SP is the Metro opportunity. So, let's talk about 400-gig. I want to be very clear. I am very confident, based on order momentum, right? Not yet seen in revenue because it's still early days in terms of shipping and deployments and building out these networks, but in terms of actual order momentum, where we've seen well over 50% growth for the last three quarters, we're taking share. I am very confident we're taking share. And now add to that in the SP space, the Metro, where there is no way but up for us because it's essentially a brand-new market opportunity for us. It's the fastest-growing subsegment of the routing opportunity within the SP space because that's where most of the 5G traffic needs to flow through. That is another area where I'm very confident we will take share, especially as that portfolio comes together throughout this year.
Operator: The next question is coming from Paul Silverstein from Cowen.
Paul Silverstein: Yes. To begin with, I've got a broader question with respect to share gain versus market growth. And I appreciate it's hard to delineate, if not impossible. But the strength you've been referencing across every aspect of your business, Rami, Ken, how much of that do you attribute to a confluence of very strong trends with networking in virtually all of your customer markets, albeit of a different nature? And how much of that is the fact that in a number of cases, such as with Mist for wireless LAN, as well as the pull-through impact on other products? How much of it is a function of share gain? Any insight you can offer there before I have my follow-up?
Rami Rahim: So Paul, I think you touched on the one area, the AI-Driven Enterprise and Mist within that area, where I believe our competitive differentiation has never in the history of this company been this strong. And the order growth rates have been phenomenal. Even in revenue for the Q4 time frame, we posted strong revenue results. And for the full year, we've shown strong revenue results, even in the face of very difficult supply chain challenges that we have had to overcome. There is a couple of key reasons for this. One is the strength of the technology, and we're sitting on some true underlying architectural differences in how we have built these solutions using a scale-out cloud native architecture that can scale to the largest enterprises in the world, exceptional leadership and really solid sales execution because we've invested in our sales, in our channel and our enablement team. So, again, very confident that we are taking share. And I honestly think that that share taking can accelerate as more of those orders that we posted translate to actual revenue and we start to draw down the huge backlog that we built.
Paul Silverstein: Rami, on the enterprise piece, given your comments, risk of different details, but similar in terms of the strength they're seeing and then Cisco being the largest -- obviously, largest incumbent, they are not -- they have been very bullish about their business as well. As I parse on this as we look out longer term beyond 2022, well beyond 2022, there's a lot of what's going on in enterprise from a market standpoint. Does this go back to when there was an incredibly pregnant pause that lasted for years, as many enterprises were not sure, were evaluating what to do with respect to cloud. How many applications to keep on-prem? How much to move to public clouds, et cetera? And that cause a really pregnant pause in the enterprise decision-making with respect to network architecture, network deployment decisions. Are we now seeing the -- is the industry seeing -- or are you and peers seeing the reverberation that that pause is passed and now there's this multiyear investment cycle as enterprise catch up above and beyond the share gains that you've been referencing?
Rami Rahim: Yes. It's a great question. First, I'll say -- I'll sort of break it up into two time lines. Over the last couple of years, there were certainly segments or elements of the Enterprise that were actually affected. They experienced headwinds as a result of COVID. But we did a really nice job of pivoting to subsegments that, not only were not affected, but in some cases, had to invest more. So take big box retailers, college campuses, public sector. I think those subsegments experienced an increase in the need to look at networking more strategically, and we captured that opportunity with really differentiated solutions. Now, let's look forward. And as things start to normalize, albeit, of course, very gradually, I don't think that enterprises and CIOs and CTOs of those enterprises are going to be rushing towards the legacy on-prem complexity of the past. They are looking for cloud-delivered, AI-driven solutions for the enterprise. They are also looking for simple data center operations. And I think, honestly, we are best equipped to capture those inflection points. So, yes, I view that the tailwinds in the Enterprise will only increase going forward relative to what we've experienced in the last couple of years. I'm talking about the market tailwinds here.
Operator: The next question is coming from James Fish from Piper Sandler.
James Fish: Look, great quarter. I'm not going to try to pick on something, but the one part we could is data center and security a little bit with security being roughly a quarter of that data center product business. The security space hasn't been this strong in terms of the spending environment since arguably 2015. And I get orders are growing very nicely. But why is this business as well as the switching side within that data center business really not growing faster? Is it just prioritizing the other segments given higher cloud and service provider mix? And is there any way to break out what you would have grown in these segments this quarter, excluding the supply chain issues versus do we have a demand issue for Juniper security specifically?
Rami Rahim: Okay. So, I think the question, if I understood, James, is both about around data center switching and sort of more broadly security. And let me first address the easier part of your question, which is the second part. Everything would have grown if it weren't for supply chain constraints. Literally everything. Because we are currently supply chain constraint in terms of what we're able to ship and, of course, that ties to our revenue. Our data center switching business is performing very well. Throughout all of last year, we have grown orders well into double-digit territory. Our revenue grew for the full year last year as well. Our revenue declined in the Cloud-Ready Data Center in Q4, purely because of the timing of orders relative to the availability of specific parts in this somewhat crazy world we live in from a supply chain standpoint. So honestly, I don't -- I'm not concerned at all about demand or about the solutions that we have available to capture those demands and to compete with our peers in the industry. On the security side, there again, I think look at our security from two standpoints. There's sort of a more mainstream, broad-based security that attaches to our enterprise offerings. That actually grew very nicely. There is also a larger high-performance security segment, which is really characterized with these very large high-performance products, our high-end SRX product line that are just lumpy. They're going to vary from quarter-to-quarter. And you're going to -- you saw some of that in the Q4 time frame. But again, the true reflection, I think, of the health of our security business is in product orders, and that grew well into double-digit territory.
Ken Miller: Yes. The only thing I would add on the security front is if you take the full year view in our product business, security business grew 14%. So, you are seeing this kind of an anomaly in any given 90-day period with the Q4 results. We're pretty pleased with the overall security performance throughout the course of the year.
Operator: The next question is coming from Alex Henderson from Needham.
Alex Henderson: First off, I want to compliment you on the way you've handled the duration question versus new gross orders. It's a lot clearer than most other companies are handling it. And it's obviously very nice to see that acceleration from roughly 15% adjusted growth to high teens. What I -- my question though is on the increase in the guidance for the full year. Given you have already baked in the price hikes that you did last year, there's nothing changed on that front. And given the commentary around the supply chain hasn't changed at all, so you've been -- very nice order growth, but you're still supply constrained. So, I guess, the question is what allows you to take your growth rate and revenues up from mid-singles to 7% to 9% if there's no improvement in availability? Is it a function of software, having much higher growth and a shift towards software growth being higher? Is it a function of a mix shift within what you're expecting? Is it a function of redesign? What allowed you to take the revenues up by a couple, 2%, 3% with no change in outlook for supply chain improvements?
Ken Miller: Yes. No, thanks for the question. So, our 2022 revenue guide of 7% to 9% is absolutely constrained by supply. If we could access more supply, the guidance would likely be much higher, given the demand strength that we've seen, given the backlog that we’ve built out. So, it is a supply-constrained forecast, if you will. Now, what we said -- nothing's changed and that we still believe the supply chain is going to remain challenged. That said, our confidence in our line of sight to procuring the supply that we need for the year has changed a bit, right? So we were talking about at least mid-single digits. We just had a little more volatility in our assumptions 90 days ago. Now that we're 90 days forward, we feel better about saying 7% to 9%. So, we did raise it from at least mid-single to 7% to 9% basically on our confidence level and our ability to procure supply we need to deliver that revenue goal.
Operator: The next question is coming from Sami Badri from Credit Suisse.
Sami Badri: Thank you. First, I just wanted to double-click on something you said earlier, Rami, and you've alluded to this twice on this conference call, which is the Metro opportunity and solution set. Can you just expand on all of this? Like, what is required? What are telcos, cables, other SPs, what are they going to need for this? What are you guys specifically looking to add to portfolio and just so we can better understand why this isn't actually in position yet and where it's really going? So that's the first piece. The second piece is on Apstra. And maybe you could just tell us -- I think you mentioned earlier that some of your cloud customers are actually using this. But maybe you could expand if this could actually be much more all encompassing for all your customers to potentially use. Could you just kind of help us understand these two things?
Rami Rahim: Absolutely. Thanks for the really good questions, Sami. So, on the Metro opportunity, and the question specifically is what do we need? So, we have great routing technology. We have a fantastic routing stack, our Junos and Junos Evolved operating systems, are all really critical ingredients. What we need are price and form factor optimized systems to capture the end-to-end Metro opportunity because in metro, you're putting or deploying platforms and sort of the outer reaches of the Internet closer and closer to residential customers and business customers and so on. So you can think about it from a technology development standpoint, it's relatively low-hanging fruit. We have a lot of the most complex pieces. We just have to optimize it in terms of power form factor for that specific opportunity. And that's exactly what we're doing. Why didn't we do it earlier? Simply because we had priorities of investment elsewhere, and now we are making this as a bet. And we're essentially lining that bet with the emergence of the 5G opportunity. And I should also just mention that very importantly in the Metro, there is a software component, a management and day two operations components that we're becoming really good at based on the experience that we've built with Mist in the AI-Driven Enterprise, and more recently, Apstra in the data center. Okay. With -- that leads us to then the second question with Apstra. Apstra today is primarily focused. The bulk of the business and deployment that we have on the data center, not 100%. We do have some campus and other opportunities. But really, it's the data center is the primary opportunity. Apstra is the only open-management solution for the data center in the industry. It's the best from an operational experience standpoint. They wrote the book on intent-based networking, and it's the higher scale. It scales to the largest customers in the world. And that's the differentiation that's allowing us to win more and more full stack data center opportunities or just pure software opportunities. Eventually, we might look at expanding the reach of Apstra beyond the data center. But right now, quite frankly, I'm much more focused on the data center opportunity. We've got formidable competitors in this space and we want to make sure that we continue to deliver the best possible solutions for our customers.
Operator: The next question is coming from Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Max Sanfer [ph] on for Rod. Thank for taking my question. I had a question -- more specific question on the supply constraints, and we're wondering how tight to higher-speed MX router lines supply currently is? And is it worse or better than the previous quarter? And maybe you can even comment which of the -- chips are in shorter supply.
Ken Miller: Yes. So supply constraints are really across the board, and you are seeing ebbs and flows as we solve a particular problem, maybe another problem pops up. As it relates to MX specifically, you could see from the revenue results anyway, Q3 was actually down overall in kind of our SP business and Q4 was up. So we did ship more in Q4 than we did in, say, Q3. But that's going to vary quarter-to-quarter based on timing of orders, but more importantly, timing of supply. So I don't feel there's a unique supply constraint or situation with our MX line cards. It really is kind of across the board, across all of our products and solutions.
Operator: The next question coming from Samik Chatterjee from JP Morgan.
Samik Chatterjee: I just had a question on the operating margin expansion. Does -- some of the companies that we talked to indicated that there's rising compensation costs for '22 to retain employees. Is that baked into your guidance for the at least 100 basis points of expansion?
Ken Miller: Yes. So, we have factored in our total operating cost expectations for 2022, not only for investment purposes, but also retaining employees. So yes, that is factored into our fall plans, including our expansion plans to expand operating margin.
Operator: The next question is coming from Amit Daryanani from Evercore.
Michael Fisher: This is Michael Fisher on for Amit. Thanks for taking my question. I was curious that you mentioned gross margins would have been 61.7%, I think, without COVID-related cost, so about 220 basis-point delta versus what you reported. I'm wondering, is there any way to kind of break down that 220 basis points between input cost inflation versus other factors like freight or anything else that's having an impact?
Ken Miller: Yes. So, I'll tell you that both, freight is a big chunk of it, as well as just component costs and expedite fees. So I would categorize component costs and expedite fees is kind of the same bucket. If you look at that as a combined group versus freight, both are effectively equally impactful to that number.
Operator: The next question is coming from Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley.
Erik Lapinski: This is Erik on for Meta. I guess, just when we look at the strength in Automated WAN, if we can go back to that, was any of that driven by new web-scale customer projects you've noted, or is that mostly from existing customers? And I guess, if a new customer, would there be any project-based volatility that we should be mindful of?
Rami Rahim: Yes. It's actually a great question. I think a lot of the strength and the momentum that we've seen over the last year has actually been more driven by existing footprint, existing deployments that we have within both our service provider and our cloud customers. But having said that, we have been competing for and winning new 400-gig opportunities in both segments. And we alluded, I think, starting a couple of quarters ago, to a fairly large hyperscale cloud provider WAN, in other words, routing win. Those opportunities might have contributed to some extent to our orders and to our backlog but not yet to revenue. So, the quick summary is most of the strength and the momentum thus far has been existing footprint, but great win that will continue to give us tailwinds throughout this year and next year as those opportunities start to actually deploy.
Operator: The next question is coming from Jim Suva from Citigroup.
Jim Suva: Thank you. Following up on that topic, I actually was going to ask directly about that. I remember a few quarters ago, Rami, you were very excited about some hyperscaler lab work and design wins and such. And I was going to ask you about the time line of that. Is it typically like a 12-month and then we start to see revenue recognition? Is it longer? Does COVID kind of play into some of those hyperscale, what I would consider new greenfield customer and relationships? I'm just trying to calibrate expectations for when we start to fold that into your revenue model. Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Yes. I think it's fair to think of this as deployment will happen throughout this year, probably more in the second half of the year. Typically, the sequence of events is there's a testing period as part of an RFP process. There is winning the opportunity and then there's a certification period where you work closely with the customer to do use case-specific testing and getting it ready for early feed trials and then ultimately into deployment. So, maybe sort of second half of this year time frame. And that's typically true of most large-scale WAN wins, whether they be in the cloud provider space or the service provider space.
Operator: Okay. I'd now like to turn the floor back to management for closing remarks.
Rami Rahim: Okay. Well, listen, I just wanted to thank everybody. I appreciate the time and the interest, as well as the confidence that you placed in our -- in myself and in my management team. I hope you can see the confidence that we have in our prospects, both in terms of our ability to deliver revenue growth as well as profitability, and not just for this year but on a sustainable basis. So, thank you. And we'll talk soon.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-26 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings. Welcome to the Juniper Networks Q3 2021 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host. Jess Lubert, you may begin.
Jess Lubert: Thank you, Operator. Good afternoon. And welcome to our Third Quarter 2021 Conference Call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer, and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations.  These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results might differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release and CFO commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and Juniper undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.  Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results is included in today's press release.  Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question so that as many people as possible who would like to ask a question have a chance. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami.
Rami Rahim: Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss our Q3 2021 results. We experienced very strong demand during the September quarter and delivered a fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, even though supply chain challenges impacted revenue in the period.  Orders saw another quarter of mid-teens year-over-year growth when adjusted to account for extended lead time. On an unadjusted basis, orders grew by more than 50% year-over-year for a second consecutive quarter.  And our ending backlog is now increased by more than $1 billion at compared to year-end 2020. Order momentum was strong [Indiscernible] vertical, customer solution, and geographies. With each of these categories experiencing growth well into double-digit territory.  Needless to say, our team is executing extremely well. Our strategy is working. And investments we have made in technologies that enhance customer operations and improve the end user experience, what we call experience-first networking are allowing us to differentiate across the markets we serve. we serve.  This technical differentiation along with the investments we've made in our go-to-market organization are paying off and enabling us to take share and capitalize on some of the big market transitions that are beginning to unfold across the verticals we serve.  This is particularly true in the enterprise market, where customers are increasingly recognizing the value delivered by platforms such as Mist and Astra, that dramatically reduced deployment time, eliminate trouble ticket, and reduced meantime to resolution for network problems.  These platforms are not only enabling us to win new logos in the campus and the datacenter, but also to pull through other Juniper products that present meaningful opportunities to expand with customers over time.  In the Cloud and service provider vertical, we're seeing strong early adoption of our 400-gig capable platform due to the strength of our Juniper bulk operating system, our differentiated silicon capabilities, and the deep engagement we maintained with these important customers.  These factors are not only enabling us to maintain our core franchises, but also to secure new footprint, including a large new Hyperscale wind deployment that should present tailwinds for our business over the next few years.  I'm also encouraged by the early customer interest in our metro routing portfolio, which did direct a large and fast-growing market where historically we have in place. We expect this opportunity to steadily ramp through the course of next year as new products come to market and service provider 5G investments steadily increase.  The bottom line is that I remain very optimistic regarding our future prospects despite the supply chain challenges we are currently navigating. I believe these challenges are likely to prove transitory in nature. And the strong order momentum we're seeing and the backlog we have developed set's us up extremely well to deliver improved growth and profitability in 2022 and beyond.  While it remains early, and we'll provide a more detailed 2022 outlook when we report our Q4 results based on current backlog and the August strength we're continuing to see in the market. We currently expect to deliver at least mid-single digit sales growth and at least a point of Operating Margin Expansion in 2022.  Our expectations for 2022 do not assume a material improvement in supply chain constraints. Now I'd like to provide some additional insights into the quarter and address some key developments we're seeing from a customer solutions perspective.  Starting with our automated WAN solutions, while revenue declined year-over-year due entirely to supply chain constraints, we experienced another quarter of strong order growth with solid momentum in both our service provider and Cloud segment.  We saw healthy demand across both our NF and PTF product family and strong adoption of our newer products, as well as our automation software portfolio. Our 400-gig solutions are performing well and enabled us to not only protect our existing footprint, but also to secure new wins that includes several large opportunities with our Cloud customers, including the hybrid scale opportunity I previously referenced.  Driven in part by these opportunities, our Cloud orders saw a second consecutive quarter up triple-digit growth year-over-year. While we are continuing to see strong customer demand for our automated LAN solution, these products are currently the most impacted by supply chain challenges.  As a result, we continue to expect revenue from this segment to be within the range of our long-term model calling for a 1% decline to a 3% growth this year despite the strong demand, we are seeing. Our Cloud-Ready Data Center solutions experienced 26% year-over-year revenue growth in Q3, and another quarter of encouraging order trends from our Cloud enterprise and service provider customers.  We continued to see strong momentum with new logos and deal greater than $1 million. As I mentioned last quarter, Astra is creating a significant buzz in the market, which is not only leading to more software opportunities, but also full-stack datacenter wins.  Customer interest in our Cloud-Ready Data Center portfolio is high. And we continue to be optimistic about the outlook of this business. Based on the momentum we are seeing; our Cloud ready datacenter business is now tracking to meet or exceed the high end of our long-term model looking for 5% to 9% growth year-over-year.  Finally, our AI driven enterprise solutions significantly outpaced the market and grew 35% Year-over-year. Our mid AI differentiation continues to win in the market as wireless orders experienced another record quarter with triple digit growth and a record number of deals greater than $1 million.  Our mystified revenue of wireless LAN, wired access, Marvis Virtual Network Assistant and associated EX pull-through, nearly doubled year-over-year. And we experienced record EX pull-through in the period. With this pull-through revenue growing more than 200% year-over-year.  This momentum enabled EX to achieve the highest level of sales since 2014. We expect this momentum to continue in future quarters as customers increasingly recognize the value of AI driven Cloud operations, including new and innovative features such as EVPN - VXLAN fabric management in the Mist Cloud, which has launched this quarter.  On a year-to-date basis, our mystified revenue has more than doubled year-over-year. We're also seeing very positive results with our AI -driven SD-WAN solution, which earned Juniper distinction as the only visionary in the Gartner WAN Edge Magic Quadrant published last quarter.  We saw a record quarter for our Session Smart Router portfolio acquired from 128 technology with triple-digit year-over-year growth and [Indiscernible] in various sectors like retail and banking, plus especially strong traction with the federal government. In addition, branch SRX developed last quarter hit a two-year high.  The pipeline for our AI-driven SD-WAN is strong, as both prospects and partners are gravitating towards the unique benefits provided by Juniper AI off with assured client to Cloud experiences. We are particularly encouraged by the number of full stack multi-million-dollar wins we're seeing in the campus and branch.  Where companies are turning to Juniper for a combination of their wired access, wireless access, and [inaudible 00:10:45] retailer and leading international construction company in Europe and managed services providers in North America and Europe. This highlights the value of our AI driven enterprise offerings to customers and partners across all verticals and all Geo's.  We believe that this AI continues to offer unique and market-leading differentiation, including self-driving operation and predictive actions driven by our virtual network assistant, Marvis, resulting in the best user and operator experiences. I am very pleased with the momentum we're seeing in this business. And now we expect our AI driven enterprise solution to see at least 20% growth in 2021.  Our security revenue experienced strong results in Q3, with total revenue growing 9% year-over-year. Product revenue increasing by 16% year-over-year, which marks a third consecutive quarter of double-digit product growth. Strength with broad-based across our high-end, mid-range and branch SRX products, as well as our virtual SRX offerings.  Our connected security strategy is gaining traction in the market because the convergence of networking and security provides us with a competitive advantage. And we continue to receive third-party accolades on our solutions from organizations such as ICFA and Net fax open often besting all competitors in head-to-head tech.  We believe our technical strength in both security and networking will continue to provide tailwinds in future quarters and should enable us to grow our security business during the current year. Our software momentum, accelerated in Q3.  Software and related services revenue grew 67% year-over-year as we experienced growth with ratable subscriptions, solid uptake of our Flex software licenses, and strong sales of certain perpetual onbox licenses. ARR grew 34% year-over-year, driven by a combination of mid subscription, ratable security software offering, and the related services associated with these software offerings.  We experienced a record software orders in the quarter due to broad-based strength across verticals and customer solutions. Momentum is strong in both rattible subscriptions offerings, as well as on bluff flex licenses.  Based on the momentum we're seeing, we're currently tracking ahead of the long-term total software and ARR target we presented at our recent Investor Day. I'd like to mention that our services team delivered another solid quarter and continued to grow on a year-over-year basis, due to strong renewal and service to tax rate.  Our services team continues to execute extremely well to ensure our customers receive an excellent experience. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners, and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper.  I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail.
Ken Miller: Thank you, Rami. And good afternoon everyone. I will start by discussing our third quarter results and [Indiscernible] some color on our Outlook. We ended the third quarter of 2021 at $1 billion 189 million in revenue.  Slightly below the midpoint of our guidance, but up 4% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. The modest revenue shortfall as compared to our guidance, was due to the negative impact of supply chain constraints.  Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.46 in line with our guidance. During the third quarter, momentum and product orders remained strong, showing exceptional year-over-year growth for the second consecutive quarter.  We saw significant order growth across all verticals, all geographies, and all customer solutions. Some of this order strength continues to be attributable to industry supply chain challenges that are causing certain customers to place orders early in an effort to secure supply when needed.  Even, after adjusting for these early orders, total product orders are estimated to have grown in the mid-teens year-over-year. This is the third consecutive quarter of mid-teens bookings growth after adjusting for early orders. It's important to mention that our backlog has increased by more than $1 billion relative to the start of the year.  Looking at our revenue by vertical on a year-over-year basis, Cloud grew 20% Enterprise grew 7%, and service provider declined 6%. We've got double-digit Year-over-year order growth in service provider. However, the timing of shipments due to supply constraints impacted revenue.  Turning to customer solutions on a Year-over-year basis, Cloud-Ready Data Center increased 26% and AI-driven enterprise increased 35%. Automated Land Solutions revenue was negatively impacted by supply constraints and declined 12% Year-over-year. However, orders grew double-digits versus the last year.  Total software and related services revenue were $204 million, which was an increase of 67% Year-over-year and ARR grew 34% year-over-year. As Rami mentioned, we are pleased that our software-related metrics were at record levels in the third quarter and are tracking ahead of the targets we shared at our Investor Day in February.  Total security revenue was $160 million, growing 9% year-over-year. Security product revenue grew 16% year-over-year. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, 6 were Cloud, 3 were service provider, and 1 was in enterprise.  Our top 10 customers accounted for 31% of our total revenue consistent with the third quarter of 2020. non-GAAP gross margin was 60.1%, which was above our guidance midpoint, primarily driven by favorable product and customer mix. If not for elevated supply-chain costs due to COVID-19, we would have posted non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 61.5%.  Non-GAAP Operating Expense increased 8% year-over-year and was essentially flat sequentially, slightly below our guidance midpoint. Non-GAAP Operating Margin was 16.6% for the quarter, which slightly exceeded our expectations.  We exit the third quarter with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $1.8 billion. Cash flow from operations was $137 million in the third quarter. From a capital return perspective, we paid $65 million in dividends, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share and repurchased $50 million worth of shares in the third quarter.  Now, I would like to add some color on our guidance, which you can find details in the CFO commentary available on our Investor Relations website. Consistent with prior quarters in 2021, the worldwide shortage of semiconductors and other components is impacting many industries. Caused in part by the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Similar to others, we are experiencing ongoing component shortages, which has resulted in extended lead times and elevated costs of certain products. We continue to work to resolve the effect of the supply chain challenges at an increased inventory levels and purchase commitments.  We are working closely with our suppliers to further enhance our resiliency and mitigate the effects of recent disruptions outside of our control. We believe that even with these actions, extended lead times and elevated costs will likely persist for at least the next few quarters.  While the situation is dynamic, at this point in time, we believe we will have access to sufficient supplies of semi-conductors and other components to meet our financial forecast. At the midpoint of our guidance, revenue is expected to grow 3.5%. This would be at the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth.  We expect our fourth-quarter non-GAAP gross margin to decline sequentially due to higher costs related to supply constraints and product mix. If not for the elevated supply chain costs, we would have forecasted non-GAAP Gross Margin of approximately 61%. We believe these elevated supply chain costs will prove to be transitory over time, but will likely remain elevated for the next several quarters.  I'd like to point out that despite an expected sequential decline in non-GAAP gross margin in Q4, on a full-year basis, our guidance remains approximately 59.5%, which is in line with what we provided previously.  While there is a lot unknown about the future due to the pandemic and other macroeconomic uncertainty, we would like to provide a few comments on our outlook for 2022. Presuming no further COVID-19 related economic deterioration, based on the current order momentum we're seeing and the anticipated Q4, 2021 ending backlog, we expect at least mid-single-digit revenue growth on a full-year basis in 2022.  In addition, we expect to see at least 100 basis points of Non-GAAP Operating Margin Expansion on a full-year basis. This guidance is not dependent on improvements in lead times or easing of industry supply chain constraints.  We expect to see seasonal patterns from a revenue Non-GAAP gross margin, and Non-GAAP operating expense perspective. As a reminder, our Non-GAAP gross margin tends to be sequentially lower in the first quarter with gradual volume-related improvements about the course of the year.  In addition, operating expense is typically sequentially higher in the first quarter due to the reset, and variable compensation and fringe costs.  In closing I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. Especially in this challenging environment. Now, I would like to open the call for questions.
Operator: At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. We also remind everyone to limit themselves to only one question. One moment, please, while we pose for questions. And our first question is from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs, please proceed with your question.
Rod Hall: Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I guess I wanted to check the number on automated WAN if that was down Year-over-year in the quarter, but then it seems like you've got a lot of opportunity as you head into next year.  And I just wanted to see what you're thinking, what happened in the quarter? Maybe you give us a little bit more color, but also was it -- was that supply mainly, and how does that look for you next year as you look out the next 12 months? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Thanks for the question, Rod. So, the short answer is, it's absolutely supply-chain limited. It just so happens that as you might imagine, for automated when the predominant product is routing, routing is when a more complex products that we need to build.  They use the most amount of the sophisticated semiconductor components. And for that reason, the discrepancy between revenue and orders is going to be greater for automated WAN and by connection also for the service provider.  Having said that, I'm very pleased with both our service provider and our automated WAN momentum, especially from a booking stand point I should mention every solution area automated WAN Cloud ready datacenter and the AI driven enterprise had order growth of over 50%.  It's just that the automated WAN had a biggest impact from when it came to supply chain challenges. I really like the fact that our newer products that we've introduced into the market line cards for the MX, line cards for the PTX are performing very well.  That's something that we monitor closely. We've talked a lot about the Metro opportunity, which in large part hasn't really positively helped us in any significant way that really, I think next year and year after it's when if kicked in. But nonetheless, we're seeing very solid early momentum with record orders for our ACX product line, which is predominantly used in that metro opportunity.  And the last thing I'll say about automated WAN which is very encouraging, is our 400-gig win rate. So, while we don't necessarily see a tone of revenue yet, with 400 gig deployments, we are looking at very solid wins and also growing orders at this point, which is reflected in the automated WAN order growth.
Rod Hall: Okay. And thanks for that, Rami. And can I just -- just following that up, could you comment on the backlog, as I know you said it's a billion-dollar increase, I think year-to-date, is most of that backlog increase in this quarter in the automated WAN area where -- you're just seeing that across-the board. I'm just curious about the composition of the backlog?
Rami Rahim: Yes. So, we've been building backlog throughout the year and it did grow quite healthy in Q3 as well as you noted, Rod. It is really across the board. I mean, backlog is up across all customer solutions. I would say that the automotive WAN is up a little bit more than the others, but it really is an across-the-board backlog build with a little bit more slanted towards automated WAN.  So, we are entering the fourth quarter, and I believe next year with a very healthy backlog across all products, but automated when it is, I would say, the healthiest, if you will.
Rod Hall: Great. Okay, guys. Thank you very much.
Rami Rahim: Sure. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Q - Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Samik Chatterjee: Thanks for taking the question. I guess I just wanted to start off by asking on pricing. What kind of actions have you taken on that front? If you can just break that down in some different verticals. Where are you finding it easier to take pricing, where it's been more difficult and in relation to the supply chain driven headwinds on gross margin when do we get to a point where you can be more net neutral with the price -- the pricing actions that you take? Another follow-up, please.
Ken Miller: Yeah. So, I'll take that. Thanks for the question to me. So, we are expecting the supply-chain costs to remain elevated throughout next year. I still believe there transitory and I could be positively surprised where we might see some of that reduction, maybe late next year. But at this point, we're presuming that it's going to remain elevated on the cost side.  On the pricing side, we are absolutely taking pricing actions to try to protect our Gross Margin. At this point, I feel that we are going to be able to protect much of our Gross Margins a little too early to call exactly how that's going to play out.  The other thing I would also add is the timing. I do expect that the cost to hit us a little earlier as you can see from the results. Costs have already started to hit us and the pricing actions will take some time to feather in, particularly because we have such a large backlog at the old prices.  So, we need to burn through the backlog at kind of legacy pricing if you will. And as we make pricing actually going forward, but we will realize that benefit in 2022, but it might not be evenly throughout the year.
Samik Chatterjee: Got it. As far as a follow-up, you are guiding the 5-plus in revenue growth and mid-single-digit as you call it, revenue growth in 2022. In the past, you've given some color about growth expectations by the vertical, just wanted to -- I can see different drivers, you have Cloud, you have the benefit of 400 gigs is Momentum and service provider as lenders.  If you can help us think about directionally which vertical is probably going to be your strongest growth vertical and rank order them in terms of growth for next expectations for next year?
Rami Rahim: Let me take that and maybe Ken would add some more to it. First, I would say we're not really guiding to mid-single-digit or a 5% growth, as you mentioned. We're guided -- we're providing an outlook of at least mid-single-digit growth.  And just keep in mind that we are supply chain limited right now. So that outlook that we provided assumes no meaningful improvement to the supply chain situation. If the supply chain situation does start to materially improve next year, then I think there is upside to that number. So, I would just start with that. In terms of where that growth comes in.  Every vertical is performing extremely well, and every solution area is performing extremely well. In enterprise, I'd say it's going to be a significant growth driver for us. So, assuming against supply chain goes our way, I think the differentiation that we have in the market, the win rate, the net new wins we're getting sets us up to perform extremely well.  A service provider, I think could actually do exceptionally well and even compete with an enterprise standpoint -- with the enterprise vertical just from the standpoint of the significant backlog that we built thus far.  So, it's going to be very difficult to predict exact stack ordering of contributors to that growth, primarily because it's going to be very much determined by the supply chain situation.
Ken Miller: The only thing I'll add, we'll provide more color on our next call as we typically do in the beginning of 2022. So, our Q4 call, we'll provide more color on FY '22 at that time.
Samik Chatterjee: Thank you for these clarifying remarks, Rami, and thank you, Ken. Thank you.
Ken Miller: Okay.
Operator: And our next question is from James Fish with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.
Clinton : Hey guys, this is Q - Clinton for [Indiscernible] Thanks for taking our question. Maybe touching base again on the Enterprise side, we've seen some really strong quarters, especially within the [Indiscernible] business. How should we think about the puts and takes of the Enterprise strength? Is it driven more by kind of delayed projects returning or are we seeing Juniper gaining more share? Are winning more against the incumbents? Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Yes, thanks for the good question. So, I'm very confident that we're taking share in the enterprise space. You saw our enterprise routing performance, 7% year-over-year. But I think the big difference between our revenue, and I think I said enterprise routing performance, I mean enterprise revenue performance 7% Year-over-year.  Order performance is actually significantly more than that and the difference is driven primarily by the fact that we had some weakness in enterprise routing due entirely to the federal space where there's still uncertainty of our budget. So, if you remove that, our strength in the enterprise is phenomenal.  We're seeing significant wins of net new opportunities and there are two things that are driving that today. One is our AI driven enterprise solution, campus and branch that includes the Mist for wireless, wired, and WAN that's achieving new records every single quarter.  Triple-digit revenue growth for Mist, the first triple-digit bookings quarter for Mist wireless, significant EX wired switching pull-through of the Mist portfolio, all of these are contributing to that portion of the Enterprise business.  The second vector of growth within the Enterprise is a datacenter, there as well, over 50% year-over-year order growth. Significant differentiation with Apstra as the management solution for the datacenter, very solid win rate. So, I just think that we're taking share because of the strength of our portfolio which has never been this differentiated I mean, at least in my time at Juniper.
Ken Miller: And I just want to add on to that a little bit. So as Rami mentioned, Enterprise from a revenue perspective was up 7%. We already talked about automated WAN and service provider being a little bit stunted because of supply.  And I just want to make sure everyone is aware that all cuts, whether it's Enterprise Cloud or SP, or Automated [Indiscernible] Cloud Ready Datacenter [Indiscernible] than Price. All numbers are actually lower from a revenue perspective than we would otherwise expect if it were not for supply constraints.  We're not going to give you an absolute number, but it could have been, but in one way to look at it is the difference between our adjusted bookings on a product perspective, which is 15% or mid-teens in Q3 year-over-year as compared to our revenue growth on a product perspective of 5%.  So, it's easily to imply that there's an extra 10% of revenue growth that did not happen due to supply constraints. and that would have really lifted all boats, Enterprise, Cloud, NSP.
Clinton : Super helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James, please proceed with your question.
Simon Leopold: Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if you could talk about the general trend in your input costs and specifically what I'm pondering is the components, particularly chips that you're ordering now or ordered during the quarter, are likely to show up in 40, 50 weeks at higher price points. So, want to get a better understanding how to think about the impact of that particular headwind in 22 gross margins. Is that something you could help us with?
Ken Miller: Yes. So, as you can see from -- we provided the actual reported gross margin of 60.1 this quarter, which was above midpoint due to product mix being favorable. But we also talked about what it would have been if it weren't for the elevated costs which would have been close to 61.5%.  So, these elevated costs are hitting us now. And one thing I would say, Simon, yes, we have purchase orders throughout all of next year. In some cases, out 50 weeks, in other cases, out 80 weeks, in an attempt to secure supply.  And these are non - cancelable committed purchase orders with pricing. That said, this pricing environment is taking that and throwing it out the window. We are seeing costs going up despite the fact that we have orders in place.  So, we are expecting -- the orders we have in place are not necessarily the price we are going to pay. Whether it's disguised in the form of an expedite fee or purchase price variance, etc., we're seeing costs going up in advance of those orders being fulfilled if that makes sense.
Simon Leopold: I think it does. Just to clarify, all else being equal your mix the same, customers the same, gross margins for products would be lower in 2022 than they are right now. Is that fair?
Ken Miller: Not providing 2022 specific gross margin guidance at this point, there's just too much uncertainty. You could count on us giving you a better understanding 90 days from now on our next call.  I will say this, we're not dependent on gross margin improvement next year for us to hit our commitment of at least 100 basis points improvement in operating margin. So, we're very committed to expanding profitability next year and we're not dependent on gross margin to do that, but we are very committed to expanding profits.
Simon Leopold: Okay, thank you. That's helpful.
Ken Miller: Yes.
Operator: Our next question is from George Notter with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
George Notter: Hi, guys. Thanks very much. I guess, as I listened to the call, you guys have turned out a lot of numbers. Certainly, some eye-popping stats, I think, in terms of the additional billion-dollars in backlog, triple-digit order rates across a number of your business lines and customer areas, and yet we're talking about mid-single-digit growth for next year.  Certainly, I think you caveated that at least mid-single, but I guess I'm trying to understand sort of the delta between all these numbers. I mean, it seems like at some level you expect that some of your customers have double and triple ordered with you. And I guess I'm wondering like how you see that dynamic and how does that play out going forward?
Rami Rahim: Hi George. I'll start. So, I mean, you said it. We're really not guiding or we're not providing an outlook of mid-single digits. We're providing an outlook of at least that number, and we're doing it with the major assumption that supply situation does not in fact get better.  If the supply situation, in fact does start to improve, and it could by the second half of next year. Then I think you will see an upside to this outlook that we provided.  That's really the net of it. At this point in time based on visibility, we felt that it would be prudent for us to provide you with an outlook based on the supply situation not improving. However, that could be a false assumption. Things could actually be better next year.
Ken Miller: Absolutely. I mean, there's no doubt that the limiting factor or the primary input into our guidance or outlook for next year is supply. This really has to do with how much supply we think we're going to have access to next year.  And that's where we came up with at least mid-single digits. If it were purely a demand equation, the number would be much greater than that. And that that holds true to nominate next year. But also, this year.
George Notter: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question is from Meta Marshall (ph.) with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Meta Marshall: Great thanks. I'm trying to see where you were seeing the most traction with the App Store business and was its enterprise or just -- or were you seeing kind of any attraction on the hyperscale side or on the cloud side. And then maybe just a second question if you could just remind us how much of the Q3 year-on-year growth would be inorganic? Thanks
Rami Rahim: Yeah. Let me start with your question about Astra. So first, I'll just say very quickly that we never anticipated that Astra would be a significant opportunity in the hyperscale space. Primarily because the top 5 hyperscale customers tend to develop their own automation software.  That being said, everything outside of hyperscale: Enterprise, service provider, even Cloud major, is an opportunity.  Where we have thus far seeing the quickest win rates, the biggest pipeline build is in the enterprise, large to mid-size enterprise companies. and as I mentioned earlier, it's extremely encouraging the rate at which we are taking down new opportunities. There is absolutely a demand for this kind of automation technology for the datacenter space. And there are some very unique aspects to our Astra software offering.  First and foremost, it's the only open solution in the market today. None of our peer automation solutions work on anything but their own switching infrastructure. Astra works on our own switching as well as sonic as well as our competitor switches. that turns out to be a highly desirable feature of the technology. Apstra is designed ground-up to scale to the largest datacenters.  That's very meaningful for large enterprises especially in financial services, and manufacturing, and other similar verticals. And Apstra invented -- pioneered the concept of intent-based networking so from an operational experience standpoint, there really is nothing as good as it in the market. So, I'm very, very pleased with the performance thus far, and I think this is going to be a great growth driver for us in the future.
Ken Miller: Yes, and your second question on organic versus inorganic. When we started the year, we called out that we believe the inorganic acquisitions in aggregate, all 3 of them would add about 1% of revenue growth to Juniper.  We know it's about $50 million and that's holding exactly as we expected. So, you can take that 50 million. I am not going to give you the exact number in Q3, but if you start with a $50 million for the year and quarterize that, that gives you some indication of the inorganic revenue in Q3.
Meta Marshall: Great, thanks, guys.
Ken Miller: Sure.
Operator: Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Fisher: Hey, guys. Q - Michael Fisher on for Amit. I was curious on one of the comments on the AI driven enterprise revenue growth. You mentioned both Mist and EX product families grew year-over-year. I was curious, if you can give some more color on the trajectory there and whether growth rates are accelerating, decelerating, not moving around too much for each of those products, families?
Rami Rahim: Yeah, I sorry, you glitched there for a second. I think you're asking about Mist Wi - Fi, and then also the.
Michael Fisher: Yes.
Rami Rahim: Got it. Thank you. So first, I think by any measure, Mist has been an incredible acquisition for Juniper Networks, and it really has put our enterprise business on a significant growth and take share of trajectory. Q3 was no difference in terms of the quarter-over-quarter record we continue to make. This was a record AI - driven enterprise orders quarter and record AI - driven revenue quarter for us.  Order growth is well into double-digits and Growth in all customers verticals, SP Enterprise and Cloud providers that are all bracing the technology. And I think I did mention that it's not just about WIFI, although Wi-Fi___33 in and of itself was a record and it hit triple-digit bookings for the first time in the Q3 timeframe.  We saw a record number of EX pull-through, both in units, but also in revenue as well. So that has always been the strategy for Mist, not just about Wi-Fi___33, it's that entire client to Cloud connection that includes Wi-Fi___33, wired, and WAN.  We're seeing the full benefit in wireless and wired, as we integrate 128 technology into the LAN, which is really going to happen by the end of this year. And the first part of next year, I think we'll see a similar pull-through effect happening on that side as well. So, the momentum has just been really strong. I expect that to continue for sure.
Michael Fisher: Great. Thanks for taking my question.
Operator: Our next question is from David Vod with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.
David Vod: Great. Hey guys. Thanks for the question. So, can I just go back to the commentary about product order growth versus actual product revenue. Are you suggesting that in 3Q there was roughly 70 million of deferred product revenue that shows up in your product backlog that you're going to recognize next year?  And if I do that same math in the June quarter, it's probably about 60 million or maybe 55 million. So, is that revenue that you think it will be recognized next year? Is that the right way to think about it? And then I have a quick follow-up.
Ken Miller: Yes. So, I think those numbers you're referring to are in the ballpark from an adjusted bookings perspective, our actual backlog is growing much faster than that. We've talked about greater than a billion. So much bigger numbers.  But if you just go to our adjusted bookings number, which is that mid-teen number, that delta the revenue or the numbers you just quoted and those are the revenue that we could have or arguably should have recognized already, right, in Q3. That plus 10%, that $70 million you were referring to.  That if there were not supply constraints, we would have recognized approximately that much more revenue is really the math I want you to understand. From a backlog build is much greater than that because customers are placing orders at a faster rate.
David Vod: So then maybe just as a quick follow-up. So that's 70 million given your backlog, I guess would be recognized in calendar 2022. So, when I think about your commentary about at least mid-single-digit revenue growth, that sounds like about a 0.5 of that growth comes from the backlog pushed from, let's say 3Q into 4Q.  What I would imagine, you're expecting something similar in Q4. Is that the right way to think about your '22 revenue outlook? There's some push-out from 3Q and 4Q that's going to benefit in 2022?
Ken Miller: I do think that the backlog build, whether it's the adjusted bookings backlog build or even the unadjusted, for that matter, is going to ship essentially. So, I think that gives us confidence in our revenue outlook of at least mid-single-digit revenue growth. The reason why we're not guiding more than at least single-digits is supply constrained. So, we are supply constrained today and we're expecting to be supply constrained next year as well.  So how much of that backlog and how quickly we are able to ship it is still uncertain at this point, but we feel very good about at least mid-single-digit growth due to the strength of our backlog, due to the strength of the momentum we're seeing on the bookings side, quite honestly, the execution we have in the field and depart differentiation we enjoy.  So, there's a lot of reasons to be more bullish, the one reason to be somewhat prudent is supply and that's something that's keeping us kind of at the at least mid-single digit level at this point.
David Vod: Great, thanks for the color.
Ken Miller: Sure.
Operator: And our next question is from Bajaj Najam with MGM Partners, please proceed with your question.
John Najam : Thank you for squeezing me in. I apologize I missed much of the call so if I'm repeating, I apologize. but I just want to get a better sense on your gross margin trend. In terms of -- can you give us some color on pricing environment, and how much of a percentage does that offset to a degree the component and freight costs that are impacting your near-term gross margin and how do you think the pricing environment plays out next year? I suspect it's probably favorable when -- and if anything, if I look at some of your peers like Cisco who highlight is significantly benefit in the fourth quarter for the pricing environment, I suspect you are also likely to benefit from that. So, can you give us a color on how that plays out versus component costs?
Ken Miller: So, we already are seeing some of the elevated cost rates are component shortages, freight, etc. and we expect those costs to remain elevated throughout next year. In some cases, bringing up perhaps get a little worse application is actually a little better, but we expect elevated costs throughout all of next year and we're already experiencing those.  Now we've given you a Nano -meter Gross Margin reported by the Adjusted Gross Margin, just to account for that, those extra costs which we do believe are transitory. However, at this point, we're assuming it's not going to go away in 2022 it'll be beyond that. On the pricing side, we are taking actions.  I think many of our competitors are taking similar actions, but will take some time for us to -- for those actions to really hit our P&L. I do expect them to be beneficial to 2022, but the timing will be a little more back-end loaded because we are carrying such a large backlog.  We have nearly $1.5 billion of backlog. We talked about growing it over a billion, we started the year with $420 million, so we're nearly at $1.5 billion. That takes some time to burn through and that's not going to be impacted by the pricing actions as much as the future of orders will be, so you'll start to see some benefit.  How that all plays out is something we're -- it's just too early for us to quantify and provide outlook on. But what I am confident on is our profitability overall next year and op margin will expand by at least 100 basis points.
John Najam : Can you share how the customer feedback has been on the price hikes, especially like are you getting a lot of pushback? Can you give us some color on the discounting environment, is it more discipline across the market? And should that all else being equal, if you have a favorable discounting environment, wouldn't that a good degree significantly offset the component headwinds that you've highlighted?
Ken Miller: Yes. So, we are taking the pricing actions with that goal in mind to protect our gross margin, and I think to a degree at will. How much degree as what we're still working through and not willing to provide an outlook at this point? But absolutely, it should help offset and protect our gross margin, and that's why we're taking the actions.  From a customer acceptance perspective, I think overall, I would summarize it is they're not surprised. They're seeing it across the board, across most of their suppliers. We're seeing it across our suppliers.  This is something that's upstream and not surprising. Obviously, I don't think that they are necessarily jumping up for joy when we talk about price increases, but I think their understanding of it. And we feel that we'll be able to capture much of that price increase and be able to protect margins to the best of our ability.
David Vod: Appreciate the answer. Thank you.
Ken Miller: Yeah.
Operator: And our next question is from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Jim Suva: Thank you very much. My question is your outlook for next year is very encouraging. I think you said at least mid-single digit. Can you just recap this year and next year the amount of organic versus inorganic, I think sometimes the timing layers in a little bit organic versus inorganic and I just assume, but maybe you can answer next year's outlook is not including anything not announced or pending or things like that for acquisitions. Thank you.
Ken Miller: Yeah. Next year's outlook does not assume any new acquisitions. The acquisitions we made approximately 12 months ago are now baked in to our run rate and baked in to next year's outlook. Those businesses are growing.  And so, you would see a year-on-year improvement if we were to break that out, which we're not. But we have back that into our at least mid-single-digit Growth. But this is an organic Juniper as today, outlook for next year does not require any additional M&A.
Jim Suva: Thank you so much.
Ken Miller: Sure.
Operator: Our next question is from Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.
Paul Silverstein : I appreciate you squeezing me in all I do apologize if this has been asked and answered. First off, with respect to web-scale customers, I know 60 of your top 10 customers were Cloud and I know there has been pretty typical with presiding quarters but are all 4 of the Web Skill Johnson among those 6.
Ken Miller: Are all 4 of the hyperscale’s. What scale giant amongst those 6? We don't break out that love detail as you know, Paul, I mean, I think it's a fair assumption that where the Capex is where you're going to see our biggest customers. So, where the spend is likely going to be where our top 10 customers are. But I'm not going to get into any more detail and say, 6 of our top 10 are Cloud customers.
Rami Rahim: I do want to add just Paul, that our Cloud provider businesses is performing incredibly well. second quarter of triple-digit order growth. And I love the broad-based strength that we're seeing. So, we're seeing an expansion within Hyperscale of opportunities and diversity across the four or five big hyperscale customers.  So, it's not just our traditionally largest Cloud provider customer that's driving that growth, is also other hyperscale customers and add to that, that Cloud major Tier 2, Tier 3 Cloud providers that are also performing very well.  There's an additional element of strength and broad-based diversity and net is in the technology space. So, routing, switching, and security are all performing really well within the cloud provider segment.
Paul Silverstein : So, Raleigh, to that statement, I assume -- I recognize, as you just pointed out, you've got more than just routing, but I assume routing is a big portion of those large -- of your business with this large Cloud operators. Where I'm really trying to go with this and I'm trying to be too clever by half clearly is in light of Facebook's massive, was the $10 billion to $15 billion increase in calendar '22 CapEx. I was trying to discern to what extent, if any, you were leveraged.  I assume you do have leverage, but I suspect you're not going to be willing to answer that. If you are, great. If not, I would like to ask you -- Let me pause and let you respond, and then I have a quick follow-up.
Rami Rahim: Well, I am not going to answer a question that specific to a customer. However, I will say, I'm looking at the hot off the press earnings results from our -- the Hyperscale Cloud providers looking at their capex rates and feeling very good about that because as long as their business is performing well, they will need to invest in their infrastructure to maintain that strength, to keep up with the demand that they're seeing and we will benefit from that.  The simplest that our footprint in routing within Hyperscale is phenomenal. We've maintained that footprint despite many attempts by competitors to take slices of it away from us. And then as you get into the top 10 and Cloud major, it's not just about routing, it's about routing and switching for us.
Paul Silverstein : And just a quick follow-up. I assume -- assuming that increasing number of customers are, in fact, providing longer-term forecasts, as I believe is [Indiscernible] for you and most others. I assume your forecast, your outlook for '22 is relatively more solid. There's more knowledge underlying, and let's hope relative to last year and proceeding years. Is that simply given?
Ken Miller: Yeah, I think given the strength of our backlog and that's the most tangible way to look at it. I mean, we have a hard order in place for a much greater percentage of next year's revenue than we normally would entering the year. So, I think that absolutely gives us better visibility than we are accustomed to as we enter in future periods.
Paul Silverstein : I appreciate the responses [Indiscernible]. Thanks, guys.
Rami Rahim: Thanks, Paul.
Operator: In our last question would be from Alex Henderson with Needham 40, whichever question.
Alex Henderson: I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the broader pricing environment. Not necessarily in context of what you're doing, but rather what you're seeing from your competitors and to what extent your actions are under an umbrella or are ahead of the umbrella and just can you talk about your price in your categories relative to what they're doing. Thanks.
Ken Miller: Yes. I don't want to get super specific on what others are doing individually, but I can tell you pricing actions, whether they'd be list Price actions, discount controls, or other types of actions or absolutely something that many Companies, I assume not just Juniper group, but even in other industries where they're getting input costs are rising pretty dramatically.  Many companies are exploring and implementing it. And I can tell you that so far, we have taken some actions, we'll continue to look at opportunities going forward. All in an effort to protect our gross margin. The [inaudible 00:55:41] costs are absolutely rising. I think that's not a secret.  It starts upstream with the wafers, and the fast, and then moves into our component suppliers, and they're seeing higher cost, and are looking to pass those on to us, and we're looking to pass those onto our customers. And so far, we feel that -- feel confident we are going to benefit from the actions we're taking, but it's just too early to commit to gross margin input -- gross margin outputs for next year.
Alex Henderson: Certainly, I understand the mechanics of that. And I think everybody on the call does. There shouldn't be any surprises there. But the real question is, are you more aggressive and trying to push price or are you less aggressive versus your competition? And I don't -- I'm not asking for you to describe it on a per specific person or company.  But rather in general, are you more aggressive or less aggressive on pricing than your competition in the categories that you are competing? And particularly, can you focus a little bit on the campus market, which is particular important here, Growth steam.
Rami Rahim: Yeah, Alex, let me take a stab at it. It's very difficult to answer that quantitatively because we don't know in a lot of detail what everybody else is doing. But to the extent that our peers are attempting to do what we're doing, which is essentially to offset cost increases, then I think first order of magnitude is going to be all roughly in line with each other.  And that's sort of how I would answer that question. And then in the campus and branch in particular, yes. There are going to be cost pressures there just like anywhere else. But the thing about campus and [inaudible 00:57:23] that makes me feel very good is, the level of differentiation.  And this is software-led differentiation has never been stronger and it allows us to win -- to compete and win on value. So, there are opportunities that we are winning now fairly routinely, where we're not price leaders, and yet we are able to garner a greater price dip because of the differentiation that we have with that solution.
Alex Henderson: With all due respect, I think there are large differences between the locations where Price actions are being taken by your competitors, and necessarily your exposure to them so that there could be meaningfully differentials between categories.  And my guess is that campus is an area, that prices have gone up more rapidly, but the interest is if you have any thoughts on that point?
Rami Rahim: No additional thoughts at this time. Thanks for that input, Alex. I appreciate it.
Alex Henderson: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Rami Rahim for a closing remark.
Rami Rahim: Briefly, I just wanted to thank everybody for participating in the call today and for the great questions. I will just leave you with a couple of thoughts.  First, I remain very encouraged by the momentum that we're seeing in the business especially the diversity of the strength that we're seeing across market segments and technologies and solution areas. I think the team is executing extremely well and I'm very proud of our Juniper team for doing that.  And last but not least, I think the demand strength we're seeing coupled with the backlog that we built right now sets us up for a great next year, both from the standpoint of achieving revenue growth, but then also our commitment to expanding profits as well. So, I'll leave you with that thought. Thanks again.
Operator: And this concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your line at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-07-27 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Juniper Network's Second Quarter 2021 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jess Lubert, Vice President Investor Relations.
Jess Lubert: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to our second quarter 2021 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results might differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release and CFO commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today and Juniper undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the Company's financial results is included in today's press release. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami.
Rami Rahim: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss our Q2 2021 results. We reported better than expected Q2 results, delivering a second consecutive quarter which saw year-over-year revenue growth across all verticals and geographies. We also experienced record orders in Q2, which helped us grow backlog both sequentially and year-over-year. Momentum is strong entering the second half of the year. I'm encouraged by the diversity of the strength we are seeing, which is spread across vertical customer solutions and geographies. While the strength is due in part to improved trends with some of our large strategic customers, particularly in the Cloud and Service Provider verticals, we're also seeing strong momentum with new logos and an increased number of deals greater than $1 million especially in the Enterprise vertical. I would call out three factors driving our momentum. First, our focus on leading the industry and delivering simplified operations and a superior user experience what we call experience first networking is resonating in the market. Our AI and software management tools are second to none and deliver meaningful customer value that is enabling us to accelerate our success and take share, particularly in the enterprise campus and the data center markets. But also in Service Provider and Cloud verticals. By leveraging software control point like Mist, Astra and Juniper Paragon to improve customer operations and experience. We are not only creating sticky new software revenue stream, but also creating platform that pulls through a broader suite of core Juniper infrastructure. Second, our teams are executing extremely well. Our internal alignment around customer solutions and investments in our go-to-market organization are enabling us to capitalize on our technical differentiation and benefit from improved end market conditions we're seeing. In addition, our customer satisfaction ratings are record highs, reflecting the strong work of our engineering and services organization as well as our supply chain team, which continues to work tirelessly to meet customer demand in an extremely tight supply environment. Third, we are seeing improved end market conditions across verticals and geographies. As a global businesses reopen and companies look to bring workers back to the office, many projects which were halted are resuming and many new ones are starting Cloud and Service Provider customers are all recognizing the strategic importance of the network and investing to support a more distributed workforce which is increasingly reliant on high bandwidth applications such as real-time video collaboration. While the demand environment is strong, we, like others in our industry are managing through significant supply chain challenges. Customers have become more aware of these challenges and many are either placing orders early or providing significantly greater visibility into future projects. This is particularly true with some of our large strategic customers, especially in the Cloud and Service Provider verticals. We view these early orders and insight into our customers longer-term plan as a positive development.  Importantly, even excluding these accelerations, orders are estimated to have experienced mid-teens growth in the period with healthy momentum across verticals and customer solutions. Based on this trend, we now expect to grow our business approximately 6% in 2021 on a full year basis, despite the challenging supply chain backdrop. I'm excited by the momentum we're seeing. The investments we're making are paying off and I'm increasingly confident in our ability to not only grow our business this year, but to do so on a sustainable basis. Our strategy is down and we are investing and succeeding in several big industry opportunities that should provide attractive tailwinds over the next few years. The first area, we're winning is the enterprise transition to AI driven cloud architectures. Mist was one of the first to deliver on this vision with wireless, and since the acquisition we have brought the same automation insight and agility to the wired land and now the win. This unique client to cloud approach for AI [ph] off delivered superior end user and operator experiences which is enabling us to both land new full stack wins defined as WiFi, wired SD-WAN and expand our opportunity with the large existing accounts. While marketing messages can sound similar, we believe Juniper with Mist AI has fundamental architectural advantages that will stand the test of time including a purpose-built microservices cloud architecture, sixth generation data science expertise, a unified AI engine across the LAN wireless LAN SD-WAN and AI driven support led by the industry's only conversational assistant, Marvis. This differentiation has enabled us to take share in key networking segments, which we believe will continue at the $20 billion campus and branch market transition to AI driven cloud architecture in the years to come.  We're also continuing to see success with our 400G offerings, both in wide area as well as data center use cases. We now maintain more than 200 wins that span across Hyperscale, Service Provider and Cloud major accounts, which is up materially on a quarter-over-quarter basis. We remain optimistic regarding our ability to not only protect our footprint, but also to capture net new opportunities in these larger accounts. We continue to expect 400G deployment to begin later this year and present increasing tailwinds over the next few years. In addition, we are optimistic about our 5G metro opportunity. We believe the investments we're making in our Juniper Paragon automation suite as well as ACX metro access and aggregation portfolio will position us to capitalize on this sizable and growing market. While it remains early, we're seeing healthy customer interest in our new Metro portfolio and we expect to continue to introduce new solutions over the next 18 months that should further enhance our ability to succeed in this market. Now, I'd like to provide some additional insight into the quarter and address some of the key developments we're seeing from a Customer Solutions perspective. Starting with our automated WAN solution. While revenue slightly declined year-over-year due to the timing of shipments in the cloud, we experienced strong orders with solid momentum in both our Service Provider and Cloud segment.  We saw healthy demand across both our MX and PTX product families and improved adoption of our newer products as well as our automation software portfolio. Our 400G solutions are performing well and enabling us to not only protect our existing footprints, but also to secure several net new wins. While we are continuing to see strong customer demand for our automated WAN solutions, these products are currently the most impacted by supply chain challenges and therefore the most difficult for us to predict. As a result, despite very strong orders, we now expect our results from this segment to return to within the range of our long-term model, calling for a minus 1% decline to a 3% growth during the year with supply to likely to be the biggest determinant of where we will ultimately fall within this range. Our Cloud-Ready Data Center solution has experienced 28% year-over-year growth during the June quarter, an encouraging order trend from our Cloud, Enterprise and Service Provider customers. We saw strong momentum with new logos as well as an increase in average deal size in the period, including a meaningful increase in deals over a $1 million after exceeded expectations for its second consecutive quarter and it's creating a significant buzz in the market. This is leading to more software opportunities and full stack data center wins.  Customer interest in our Cloud-Ready Data Center portfolio is high and we remain optimistic regarding the outlook of this business. For the year, we believe our Cloud-Ready Data Center business is now tracking at to slightly above the high end of our long-term model, looking for 5% to 9% growth year-over-year. Finally, our AI driven Enterprise Solutions also grew 28% year-over-year. Our Mist AI differentiation continues to resonate in the market, as new logos increased 130% year-over-year and Mist orders experienced another quarter of solid triple-digit growth. Our Mistified revenue from wireless LAN, wired assurance, Marvis Virtual Network Assistant and associated DX pull through nearly doubled year-over-year and we saw another quarter of record. I believe the Mist pull through opportunity will continue to grow, thanks to the recent introduction of the EX4400, a groundbreaking new access that combines true enterprise grade, scalability and performance with the ease of AI driven cloud operations. Mist also positively impacted our Branch Security business, which performed well in Q2. And we continue to make progress with 128 technology, which we are integrating with our SRX secure branch gateways under a common cloud and AI umbrella. The pipeline of SD WAN opportunities remains strong thanks to these technology differences coupled with the unique synergy potential of a unified client-to-cloud Enterprise portfolio from Juniper with end-to-end automation, insight and action. In addition to strength with large Fortune 500 customers, we continued to see very strong momentum in the channel and success with smaller commercial accounts during Q2, which highlights the value of our AI driven enterprise offerings to customers of all sizes and across all verticals.  We believe Mist AI continues to offer unique and market leading differentiation, resulting in the best user and operator experiences. I remain encouraged by the momentum we're seeing in this business and remain confident our AI driven enterprise solutions are likely to see double-digit growth in 2021. Our Security revenue experienced strong results during the June quarter, and orders also exceeded expectations. Strength was especially notable in the high end of the market where we have historically been strong, although we saw growth across all customer verticals and those product families. Our Connected Security strategy is gaining traction in the market because the convergence of networking security provides us with a competitive advantage in the portions of the market where we are currently focused. We believe our technical strength in both security and networking will continue to provide tailwinds in future quarters and should enable our Security business to achieve our growth objectives. Our software momentum is also strong. Our software and related services revenue grew 59% year-over-year in Q2, as we experienced growth with ratable subscriptions, solid updates of our Flex software licenses and strong sales of certain perpetual on-box Flex licenses. ARR grew 32% year-over-year in the period, driven by combination of Mist subscriptions, ratable security software offerings and the related services associated with these software offerings. We experienced record software orders in the quarter due to broad based strength across verticals and use cases. We're seeing ongoing strength in ratable subscription offerings and improved adoption of our on-box Flex licenses, which are seeing traction across all of the customer verticals that we serve. Based on the momentum we're seeing we remain confident in the long term Software and ARR targets we presented at our recent Investor Day I'd like to mention that our Services team delivered another solid quarter and continued growth on a year-over-year basis, due to strong renewals and service attach rates. Our services team continues to execute extremely well to ensure our customers receive an excellent experience. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ken who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail.
Ken Miller: Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start by discussing our second quarter results and end with some color on our outlook. We ended the second quarter of 2021 at $1.172 billion in revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.43, both above the midpoint of our guidance. Revenue was up 8% year-over-year, with growth across all verticals and geographies. We experienced record levels of [indiscernible] orders during the second quarter, with significant strength across all verticals and Customer Solutions. We believe some of this strength is attributable to industry supply chain challenges that are causing certain customers to place orders early in an effort to secure supply when needed. These early orders resulted in an increase in backlog and provide us with improved visibility into the second half of 2021. Even after adjusting for these early orders, total product orders are estimated to have grown mid-teens year-over-year, exceeding our expectations. With year-over-year growth across all verticals and Customer Solutions. Looking at our revenue by vertical on a year-over-year basis Service Provider grew 2%, Cloud grew 12% and Enterprise grew 12%. All verticals grew on a sequential basis. From a Customer Solution perspective, automated WAN solutions declined 3% year-over-year. While PTX product family posted year-over-year growth, our MX offerings declined year-over-year. While our automated WAN revenue declined due to the timing of shipments, orders grew year-over-year. Cloud Ready Data Center revenue increased 28% year-over-year, as we experienced strong demand for our QFX product family across all customer verticals and geographies. And finally, AI driven enterprise revenue increased to 28% versus last year. Our Mist and EX product families both grew year-over-year. As Rami mentioned, total software and related services revenue was $173 million, an increase of 59% year-over-year. And our annual recurring revenue or ARR, grew 32% year-over-year. Total Security revenue, which includes security products as well as services related to our security solutions was $172 million, an increase of 11% year-over-year. Security Product sales grew 21% year-over-year. In reviewing our Top 10 customers for the quarter, Forever Cloud, Fiber Service Provider, and one was in Enterprise. Our top 10 customers accounted for 33% of our total revenue as compared to 30% in Q2 2020. Non-GAAP gross margin was 60%, which was above the midpoint of our guidance, primarily due to higher revenue and lower service delivery costs. If it weren't for elevated logistics and other supply chain related costs, we would have posted non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 60.5%. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 9% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, slightly above the high end of our guidance range. Primarily due to higher variable compensation related to better than expected order momentum. Non-GAAP operating margin was 15.8% for the quarter, which exceeded our expectations and the midpoint of the guidance looking for 14.6%. We exited the quarter with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $1.8 billion. The sequential increase was due to strong free cash flow generation, Which was partially offset by our capital return program. Cash flow from operations was $257 million. From a capital returns perspective, we paid $65 million in dividends, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share and repurchased $110 million worth of shares in the second quarter. Turning to our guidance, as I'm sure you are all aware, there is a worldwide shortage of semiconductors impacting many industries. Similar to others, we are experiencing ongoing supply constraints which have resulted in extended lead times and elevated costs. We have invested to strengthen our supply chain and have increased inventory purchase commitments over the course of the last year. We continue to work closely with our suppliers to further enhance our resiliency and limit disruptions outside of our control to the best of our ability. Despite these actions, we believe extended lead times and elevated costs will likely persist for at least the next few quarters. While the situation is dynamic, at this point in time we believe we will have access to sufficient for Senect [ph] Vector supply to meet our full year financial forecast. Looking specifically at the third quarter. At the midpoint of guidance, revenue is expected to be up 5.5% year-over-year. We expect supply constraints to be particularly tight in the third quarter, which has been factored into our guidance. We expect our third quarter non-GAAP gross margins to be impacted by higher component costs related to supply constraints and higher expected service delivery costs. At the midpoint of guidance, earnings are expected to grow faster than revenue in the period, despite the expected pressure from supply constraints. Moving on to our expectations for 2021. We have updated our full-year revenue growth and profitability expectations to account for our better than expected Q2 results and current expectations for the second half of 2021. We now expect full-year revenue growth of approximately 6%, a point of which is expected to come from recently acquired assets. Our revised top line outlook is 150 basis points higher than the midpoint of our previous expectation of 4% to 5%. From a vertical perspective for 2021, Cloud is expected to grow faster than our long-term range of 1% to 5%, Enterprise is expected to grow towards the high end of our long-term model range of 5% to 9% and Service Provider is expected to be flat to slightly up versus last year toward the high end of our guidance range. While non-GAAP gross margin can be difficult to predict, we now expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 59.5% for 2021, down from our previous expectation of approximately 60% due to the elevated freight and cost related to supply constraints we are now experiencing. We continue to expect full year non-GAAP operating margin to be flat to slightly up versus 2020 levels. On a full-year basis, we expect non-GAAP earnings to grow faster than revenue. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success, especially in this challenging environment. Now, I'd like to open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Samik Chatterjee from JP Morgan. Please proceed.
Joseph Cardoso: Hi, thanks for the question. This is Joe Cardoso on for Samik. So my first question here is on the guide. You reiterated your guide for Service Provider revenue to be flat to slightly up for the full year, which implies revenue for that vertical is likely to decline or to be flat in the second half of the year which optically would appear conservative given the expectations for Service Providers to ramp spending into the second half of this year. Can you help bridge that variance there and maybe how that thinking is wrong? And then I have a follow up. Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Yes, let me start, Joe, and then maybe Ken would like the WAN. So we had a solid first half of the year for Service Provider. Our Q1 performance was exceptional, Q2 was also I think in line with expectations. We're entering the second half of the year with solid backlog. We're encouraged by the momentum that we're seeing across the business internationally, and both those tier 1 Service Providers strength in this country, in the US, also encouraged by the number of wins, 400G, wins which aren't really contributing to revenue in a very meaningful way yet, but I expect that to change in the second half of the year. Technology strong, new products both MX and PTX routing products are performing very well. So I like the trends that we're seeing in SP all up, certainly a great start of the year. There are a lot of dynamics around the second half of the year supply being one element of that dynamic that we just have to keep a watchful eye on. And all of that has been into the outlook that we provided for the SP segment. Ken, you want for?
Ken Miller: Yes, I would just reiterate that supply constraints are factored into our full year guide. To your point, Joe, the full-year guide is unchanged. We are seeing stronger-than-expected bookings. So the momentum is quite strong, that's resulting in improved visibility, improved backlog levels. That said, because of the supply constraints, we feel at this time keeping the guide kind of where it was on a full-year basis is the most prudent thing to do. That visibility and increased backlog will ultimately result in revenue for us, but at this point we see that perhaps beyond this year.
Joseph Cardoso: Got it. Appreciate the color. And then my second question is on the supply shortages. Given that the supply shortages appear to be here today for a couple of quarters, curious to hear if you guys are pulling on any levers to offset it like price increases or if you plan on passing on any pricing to customers and whether any of that is baked into the better top line we're seeing here.
Rami Rahim: Yes, so we have recently adjusted some price -- list price and changes for our products. We do that periodically. We did a pretty significant uplift in many of our products in the Q2 time frame. That will take some time to play through. As you know, we do have a fair amount of backlog that was on previous pricing levels, but still need to kind of ship. But as we continue to increase our bookings going forward, we should see a positive impact from our recent pricing changes. It wasn't across the board for all products, but it was a good percentage of our products in an attempt to offset some of the pressures we're seeing but it will play out over a fair period of time. Something we do periodically, making sure we have the right price for the right value that we deliver to our customers is something we're very focused on and something that we expect to play out in the form of improved profitability over time. It didn't have an impact on Q2 results, the price change came towards the end of the second quarter and really will play out over the next several quarters rather than have any impact on Q2.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Kvaal with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.
Jeff Kvaal: Thank you. I was hoping to unpack the gross margin dynamics a little bit. It sounds as though we should be thinking 59.5% for the third quarter and fourth quarter. At the same time, it also sounded like the intensity of the supply constraints was most acute in the third quarter. So maybe little pricing increase plus [indiscernible] just mean that higher volume in the fourth quarter ought to be higher?
Ken Miller: Yes, so Q3, we definitely think that supply constraints are particularly tight, and we mentioned that on the prepared remarks and obviously factor that into our guidance. Both our top line guidance as well as our gross margin guidance. Q4, while we haven't given specific Q4 gross margin guidance, we have provided the full year and I think your math is pretty directionally correct where it applies somewhat flattish Q4 as compared to Q3. That said, it's a little bit too early to call with any more specificity than that. We do expect the volume to be up. Our software mix should be up, which would be obviously tailwinds and potentially positive drivers to gross margin improvement, potential gross margin improvement. However, given the supply dynamics and the quite honestly the unknown aspects as we continue to work through this, we think it's prudent to kind of keep the guidance where we have it on a full year basis.
Jeff Kvaal: Okay, thank you. And my second question would be on the visibility that you have. It's nice to be in a position having a little bit additional visibility than usual. On the other hand, that invites questions like this one. How durable do you think the relative strength in your revenues are for this year? And these trends that should persist into 2022 and beyond, or do you think that this is a little bit of a cyclical uptick for us all?
Rami Rahim: Yes, let me start. It's a good question. We're entering the second half of this year with really strong momentum. What I like about this momentum is that it is really diverse. It cuts across geos. It cuts across our Customer Solutions. It cuts across the vertical segments. So we're firing on all cylinders on that front. There is definitely a COVID related element where customers are, let's say, making sure that they're getting ahead of potential supply constraints. But even factoring that out, we're seeing very solid order momentum with new projects that are starting, old projects that were paused that are starting to resume again, the need to build out capacity to keep ahead of customer demands on the network are all coming to fruition. I think we're executing well, so we're essentially setting ourselves up to benefit from that recovery in the markets. So, those -- that improved market condition to something that I think is going to be very good for us going forward. I don't think this -- the demand strength is not a short-lived thing from my perspective. I have confidence that the combination of market dynamics and our own execution, product differentiation, go-to-market strength is all going to work for us on a sustainable basis.
Ken Miller: Yes. And from a revenue perspective, I would say that our durability for revenue growth is actually having a stronger belief that that's going to happen, then I would have had to say a few quarters ago given the bookings that we saw. So clearly the booking strength in the first half is setting us up well with an increased backlog, increased visibility in second half, which gives me confidence that our revenue strength that we've seen in the first half of 8% growth is going to result in a very solid year. We've raised the year now to 6% on a full-year basis, the second time this year since February that we've raised the full-year guidance on the revenue side, and part of that confidence is the strength we're seeing and the momentum that we have pretty much across the board.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Bala Reddy: Hi, this is Bala Reddy on for Rod. Thanks for taking my questions. Firstly, congrats on good quarter and guide here. I don't think we touched on geography here. Now EMEA has been strong the last year quarters, but if you look at Americas the number is -- the number looks good here. Could you may be tie this thing to different verticals and see if we are expecting to see an improvement in, let's say, Service Provider because of the stronger Telco CapEx guidance? And I have a follow-up.
Rami Rahim: Yes, thanks for the question. So the strength that we've seen in Q2 is broad based. It cuts across every geography. The Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific. You're right. EMEA has been especially strong, growing 10% year-over-year in the Q2 time frame and that is true -- we saw growth across all verticals and all solution areas in EMEA. But even in the Americas, we saw growth in every vertical and we saw special strength in Data Center opportunities and the AI driven enterprise opportunities across those verticals. And in Asia Pacific, I think we are executing extremely well there as well with growth in the Cloud vertical, in the Enterprise, and strength in Data Center, AI driven enterprise solutions. So I'm very encouraged, as I just mentioned earlier, with the diversity of the strength that we're seeing across geographies. There is definitely a market dynamic where things are working to our favor, but I think there's a result of this -- the fact that we are executing extremely well to capture that market opportunity.
Bala Reddy: Okay. Secondly on the natural opportunity in Service Provider. So if we talk about ACX new products and looks like there are more products that you plan to launch in the near term. Could you talk about the interest levels that you are seeing there? I know this is [indiscernible] opportunities in Italy new for Juniper. So could you maybe give some more insight on the past? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Yes, absolutely. I'm quite frankly very excited about the Metro opportunity and the solutions that we're bringing to market today. We already have elements of that solution or available shipping with very solid early entrant. Despite the fact that the solution is not really fully complete we plan to round out that solution over the next year, year and a half or so with more and more products that will enter into the market. I think we're laying the foundation with Metro this year for growth next year. So this would be a growth vector within the automated WAN and especially in the Service Provider segment for next year. And again there is a very important elements of our automated WAN solution that is software, and this is where our Paragon automation suite comes into the picture. We've recently rounded out that solution, introduced new capabilities into the market and actually won a competitive win with a Tier 1 telecom operator in Asia Pacific just recently in fact, which I think speaks volumes to the strength of that software solution that we now have in the market and will only get stronger in time. So the net of it is, I think it's going to be a wonderful opportunity for us and I'm quite bullish about it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.
Irvin Liu: Hi, thanks. This is Irvin Liu on for Amit. I also had a question and a follow up. And on the topic of the constraint semiconductor supply environment, I was wondering if you can perhaps quantify what sort of impact this had on your Q2 revenue and on your forward revenue guidance as well? Essentially, if supply shortages impact your ability to fulfill orders. And from a gross margin perspective, do you see supply headwinds improving or deteriorating versus the 50 basis point headwind you saw in June?
Rami Rahim: Yes, maybe I'll start and then Ken you can talk a little bit about what color we can provide in terms of quantification. It's clearly a worldwide shortage. It's affecting many industries, not just IT and networking. It has resulted in extended lead times, but quite frankly all of our customers have now come to expect these challenges and as a result of that they providing us with much better visibility into their future purchasing and that's a very good trend for us quite frankly, especially in this constrained environment. And I -- just while I have you. Our supply chain team has been doing a phenomenal job, all things considered, navigating these challenges which change from a month over month to week over-week basis sometimes in terms of where those constraints are. And I personally have been very much involved in trying to alleviate challenges by working with our strategic partners. And I'll let Ken there start from there.
Ken Miller: Yes, so from a revenue perspective, I don't believe it impacted our Q2 results materially. We're very pleased with the results we posted of $1.172 billion, which is towards the high end of our range. Obviously, the profitability metrics were also quite strong in Q2. So I don't believe it had an impact on our future results. That said, it is something we're considering as we set the guidance for Q3 and the rest of the year. We did increase the full year revenue guidance again for the second time this year up to 6% full year year-on-year growth and previously we were at 4% to 5%. So we are able to secure the supply, at least we believe we'll be able to secure the supply to go ahead and increase our revenue guidance. So it's not impacting us very negatively. However, it is part of that guide. We are definitely considering our ability to secure supply when we set our forward guidance. From a gross margin perspective, what's happening as we talked on the last call, at this point in time we clearly knew it on the last call that there were going to be some pressures because of supply constraints. But we also expected at that time to have some alleviating pressures coming back towards from the COVID perspective. So we were expecting some reduction in freight cost towards the second half of the year. Our current expectation does not call for that anymore. So we're seeing freight costs remain elevated throughout the rest of the year. That's our current anticipation. That coupled with the increased component costs that we're seeing and the expedite fees, et cetera has resulted in us bringing the full year guide down from 60% to 59.5%. So, I do believe these are temporary transitory costs if you will. they should -- we should recover from these. That said, I do think it will take at least a few quarters, right? It's not something I anticipate recovering from in the quarter or next or, but I do think we will recover this in the longer term and allow us to expand our gross margins and operating profits even more robustly than this year's level where we do expect some operating margin expansion, as well as earnings growth to be faster revenue. So we -- the profitability metrics are quite strong this year despite these pressures, as these pressures alleviate they just allow us to double down on our profitability goals.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Long with Barclays. Please proceed.
Tim Long: Thank you, and two if I could as well. First, I did want to go back to the kind of this Q4 implied revenue guidance. I understand the supply chain impacts, but it does seem like you guys were able to kind of beat numbers on the top line the last two quarters. So you were able to fight through that somewhat. Sounds like you have supply for the year and clearly the orders are there. So maybe what's changing with the ability to continue with mid-single or mid to high single-digit growth in Q4 compared to what you were able to do in the prior two quarters? And then secondly, if we could just dig a little bit more into the enterprise. Rami, you talked about the million dollar deals. Can you just give us an update there? Maybe scale that a little bit, talk a little bit about win rates and where you are with salesforce. Is this more to grow from here or is it also getting more at-bats? If you can give us an update on Enterprise. Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Yes, maybe I'll start with the second question first and then Ken I'll pass it to you to talk a little bit more about the supply chain related question. So, Enterprise, I'm very pleased with our performance and we have been doing well, performing well through -- from of the beginning of the onset of the pandemic despite end market disruptions that our industry has faced. There is no doubt the economic uncertainty as a result of COVID persists, but it's getting better and elements of the Enterprise market that have essentially shut down. Like take for example, traditional [ph]carpeted enterprise are starting to recover again and projects are starting to emerge and that will open up net new opportunities for us and it's a good time because our differentiation in this space has never been better, quite frankly. We're seeing great growth in the AI-driven enterprise, of course missed being a very important component of that. But I also want to emphasize that there is another leg to the Enterprise stool and that is Data Center. Now we've always done quite well in the Data Center space and the Enterprise, but I think now with the addition of the Astra Team, the technology, we've created some real lift to our solution to the differentiation in that space. So, from a Mist standpoint, the phenomenal growth and momentum just continues. Mist Solutions revenue which includes wireless, it includes wired, it includes software, grew at nearly 2X year-over-year. If you think about Mist all up in terms of annualized order run rate, we are now over $400 million. So, it's a pretty significant component of the total Juniper business. And then add to that, although it's early days with Astra, the initial feedback from customers, the initial win rate has exceeded our expectations and quite frankly the pipeline that we've built has been absolutely phenomenal. So, I think that Astra and the Data Center opportunities have a lot of the early signals that we got from Mist shortly after we made that acquisition in 2019.
Ken Miller: Yes. And on the Q4 guide perspective. as you mentioned, Tim, we had a very solid first half, Beat our midpoint of guidance, both in Q1 and Q2, raised guidance in Q2, and raised again in Q3 here on this call and raised the full-year at 6%. So we're pleased with the execution and the momentum we're seeing on the revenue side. That said, supply constraints are tighter now than they were in the first half. A lot of this has to do with our own inventory levels. And clearly we were anticipating some of the shortages and some of the buffer stock, some of the redundancy efforts we put into place starting last year, really helped us in the first half and they're going to continue to help us in the second half. However, material is getting tighter. So it is something that's going to impact us a bit and we wanted to make sure we factor that into our second half guide, which again is up from where we were earlier in the year and on a full year basis and Q3. So, I'm pretty pleased with the result. And I think given the strength of the bookings and the backlog we build, not only are we set up for a good second half, a good full year FY21, but it is likely to leak into FY22 as well. So, I think it gives us a good head start, this bookings growth that we're seeing and the momentum that we have now, there's a line for a solid 6% revenue growth, well above our at least low single-digit guidance range for this year and actually sets us up pretty favorably as we enter into 2022.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Alex Henderson with Needham. Please proceed.
Alex Henderson: Hi, thank you very much. I wanted to clarify a few things. You just stated the earlier question that you didn't see any impact to your numbers from the supply chain. And I think that that's kind of a misstatement. Clearly you did, but it may have been in line with what you had expected. Therefore, you're saying we didn't see a variance from our expectations. And I don't think that was the question that was asked. I think the question was asked was if you had no supply constraints, how much impact would it -- how much larger would the revenues have been? So could you clarify that point because I think you're answering a different question than what he was asking and what analysts probably heard relative to that key question. The other thing I wanted to clarify is you give growth rates in software, both in revenues and ARR, you also gave revenue growth in security products. Can you give us what the organic growth rates were on those two? Thanks.
Ken Miller: Yes, I'll take this one. So from a -- yes, just to clarify. The comment about supply constraints and the impact it had on Q2 was with our own guidance from where we expected the quarter to land. So, we did factor in some supply constraints when we set our Q2 guidance. And you're right in that we -- the quarter played out actually a little bit more favorably than we expected, but largely in line and it didn't negatively impact our ability to hit our results in Q2.  The one area that is impacting the results and we called it out in prepared remarks was in gross margin, which was negatively impacted by about 50 basis points. Gross margin was quite solid above the midpoint of Q2 at 60%, but it would have been 60.5% were it not for some of these transitory costs, both of kind of a carryover from last year's COVID-related freight costs as well as some of the supply constraints that are starting to impact Q2. So, yes, to clarify that, that is what we intended to say. On the organic, we don't break out in organic versus non-organic . I'm trying to understand when you say non-organic, are you really referring to the most recent acquisitions of the last three quarters or so, and I can tell you those are on track. We're very excited about the momentum we're seeing there. We expect them to add a point of revenue growth. So that's is in the $45 million to $50 million area on a full year basis. Those numbers on a quarterly basis aren't that impactful really to our overall software growth and-or our security growth. They're a significant minority as compared to the strength we have on our Security business and our Software business. They are a big part of our future, both Software as well as Security, but to-date the Q2 results were not significantly impacted by those most recent acquisitions. Clearly, if you go back to the Mist acquisition days, there is a significant impact on our growth due to Mist on the Software side in particular, zero impact to Security. But on the Software side, Mist is a big driver for our software business, particularly our Software as a service business, which is embedded in that number.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please proceed.
Simon Leopold: Great, thank you for taking the question. I wanted to first ask about the Cloud vertical in particular and essentially the group that we often refer to as the Tier-2, Tier-3 cloud builders, and just for illustrative purposes, I'm thinking of operators like Oracle and IBM. So not the hyperscalers. I want to confirm first of all that you would put those kinds of operators in your Cloud segment that's not as opposed to the Enterprise or Service Provider segment. And then regardless of where you put them, how do you see that group of the smaller Cloud builders behaving for you? How material are they in your business and how are they spending with you? And then, I've got a follow-up.
Rami Rahim: Sure, Simon. Let me start. So first, we had a phenomenal Cloud quarter in Q2. It was a record quarter for us in that timeframe. Our cloud orders in fact were up over 100% year-over-year. So we're seeing real great strength there and it's broad based. We indicated in the last quarter that there has been a resumption of spend by our largest cloud provider customer that continued into the Q2 timeframe, but it also is true for the rest of the hyperscale customers as well as what we define as cloud majors, so Tier-2, Tier-3 cloud providers where the defined as customers whose businesses depend on deliver -- delivering some sort of cloud services; it continues from there. Momentum and strength double digit, well into double-digit territory in terms of both switching and routing WAN and Data Center. And then 400G wins. the momentum we're seeing in 400G wins across large Tier-1 hyperscale customers, as well as the broader cloud major customers is very, very encouraging. And there I would say that the differentiation that we have introduced into the market with our products across the full stack of technology from our network operating system it's evolved to our silicon technology. We have inserted silicon capabilities that are now in the market that we anticipated would be differentiated, things around security, for example, that have now resulted in wins for us and that gives us a lot of confidence that what we -- the design points that we have chosen that we've decided on, are actually paying off for us. So this is why all up, we're now anticipating that we're going to grow faster than the full year guide that we provided for Cloud provider in the last Analyst Day.
Simon Leopold: Thanks. And then just my follow up is, on the surface the product mix this quarter was unfavorable relative to what we would expect in terms of gross margin. Because normally routing has the better than average gross margin. So I'm -- in managing that you're Software business is contributing more favorably or disproportionately to Data Center and Enterprise segments and that's helping those segments have better gross margin than they have historically. I don't necessarily need some complete breakdown of Software by segment. But could you help us understand the distribution of Software in the reported segments?
Ken Miller: Yes. So, I do -- you are right in that our software mix absolutely did help overall gross margin. Mix is the biggest determinant, product and-or vertical is a highly correlation. However, even within vertical sometimes you might have some customer mix where your more advantage than other periods of time, maybe they're geographic, as an example, where we did have a higher margin and say the US Tier 1s than we might in some parts of Asia as an example. So there is a lot of mix to consider, but generally speaking, you're correct in that the vertical/product mix in aggregate was unfavorable. We offset some of that with some software growth, which is a little more slanted, particularly off box higher margin software is a little more as a percentage a little higher in our Enterprise -- our Cloud Ready Data Center AI driven enterprise businesses than it is our traditional service provider routing domain where we do have a fair amount of software, but it's more on box and as less margin impact overall. So that is part of the mix going forward. And last thing I'd call out Q2, we saw very strong Services gross margin in Q2, which was the primary reason why our gross margin was beyond the midpoint of our guidance. The product margin came in largely in line with our expectations. Even with the mix shift that you're talking about, the Services exceeded our expectations which resulted in the overall increase from mid-point.
Jess Lubert: Operator, we're going to take two more questions.
Operator: Okay. Our next question this is from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Sami Badri: Hi, thank you. The first thing I just wanted to ask was regarding some of the orders that some of your customers are submitting earlier than they normally would, I think you made that comment, Rami. Have most of your customers have been doing this with most of the networking equipment vendor base? And a follow up to that is, is there any optionality the customers have to potentially postpone or full on cancel their order in the event that another vendor is able to deliver on any kind of routing or networking equipment?
Rami Rahim: Yes, hi, Sami. Thanks for the question. I think the first question. sorry, I've already forgotten the first question.
Ken Miller: Are orders getting earlier.
Rami Rahim: Yes. I think very difficult for me to comment on what is -- what our customers are seeing from our peers in the industry. All I know is it's very likely that the demand, sorry the supply constraints and the challenges are broad based. They're felt across our peers, they're felt across the entire industry and many other industries. We have to understand that these supply constraints are very high upstream in the overall supply chain, all the way to the silicon fabrication houses that are around the world. So it's most likely the case that our customers are seeing very similar trends from all of our peers in the industry.
Ken Miller: Yes. And our orders are cancellable. However, most orders would come with cancellation fee if a customer returns to cancel. And I would say that our history of cancellations is extremely low. We're quite confident in the strength of our backlog. We do not expect that cancellation activity to increase in any sort of significant way. And we feel that customers are just giving us advance or giving us better visibility to their true deployment needs as they're aware of our published lead times obviously and they want to make sure they get their orders in our hands in time for us to deliver against those stated goals. So I don't expect there to be any sort of disruption to our backlog or bookings from a cancellation perspective.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Please proceed.
Paul Silverstein: I appreciate you all squeezing me in. A couple clarifications. I apologize if this is repetitive of what's been said before. My line has come in and out. On the pricing, on pricing, any meaningful change, Ken?
Ken Miller: Yes, we did change a fair amount of our products in Q2 time frame, late in Q2, we did increase list prices. I don't want to say across the board, Paul, but in a majority of our products we did see a price increase in Q2. That's going to play out over the next couple quarters, but it is something we did do in Q2.
Paul Silverstein: I appreciate that. And then, Rami, if I understood you correctly, maybe I didn't, but with respect to the web scalers, did I understand you to say that you have product wins with the web scalers? I assume you're talking about other than intra-data center switching, the related question was where they the primary driver, not the only driver of the improved outlook?
Ken Miller: So from a quarter standpoint, I think that the trends and the momentum are broad based, certainly they're very strong in the Cloud provider space. But from an order standpoint, double-digit growth in Service Provider, double-digit growth in Enterprise as well. And then I just provided you with a color of over 100% growth in order in the Cloud Provider segment. So, clearly it's broad based and it's very encouraging and it bodes well for future quarters in terms of revenue. In terms of visibility that we have. You're right, in terms of the specific wins and the use cases within hyperscalers, our wins are WAN an inter data center that is not yet intra data center, although these continue to be opportunities that we pursue. And the rest of the Cloud Provider space, we have wins across the board that include WAN, Data Center Interconnect as well as inside of the Data Center.
Rami Rahim: Okay. So I think that was our last question and maybe I'd like to close with just a couple of thoughts. I'm very encouraged by the momentum in the business. I like the diversity and the strength that we are seeing it speaks to our strategy, it speaks to the smart investments that we're making, it speaks to the strong execution by the team which I'm very proud of. I believe that our end markets are recovering and that we're set up to benefit from that recovery. And I also think that the demand strength that we're building as well as the backlog that we have now allows it -- sets us up to deliver greater improvements in profitability next year, especially as some of the transitory supply chain related costs start to recede. So this remains a very important focus area for myself and my management team. And with that, I just want to thank you all for your time and the confidence in us. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you very much for your participation. Have a great day.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-04-27 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to Juniper Networks First Quarter 2021 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn this conference over to your host Mr. Jess Lubert, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. You may begin.
Jess Lubert: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to our first quarter 2021 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today’s call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results might differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-K, the press release and CFO commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today and Juniper undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the Company’s financial results is included in today’s press release. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami.
Rami Rahim: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today’s call to discuss our Q1 2021 results. We delivered strong results during the March quarter. Revenue exceeded our expectation, and we experienced year-over-year growth across all verticals and geographies. Product orders experienced mid-teens growth year-over-year, and we grew backlog on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. Momentum was especially strong in our Cloud and Enterprise verticals with Cloud orders growing nearly 30% year-over-year, and Enterprise orders growing more than 20% year-over-year. While our Service Provider orders slightly declined year-over-year, even here the results exceeded our expectations. Near-term visibility is strong, and given the momentum we’re seeing, we now expect to grow our business 4% to 5% in 2021 on a full year basis. The success we’re seeing is due in large part to deliberate actions we have taken to both strengthen our portfolio and enhance our go-to-market organization. Our focus on leading the industry is delivering simplified operations and a superior end user experience, what we call Experience-First Networking is resonating in the market. And our deliberate focus on specific customer solutions is enabling us to accelerate our success across the areas we serve. We’re seeing good early interest in Apstra, 128 Technology and Netrounds, which are not only strengthening our position in several attractive end markets, but also enhancing the success of the broader Juniper portfolio. Our go-to-market organization is executing well and the investments we’ve made over the last few years are paying off in the form of improved productivity and customer diversity. We’re continuing to invest in both product differentiation and our go-to-market organization. I remain confident these actions will not only position us to benefit from a any potential improvements in end market conditions, but also to capture share as several large industry transitions unfold. There are several opportunities that are beginning to play out, where we feel strong about our position. First, the enterprise transition to AI-driven cloud operations, where our Mist AI offering, which was enhanced by the acquisition of 128 Technology, helps customer streamline operations, reduce costs and optimize end user experiences. This client-to-cloud differentiation is truly resonating. We believe the enterprise transition to AI-driven cloud architecture is likely to present a significant disruptive force in the campus and branch networking market, where we maintain significant sustainable advantages over all competitive platforms. Second is the Cloud and Service Provider transition to 400-gig systems, where we’re continuing to see success, both in wide area as well as data center use cases. Our 400-gig solutions are highly competitive, and we remain optimistic in our ability to not only protect our footprint, but also to capture net new opportunities in hyperscale, cloud major and Service Provider accounts. Last but not least, the Service Provider 5G and metro markets, which we view as a large opportunity, that is likely to see healthy growth over the next several years. We are playing to win in the Service Provider vertical and believe our investments in automation technologies, such as Netrounds and the introduction of new metro-oriented solution such as the award winning ACX7100 family should position us to gain share in this attractive portion of the market, where historically we’ve had limited presence. I firmly believe we’re taking share and that the investments we’re making will position us not only capitalize on the big market opportunities that will unfold over the next few years, but also to see broader market success that decreases our sensitivity to macro trends. We believe our plans will enable us to emerge from the pandemic stronger than we entered, and deliver sustainable top and bottom line growth over the next several years. Now I’d like to provide some additional insight into the quarter and address some of the key developments we’re seeing from a customer solutions perspective. Starting with our automated WAN solution, which saw strong double-digit revenue growth year-over-year, and exceeded our own expectations in Q1. We experienced strength with both our Service Provider and Cloud customers, each of which delivered double-digit sales growth year-over-year. We grew in all geographies year-over-year, and momentum is healthy entering the June period. In the Service Provider vertical, our diversification strategy is continuing to yield positive results, and we remain optimistic regarding the outlook for our cloud network offering, which combined our new ACX product with our Paragon Automation portfolio. We believe these solutions are highly competitive and well-positioned to win in one of the fastest growing portion of the Service Provider routing market. As I mentioned previously, we are playing to win in the Service Provider market, and I remain optimistic regarding the outlook for our automated WAN solutions in this important vertical. I’d also like to highlight that our automated WAN portfolio had particularly strong orders from our cloud customers in Q1. While our strength was across multiple hyperscale accounts, we also saw improved activity with our largest cloud customer following several quarters of softer demand. Our cloud pipeline remains strong, but we are optimistic regarding the outlook for our wide area solutions, particularly in areas where we maintain incumbency, and are well-positioned to benefit from forming a big tailwind, that are likely to start ramping later this year. And for the year, we are confident in our outlook for our automated WAN solution, we expect 2021 results to be slightly above the high-end of the long-term forecast range we provided at our February Investor Day, calling for a 1% decline to 3% growth. While our cloud-ready data center solutions declined 10% year-over-year during Q1, orders grew nearly 30% year-over-year due to broad based strength across our Cloud, Enterprise and Service Provider customers. Win rate improved and we saw a material increase in average deal size in the quarter. Apstra exceeded our expectation, and is already enabling us to win data center opportunity we likely wouldn’t have been able to secure if we hadn’t completed the deal in January. Customer interest in our cloud-ready data center portfolio is high, and we remain optimistic regarding the outlook for this business. While the Q1 revenue decline in our cloud-ready data center business was almost entirely due to expected weakness at a single large customer, orders with this customer also materially improved in the quarter and should positively impact results in future periods. For the year, we believe our cloud-ready data center business remains on track to achieve the long-term forecast range we highlighted at our Investor Day, looking for 5% to 9% growth, despite the slow revenue start to the year. Finally, our AI-driven enterprise solution experienced double-digit growth year-over-year, and exceeded expectations in the March quarter. Our Mist AI differentiation continued to resonate in the market as new logos nearly doubled in Q1 and Mist orders experienced another quarter of triple-digit growth with a record number of deals greater than $1 million. Our Mist client business of wireless LAN, wired access,, Marvis Virtual Network Assistant and associated EX pull-through approximately doubled year-over-year, and we saw record EX pull through in Q1. In addition to strength with large Fortune 500 customers, we’re also experiencing continued strength in the channel and improved momentum with smaller commercial accounts, which highlights the value of our AI-driven enterprise offering to customers of all sizes and across all verticals. We believe Mist AI continues to offer unique and market leading differentiation, resulting in the best user and operator experiences. To enhance this leadership, we continue to bring new innovations to market that should further accelerate our success in future periods. Some of the innovation we’ve recently announced include the industry-first campus switch that’s optimized for AI-driven cloud operation, the EX4400, which provides customers with ease of set up, best-in-class fabric management, security, scale and AI-driven troubleshooting to find needle-in-haystack problem like misconfigured VLANs and bad cables. Add to that, the Mist-ification of our SRX branch gateway, which allows automated on-boarding and configuration using Mist AI and the cloud coupled with simple SD branch router and security configuration via the same platform as wired and wireless access. And the integration of 128 Technology’s Session Smart routing with Mist WAN Assurance and Virtual Network Assistant capability to deliver the industry’s first AI-driven SD-WAN solution, which includes customizable service level and proactive problem resolution on top of the already unique Session Smart capabilities of Juniper’s SD-WAN solutions. While it remains early, we’re seeing strong customer interest in 128 Technology’s Session Smart routing capabilities in the field. We closed multi-million dollar deals with managed service providers in Europe and LATAM, had a significant expansion with a large global enterprise and won opportunities in the U.S. federal vertical. We are excited about our Mist-ification of 128 Technology and are focusing our attention on sales enablement and leveraging the Juniper go-to-market organization to accelerate 128 Technology’s success. I remain encouraged by the momentum we’re seeing in this business and remain confident our AI-driven enterprise solutions are likely to see double-digit growth in 2021. Our Security revenue experienced strong results during the March quarter and orders exceeded expectations in the period. Strength was especially notable in the high-end of the market, although we saw growth across all customer verticals and product families. We believe our Connected Security strategy is resonating in the market and that the convergence of networking and security provides us with a competitive advantage in the portions of the market, where we are currently focused. We’re also benefiting from recent third-party validation, highlighting the superior efficacy of our products from reputable firms such as Gartner’s ICSA and cyber ratings. We believe these dynamics will continue to provide tailwinds in future quarters and should enable us to grow our security business during the current year. Our software and related services revenue grew 7% in the March quarter. A strong growth in our ratable subscription offering such as Mist and healthy uptake of our Flex on-box software offerings were partially offset by lower sales of certain older products that carry a high level of perpetual software. ARR grew 28% year-over-year in the period driven by a combination of Mist subscription, ratable security software offering and the related services associated with these software offering. Software orders were particularly strong in the quarter, rising more than 70% on a year-over-year basis due to broad-based strength across verticals and used cases. We’re seeing ongoing strength in the ratable subscription offering and improved adoption of our on-box Flex licenses, which are seeing traction across all of the customer verticals we serve. Based on the momentum we’re seeing, we remain optimistic regarding the outlook for our overall software business as well as the long-term ARR target we presented at our recent Investor Day. I would like to mention that our services team delivered another solid quarter and continue to grow on a year-over-year basis due to strong renewals and service attach rates. Our services team continues to execute extremely well to ensure our customers receive an excellent experience. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper, and I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail.
Ken Miller: Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon everyone. I will start by discussing our first quarter results and end with some color on our outlook. We ended the first quarter of 2021 at $1,074 million in revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.30, both above the mid-point of our guidance. Revenue was up 8% year-over-year, with growth across all verticals and geographies. Looking at our revenue by vertical, on a year-over-year basis, Service Provider grew 17%, Cloud grew 3% and Enterprise grew 1%. As expected, all verticals declined on a sequential basis. Orders were strong in the first quarter, with growth in the mid-teens on a year-over-year basis, with particular strength in our Cloud and Enterprise verticals. As we discussed at our Investor Day in February, this is the first quarter of our updated revenue reporting, pivoting from technology categories to customer solutions. The customer solution categories are automated WAN solutions, cloud-ready data center and AI-driven enterprise. As we have discussed, this change better aligns our revenue reporting to key growth drivers that is aligned with our strategy. Looking at revenue by customer solution, automated WAN solutions increased 22% year-over-year, with both MX and PTX product families posting year-over-year growth. Cloud-ready data center revenue decreased 10% year-over-year, while the timing of shipments impacted revenue results, order saw strong growth in the quarter. And finally, the AI-driven enterprise revenue increased 12% versus last year. Our Mist and EX product family both grew year-over-year. As Rami mentioned, total software and related services revenue was $143 million, an increase of 7% year-over-year. And our annual recurring revenue or ARR grew 28% year-over-year. Total security revenue, which includes security products as well as services related to our security solutions, was $163 million, an increase of 11% year-over-year. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, five were Cloud, four were Service Provider and one was an Enterprise. Our top 10 customers accounted for 31% of our total revenue as compared to 33% in Q1 2020. Non-GAAP gross margin was 59.3%, which was above the mid-point of our guidance, primarily due to higher revenue. If it weren’t for the pandemic-related elevated logistics and other supply chain related costs, we would have posted non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 60%. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 3% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, in line with our guidance range. Non-GAAP operating margin was 12.1% for the quarter, which exceeded our expectations. We exited the quarter with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $1.8 billion. The sequential decline was primarily due to the repurchase of our remaining debt that was refinanced last quarter and the cash outflows associated with the acquisition of Apstra. Cash flow from operations was $180 million. From a capital return perspective, we paid $65 million in dividend, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share, and repurchased $125 million worth of shares in the first quarter. Turning to our guidance. As I’m sure you are aware, there is a worldwide shortage of semiconductors impacting many industries. Similar to others, we are experiencing ongoing supply constraints, which have resulted in extended lead times. We have invested to strengthen our supply chain and have increased inventory levels over the course of the last year. We continue to work closely with our suppliers to further enhance our resiliency and mitigate disruptions outside of our control. Despite these actions, we believe extended lead times will likely persist for the next few quarters. While the situation is dynamic, at this point in time, we believe we will have access to sufficient semiconductors supply to meet our full year financial forecast. Looking specifically at the second quarter, at the mid-point of guidance, revenue is expected to be up 5% year-over-year. We expect to see sequential growth across our Cloud and Enterprise verticals, while Service Provider is expected to remain approximately flat. We expect our second quarter non-GAAP gross margins to benefit from higher volume and incremental software mix, which should more than offset unfavorable product mix trends and potentially higher component costs related to supply constraints. We expect non-GAAP operating expense to increase sequentially, primarily due to the investments we are making to take advantage of future market opportunities. Moving on to our expectations for 2021. We have updated our full year revenue growth and profitability expectations to account for the upside we expect to experience in the first half of 2021. We now expect full year revenue growth of approximately 4% to 5%, a point of which is expected to come from recently acquired assets. Our revised top line outlook is 100 basis points higher than our previous expectation of 3% to 4%. From a vertical perspective for 2021, Enterprise revenue is expected to grow the fastest, Cloud is expected to grow toward the high-end of our long-term model range, and Service Provider is now expected to be flat to slightly up versus last year. At this time, our revenue and non-GAAP earnings expectations remain unchanged for the second half of the year relative to the forecast we provided during our Q4 2020 earnings call. While non-GAAP gross margin can be difficult to predict, we continue to expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 60%, consistent with what we’ve said on our Q4 2020 earnings call, as well as at our February 2021 Investor Day. We expect full-year non-GAAP gross margin to benefit from higher volume, improved service margin and incremental software mix, which should more than offset unfavorable product mix trends and potentially higher component costs related to supply constraints. Full year non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be flat to slightly up versus 2020 levels. We expect non-GAAP OI&E to remain near Q2 2021 levels through the course of the year. In closing, I’d like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper’s success, especially in this challenging environment. Now I’d like to open the call for questions.
Operator: At this time, we’ll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question.
Rod Hall: Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for the questions. I guess, I wanted to dig into this order volume in a couple of ways. One, maybe, Ken, you could talk about book-to-bill or could you give us a book-to-bill number? And then secondly, more qualitatively, the software orders that are so strong, could you guys dive into a little bit of color on that, what particular things are driving that? Is it Mist or just give us some prioritization of where those software orders are coming from? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Thanks for the question, Rod. Let me start with the software, and then I’ll pass it over to Ken. So obviously, very pleased with the momentum in our software business, 70% year-over-year growth in orders, particularly pleased with our momentum at 28% year-over-year. So the way we’re running the business right now is we have an intense focus on our customer solutions, AI-driven enterprise, cloud-ready data center, and automated WAN. Each of these solutions has an embedded and a meaningful software component that we have invested in that drive significant differentiation in the market, and that ultimately delivers on our strategy of Experience-First Networking. So you can’t sell an AI-driven enterprise solution without actually also selling a meaningful software component along with it. That is what is driving the momentum especially in off-box software offerings like Mist. And then I know it’s early, but increasingly in solutions like Apstra as well. In addition to that is the Flex licensing model. This is a really simple on-box licensing model that gives customers the flexibility to choose what particular features and scale they want along with the traditional systems that they deploy in their network. So that combination is working very well for us. I feel very good about our ability to achieve our long-term targets that we provided to you in the recent analyst event, and I think we’re going to continue to see good solid momentum in the software space.
Ken Miller: And I’ll just on the software side, we did see very strong bookings growth of 70%-plus. You see revenue was at 7%. The delta there, if it’s not obvious is really mostly in our backlog where we did book some software orders that we haven’t yet shipped or fulfilled, and also there is a growing piece of deferred software revenue, which is actually shows up predominantly in our service deferred revenue. So we are seeing some of the bookings, even when we fulfill it, it doesn’t show up in revenue right away as it gets recognized over time and that’s really our ARR business, which is also a very strong grower for us this quarter. From a book-to-bill perspective, we don’t disclose the number, Rod, but I can tell you, it’s clearly over one. I mean we grew backlog both year-over-year and sequentially. We don’t typically grow backlog sequentially in Q1. This is something that due to the kind of unexpected order strength that we saw, the mid-teens orders growth really resulted in a backlog growth quarter for us, and a book-to-bill greater than one.
Rod Hall: Great. Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.
Rami Rahim: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. You may proceed with your question.
Amit Daryanani: Thanks for taking my question as well. I guess, I have one question and a follow-up. On the Enterprise side, maybe to start with, it appears that your solutions especially wrap with Mist is resonating well with customers, but as I think about the positivity that you have around Enterprise, is only to think about how much of that is really driven by a cyclical up-shift given budget is getting better on the Enterprise side versus perhaps share gain that Juniper seeing versus their incumbents?
Rami Rahim: Yes, Amit, I have no doubt in the Enterprise, we’re taking share and it’s on the back of some really meaningful and differentiated solutions and technologies that we’ve introduced into the market. And in the Enterprise space there might be some COVID related tailwinds in some areas of the Enterprise, but there are a lot of headwinds in certain segments of the Enterprise, and I think the team has done a phenomenal job of pivoting rapidly to focus in areas where the Enterprise spending is going to be more COVID resilient, and then add to that the differentiation that we’ve built, both organically and inorganically. In AI-driven enterprise, we powered by Mist, double-digit growth, pretty much every customer vertical, new logos are growing very rapidly at 2x year-over-year, a record number of million dollar deals. Like I said, I’m very confident that this is share taking growth.
Amit Daryanani: Got it. And then if I could just follow-up on the supply chain side, I think you implied that 70 basis point margin headwind from logistics supply chain issues in the quarter. How do you see that number stack up as you go through the year? And then did you have any revenue that you put on the table into the supply chain issues as well?
Rami Rahim: Before I let Ken answer that specific question, I just want to say, this is a worldwide shortage that’s affecting practically every tech company across all industries. So what Juniper is experiencing, I don’t think is unique. Having said that, I have a lot of confidence in the strength of our supply chain team. I think they are navigating the current situation phenomenally well. And as Ken mentioned in his prepared remarks, we’ve invested in our supply chain, really starting over a year ago, that’s helping us right now. So there is no doubt there are going to be some challenges that we need to work around, but I have a lot of confidence in the strength of the team and the relationships that we have with our suppliers in pulling through this. And Ken, maybe provide some additional color.
Ken Miller: Yes. And as we mentioned, the impact in Q1 was about 70 basis points, and that is predominantly logistics in kind of some of the COVID related costs that we’ve be talking about the last couple of quarters and the freight cost for paying per kilogram are still significantly elevated versus pre-COVID levels. We expect that to be maintained over the next couple of quarters. It is difficult to predict when that’s going to normalize, but I do expect that to normalize eventually, but I do think it’s going to take a few more quarters for that to normalize. In addition to that, we are starting to factor in some potential costs to creep from a component perspective due to the supply constraints that we’ve mentioned before. So we have factored in some costs, component cost to increase into our current forecast. We still believe 60% is the right target for us on a full-year basis for this year, despite some of these incremental costs, but it’s something we’re watching very closely and we’ll obviously be managing it aggressively as we have been, and we’ll continue to keep you guys updated as we go. There is a fair amount of uncertainty there, but based on our current expectations, we feel that the 60% target that we have for the year still holds true. From a revenue loss perspective, we are seeing extended lead times, so that means an order that we would book might not recognize in the same period as it would have otherwise. However, we feel that the revenue results we just posted in Q1, the guidance we just put out there for Q2 are quite strong based on the demand strength that we’re seeing and we feel good about our ability to procure the supply we need to hit our revenue forecast.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. You may proceed with your question.
Simon Leopold: Thank you. I appreciate that. First, I wanted to see if maybe you could unpack your cloud vertical a little bit. And where I’m going with this question is we’ve gotten the impression that you tend to be disproportionately stronger and what’s often called Tier 2, Tier 3 as opposed to hyperscale. Is there some insight you can offer to help us understand the dynamics of maybe breaking up that cloud vertical? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Yes, Simon. Thanks for the question. Our position in the cloud vertical including hyperscale is actually quite unique. The share that we have with hyperscale routing, in particular, is second to none in the industry, I believe. So the strength that we saw in Q1 was actually very broad-based, certainly, hyperscale contributed to that momentum. And the nice thing about the hyperscale momentum that we’re seeing right now is that it’s not just about one or even two accounts, that it’s fairly well distributed, there is good amount of diversification within hyperscale. After that, the cloud majors which are the smaller cloud providers, international cloud providers, they have also contributed to that momentum. So in Q1 we saw double-digit growth in routing, again, based on the footprint that we enjoy. Switching was down, but only because of a particular use case in one customer that essentially a wide area use case. I’ve actually talked about that in the last one or two earnings calls, but I will note here that even in that use case we’ve now started to see a resumption of spend by our large customer that deploys it in this manner. And then orders up 30%, nearly 30% year-over-year, again is indicative of the position that we have. I mean I think the way you should look at cloud providers today is, there is certainly competition that’s happening for future build-out especially 400-gig, I feel very good about the competitive nature of our solutions, the engagement with our cloud provider customers. But I think will bode well for us in the future especially as you get into the second half of this year and next year. But then to benefit from the investments, the hyperscale and the broader cloud major customers have today, you need to have the footprint, and we have the footprint.
Simon Leopold: Thank you.
Ken Miller: And just to…
Simon Leopold: Sorry. Go ahead, Ken.
Ken Miller: Sorry, Simon. I just wanted to clarify in aggregate, so if you look at our cloud vertical in aggregate, our hyperscale number is the larger piece, it’s bigger than our Tier 2, Tier 3, our cloud majors piece. But it is predominantly as Rami mentioned, it’s the wide area networking use cases are routing footprint that we’ve enjoyed there for so many years, where we’re seeing growth on the cloud majors of the Tier 2, Tier 3 side is really in the data center side. And that’s where we’re seeing more mix toward switching in the cloud-ready data center solutions to the Tier 2, Tier 3 and we’re obviously kind of break into the hyperscale and data center side. But right now, our footprint is predominantly on the automated WAN solutions.
Simon Leopold: Great. Appreciate that. Just as my follow-up. I wanted to see if we could talk a little bit about your intentions in terms of market share on the enterprise campus both switching and wireless LAN. What’s a realistic expectation for how many points of market share? Do you think you could take in a year? And what’s your objective. Do you – is your sort of goal to get to a 10% level in some time, help us understand the milestones we should look forward? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Yes. Well, I think we’re focusing on areas of the campus and branch market that are fastest-growing that I think we’ll see the quickest recovery post-COVID. And even now, where there are some meaningful headwinds in certain segments of the enterprise, because of COVID, we’re doing really well. And I think, again this is on as a result of the significant differentiation that we have in the market. And I would also just add that, that differentiation is very difficult to replicate. I mean, we now have a five years of AI-driven solution building and learning that happened in the market, that’s given our capabilities really some solid differentiation. And this is going to be the fastest growing vertical for Juniper, enterprise all up and campus is a very significant component of the enterprise. And as a result of that, we have been taking share over the last several years and I think we’re going to continue to take meaningful share going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan. You may proceed with your question.
Joe Cardoso: Hi, this is Joe Cardoso on for Samik Chatterjee. My first question is just on the Service Provider vertical, it’s sounding much better than when you guys last spoke on it. So first of all, is that a fair comment, and if so can you help us understand what is driving the improved outlook and visibility there?
Rami Rahim: Yes, I’d be happy to. So obviously delighted with the Service Provider momentum in Q1, strong revenue performance, now partially explained by a need to compare relative to last year, but I would say that it did exceed our expectations, including from an order standpoint. And what I really like about our performance in the Service Provider space is the diversity, both from the standpoint of geography, that is not a North America phenomenon or a European phenomenon. It’s broad-based across every geography, the diversity of solutions and technologies, so we’re seeing strength in routing as you would expect, but we’re also seeing strength in security as Service Provider gear up for 5G deployments; platforms, MX has always been a workhorse in the Service Provider space and we continue to invest in new line cards, new software capabilities, but we’re starting to see some good PTX momentum and solid 400-gig wins in competitive bids with the Service Provider. And last but not least, I will add that. Tier 1 spending – Tier 1 U.S. Service Provider spending has actually been weak over the last year or so as we’ve outlined in previous earnings call or calls. But we’ve actually seen a bit more, let’s say, signs of life or resumption in spending by some Tier 1 operators as well which is encouraging. Add to that the differentiation, we’ve introduced the system in the Q1 time frame, our Paragon Automation suite and this really addresses a real need in the market for the types of tools that customers are looking for, for planning and provisioning and insights and assurance. And then, we also launched our cloud metro strategy, which is really our big push into the metro space, and announced two new ACX metro platforms and that we shipped, one of them already ACX7100, which is a 5G ready, high density, high capacity solution to address the future of 5G metro build-outs, and that’s a net new opportunity for Juniper, that we traditionally not had any meaningful presence here, but we expect that to contribute to our revenue performance over the next few years. So it’s for that reason that we’re now tracking up to the high end of our long-term model for this full year 2021.
Ken Miller: Yes, Joe. As you heard in our prepared remarks, we did bring the full year outlook up from a revenue perspective, it was 3% to 4% earlier in the year now, we’re up of 4% to 5% on a full year basis. The vertical that actually came up the most was our Service Provider vertical. We were talking before about it being further stabilization. If you recall 2020, we were down 4% a full year basis and we thought we would get closer to zero this year from negative four to something closer to zero that’s the further stabilization. We’re now calling a SP based on the strength of the first half to be flat to slightly up on a full year basis, which as Rami mentioned is more in line with our long-term model, actually the high end of our long-term model, whereas previously we were kind of tracking toward the low end. So we are seeing some strength in SP, particularly here in the first half.
Joe Cardoso: Thanks, guys. Appreciate the color on that. And then my second question is just on the acquisitions. You spent a lot of time in the prepared remarks, highlighting the different acquisitions you recently completed in contributing the better outlook in part due to them. I guess, just kind of diving in there, is there a particular acquisition that you guys would highlight driving the better outlook or has it been more broad-based? Any color would be appreciated. Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Yes, well. So we recently crossed the two-year anniversary since the close of Mist and that continues to do phenomenally well for us, and Mist is no longer a WiFi solution, Mist is an architectural approach that cloud-delivered AI-powered solution to everything from client to cloud and what we’re seeing is the business all up under the Mist umbrella, doing incredibly well, right. Like I said, doubling new logos, record number of million dollar deals, et cetera. The other acquisitions are still a little bit newer, so it’s still earlier. But I’m very encouraged, based on what I’m seeing thus far. Apstra, as an example has seen early interest from many customers. The pipeline is very solid. And it’s clear that there are many customers out there that are looking for the ability to deploy private cloud, but are fearful of the operational complexity of private cloud, and Apstra provides the best solution that’s truly multi-vendor. So it’s not just working on top of Juniper underlay, but any vendors underlay solution to provide that seamless, easy, intent-based private cloud experience. There is a need in the market, and I firmly believe we have the best technology for it right now. 128 Technology, again there the Mist-ification of that technology, under the Mist umbrella is happening very rapidly. So we’re introducing more and more capabilities. The second half of the year is going to be really important for ramping up that solution, but even on a stand-alone basis, we’re closing multi-million dollar deals with managed service providers. We’re seeing expansions of existing franchises that we have with 128 Technology. Federal government is especially interested in the security aspects of 128 Technology. So even though it’s early, I’m actually quite optimistic about what we’re seeing thus far.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. You may proceed with your question.
Jake Wilhelm: Hi, this is Jake Wilhelm on for Aaron. First of all, congrats on a great quarter. I was wondering, if you could talk a little bit about your visibility into your customers inventory levels? And maybe how that has changed?
Ken Miller: I’m sorry, you broke up a little bit there, Jake, could you repeat that the question on that…
Jake Wilhelm: Sorry about that. I was wondering if you could talk about visibility into your cloud customers inventory levels and how that has changed?
Rami Rahim: Got it. So yes, I mean with our cloud customers, first the momentum – since the beginning of the year has been phenomenal. It’s always difficult to predict cloud demand on a quarter-by-quarter basis. However, I would say that if you take a look at how their businesses are doing. I haven’t seen the latest headlines today, but I suspect they are doing quite well. And I suspect, they’re going to continue to do quite well and they cannot fuel that business without ongoing investments in their networks. So if the sort of the thrust of the question here is, is there demand that’s happening within the cloud provider space that’s trying to get ahead of some of the supply constraints in the industry? I believe, that yes, there is probably some of that that’s happening right now, but I don’t believe that’s the only thing that’s happening. I think we’ve executed well. We preserved our footprint within the cloud vertical. We’ve engaged as partners to our cloud customers. It’s been broad-based across hyperscale and the cloud majors and it’s for that reason that we now expect the full year in the cloud to be more on the high end of our long-term model.
Ken Miller: Yes. And just as a reminder, we saw bookings growth in the cloud vertical nearly 30%, revenue was at a 3% clip. So clearly we’re building some backlog in the – with the cloud vertical as well. We expect revenue to be up sequentially from a cloud perspective.
Jake Wilhelm: Great, thanks. And then maybe kind of as a follow-up, I know you touched on this a little bit earlier, but could you talk about any inflationary pressures you’re seeing and component pricing?
Ken Miller: Yes. So at this point, it is really difficult to predict. We’re obviously working with our suppliers. We have long-term contracts in many cases, long-term pricing contracts, et cetera. So we’re not expecting it to be, I would say super material. However, we are expecting there to be some impact and we are factoring that into our long-term model at this point. But it is early, it’s something we’re adapting on a regular basis. We do think it could have some impact. It probably will have some impact. We don’t think it’s going to be enough to take us off our full year gross margin target of 60% at this point.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Long with Barclays. You may proceed with your question.
Tim Long: Thank you. Two questions if I could. Rami, maybe you can update us, I think Ken mentioned something about the strength in the cloud vertical and still looking for some of those 400-gig wins in the hyperscalers. So could you kind of update us on progress there, and maybe if you could just work in kind of what you’re seeing across that customer base and the rest of the customer base as far as white boxing as a risk? And then secondly on the Service Provider side, could you talk a little bit about the competitive landscape, obviously Huawei does have some struggles and Nokia seems to be struggling a little bit as well across their businesses. So can you talk about in the context of a favorable industry backdrop, how you see kind of competitive advantages at this point? Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Sure, Tim. So let’s start with the cloud provider space in particular 400-gig. Things are progressing very well and 400-gig I feel increasingly confident that we’re going to be able to win 400-gig footprint and this is a broader market in across both the hyperscale cloud providers, as well as the Tier-2, 3 or the cloud major, cloud providers as well. Now that the competitive solutions are out in the market, the competitive bake-offs are happening, we sort of get a good feel of what’s out there and how the differentiation we had hoped to achieve is actually fairing out with practical testing and I feel good. I mean let’s just say that. We’re winning especially in wide area use cases. And this is across both the hyperscale as well as the smaller cloud provider. And then even in the data center, we’ve one 400-gig data center use cases. We’re not yet ready to announce a hyperscale 400-gig data center win at this point, but we’re going to continue to aggressively go after the full market that’s out there, both wide area and data center. And on the SP competitive front, there – our solutions, our strategy is very much based on the strengths and the merits of our own products, our wide area capabilities, our automation capabilities and I feel very good about that. We’ve listened closely to our customers. We understand what they want. And I think we were delivering solutions and have delivered solutions that addresses their biggest needs and requirements. With Huawei sort of issue that’s out there and whether that presents an opportunity for us? The answer is yes. I think we do see some opportunities right now. The results of some concerns about Huawei, they’re going to sort of play out in time. This is never going to be a sort of an overnight thing, share shift typically happens in time frames of the year, but the good news is, we do see that there are opportunities and customers that are rethinking some of the decisions that they have made in specific geographies around the world.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed with your question.
Meta Marshall: Great, thanks. I just wanted to ask about the security kind of segment that you alluded to, I mean just in – I guess how far integrated or how far down the pipeline, are you in integrating 128 into kind of the portfolio, so that it can be kind of a cross-sell and cross-Mist in the Enterprise portfolio? And then just with the security portfolio have grown year-over-year without the inclusion of 128? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Yes, so let me start and then Ken you can add some more colors on the specific question. So 128 has become an integral part of our AI-driven enterprise strategy, which is really around everything from client to cloud with ease of automation, simplicity of day-to-day provisioning and there is a security architecture element to this, because it provides visibility into applications, it integrates seamlessly with our on-prem security offering. And then over time as we introduce more cloud-based security offerings that will integrate seamlessly with that, and so that has – still early days with 128 Technology. But as I mentioned, the win rate is solid, the customer interest is solid, the pipeline that’s being built is solid. And I have a lot of confidence that it’s going to be a successful acquisition in the long-term.
Ken Miller: Yes. Security all up, which includes products and services grew 11% in the quarter. Products actually grew better more than services, services had modest growth, products actually was driving most of that 11% growth. And yes, it would have grown without 128 T. In fact, all three of the recent acquisitions Apstra, 128 T, as well as a Netrounds, accounted for less than 10% of revenue in the quarter. On track to the full year plan, we expect it to be about a point in aggregate of growth for Juniper. So call it $45 million or so in total revenue for the year. So we’re on track for that although Q1 was less than $10 million as expected.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of George Notter with Jefferies. You may proceed with your question.
George Notter: Hi, guys. Thanks very much. I realize this is probably a relatively small part of your revenue stream, but I wanted to ask about your exposure in the rural broadband market. Obviously, lots and lots of new stimulus dollars coming into that space, certainly needs there, I think in terms of the LAN piece and routing piece. Can you just talk about what percentage of sales might be coming from that end market and how you might see that growing going forward? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Yes, I don’t even know if we have that figure off the top of our head. Maybe Ken can pull something up, but I’ll tell you this, we’ve actually had over the last two years or so as part of the sales restructuring that we did a deliberate focus on Tier 2, Tier 3 service providers with an eye on tapping into some of the broadband sort of rural stimulus dollars that are making their way into the market. So there is no doubt that Biden’s infrastructure deal, if it actually manages to pass, is going to present some opportunities for us. And I think we’re well prepared for it. It really is – it’s not a matter of technology. We’ve got the goods, we’ve got the products, we have the solution. Automation in fact becomes especially important for the rural areas where typically you are going to just have to deal with a lot more density of products in sparse geographical areas, but I think it’s just a matter or sort of seeing the stimulus dollars actually weave their way into actual spending.
Ken Miller: Yes. Unfortunately, we do not break out our business, our automated WAN solutions business in that way. So we can’t share with you the numbers, but as Rami mentioned, we’re focused on diversifying that business. And we’ve seen tremendous success over the last couple of years diversifying and I think we’ll continue to do that going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. You may proceed with your question.
Sami Badri: Hi, thank you for giving me the slot to ask a question. One thing, Ken, I think in your prepared remarks you talked about the cloud growth, and that the new guide, I may have misheard you but you said that the way it’s trending, is coming in at the higher end of your long-term growth model with a cloud customer. And I know you kind of gave some granular data points regarding the revenue outlook and the Service Provider flat to slightly up, kind of I think that was the message. Could you just kind of give us the same kind of dynamic or unpack it for Cloud so to just get a better idea on what that vector looks like as it pertains to the company?
Ken Miller: Yes, absolutely. So at Investor Day, we talked about Cloud, the long-term model for Cloud being plus 1% to 5%, so 1% to 5% growth on a kind of a three-year CAGR basis, our long-term model basis. This year, we actually expect to be the high-end of that range. So we’re thinking closer to their 4% to 5% range, or higher end of that 1% to 5%, based on the strength we’re seeing at the start of the year. Previously for Cloud, our previous guidance for the year was just, it would be growth, right. And now we’re actually quantifying it to the high end of that kind of 1% to 5% range. That’s a change from 90 days ago.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Lloyd with UBS. You may proceed with your question.
David Lloyd: Great. Thanks, guys. And if you guys covered this I apologize. My line went off for a little bit. Can you – Ken, can you kind of touch on the contribution from the acquisitions in the first quarter, and whether that show up, I’m assuming most of it showed up in the Enterprise segment and it sounds like it was somewhere between $5 million and $10 million? And then just a quick follow-up on this weighing out there, but I think about sort of the commentary for the full year guidance, does it imply based on your Cloud and Service Provider commentary that some of the back half of the year. Enterprise revenue growth should be sort of double-digits, that’s sort of what you’re intimating by sort of the guidance that you laid out there? Thanks.
Ken Miller: Yes. So on the acquisition front, I mean we – for Q1, the revenue was less than $10 million in aggregate, in line with our expectations for the quarter. So we’re off to a strong start, but Q1 was less than $10 million. So relatively immaterial, and most of that would have showed up in Enterprise, given the customers, accelerate the products predominantly being cloud-ready data center and AI-driven Enterprise oriented revenue products. We’re still on track for the full year to get to a 1% in aggregate growth across $45 million, give or take for the year, from revenue perspective. And we do think these acquisitions as we said before will be dilutive in FY2021 by about $0.05, and that’s something that we expect to pressure in the second half and actually be accretive here in 2022. So while they are a bit of a drag on overall earnings this year, we expect them to enable us to expand margins in 2022 and beyond. Second part of your question, I’m sorry, one was about the acquisitions. What was the second part of your question?
David Lloyd: When you think about the rest of the guidance, does that imply sort of Enterprise revenue in sort of double digits in the back half of this year, given sort of where Cloud will be in terms of either for the rest of the year?
Ken Miller: Yes, I mean so Enterprise we expect to be our fastest growing vertical. I think if you do the math, you’re going to get to kind of the numbers you’re talking about. We expect it to be our fastest growing vertical. We do believe AI-driven Enterprise will be double-digit growth, cloud-ready data center, we talked about being toward the middle of the long-term model, which is kind of high-single digit growth. And those are predominantly Enterprise, although, we obviously sell those solutions to Service Provider as well as Cloud.
Jess Lubert: Operator, we’ll take two more questions.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson with Needham. You may proceed with your question.
Alex Henderson: Thank you very much. So when you guys start talking about Mist, you spent a fair amount of time talking about how it generates upsell into other products imposed through a multiple of the initial sales over time. I haven’t really heard much update on that. In fact, if anything in the last quarter, it seemed like it had been at the lower end of the multiple benefit. Can you talk a little bit about what kind of upsell you’re seeing and I get it that it’s become an architectural sale, but to what extent there is an upsell around what has traditionally been more standardized products like rackables switches and so forth?
Rami Rahim: Yes, let me start and then maybe Ken you can add some more color. I honestly I’m scratching my head a little bit about where your comments around sort of slowdown. We don’t see anything of that nature in the AI-driven Enterprise where Mist plays. I did mention in my prepared remarks, that if you take a look at orders for Mist all up, that includes all Mist products, right, the wireless, wired switching, associated software capabilities it doubled on a year-over-year basis, and it’s no longer a small business for Juniper, and really it’s now starting to contribute meaningfully. The innovation is phenomenal here. I mean the pace of innovation, we just announced and launched in fact and we’ll ship very shortly, if we haven’t already, a new breed of campus wired switch in the form of EX4400, which is our first true cloud native, Mist-optimized wired switch that’s intended for rapid, fast adoption, zero touch provisioning, all the aspects of the Mist solution that you’ve come to expect and love and their access points now applying to this next generation wired solution, and that’s just us really pouring fuel on the fire of the AI-driven business that is essentially powered entirely by Mist today.
Ken Miller: Yes, I would just add that we mentioned in the prepared remarks that our EX pull-through related to Mist is actually a record in Q1. So we have a lot of EX that we’re selling are because of the Mist kind of solution is actually the all-time high. And we’re obviously continuing to sell more subscriptions as well, and the subscriptions, they don’t show up in revenue right way, obviously they are recognized gradually over time. So a big part of our ARR growth that we mentioned of 28%, is also very much tied to the full Mist solution, not just necessarily the Wi-Fi. So in aggregate we talked about in Investor Day that we think the lifetime value of the kind of the pull-through, if you will, the non-wireless LAN solution is about 2.5 times the Wi-Fi business. So that’s something we’re still in very early innings of that. And we’re still leading largely with Mist itself, and then pulling through the rest of the solution. But as we see the lifetime value and these customers continue to grow with EX and other parts of the portfolio. We feel confident in that kind of 2.5 times ratio that we put out there.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein with Cowen. You may proceed with your question.
Paul Silverstein: Thanks, guys. Appreciate you squeezing me in. Question for Ken or question for Rami or both of you, total gross margin, it sounds, if you already stated this, I apologize, but it from what I read it doesn’t sound like, but it seems your guidance. But if I go back to last quarter, you did sell more constructive looking out beyond this year. Any changes you’re thinking about where gross margin could go and what timeframe?
Ken Miller: So you’re right. We have not changed our guidance for gross margin. We did change our guidance for revenue. We increased it by a point and we’re not bringing gross margin up, and typically you would expect with volume, you would see some increase in gross margin and some of the reason for that Paul, is some of these supply constraints, some of the semiconductor shortages, we are factoring in some incremental costs and quite honestly, there is still some uncertainty there. So I just want to, at this point we’re keeping our margin targets the same. Beyond this year, I think on things we control like software mix and optimization within our services organization, et cetera. I feel very good. That said, some of the things that have less control on whether it be COVID-related freight costs or even some of these semiconductor shortages, it makes it very cloudy. So at this point, we have really no update beyond this year. We expect to be able to manage to the 60% target for this year, but beyond that, really no change to our outlook at this point.
Rami Rahim: And Paul we have...
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen...
Rami Rahim: I think Paul, he had a question for me, but maybe we lost him already.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of today’s question-and-answer session. I would like to turn this call back over for closing remarks. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for participation. Enjoy the rest of your evening.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-01-29 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Juniper Networks Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2020 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Jess Lubert. Thank you, Jeff. You may begin.
Jess Lubert: Thank you operator, good afternoon and welcome to our fourth quarter 2020 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today’s call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results might differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release and CFO commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today and Juniper undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the Company’s financial results is included in today’s press release. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that I will now hand the call over to Rami.
Rami Rahim: Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us on today’s call to discuss our Q4 and full year 2020 results. I hope you and your families are well and my thoughts go out to all those affected by the pandemic. 2020 was an unprecedented year, which presented challenges that none of us could have predicted a year ago, the biggest being the emergence of the global pandemic. This event materially impacted our supply chain, the way we work and collaborate and how we engage with our customers around the world. The pandemic also impacted the health of our customers, employees and people close to us in our personal lives. Despite these challenges, we grew our enterprise business for a fourth consecutive year. We grew our cloud business for a second consecutive year and we made progress stabilizing our service provider business with orders in this vertical growing on a full year basis even though revenue declined. These results were made possible by the efforts of our employees, who have executed exceptionally well and I would like to give a special thanks to all of them for not only enduring but excelling in the face of adversity. We are proud to be one of the key players of the global Internet and the world needed the Internet in 2020 more than ever. We are exiting 2020 following two consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth and entering the new year with good momentum. This is a direct result of the strategic actions we have taken around how we go to market, how we align our business and how we complement our organic business with thoughtful acquisitions such as Mist that create new revenue stream and pull-through sales of our existing products. While these actions should set us up to sustainably grow our business starting this year, I’d like to highlight several key areas of strategic focus where we plan to double down in the New Year, which you’ll hear us talk more about during our upcoming Investor Day event on February 12. First, delivering industry-leading customer experiences through superior technology, engagement, quality and support. While we are entering 2021 with the highest customer satisfaction scores we have ever seen, we view customer experience as our true north and are committed to doing even better. We think delivering superior customer outcomes will enable us to win across all of the markets and verticals we serve. Second, focusing our business on specific use cases, which include the AI-driven enterprise, cloud-ready data centers and automated WAN with connected security embedded in each. These use cases each represent a large opportunity that spans across verticals we serve. Each of these use cases is likely to see attractive market tailwinds over the next several years and focusing our resources on these areas should enable us to accelerate our growth as these opportunities unfold. As I discussed last quarter, we have reorganized our sales, product management and engineering teams around these business opportunities, and we will begin disclosing our revenue mix in this format when we report our Q1 results. Third, capturing the value presented by our recent acquisition and making sure 128 Technology, Apstra and Netrounds deliver similar returns on investment to what we are seeing with Mist, which continues to exceed expectations and it’s positively impacting sales of the broader Juniper portfolio. I’m very encouraged by the early customer interest in each of these transactions, which is building confidence these businesses will positively impact our performance in the future. We firmly believe we are taking share and that the deliberate actions we’ve taken along with some of the investments we have made should position us to not only capitalize on the big market opportunities such as 400 gig and 5G that will unfold over the next few years, but also to see broader market success that decreases our sensitivity to macro trends. We believe our plans will enable us to emerge from the pandemic stronger than we entered and deliver sustainable top and bottom line growth over the next several years even if end market conditions remain challenged. Now, I’d like to provide some additional insight into the quarter and address some of the key developments we are seeing within each of our core market verticals. Starting with enterprise, we delivered record revenue in the December quarter and experienced high single-digit order growth year-over-year, which exceeded our own expectations. While we saw particularly strong demand in the North American market, strength was broad based across geographies and we secured a significant multi-year opportunity with an international global 10 account for our wireless, wired and SDRAM portfolio driven by our Mist AI differentiation. Based on our results, we believe we are taking share and that our enterprise business is likely to be our fastest growth vertical in 2021. Our optimism is fueled by the building customer response to our AI-driven enterprise offerings and specifically the momentum we are seeing around Mist, which saw new logos grow by more than 125% year-over-year and orders increased by nearly 140% year-over-year. In addition to robust wireless growth driven by Mist AI, we experienced strong adoption of our Wired Assurance capabilities and record pull-through of our EX switching portfolio. In total, our current mystified business of Mist Wireless LAN, Wired Assurance, Marvis, virtual network assistant and associated EX pull-through generated more than $150 million worth of revenue in 2020 and we expect to materially grow this business over the next few years. We would also remind you that Mist is a software subscription business with 30% to 35% of each deal recognized ratably generating a healthy deferred revenue stream, which will be recognized in the future. The Mist technology is truly unique and delivers a compelling solution for AI-driven client to cloud operations. Not only does our solution minimize IT costs with proactive automation and self-routing action, but it assures secure user experiences with end-to-end service levels and AI-driven support. This experience-first focus is resonating in the market and is one of the reasons Gartner recently positioned us in the Leaders Quadrant for wired and wireless access where we were named the leader of leaders in terms of ability to execute. The acquisition of 128 Technology represents the next evolution of our AI-driven enterprise vision. 128 Technology will not only enable Juniper to provide a superior application end-user of our SD-WAN experience as compared to all other SD-WAN offerings in the market, but also to extend the value of Mist secure AI engine and cloud management capability from client to cloud. Our service provider segment also exceeded our expectations in Q4 and we have been encouraged to see this business begin to stabilize in 2020 following several difficult years. The improved service provider results we delivered both in Q4 and for the full year 2020 are due in large part to the deliberate diversification efforts we have undertaken, which would enable us to overcome weak spending trends at several of our large U.S. Tier 1 customers. We believe the strength we are seeing with U.S. cable operators and international carriers is likely to continue through the upcoming year and we remain optimistic regarding our ability to capture more switching and security opportunities within the service provider vertical in addition to core and edge routing deployments. Not to be overlooked, we remain optimistic regarding the access aggregation and net for routing opportunities, which in aggregate represents a $2 billion portion of the market that is growing and where Juniper historically hasn’t played. We introduced our first product targeting this opportunity during the second half of this past year and plan to introduce additional solutions through the course of 2021. Early interest in our metro offerings is encouraging and we believe the combination of these products with Netrounds software automation capabilities should present a compelling value proposition that enable us to win in this attractive portion of the market. Based on our current pipeline, we remain confident in our ability to further stabilize our service provider business during the upcoming year despite the ongoing challenges facing many of our customers in this vertical. Our cloud business also exceeded our expectations in Q4 and grew on a full year basis for a second consecutive year despite an anticipated decline in spending by what has historically been our largest cloud customer. We’ve been able to achieve this growth through improved momentum with other hyperscale accounts and continued success with our Tier 2 customers, which we plan to call cloud majors going forward. Our hyperscale pipeline remains healthy and we continue to see strong wide area momentum with these important customers, particularly for our routing solutions, which experienced strong growth from both a revenue and an orders perspective during the most recent quarter. While business with these customers is likely to remain lumpy, especially as old projects complete and new projects ramp up, the funnel of new high-value opportunities we have been seeing in this footprint continues to exceed the headwinds we also see from old projects completing. The value of our routing stack remains critical to these customers and some of the innovations we have been delivering in software around SONiC and containerized routing are opening up new use cases that expand our TAM and will further increase the value of our technology to this critical customer set. Importantly, we also remain optimistic regarding our potential to gain share with cloud majors, which we view as a large and growing market opportunity. Our potential here is not only driven by the strength of our portfolio and Apstra will further enhance our position, but this is also an area where we see opportunities to diversify by gaining share within existing accounts and opening up new logos through an incremental go-to-market efforts. Based on our current pipeline and the momentum we are seeing at both hyperscale and cloud majors, I expect us to grow our cloud business in 2021. Importantly, we're continuing to make progress on 400 gig and currently have more than 100 wins for our 400 gig capable products, while many of our wins are addressing wide area use cases where we have historically been strong. We're also seeing an increased level of success in data center switching opportunities. We continue to expand our 400 gig product set and deliver new features needed to gain share in this critical market opportunity. We believe we have the right products and customer engagement to both protect our wide area footprint and capture switching share as the 400 gig cycle unfolds across our cloud and carrier customers starting later this year. On this last point, I'd like to spend a few minutes on Apstra, which has the potential to accelerate our success in the data center switching market, both within cloud majors and large enterprise accounts. Fabric management is a key determinant of success in many of these opportunities and Apstra not only provides us with leadership here, but also in the area of closed loop assurance, which allows customers to quickly troubleshoot and remediate problems in large data center environments. We believe Apstra's capabilities are highly differentiated and offer customers the industry's best day zero, day one and day two automated operations. We think these abilities have the potential to significantly improve customer experience and accelerate the momentum in our data center switching business, both in cloud majors as well as large enterprise environments. Our software business performed well in Q4 and accounted for 12% of our overall sales. As a company, we remain laser focused on capturing more software and in particular, more SaaS and subscription-based software. While high value staff and subscription software are smaller percentage of our overall software revenue stream today, they are growing rapidly, which is a trend we expect to continue over the next several years. This growth is primarily being driven by the strong adoption of our Mist Cloud, as well as other software-based subscription offerings. The recent acquisitions of 128 Technology, Netrounds and Apstra will further accelerate our efforts to capture more software revenue in the years to come. I'd like to mention that our services team delivered another solid quarter and on a full year basis, 2020 was another year of service revenue growth due to strong renewal and tax rate as well as growth in our SaaS and software subscriptions. Our services team continues to execute extremely well and ensure our customers receive an excellent experience. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ken who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail.
Ken Miller: Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start by discussing our fourth quarter results and then cover the fiscal year 2020 and end with some color on our outlook. We ended the fourth quarter of 2020 at $1.223 billion in revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.55, both above the mid-point of guidance. Revenue grew 1%, which was the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. The higher than mid-point results were driven by strength across all verticals. Looking at our revenue by vertical on a year-over-year basis, Enterprise posted a record quarter growing 7% year-over-year and 14% sequentially. Cloud grew slightly year-over-year and increased 11% sequentially. Service Provider declined 4% year-over-year and was essentially flat sequentially. From a technology perspective, Routing increased 9% year-over-year and grew 7% sequentially. Switching decreased 2% year-over-year and increased 14% sequentially. Security decreased 14% year-over-year and grew 19% sequentially. Our Services business decreased 1% year-over-year and increased 2% sequentially. Software revenue was approximately 12% of total revenue in the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 60.0% in the quarter, which was in-line with our expectations. In reviewing our Top 10 customers for the quarter, three were Cloud, six were Service Provider, and one was an Enterprise. Our Top 10 customers accounted for 30% of our total revenue as compared to 33% in the fourth quarter of last year. Product deferred revenue was $105 million, up 5% sequentially and down 21% year-over-year due to the timing of the delivery of contractual commitments. Deferred revenue related to our Software as a Service and software subscription offerings, which grew year-over-year, are included in our services deferred revenue. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 2% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. The higher than anticipated costs were driven by higher variable compensation, mostly in the Go-to-Market organization as a result of higher revenue as well as the acquisition of 128 Technology. Cash flow from operations was $126 million for the quarter and increased both year-over-year and sequentially. We paid $66 million in dividends, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share. We also repurchased $75 million worth of shares. Total cash, cash equivalents, and investments at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020 was $2.4 billion. I’d like to point out that there was a timing difference between our new debt issuance and the full retirement of the previous debt which was completed in January. As a result of this timing difference, our total cash and debt balances are elevated by approximately $485 million and $425 million respectively, as of year-end. Moving on to our full year results. Total revenue for 2020 was $4.445 billion, which was flat versus 2019. Our Enterprise business grew 3% for the year, despite the impact from the pandemic. This was our fourth consecutive year of full year growth in Enterprise. Our Cloud business grew 2% for the year, the second consecutive year of growth. Our Service Provider business began to stabilize and performed as expected, declining 4% for the full year. Looking at our technology, Routing declined 1%, Switching grew 2%, and Security declined 9% year-over-year. Our Services business grew 1%. Software was 10% of total revenue; the second year of Software being at or above this level. In reviewing our Top 10 customers for the year, five were Cloud, four were Service Provider, and one was an Enterprise. Non-GAAP gross margin declined by 90 basis points in 2020, primarily due to the additional logistics and other supply chain related costs related to COVID-19, partially offset by improvement in our Service gross margin. Throughout the year, we continued to focus on disciplined operating expense management with a modest increase of less than 1%, on a non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue was 43.7%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.55 in 2020. For the year, we had cash flow from operations of $612 million, which increased $83 million compared to 2019. During 2020, we took a balanced approach to capital allocation. We repurchased $375 million worth of shares and paid $264 million in dividends for a total capital return of 125% of free cash flow to shareholders. In addition, we acquired two growth-oriented companies that we believe will help us return to sustainable revenue growth and margin expansion over time. We also improved our capital structure by refinancing a portion of our debt, locking in historically low long-term financing rates and extending our average maturity, while preserving our investment grade credit profile. I’m proud of the strategic approach the team has taken to ensure our financial resilient through this challenging and uncertain times. Now, I'd like to provide some color on our guidance, which you can find details in the CFO commentary available on our Investor Relations website. At the mid-point of our revenue guidance, revenue is expected to be up 6% year-over-year, which includes less than $10 million from our recent acquisition. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to experience normal seasonal patterns in the first quarter. Excluding the anticipated impact of increased COVID-related costs, non-GAAP gross margin would be approximately flat versus the first quarter of last year. We expect first quarter non-GAAP operating expense to increase sequentially, primarily due to the inclusion of approximately $20 million of operating expenses related to the recent acquisitions as well as the annual reset of variable compensation and the typical seasonal increase of fringe costs, partially offset by a decline in commission expense. In addition, our first quarter non-GAAP EPS guidance includes the dilutive impact of the recent acquisitions. Before we move on to the Q&A, I would like to provide some comments on our expectations for the full year 2021. Our 2021 revenue and non-GAAP earnings expectations remain unchanged relative to the forecast we provided during our Q3 2020 earnings call. However, we have updated our growth expectations to account for the revenue and the non-GAAP earnings upside we experienced in Q4 2020 as compared to the mid-point of our guidance. We have also factored in the acquisition of Apstra, which is expected to be dilutive to our non-GAAP earnings during the first-half of 2021, but be breakeven on a full-year basis. In terms of full year revenue, we expect organic growth of approximately 2% to 3% and we anticipate an additional 1% of growth from the recent acquisitions. Beyond the first quarter, we expect revenue to grow sequentially each quarter in 2021. While non-GAAP gross margin can be difficult to predict, we expect full-year gross margin of approximately 60% due to higher volume, reduced COVID-related logistics costs, and higher software mix, as well as improved services costs. Through the course of the year, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to improve with volume. Non-GAAP operating expense is expected to remain near first quarter levels through the course of the year. The full year non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be approximately flat to 2020 levels. While we expect total non-GAAP operating expense to be up on a full-year basis as we absorb our recent acquisitions and invest to take advantage of market opportunities, we remain committed to disciplined expense management and expanding operating margin longer term. I would also like to note that we expect non-GAAP other income and expense to remain near first quarter levels through the course of the year. Our non-GAAP tax rate on worldwide earnings is expected to be 19.5% plus or minus 1%. We expect full year non-GAAP EPS to grow faster than revenue. Finally, our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share to be paid this quarter to stockholders of record. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success, especially in this challenging environment. Now I'd like to open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
Simon Leopold: Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to just get sort of a very simple one out of the way. I appreciate the commentary on the full year. One of the trends that we assume would occur would be expenses rising in the second half of the year with some normalization in catch up post the pandemic. I'm thinking about things like travel expenses coming back. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about those kinds of expenses coming back. Is that something you're assuming happens in 2022, rather than later this year? And then I've got a bigger picture question afterwards.
Rami Rahim: Sure. Thank you, Simon. So for Q1, the primary driver of the sequential growth in OpEx, the Q1 guide at $510 million really is the acquisitions that we recently closed, and that's about $20 million of OpEx in our Q1 number. We expect for the rest of the year to roughly maintain those Q1 levels around $510 million plus or minus a bit. We do anticipate there being some costs coming back into the equation when people start to travel again, et cetera, perhaps in the second half. However, I do think the new normal is still yet to be determined, and at this point I'm not expecting all the costs to come back. I think we'll be able to be conservative and basically efficient with our travel et cetera, as we move forward. So although I do expect some COVID costs to come back, we don't have a large amount baked into our current full year forecast at this time.
Simon Leopold: Thanks for that. And then in terms of the trend, it seems pretty clear that the enterprise market vertical will become your largest by the end of 2021. And doing business in that space is just very different than Juniper's roots, so clearly you've done something different to get here, but could you talk about how this has affected the thinking on the long-term multi-year strategy and the profile of maybe the company's culture go-to-market? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Yes. I'm happy to address that Simon. So this would be – 2020 would be our fourth consecutive year of growth in the enterprise vertical. So this is not a new thing for us. However, I do believe that there have been a number of strategic actions that we've taken over the last few years equipping sales and structuring sales in a way that goes after the enterprise effectively and efficiently. Our organic innovations, our inorganic acquisitions have set us up to accelerate this part of our business. So despite the challenges that we saw in 2020 as a result of COVID, we grew this vertical and we grew it nicely. I think we're taking share. I believe our technology and our differentiation has never been stronger. We've created not just market share growth and business growth, but Mindshare growth in the industry and I think we've done so with an eye on doing it as efficiently as possible by focusing on the large enterprises. So a big component of our success comes from large Fortune 500 Global 1,000 accounts where these sales investment is as efficient as it can be for that Enterprise. So, for all these reasons, I honestly, I've never felt better about our opportunity in the enterprise space.
Simon Leopold: Thank you very much for that.
Rami Rahim: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.
Paul Silverstein: I appreciate you all taking questions. First off, Ken, in terms of the supply constraints, how large an issue [indiscernible] advantage vis-à-vis Cisco given the forward volume into Broadcom and other suppliers, or is that just not an issue in terms of both revenue growth and pricing? And I've got a bigger picture follow-up question.
Rami Rahim: Yes. So we clearly did experience some pretty significant supply constraints in the peak of kind of the COVID pandemic, if you will, kind of in the summer months. We think we've had material improvements since then. I would articulate that as we exited the year, we're pretty much back to normal. We might have some elevated lead times here and there, but that's more due to demand being beyond our expectation than true supply constraints. I'm very pleased with how the team has really adapted and improve the supply as we proceed. That said backlog is higher. We're exiting the year with about 20% more backlog than we entered. So we are maintaining healthy backlog as we move into this year in 2021 and really the supply constraints, extended lead times, et cetera, that we saw through most of the summer months are largely behind us at this point. I don't believe we're at a competitive disadvantage. Our team does a great job with components manufacturing and component suppliers to negotiate the supply that we need.
Paul Silverstein: All right. And then on, I hate to ask you this, because I think I asked you all every quarter, so my apologies, but I think it's been an investor concern for a while, which is have you seen any share losses or are there any signs of awards away from you specifically in cloud for the GCI and WAN, routing or switching use cases? And on the other side of the equation, Rami your comments about ongoing optimism in the cloud, any incremental insight you can give in terms of where's the opportunity for the greatest upside?
Rami Rahim: Certainly, Paul. So the short answer to your question is no. We have not lost share or footprint in cloud routing today, I mean, in cloud period, I should say. We saw our routing up double digit year-over-year in the Q4 timeframe. I think that is an indication of the health of the footprint that we have retained in this extremely important vertical for us. We continue to see healthy diversification within cloud both within the hyperscale cloud providers, where we enjoy footprints across practically all of them, but also among the – what we used to call Tier 2, Tier 3, which we're now calling cloud majors going forward more and more market share in that area as well. I'd also think that there is a greater diversity of technology that we're selling. So it's not just about routing, it's also about switching, it's also about security in this very important vertical. As I look out into 2021, I believe our footprint that we retain within the cloud space is going to work for us, right. We didn't anticipate any major additional share taking that's going to happen in 2021 to achieve the growth that we believe that we can achieve in 2021, but I do think that with the right focus in go-to-market, the technology that I know we have, that I know is very competitive, we can in fact take some additional share as well in this vertical.
Paul Silverstein: I appreciate it. Thanks guys.
Rami Rahim: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Long with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Tim Long: Thank you. Yes, two, if I could as well. First, maybe Rami talk a little bit about the enterprise side. You mentioned a lot of really good cross-selling with Mist. It seems to be doing very well. Could you talk a little bit about kind of win rates, deal sizes and kind of how you get more at that out of that business to keep the ball rolling? And then second you talked – obviously there's a bunch of other acquisitions and you've framed for us the size of them. Can you talk a little bit about the three of them? And how easy it's going to be for the Salesforce to engage with those and potentially make one, two, or all of them have a similar type of impact and ramp that that Mist is having on the company? Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Yes, it's a great question, Tim. Thank you. So as just a couple of data points for you to give you an indication of just how well we're doing with Mist. Our annualized order business for Mist standalone in Q4 exceeded $200 million. And if you include Mist wireless and wired, so this is EX that's sold really under the Mist automation framework on a standalone annualized order basis, it's really around 300 million already. So the momentum has been really amazing. We're going to take the playbook that we implemented in getting our sellers very proficient and being able to position the Mist differentiation, the technology, and apply that exact same playbook to the acquisitions that we've made last year. 128 and Apstra in particular, which are mostly suited for the enterprise, but have applicability in other verticals as well. With 128, it is a really unique differentiated SD-WAN solution that fits beautifully under the Mist client to cloud vision, right, where you're extracting data insights telemetry from everything in the path between client to cloud and you're doing something really interesting with that data, which is to provide insights and improve the automation and improve the end user experience for our customers. Apstra takes this experience first networking approach that we know has worked so effectively in the campus in client to cloud and apply this to the data center. So, honestly, early interest in Apstra, although we just closed the deal yesterday has been like exceeded our expectations at this point. The pipeline we're building, the interest in customers that want to understand the better together story has been extremely encouraging. And then the last acquisition is a little bit on – a smaller one, which is Netrounds. And Netrounds has applicability to all verticals, but especially the service provider vertical, where we have an ability now to sell beyond just the box and connectivity between boxes, but an assured experience, assured SLAs to service providers and we're also very pleased with the early interest from SPs in that technology as well.
Ken Miller: Yes. And on the enterprise kind of customer acquisition question, Tim, I mean, we did mentioned in Rami's prepared remarks that we did see 125% increase in new logos for Mist. I would tell you that a good percentage of those logos, our existing Juniper install-based customers are really leveraging our install-base with the growth asset of Mist is pretty much part of the strategy to accelerate the Mist growth, but also a good percentage of those customers are net new to Juniper. So really there is a land and expand opportunity where we might lead with the Mist and the Mist AI engine, and then expand to the rest of the portfolio. So it really excited about the enterprise and then we're seeing from a customer acquisition perspective.
Tim Long: Okay, great. Thank you guys.
Rami Rahim: Thanks, Tim.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.
Samik Chatterjee: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Rami, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks the stabilization in the service provider spending, but I think you mentioned that Telco, U.S. Telco's spending has been weak, whereas you are just kind of seeing stress within the cable customers. Can you just kind of talk about how long do you think this weakness from U.S. service provider – in relation to U.S. service provider spending kind of continue? And what kind of impact maybe some of these auctions going on in the U.S. are having on spending? And I have a follow up.
Rami Rahim: Yes, I'd be happy to Samik. We're very pleased with our results in SPs. The Europe largely played out as expected from a revenue standpoint. Q4 probably exceeded our expectations by a bit. We enjoyed very strong, healthy franchises with service providers around the world. 49 of the top 50 service providers worldwide are our customers trust Juniper technology. We did see weakness in some of the largest Tier 1 service providers, especially here in North America. And I think for the reason that we all know there has been a lot of capital expenditure that has been placed in a spectrum auctions and so forth. So it's diverted investment away from the areas of the network, the business that we are traditionally strong in. I don't expect that to be the case forever. If you look out into 2021 and we provided an outlook of further stabilization, i.e., even better results than we saw in 2020, in 2021, we did not end that outlook anticipate a resumption that any significant resumption in spending by our large Tier 1 SPs. If they do resume spending in the kind of IP technology that we developed and sell, then I think that would obviously benefit our business even more. The strength that we saw has to do with the diversification strategy that we have been executing on, so increased penetration in the cable space in this country, Tier 2 and Tier 3 service providers that are working very effectively for us and international service providers. You'll notice that we had a very healthy quarter in Asia Pacific. I'm very proud of the team out in APAC for really showing results, not just in SP, but across all verticals. And that's just an indication of the kind of diversification we're driving through our business.
Samik Chatterjee: Got it. Got it. I had a follow up on the 400 gig wins that you talked about, I think you said you have 100 wins and most of them are in the WAN, but there's a portion of them in data center switching as well. If you can just kind of talk about how many of those switching wins are, where you already had that position in the data center with the customer versus kind of new wins where you met a displaced incumbents, or it's a new use case that's kind of come up and you've managed to gain a position there, which is kind of an incremental opportunity?
Rami Rahim: Yes, in cloud provider data center switching, many wins are going to be mostly around net new share for us because that's where our existing share is not all that high. I don't know the exact split of the business that you're asking for, but I'll give you this data point. If you look at the foundation of 400 gig business today and measured in the number of customers, in the Q3 of 2020 timeframe our cumulative number of customers that invested in 400 gig capable switching technology and compared that to the Q4 timeframe, same metric cumulative number of customers that invested in 400 gig switching technology, that's doubled. So, whereas the revenue from 400 gig switching today is still relatively small in comparison to the total switching business, the way we measure it is momentum and wins and momentum and customers and you can see that that momentum is quite solid. That's a very encouraging data point for us.
Samik Chatterjee: Got it. Interesting. Thank you. Thanks for taking my question.
Rami Rahim: My pleasure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Rod Hall: Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I had a couple of quick number clarification than a question on the products. So on the numbers, can you set 2% to 3% growth and then 1% for acquisitions? Is that 1% on top of the 2% to 3%? Or is it included…
Ken Miller: Yes, that would be on top of, so – yes, that would be on top of.
Rod Hall: Okay.
Ken Miller: So we expect to navigate 3% to 4% in total.
Rod Hall: Right. Okay, that's what I thought. And then on the gross margins, you said excluding COVID costs, I'm assuming COVID costs there would be just a few tenths of a percent. Could you just confirm that that's the case?
Ken Miller: Our COVID costs are running between 50 and 100 basis points in any given quarter, so it's fairly material impact to our past few quarters and I expect it to be similar in Q1. I do think that should come down a bit in maybe the second half, but the first half I expect it to be remain in that 50 to 100 basis points of impact.
Rod Hall: Okay. So we add 50 to 100 back to account for the COVID costs.
Ken Miller: Yes, once the cost normalized, that's what we would expect to see. Yes.
Rod Hall: Okay. And then on the products, I just wanted to check on Mist again, Rami, that I guess that the thing that we get back from investors quite a bit is this – it's hard for people to believe that that campus networking oriented products like that are going to continue to do well as we reopened, I think a lot of people think, gosh, why would people invest in their campus networking. And I know there's reasons for that, namely that you don't have a lot of market share there and there's a lot to go for. But could you just kind of help maybe for the broader audience, help us all understand kind of what's going through customers' minds when they think about investing in that and in the kind of a reopening environment and an environment where maybe more people are working from home long-term that sort of thing? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Yes, certainly. It's actually a great question, Rod. So in – the way that we've maintained our momentum throughout the pandemic is on focusing on sub-segments of the enterprise and of course cloud and SP, but primarily in the enterprise that are most resilient to economic perturbations or spending patterns in IT, so financial services, higher education so think here college campuses, U.S. federal government, large big box type retailers, warehouses. These are all areas where investments in IT and networking must be made today. But as we look out beyond the pandemic and you start to think about what happens when we recover from the pandemic, my strong belief is that there will be a pivot towards investments in IT technology that's going to be cloud delivered, AI driven. It's not going to be the complex legacy on-prem traditional technologies that quite frankly are not important to Juniper and not a part of our strategy, it's the cloud delivered technology that I think we'll actually see an acceleration as you get out of this COVID crisis. So my view is that we've done what's necessary to capture share during the pandemic and we're setting ourselves up with a strategy that's going to be geared to where investments are going to be greatest post-pandemic.
Rod Hall: So you would be thinking that people are investing to give themselves more resiliency, more workforce flexibility that kind of thing as they think through the other side of the pandemic.
Rami Rahim: Absolutely, whether it is because they need that flexibility or because they want to crush the costs of running networks by replacing the human elements of running network with automation and that is the magic of Mist. And again, don't think of Mist as just wireless LAN. Mist is that cloud delivered AI powered automation framework for wireless, wired, and now with 128 Technology WAN that full client to cloud experience.
Rod Hall: Okay. That's great. Thank you, Rami.
Rami Rahim: My pleasure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Kvaal with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.
Jeff Kvaal: Yes. Thank you. I guess my first question is about cloud. And I guess I'm wondering are there opportunities for you to do better than that growth statement that you gave for the year? And I say that in the context of – we had a couple of tough years in cloud as you, I'm sure, know better than I do. And we've had now a couple of decent years in clouds within the flattish or up some. But at the same time we see these cloud companies that are growing their revenues and expanding their CapEx and building new data centers at a faster clip than what your revenues are doing. And so I'm wondering if there's an opportunity here whether it's 2021 or 2022 or down the road to kind of close the gap a little bit and make cloud more sustainable mid or even high single digit grower.
Rami Rahim: Yes. Yes. So, Jeff, it's a good question. So we've seen now two years of growth in cloud. When we provide our outlook for 2021, we're not assuming any major take share type opportunities that we score that would accelerate beyond just the statement of growth. I mean, that's really the thing that I would ask you to take note of. If there were 400 gig opportunities that would represent major like net new footprint and certainly that would be additive and I will say this, I mean, we do see those opportunities and we're – absolutely sleeves are rolled up and we're aggressively fighting for them and actually I feel kind of good about them, but we're not yet at a point where we want to call them in our outlook for 2021.
Jeff Kvaal: Okay. All right. And then secondly just to follow up on Rod's question a bit. How do you feel like your enterprise customers are now perceiving their willingness to invest? And I think we cycle back a quarter or two, these are different companies we talk about, well they are doing digital transformation on the [indiscernible] feels like people are back. Where are we in the recovery spending zone? Are we fully back yet? Or is there more – is there opportunity for acceleration from here?
Rami Rahim: No, I don't think we're fully back yet. I still believe that there are COVID related headwinds that we were facing and we're anticipating that we will continue to face. In fact, I strongly believe that our enterprise business would have performed even better in 2020, had it not been for COVID. We're not in our outlook for enterprise accounting on in a major recovery, a significant recovery from COVID type spending in enterprise, but should that – should that reverse, let's say, in the second half of the year enterprises go back to spending more like they used to then I think will absolutely benefit from that. As far as your question around appetite for spending in those verticals that I just mentioned to Rod financial services, campuses, higher education, federal government, large retailers, actually the appetite for investments as measured by large projects are – is there we've seen it and we've won many opportunities based on the merits, the differentiation of our technology. The last thing I would say is even in this, let's say, the smaller type enterprises, let's say mid-sized enterprises, where COVID is going to be more of a headwind, more of a factor to be considered in IT teams justifying projects. I would argue that we're living in a time now where differentiation matters most, right. And I've never felt more strong about the merits of our technology, the differentiation of our solution for the enterprise.
Jeff Kvaal: Okay. Thank you, Rami.
Rami Rahim: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Sami Badri: Hi, thank you for the question. The first question is more of a timing and clarification on one of your cloud comments. Rami, you mentioned that you are completing some projects and then you are seeing the commencement of other projects. I just want to get an idea on some of the seasonality or just the timing of some of these? Are we seeing things kind of wind down right now, which means that things could be kind of slow for quarter or two in the cloud segment? And then could they potentially ramp back up very quickly instead of back half of 2021? Is there anything you should be expecting and kind of the lumpiness in 2021 cloud revenue?
Rami Rahim: Yes. I'm happy to answer that Sami. So first, I wouldn't say seasonality because it sort of indicates maybe some timing of orders that's based on which quarter of the year, and that's not necessarily what we're seeing. What we see within the cloud vertical are really two dynamics. One of them is a natural evolution of the deployment of used cases. So they're always going to be older, more mature use cases that start to sort of diminish. They kind of reduced over time, but we're offsetting those older use cases with new use cases that we continue to win even within the same customer. So any cloud provider, especially how hyperscale cloud provider is going to be deploying our technology in a number of different use cases and that natural evolution of use cases it's always been there. Some will decline and others will grow. The second factor within the cloud vertical is just diversity within or among customers. We're seeing really healthy diversity among our largest hyperscale cloud customers and that offset some of the puts and takes of use cases within each of the customers. And we're seeing strength in the cloud majors opportunity where there are many customers, so that naturally is going to be more diverse element of our business.
Sami Badri: Got it. But just to kind of lock on here; the first half of 2021 should be relatively like no real surprises, or should we be kind of expecting lumpiness or anything like that, just so I can frame out the year a little bit?
Rami Rahim: No. We're not anticipating any surprises. I mean, like I said, when we provide an outlook of growth in clouds where we're totally factoring in this transition of used cases in our business and we're also of course taking into account that we've got a diversity of customers and we're not counting on any major net new footprint wins.
Sami Badri: Got it. Got it. I wanted to thank you for that. I just want to shift gears a little bit back to something that was a big dynamic about two years ago, the MX, the PTX transition. This hasn't really come up much recently?
Rami Rahim: Operator, we are – we have to move on to our next question.
Sami Badri: Okay. Okay. Go ahead.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Vaughn with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
David Vaughn: Great. Thanks guys. Just want to circle back on the enterprise for a second. Clearly it's becoming a critical driver of the company going forward. And the recent M&A clearly has been really focused on that segment. Just wanted to touch on how do you think about the portfolio today going forward and where or if there are any wide spaces that you need to address going forward to really solidify our bad market going forward? And then I just have a quick follow up question.
Rami Rahim: Yes. Thanks for the question, David. I really do think that we've rounded out our portfolio and our position, our solutions, each of our three really important used cases. I don't think there are any glaring gaps at this point in time. We're always going to be looking for opportunities for value enhancing M&A, but quite frankly where my mind is at right now, where my focus is at is on landing and integrating successfully and achieving the kind of business momentum and success that we saw with Mist to these acquisitions that we made last year.
David Vaughn: Great. And just a quick follow-up on all the M&A activity. I think last quarter you mentioned, post the closing of 128, you would expect that a point of growth this year in 2021 from that transaction and your commentary is certainly sounds like the receptiveness or the enthusiasm around Apstra has gotten clearly ahead of your expectations? Does that suggest that sort of the expectation from an M&A perspective that you have today probably is a little bit conservative given sort of the initial client feedback from the transaction that you've completed?
Ken Miller: Yes. We did. We did tweak the language a little bit there. David, we talked about being nearly a point of growth. We thought that the 128 Tech and Netrounds would give us nearly a point of growth. We're now updating [indiscernible]. We do expect a full point of growth from our recent acquisition. So it's a modest change in our outlook there.
David Vaughn: Got it. That's helpful. Thanks, Ken.
Ken Miller: Sure.
Rami Rahim: Operator we'll take two more questions.
Operator: Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Aaron Rakers, your line is live. You may proceed with your question.
Rami Rahim: Maybe we can go to the next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Henderson with Needham. Please proceed with your question.
Alex Henderson: Great. Thank you very much. So I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the spending patterns that you’re seeing from enterprise customers. Not so much driven by COVID but rather by the impact of SolarWinds hack. We’ve spent a fair amount of time talking to value-added resellers during the survey work and the like as well as talking to individual companies. And it seems quite clear that spending intentions around security have ratcheted up quite significantly and that the overall IT budgets are also increasing quite meaningfully, which does not really put to your commentary about fairly soft conditions on spending potentially improving once COVID is resolved. Have you had conversations with the C-suite types in the large accounts or even intermediate sized accounts that are recent enough to get a handle on whether SolarWinds had an impact on spending intentions and while you’re at it did you have any impact on as a result of the hack?
Rami Rahim: Yeah. So there are a few things there to unpack. First I want to say actually what I mentioned was we anticipate enterprise spending to be healthy post COVID. So I actually think that there will be a resumption in spend, more tailwind and acceleration, if you will, of enterprise spending in many different use cases, especially the use cases that we at the Company are focused on. Next I want to say with respect to Juniper and impact of SolarWinds, we never put that SolarWinds product into any of our products that we sell our customers. And, of course, once we – once we heard of the news, we quickly scoured our own networks and looked for any exposures and we didn’t find that we were in any way exposed. So that I’d just get out of the way. In terms of has SolarWinds or other security type incidents increased the appetite for IT leaders our CISOs to focus on spending, especially in security, the answer is absolutely yes. I mean, there is a reason that I think it’s very important that as a networking company you also have security competence and you embed security as a forethought, not an afterthought in all of the solutions that you sell to address the use cases that are important to your business. That’s never been more important. So our security business in Q4 did not grow but there is a reason for this. The high end of our security where we typically sell into large service providers, cloud providers that tends to be lumpy. The broader part of our security portfolios, really the strategy there is to embed it into our solutions. So we talked a lot about Mist. One element of our client to cloud Mist solution is that it’s going to be secured by default with the technology that we have embedded in our - the Mist solution portfolio. And for that reason, I’m actually quite optimistic about how these security trends and the appetite to invest in security by IT departments for our business.
Alex Henderson: So did you talk to any CIC sweets post the hack broke in December? [Indiscernible] to me that, we wish we could have a hack like this every year. If they're going to have a hack, have it in December because it's spiked spending intentions. Have you heard anything along those lines from anybody in the C-suites that you've talked to?
Rami Rahim: Yes. So my remarks were – Alex, were absolutely based on conversations that I have on an ongoing basis with C-suite professionals. So a big and very important part of my job is to talk on a regular basis to CEO, CIO, CTO of large enterprises, service providers, cloud providers and the net of it is absolutely security is a top of mind consideration. It's driving spending, and making sure that our customers understand that security is embedded in all of our strategic use case solutions is a big part of my job.
Alex Henderson: Okay. Thank you very much.
Rami Rahim: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Ryan Koontz with Rosenblatt Securities. Please proceed with your questions.
Ryan Koontz: I think the question, great progress on the routing side with service provider stabilizing there. I would, if you could give us any color on some of the used cases you're seeing, some of the new used cases in the enterprise and cloud. Is it as simple as the campus and DCI WAN piece or am I missing some other interesting used cases? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Yes. I'm very pleased with our routing progress. In Q4 we saw double-digit routing growth in cloud providers and enterprises, governments and cable momentum was strong MX and PTX grew both year-over-year and a sequential basis. So it does appear to be broad-based. The used cases today for us are mostly going to be in core routing and edge routing, some DCI data center interconnect. The thing that I'm really excited about when it comes to the opportunity isn't on our metro roadmap. The metro represents around a $2 billion routing opportunity today that's growing at a healthy clip, is probably the fastest growing routing sub-market of the overall routing market. And it's largely untapped by Juniper. And the good news is this is just another high performance network, but it requires certain capabilities, certain aspects of your products around footprint and efficiency – power efficiency, and certain types of features. These are all within our wheelhouse, and this is a roadmap that we're executing on. We've already introduced the first product to address it, but you can expect a number of new products that we introduced this year to complete our metro routing portfolio. Net rounds really fits beautifully into the solution because it provides that automation and SLA assurance, and that's important for the metro. So that I believe is going to help us in our routing business in 2021, but especially in 2022, when the, when the portfolio is complete.
Ryan Koontz: Helpful, Rami. Thanks very much.
Rami Rahim: My pleasure, Ryan.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Jess Lubert for any closing comments.
Jess Lubert: Thank you, operator. Before we conclude today's call, I'd like to remind everyone that Juniper will be hosting its virtual 2021 Investor Day on February 12th. Executive presentations will start at 10:00 AM Eastern Standard Time and can be accessed via a link which we posted to our IR website. If you have any questions regarding how to participate in the event, you can reach out to me at jlubert@juniper.net. We look forward to hopefully seeing you there. That concludes today's call. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful evening.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-10-27 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Juniper Networks' Third Quarter 2020 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to turn this conference over to your host, Mr. Jess Lubert, VP of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.
Jess Lubert: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter 2020 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results might differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release and CFO commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and Juniper undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website under financial reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results is included in today's press release. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami.
Rami Rahim: Good afternoon, everyone. Like many of you on this call, we're continuing to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic and take actions to both meet the needs of our customers and ensure the safety of our workforce. Most of our employees are continuing to work from home and successfully leveraging the various technologies enabled by the network to maintain a high level of productivity, despite the current environment. To this last point, I'd like to reiterate my belief that the strategic importance of the global network has never been clearer and the long-term outlook for the markets we serve remain positive. We are investing not only to survive the current environment, but to capitalize on the opportunities our markets present, and to come out stronger on the other side. Now on to our results. We delivered solid results during the September quarter with revenue of $1.138 billion exceeding the midpoint of our guidance due to better-than-expected results in our service provider and enterprise verticals, both of which grew year-over-year. Upside in these areas, more than offset some lumpiness with our cloud customers. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.43 was in line with the midpoint of our forecast. Orders once again exceeded our expectations, particularly in our enterprise business, which saw double-digit order growth year-over-year, despite the challenging macro backdrop. We're executing well in the current environment. We firmly believe we are taking share, and that our technology differentiation along with our investments and go-to-market are enabling us to win at a time when challenging market conditions have adversely affected our competitor. Our momentum is strong entering our fiscal fourth quarter, and this momentum is increasing my confidence that we will be able to grow the business on an organic basis for the full year 2021. With that said, I'd like to touch a bit on our strategy and some of the actions we are taking to win the next decade of networking. Specifically, at the beginning of this year, we focused our sales teams, product management teams and engineering teams on compelling and differentiated use cases, targeting the AI driven enterprise, automated WAN solution and cloud-ready data centers. We believe each of these use cases is likely to see very attractive market tailwinds over the next several years. And focusing our resources on these specific areas should enable us to accelerate our growth as these opportunities unfold. It's worth mentioning that each of these use cases span across the three industry verticals that we target, and by focusing our resources on these areas, we should have the opportunity to speed time to market, accelerate share, and leverage development costs across a wide base. While this alignment should position us to better capitalize on big opportunities like the move to AI driven cloud managed architecture, 400 gig and 5G in the years to come, the early feedback from our teams has been incredibly positive, and we’re already starting to see the benefits of this alignment, which you'll hear me discuss more in future calls. Now I'd like to provide some additional insights into the quarter and address some of the key developments we are seeing within each of our core verticals. Starting with the enterprise, we are particularly encouraged by the improved momentum we're seeing as this business experience double-digit sequential growth and slightly grew on a year-over-year basis. We saw improved momentum in the U.S. and Asia, which more than offset weakness in Europe. Order growth was solid and exceeded our expectations, particularly in the North American enterprise and U.S. federal vertical. Based on our results, we believe we are taking share, a dynamic we expect to continue in the future. Our optimism is fueled by the customer response to our AI driven enterprise vision, which we began executing to early last year. This effort started with an investment in go-to-market headcount, and it was followed shortly thereafter with the acquisition of Mist Systems. These moves have not only enabled us to broaden our reach, but also added some game-changing AI and cloud management technology, which we are extending across our enterprise portfolio. The Mist Technology is truly differentiated and has enabled our customers not only improve network performance, but also to capture material operational savings and deliver significant improvements in end user experience. The differentiation of Mist, which has been extended to our wired offering, can be seen in the order of momentum I mentioned this quarter. To this point, Mist reported another record quarter with new logos once again growing more than 100% year-over-year and orders rising more than 180% year-over-year. We also saw a very strong adoption of our Mist Wired Assurance capabilities and corresponding pull-through of our EX switching portfolio, which positively impacted orders in the Q3 timeframe and should benefit revenue on a go-forward basis. To this point, joint Mist and EX orders exceeded $200 million annualized run rate in the Q3 timeframe. Our investments in go-to-market are beginning to payoff, and we are also seeing positive momentum in the channel, both of which are creating optimism that the success we have been seeing is likely to continue in future quarters. Our agreement to acquire 128 Technology represents the next step in our AI driven enterprise evolution. 128 Technology is truly unique and offers customers material benefits over any alternative SD-WAN solution today. Some of the benefits include much lower hardware costs, much lower latency and significantly lower bandwidth costs. In addition to these benefits, customers will see application performance improve and users will receive a better overall experience. 128 Technology user-centric SD-WAN is a perfect complement to our AI driven enterprise solution, delivering market leading insights and automation from clients to cloud. I expect our enterprise momentum to build in accordance to come and believe this business is positioned to not only grow organically and take share in 2020, but also in 2021 and beyond. Our service provider segment also saw very healthy results in the September quarter, growing 5% year-over-year, despite ongoing challenges from a supply chain perspective. Although we are continuing to see some COVID-19 related capacity benefits, we believe the primary driver of the service provider strength we are seeing continues to be our efforts to diversify this business across customers, products and geographies. Similar to Q2, we continue to benefit from the strength with our U.S. cable customers as well as Tier 2 and Tier 3 carriers in international markets. We also saw solid demand for our switching products in addition to our routing solutions. While we did see some weakening in our SP security business, we believe this was a function of timing. I would note that the pipeline here remains strong. Our diversification efforts are only likely to strengthen as we increasingly target access aggregation and metro routing opportunities, and introduce new software-centric testing and automation capabilities acquired through Netrounds that further enhance our ability to win in these growing areas of the routing market, where historically we hadn't played. Based on Q3 results and Q4 pipeline, we continue to believe our service provider business is likely to see a mid single-digit decline in 2020. While we acknowledge some of our service provider customers that are continuing to face business challenges that may impact their ability to spend in future quarters based on our recent momentum and customer conversations, we believe this business has the potential to further stabilize in 2021. Our cloud business came in slightly weaker than we originally expected. We believe the decline on both a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis was largely a function of lumpiness following five consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth. We believe this lumpiness reflects normal customer consumption patterns. Our Cloud backlog remains healthy and we believe the general spending outlook from a hyperscale and Tier 2 customers remains favorable. We believe we are holding our win footprint and are increasingly optimistic regarding our potential to gain data center share in the years to come, while we now believe our Cloud business is likely to be flat to slightly up for the full year 2020. We remain confident in our ability to grow this business in 2021 and beyond. Importantly, we're continuing to make progress on 400-gig with additional wins and strong pipeline of opportunities in both our Cloud and Service Provider segments. While many of our wins are addressing wide area of use cases, where we are historically been strong, we've also secured net new Switching opportunities including a design win with a Top 10 cloud provider. We continue to expand our 400-gig product set and deliver new features needed to gain share in this critical market. We believe we have the right product and customer engagement to both protect our wide area of footprint and capture switching share as the 400-gig cycle unfolds across our cloud and carrier customers in years to come. We continue to expect the 400-gig opportunity to begin in earnest next year with the revenue starting to become material during the second half of next year. Our Software revenue represented less than 10% of sales for the second consecutive quarter, due to a lower mix of certain products that drive higher on-box attach rate of perpetual licenses. That said we continue to see strong adoption of our Mist and Security subscriptions and our efforts to transition certain perpetual software offerings to term-based subscription are beginning to drive improved results. We believe growth in these recurring software offering is an encouraging dynamic that should improve the visibility over time and give us confidence in the long-term outlook for our software revenue. I'd like to mention that our Services team delivered another solid quarter and continued to grow on a year-over-year basis due to strong renewal and service attach rates. Our Services team continues to execute extremely well and ensure our customers receive an excellent experience. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ken who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail.
Ken Miller: Thank you Rami and good afternoon, everyone. I will start by discussing our third quarter results and then provide some color on our outlook. We ended the third quarter of 2020 at $1.138 billion in revenue, above the mid-point of our guidance range. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.43 was in line with the mid-point of our guidance. Revenue was up slightly showing year-over-year growth for the first time this year, while lead times improved on a sequential basis, we continue to experience supply constraints and lead times remain extended on certain products due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Looking at our revenue by vertical, on a sequential basis, Service Provider and Enterprise grew while Cloud declined as expected. On a year-over-year basis Service Provider grew 5%, showing year-over-year growth for the first time in 13 quarters. Enterprise grew slightly and exceeded our expectations. Strength in our Service Provider and Enterprise verticals more than offset a 7% year-over-year decline in Cloud. We saw revenue in all geographies grow on a sequential basis. From a technology perspective on year-over-year basis, Routing increased 6%, while Switching decreased 5% and Security decreased 23%. Our Services business grew 4% year-over-year. In reviewing our Top 10 customers for the quarter, four were Cloud, five were Service Provider, and one was an Enterprise. Our top 10 customers accounted for 31% of our total revenue as compared to 34% in the third quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP gross margins were 59.0%, which was below our expectations primarily due to mix. If it weren't for elevated logistics and other supply chain-related costs due to COVID-19 we would have posted non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 60%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were down 2% year-over-year and flat sequentially, which was in line with our guidance range. Our operating expenses in the third quarter benefited from COVID-19 related savings. Cash flow from operations was $116 million. We paid $66 million in dividends, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share and repurchased $100 million worth of shares in the quarter. Total cash, cash equivalents, and investments at the end of the third quarter of 2020 was $2.6 billion, essentially flat from the second quarter. Now I'd like to provide some color on our guidance, which you can find detailed in the CFO Commentary available on our investor relations website. As a reminder, our guidance includes the impact of the acquisition of Netrounds but excludes any impact from the pending acquisition of 128 Technology. At the mid-point of our Q4 guidance we expect to see sequential revenue and earnings growth. Confidence in our forecast is driven by strong backlog and healthy momentum. Our Q4 forecast assumes sequential growth in our Enterprise and Cloud verticals and a slight sequential decline in Service Provider. We expect to see sequential volume-driven improvements in our non-GAAP gross margin. In addition, we expect logistics and other supply chain-related costs due to the effects of the ongoing pandemic to remain elevated but slightly lower than Q3 levels. We expect fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expense to be modestly up from Q3 levels. We will remain focused on prudent cost management while continuing to invest to capture future opportunities. We expect non-GAAP Other Income & Expense, or OI&E to be an expense of approximately $15 million on a net basis in Q4 and remain at this level in future periods. The expected negative impact on OI&E is due to the lower interest rate environment, our capital return initiatives and recently announced acquisitions. Turning to our capital return program, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.20 per share to be paid during the fourth quarter. We remain committed to paying our dividend and will remain opportunistic with respect to share buybacks. While there is a lot unknown about the future due to the pandemic and other macroeconomic uncertainty before we move on to Q&A, I would like to provide a few comments on our outlook for 2021. Presuming no further COVID-19-related economic deterioration, based on the current momentum we are seeing and the investments we are making to capitalize on the opportunities ahead, we expect to return to organic revenue growth on a full-year basis in 2021. Assuming the pending acquisition of 128 Technologies closes, we expect nearly a point of additional revenue growth, which we would expect to be weighted towards the second half of 2021. We expect full-year 2021 non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 60%, up from 2020 levels. The improvement is expected to be driven by increased volume, software sales and our value engineering efforts. We also expect to see a gradual reduction in COVID-19 related costs through the course of 2021. As a reminder, our gross margin tends to be seasonally lower in Q1, with gradual volume-related improvement throughout the course of the year. We expect 2021 non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately flat year-over-year as improved gross margin will be offset by increased costs related to the pending acquisition of 128 Technologies, the gradual normalization of COVID-related savings, and targeted investments to capitalize on growth opportunities ahead. Due to lower cash and investment balances, combined with lower investment yields, we expect a negative impact to non-GAAP OI&E in 2021. We expect non-GAAP EPS to grow slightly faster than revenue. Our long-term financial objectives have not changed. We plan to deliver sustainable revenue growth, improved operating margin and earnings expansion over time. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper’s success, especially in this challenging environment. Now I'd like to open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. You may proceed with your question.
Ittai Kidron: Thanks. Hey, guys. Nice quarter. A couple of questions for me. First on the switching side, you've talked about the progress clearly of your campus, which is we’ve missed that you're seeing a pull through, but the overall category was still down 5%. Should I interpret this to mean that the data center switching was weak in the quarter? If you can give us some color around that. And then second question is around the macro. i mean, clearly you sound more confident here heading into towards the end of the year, and that's great to hear. But we are starting to see second wave kind of shutdowns happening in Europe, here and there on a selective basis, perhaps not as extensive but nonetheless happening in Europe. Can you give us some thoughts on what are you hearing from your people over there and how you've incorporated that potential risk into your outlook?
Rami Rahim: Yes. Thanks for the question, Ittai. I'll address both of your questions, and maybe Ken will add some additional color on the macro question. The short answer to the switching question is that, no, actually data center momentum has been quite strong for us. So why is it that we saw 5% reduction or year-over-year decline in revenue for switching, it's entirely or the vast majority of it is due to the dynamics around large hyperscaler deployment of our switching technology in wide area use cases. If you look at our switching performance in the data center for both enterprise and service provider, it's actually up and up meaningfully. So we're actually quite encouraged with the products, the technology that we're offering as well as the momentum we're seeing in the market. And I think our focus on solutions for the data center in both the telco and the enterprise is actually paying off for us. On macro, certainly we're not immune to major disruptions, second wave issues and so forth. But thus far we have been quite encouraged with the momentum, the order strength we're seeing in all of our verticals business, particular in service provider and the enterprise in the Q3 timeframe. I think at this point our visibility is good enough to say that in the service provider space we can see mid single-digit declines all up for the year, which is actually meaningfully better than last year. In the enterprise expect to see growth for the full year now based on the momentum and the visibility that we have, and cloud provider, flat to low single growth is actually very much realistic, again, considering the momentum today as well as our outlook for the rest of the year. And Ken will add.
Ken Miller: Yes. I mean, I would just add, to 2021, obviously there's a fair amount of uncertainty. But our current working assumption is we're presuming no further economic deterioration and the macro environment remains roughly the same in 2021 as it did in 2020. So we're not presuming it gets materially worse nor materially better throughout 2021. That's really our base case assumption right now.
Ittai Kidron: Very good. Good luck, guys. Thanks.
Ken Miller: Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question.
Rod Hall: Yes. Thank you for the question. I have two actually regarding kind of forward sales. So I wanted to ask you what the ACX pipeline is looking like. And if you were to gain footprint wins there, particularly in Europe, what you think the timing on that might be? Would it be middle of next year? Would it be earlier? Just kind of curious how that sales pipeline is developing for ACX. And then secondly on higher speed MPC line card, I wonder, could you talk about how far through the upgrade process you are out there? Like how much runway you think you've got in terms of higher speed MPC upgrade? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Yes. Thanks for the questions, Rod. So both questions are actually pertaining to our automated WAN solutions use cases that we're addressing. In the ACX specifically, this is a product that addresses our metro end-to-end use cases. We're still in the early stages of completing that solution. And what we have is the initial ACX product or modern product that we just introduced into the market, the ACX710; that actually has very encouraging early momentum. That coupled with some of our MX portfolio, some of our older ACX product line, and very importantly here is the solution that we're gluing together with end-to-end automation through some of our organic efforts, smart partnerships and then very recently our acquisition of Netrounds, which is an end-to-end assurance solution for our service provider customers in particular. I think that's starting to come together and we're starting to see early momentum, but it's still early days. And I expect that by the time we get into next year, probably second half next year, we'll have enough of the solution that we should see a bit more momentum. On your question around MPC, it took us quite some time to get the MPC products that we had introduced into the market now a while back. These are line cards for the MX product line complete in terms of the features required for use cases that the majority of our service provider customers were interested in. That's mostly behind us at this point. Then there's a certification cycle. Now we are actually starting to see some decent revenue ramp still early, but I expect that to continue to benefit us in the future. And in fact, some of the optimism we have about further stabilization in the service provider business is a result of the fact that we have these newer products that we're now selling to our customers.
Rod Hall: Do you have any percentage sort of estimate on how far through that revenue opportunity you're on the MPCs, Rami? Or I mean, is it sort of 10%? Or is it – are you further through it? Can you give us any idea?
Rami Rahim: All I will say at this point is that it's still fairly low as a percentage of total MX business, whether it's orders or revenues, still very low.
Rod Hall: Great. Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein with Cowen. You may proceed with your question.
Paul Silverstein: Thanks guys for taking the question. Can you discuss what you're seeing in terms of pricing in both the service provider and the cloud markets? And also a broader question for both of you in terms of the competitive dynamics that you're seeing your position relative to – obviously relative to Cisco, but also relative to the other competitors out there in particular and switching Arista and HPE, I recognize it's an awfully big market and you're still a small part of it. So you may not be coming across – the competitive aspect may be less rather than more, but I am curious what you're seeing and I have a follow-up.
Ken Miller: Yes. So I'll touch on the pricing part and pass to Rami for the competitive aspect. But on the pricing front, we're not seeing a material change, Paul. I mean, as you know, the pricing has always been competitive in this industry. You do see price erosion on a per bit basis, year-to-year, and we're not seeing anything unusual in the pricing curve going forward. So really nothing to note from a chain perspective on the pricing front this quarter nor in our future plans.
Rami Rahim: And just to answer your question, Paul, about the competitive dynamics. I mean, we obviously have always been in a very competitive environment, competitive landscape. I like to think about our competitive differentiation from a use case standpoint. So if you look at the AI driven enterprise, where Mist is this overarching cloud solution that delivers manageability and assurance to enterprises, I really am very pleased with our win rate. The fact that we have a solution that is highly differentiated, that's resonating with many of our customers. And especially in a macro environment that is more challenging, in the enterprise space, having this kind of differentiation is essentially what is resulting in the momentum that we're seeing in the enterprise with double-digit order growth on a year-over-year basis. And second to solutions, automated WAN solutions in particular, which is around service providers, cloud providers. I really think that we have a compelling portfolio of products, especially for the 400 gig space with our network operating system capabilities with Junos Evolved, and an automation framework that includes things like HealthBot and NorthStar SDN controller, and now Netrounds, that's really coming together nicely. Metro, that's going to fill out in time. I just answered that question as that's an area where there are going to be some certain select opportunities that we can compete based on the completeness of our portfolio today. But I feel confident with the investments that we're making now that it's going to become a much easier opportunity for us to capture in time as we build out that portfolio. Cloud-ready data center momentum there is really strong again, based on the merits of our merchant and custom silicon based products, as well as the automation solutions that we offer our customers today that actually will even get stronger in time. But I feel very good all up about the technology that we're offering, the customer engagement that we have across all of our segments.
Paul Silverstein: And Rami, just to be clear, you alluded to in your remarks, but the weakness you're citing with cloud that is not due to share loss or due to intercepted deals by your competitors. You're not seeing that.
Rami Rahim: No, that's not what we are seeing. It's really just timing of deployments across a few of our large cloud provider customers. And if I look more broadly at our cloud segment into Tier 2, Tier 3 cloud, actually the momentum there is quite solid.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. You may proceed with your question.
Sami Badri: Hi, thank you. I just wanted to touch up mainly on the quarterly results and just put into perspective some of the other results that you guys have reported earlier this year in 1Q and 2Q. Just maybe if we could get an idea, you talked about in prior quarterly results how there were some unfilled opportunities mainly tied to do – mainly tied to supply shortages. Now, when we look at the 3Q results and we think about the roadmap for 4Q, how much of 3Q and 4Q would catch-up from opportunities that were missed in 1Q and 2Q or just were a bit behind? And how much of this is essentially net new or I guess you'd say more productive sales generation rather than just like fulfilling orders that were already in the pipeline that never got executed in the first half of 2020?
Ken Miller: Yes. So we're very pleased with the Q3 results from a revenue perspective and from a booking perspective. We did see significant bookings growth in Q3 in enterprise. We also saw modest bookings growth in service provider in Q3 as well. There is some of the revenue, particularly some of the service provider revenue in Q3. I would say it did benefit from the strength in first half bookings. The supply constraint still remains elevated on particularly our service provider products; actually our MX and our PTX products are where we're still seeing the most significant supply constraints. We do expect those to moderate here as we close out the year. The rest of our portfolio was largely back on track to normal lead time. So if you look at the quarter result in Q3, from a service provider perspective, revenue growth – the large sequential increase, there was some benefit from first half bookings, but I would note that even Q3 standalone service provider bookings were up on a year-over-year basis. So we're seeing pretty broad based momentum. I wouldn't over rotate on the first half’s results of bookings being the reason why we had a strong Q3.
Sami Badri: Got it. Got it. Thank you. And then just one quick follow-up. You're guiding to EPS growth being modestly ahead of your top line revenue growth, and there are some moving pieces of OI&D. I’m just hoping to get some more color on EPS. Given margins are essentially also basically flat in 2021, your operating margin guide. Does this mean that there's going to be a pronounced buyback taking place in 2021? Or is there something a little bit more – something very similar to what you guys have done historically in the quarter and end of the year?
Ken Miller: Yes. At this point, we don't have anything specific to talk about on 2021 as it relates to capital return program, other than we will remain consistent with past practices. We will return greater than 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. We’ll remain opportunistic. We don't have an implied large buyback baked into our current P&L outlook.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Long with Barclays. You may proceed with your question.
Tim Long: Thank you. Yes, just two, if I could. First, maybe Rami, if you could talk a little bit about you mentioned a good traction for 400 gigs switching. It sounds like you secured a new top 10 customer. Talk to us about the timeline of a more significant ramp and maybe some larger customer wins in that vertical. And then secondly, if you could just double click a little bit on the security piece, looked a little bit weak in the quarter. It's kind of lagged a little bit this year, so maybe if you can highlight what's going on there and what it'll take to turn that business around into next year. Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Yes. Thanks for the questions, Tim. I'll address both. So on the 400 gig side, I have confidence in the technology, and there's a lot of new technology that we've introduced into the market here. If you consider new silicon, that's 400 gig capable; new systems that are optimized for 400 gig and a vastly enhanced operating system that we call Junos Evolved. So that momentum that we're seeing is mostly been in the wide area, but we are starting to see some success in the data center. And the thing that I liked the most about this is that it gives us an opportunity to prove out the competitiveness of our product portfolio. And all of these wins involve some level of competition. It hardens our new technology stack and ensures that we're ready for more and more customers as the opportunity expands. Timing wise, I think, meaningful revenue will be next year sometime and in particular in the second half of the year. And then on the security front, our business is very tightly aligned to our high-end portfolio. That's where we have a real – a pretty high level of differentiation relative to peers in the industry. And that's tied to cloud provider and service provider purchases. In the service provider space, many of the security deployments are for 5G networks or networks that are gearing up for 5G traffic. So it just so happened at Q3 after a couple of actually solid quarters, Q3 was a little bit weaker because of the timing of some of these deployments. If I look at the pipeline, in particular, in the high-end, it looks very solid. So I'm actually not too concerned about the performance in Q3.
Tim Long: Okay. Thank you very much.
Rami Rahim: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may proceed with your question.
Samik Chatterjee: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to start off by seeing if you could flesh out the organic growth guidance for next year, a bit more by verticals, and particularly how you're thinking about the magnitude of growth when we kind of look at cloud and enterprise verticals separately. And what are you baking in terms of further award wins, for example, with cloud customers in that outlook? I have a follow-up.
Ken Miller: Yes, sure. So while there still are some uncertainties out there, we do believe based on the momentum we have and the investments we're making, that we will return to organic growth next year on a full year basis. We're comfortable with current street estimates, looking for low single-digit organic growth in 2021. From a vertical perspective, we expect enterprise and cloud to be growth drivers for us, and we expect further stabilization within service provider, and it news all kind of organic statements. Clearly, the pending acquisition of 128 Technology as we mentioned last week should add nearly a point to revenue growth on a full year basis in 2021. And we expect those trends likely to be stronger in the second half of 2021, if that's still a very much a ramping growth business.
Samik Chatterjee: Okay. And when I think about kind of the stabilization, which you're sounding more confident about for the service provider outlook, I think there's generally broader concern in the investment community that the outlook remains for a decline on a more structural basis there, even if it's closer to kind of stabilization. Can you address that? Like once you get past even 2021, do you see a path back to growth for the service provider business?
Rami Rahim: I think longer term there is a path to growth, but we're not talking about 2021 at this point. The thing that gives us confidence in our ability to further stabilize this segment, which would of course be improvement to this year, and this year is actually significant improvement to what we saw last year is execution. And in particular, it's the diversification in how we're approaching this market segment. Diversification from a technology standpoint where it's not just about selling routing into the wide area, it's also about selling switching for telco cloud data centers, as well as security for 5G deployment, and then its diversification from a customer NGO standpoint. So we took some bets with our account coverage, our sales transformation that we took a couple of years ago that are starting to pay off with international momentum in the telco space with accounts that traditionally have not bought much from Juniper, if anything at all. And we're starting to see some really encouraging momentum in verticals like the cable segment, both here, especially here in North America, but also to some extent internationally. So that is a matter of strategy, it's a matter of execution that gives us the confidence in the outlook.
Ken Miller: The only thing I would add is that diversification strategy that Rami mentioned from a service provider perspective, it absolutely applies in our other verticals as well, but we're seeing significant diversification in our Cloud business both, Tier 2, different logos on the hyperscalers and more use cases as well as obviously Enterprise is a very diverse vertical for us going forward. So I think universe diversification has absolutely been paying dividends for us here over the last few years.
Samik Chatterjee: Great. Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from a line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. You may proceed with your question.
Simon Leopold: Great. Thank you. First, I just wanted to maybe get a bridge clarification on the strength in service provider this quarter. How much of this do you consider the catch-up from the supply chain issues and how much maybe is coming from the exceptions of the product refreshes like vMX-5G and really what I'm going for is sort of what was catch-up versus what's more organic in terms of trends in service provider? And then I've got a longer term follow-up.
Ken Miller: Yes, so I would say the majority is as Rami mentioned is execution related. It's our ability to diversify away from certain Tier 1s into broader Tier 2 internationally as well as other verticals like cable. So I really believe execution is the primary driver of our success within service provider. There was a little bit of catch-up if you recall, Q1 we did miss expectations due to supply constraints that hit us late in the quarter. I think that was about $20 million to $30 million of kind of miss in Q1 that has probably been spread back into the Q2 and Q3 results. At this point, I feel pretty good that our supply constrain while still elevated, it is we're not losing ground nor we are necessarily gaining much. It's relatively consistent, particularly on the service provider vertical.
Rami Rahim: Yes. The only thing I will add here is just keep in mind our position among service provider is internationally. We are obviously deployed in many service provider networks across a variety of use cases and where we are deployed, typically there are empty slots in systems that are ready for upgrades when there are capacity requirements and we're constantly innovating and introducing new line cards like the latest MPC line cards for vMX that offer our customers a very easy inexpensive upgrade path to meet those capacity requirements and that certainly is something that's benefiting us today.
Simon Leopold: And then I wanted to see if maybe you could elaborate on longer-term objectives for your position in the campus environment. If I look at your campus switch share according to some of the third-parties, it's bounced around 2% to 3% range. And we certainly have heard some more comments in the channel checks about improved momentum of brand awareness. I guess what I'm really trying to get at is, thinking longer term, where do you want to take this business? How, – whether its market share, revenue objectives, could you quantify what the longer term plan is around your campus position? Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Absolutely. So if you look across LAN, Wireless LAN and let's include WAN as well, Enterprise WAN or SD-WAN, that's a $20 billion market opportunity, and we're actually not interested in that full opportunity. The part of that opportunity that we're interested in is the fastest growing part, which is the cloud-delivered, AI-driven opportunity. That's what our AI-driven enterprise solution is all about, where we want to offer the industry’s best clients to cloud solution that includes everything from the end user, irrespective of whether they're in the office or at home or wherever through their wireless WAN, LAN and through the WAN to their favorite cloud. That focus – that hyperfocus and the investments that we've made on that client to cloud solution is what is paying off for us right now with a very high degree of differentiation. Our objectives in a nutshell is growth is faster than market and that's exactly what we have seen – what we've been seeing for the last several quarters. In terms of longer-term aspirations, I would just say maybe this will be a little bit of a teaser. We'll do an analyst event in the first half of next year, and we can provide you with additional color on longer-term aspirations, but let's just say, if it doesn't come across clearly on this call, I'm very excited about this opportunity as well as our ability to take share.
Simon Leopold: Okay. I'm looking forward to the event to get some numbers behind it. Thank you.
Rami Rahim: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. You may proceed with your question.
Amit Daryanani: Yes. Thanks for taking my question, two for me as well I guess. I guess first-off, when I think about this low-single digit growth organically in calendar 2021, is there a way to think about it, is the growth going to be fairly even through the year, it's going to be more H1 heavy or not. And then to the extent that growth happens, is the expectation for that coming from a better macro environment or share gains, it does seem like you guys are picking up more share versus not the last few quarters.
Ken Miller: Yes. So from a seasonality perspective, I would expect it to be largely similar to this year on an organic basis. I do think the acquisition, as I mentioned before, of 128 Technologies will probably be more backend loaded, so that incremental near the point of growth would probably be more backend loaded, but from a Juniper organic perspective, I don't see the pattern changing much typically would go down obviously from Q4 to Q1, and then we build gradually throughout the year and I expect that to happen next year, as well. Sorry, what was the second part of the question?
Amit Daryanani: Yes. It’s something the expectations for calendar 2021, are these more driven by, we think the macro is going to be more better next year or share gains that seem to be helping you.
Ken Miller: Yes, it's absolutely about share gains. I mean, we're expecting the macro economy to be largely the same as I mentioned earlier, it's highly uncertain. However, we feel about the momentum we have and our presumption that the economy remains roughly the same. We don't see further deterioration. We expect to see organic growth. I believe many of our competitors are not going to see organic growth. So I expect us to take, share like we have been this year, I expect us to continue to take share next year that's our current working assumption.
Amit Daryanani: Got it. And then if I could just follow up, AT&T recently talked about the ability to start using white boxes for call routing solutions disaggregating the core layer, if you may. I’d love to get your perspective, how do you think of that dynamic and does that expand the competitive landscape in the call routing market and how does that impact Juniper?
Rami Rahim: Yes, so I'll take that. We obviously have a lot of respect for AT&T they remain a great partner and customer of ours, having said that I'll talk about disaggregation and white box more broadly. And my perspective here largely has not changed all that much. I’d look at the architectural side, the technology side of disaggregation and Juniper has actually already invested quite heavily in disaggregating our operating system, because it gives us a tremendous amount of benefit. It gives us flexibility, it gives us the ability to reap the benefits of having merchant silicon offerings and custom silicon offerings, and even offering our routing protocols DAX and so forth on x86. That is actually something that we've done because it benefits us. We've also taken the step of offering some parts of our products especially in the switching area in a disaggregated forum where customers can procure our network operating system independently of hardware and quite frankly, the general interests has been weak. So I think the vast majority of our customers are looking for integrated solutions. They want the openness and that flexibility between software and different hardware types, which we can absolutely offer. They want to procure services for the entire stack of technology that includes software and hardware. And if things were to change and more customers start to ask for some sort of disaggregation as a procurement model, it will be ready, because we made the investment. The only other thing I will say is, we have disaggregated components of our OS, our operating system like our routing protocol stack. And we call this for example, cRPD, containerized routing protocol daemon and we've offered it as a separate entity on our price list. And on that kind of disaggregation, we're actually seeing some very robust interests and the deployment models here are all over the place. You can put them in servers, you can put them on white box which is, but all of this is a net new opportunity for us. I don't see this as being cannibalistic in any way. They tend to be very different use cases than the kind of use cases that we serve today.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. You may proceed with your question.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. Perfect. Thanks for taking the question. I have two as well. I wanted to start first on the 400-gig opportunity. I think last quarter you announced your first 400-gig win. This quarter you talked about a Top 10 cloud customer. Can you just give us a framework of how much of a pipeline, how many wins you've had on the 400-gig, but has there been any timing change or shift out in your expectations of materializing revenue contribution? Because, I think the last quarter you alluded to maybe starting in earnest in early 2021? And then I have another quick one.
Rami Rahim: Yes. So in terms of the number of wins, I actually don't have that number right now. We can look to provide you that number in future quarters or at the analyst events in the first half of next year, but it's growing. And in many cases it's either growing with native 400-gig ports that are being deployed today based on the availability of optics or customers are buying 400-gig ready products using breakout cables and things of that nature to get 100-gig connectivity today, but with anticipation that they will eventually deploy 400-gig with the right optics. So I'm honestly quite pleased with the rate of growth this early in the game, across both SPs and cloud providers in this space. And as far as timing, I do think COVID has impacted the timing of 400-gig deployments in particular in the cloud provider space, but to some extent in the service provider space as well, but I don't think it's all that significant. I mean, I still think the ramp is going to be next year, I just think that the meaningful ramp will be more in the second half of the year.
Aaron Rakers: That's helpful. And then as a second question, just remind us again of how you see the 5G opportunity. As we start to hear Verizon talk about their base station deployments, really starting to ramp up and obviously we move into the next year. I'm just curious of how Juniper sees it from a core network infrastructure side and when that might start to benefit your Service Provider business?
Rami Rahim: Yes, absolutely. So obviously given our position with telco this is a very interesting dynamic for us and one that we track and one that we're investing in. And what it means specifically for Juniper is three different things. One I've mentioned already, which is around security. Our high-end security portfolio provides our customers with that perfect cocktail, if you will of performance and efficacy. That is really unique in the industry today and has resulted in a number of worldwide service provider win where service providers are deploying the technology to protect users, infrastructure and data in anticipation of 5G deployments. Second is about transport. I mean, there's no doubt that if you're going to have Faster RAN, Faster Radio Access Network, that's going to result in more bits that needs to be carried in fiber optic networks and that's where we come to play. Today, it's largely around core and edge. And as I mentioned earlier, increasingly it's about metro with the portfolio that we're starting to introduce into the market. And the third element of 5G that's very important to us is the data center, because 5G is inherently going to be a cloud native deployment model, especially with O-RAN and D-RAN deployments that are picking up steam in the industry. Those require highly distributed, highly automated data centers. And that's something where we've already seen some strong momentum in with the combination of our hardware portfolio, but then also our software-defined networking portfolio and Contrail that stitches the solution nicely for our customers.
Jess Lubert: Operator, we'll take two more questions.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal with Wolfe Research. You may proceed with your question.
Jeff Kvaal: Yes. Thank you. I have two questions for you all. And I think one is the cloud growth that you have sketched out for us in 2021, sort of flattish to low-single digit. Couldn't that be better? I mean, shouldn't that be better in cloud that's where the action is. The pandemic is driving roads there, sounds like there's some share gains coming. And I just – I feel like that's kind of a low bar. I was hoping that that number might be a little higher. So if you could shed some light on that, that'd be grateful. And then secondly Ken, if you wouldn't mind clarifying on your sort of slight EPS growth above revenues, is that inclusive of 128 or is that on an organic basis? Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Yes, let me address the first question and then I'll let Ken address the second one. On the cloud, it is entirely dependent on the deployments of large hyperscale cloud providers. I mean, keep in mind that we have a unique position among cloud providers with the footprint that we have and we preserved. And if you recall, if you've been tracking us for long enough, a couple of years back, we went through a fairly difficult product transition that's now behind us. And the whole idea there was to retain that footprint so that we can benefit from deployments that are happening. And we saw some of that in the first half of this year, but cloud has always been a highly lumpy type of vertical because of the concentrated nature of the customer base and CapEx expenditures within that customer base. So I remain optimistic about cloud as a vertical that we focus on long-term, but we're doing everything we can and the rest is really up to our customers and their deployment patterns.
Ken Miller: And on the EPS front, the commentary provided for 2021 where we expect non-GAAP EPS to grow slightly faster than revenue that does include 128 Technology, which we mentioned is about $0.05 diluted, that's our expectation that includes that dilution from 128 Technologies.
Jeff Kvaal: Okay. Thank you all very much.
Rami Rahim: Yes. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed with your question.
Meta Marshall: Great. Thanks. I just wanted to ask a question on product gross margins and just kind of the down take year-over-year, I would think with stronger routing performance that maybe margins would be a little bit better. So is that, should we consider some of that weakness just from stronger deployments or just any commentary around gross margins kind of on a year-over-year product basis would be helpful. Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Yes. So there's really two drivers. One would be the COVID related costs that we talked about a lot on the last call. So clearly there are some year-on-year comp differences. Our margin would have been up a full point in the Juniper aggregate level, on the product side only it would have been closer to a 0.5 increase if it weren't for some of these COVID elevated costs. It's still is down year-on-year, even if you adjust for that on the product only side and that is a factor of mix. And it's to your point it's not as simple as just looking routing versus switching or service provider versus enterprise. You really have to get down a level into what's happening in a mix. One example I'll mention is software, right. So the software mix is clearly down year-on-year, we've talked about that and that's hurting margins a bit on a year-to-year basis. There's also just different product mix, different customer mix, different deal mix this all factors into our gross margin results. We're pleased with our performance this year. We expect to grow margin with volume going forward. We expect software mix to become a bigger contributor in next year, which will also help gross margin expand on a year-over-year basis and we'll continue to focus on value engineering efforts. So we feel confident about where we are and where we're headed with gross margin.
Meta Marshall: Got it. And then maybe just a follow-up, you guys have alluded to this, but just in terms of some of the enterprise strength that you're seeing, would you characterize that as you've made the portfolio more – you've buffered the portfolio, you've made the sales investments or just kind of improved buying behavior on part of the customer, that seems as if it's the sales investments that you're kind of pointing to primarily at least in early days and product portfolio kind of in 2021, but just any last commentary there.
Rami Rahim: Yes. I'd be happy to address that. Definitely, we've made some investments, both in go to market in sales in particular, but then also in the product portfolio. I talked a lot about the differentiation in the AI-driven enterprise around campus and branch, and the wide area, but I also just emphasize that our innovation is strong in the data center as well and we've seen some real great momentum in the data center across not just the enterprise, but also with telcos. They're all deploying lots of data centers in a distributed fashion to get ready for 5G deployments to offer different types of virtualized services. Both go to market and portfolio strength is the primary driver for our enterprise momentum.
Meta Marshall: Great. Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of today's question-and-answer session. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for participation. Have a great rest of your evening.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-07-28 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to Juniper Networks second quarter 2020 earnings results conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. Please note,, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jess Lubert, Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.
Jess Lubert: Thank you operator. Good afternoon and welcome to our second quarter 2020 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results might differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release and CFO commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today and Juniper undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results is included in today's press release. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami.
Rami Rahim: Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us during these difficult times. Like many of you on this call, we are continuing to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic and taking actions to both meet the needs of our customers and ensure the safety of our work force. Most of our employees are continuing to work from home and successfully leveraging the various technologies enabled by the network to maintain a high-level of productivity despite the current environment. To this last point, the strategic importance of the global network has never been clearer and I believe the long term outlook for the markets we serve remain positive. We are investing to not only survive the current environment, but to capitalize on the opportunities our markets present and come out stronger on the other side. Now on to our results. We delivered better than expected results during the June quarter with revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1,086 million and $0.35 respectively, both exceeding the midpoint of our guidance. Overall orders experienced mid single digit year-over-year growth with double digit improvements in our cloud and service provider segments more than offsetting a mid single digit decline in our enterprise business. We are entering Q3 with strong backlog and remain optimistic regarding our ability to navigate ongoing supply chain disruption. We are executing well in the current environment. While the COVID-19 pandemic continue to present challenges, we believe we are we successfully meeting the needs of our customers and helping many of them deliver the critical bandwidth required to support the global economy as millions of people around the world work from home and increasingly leverage cloud-based services. We remain optimistic regarding our competitive positioning and our ability to capitalize on some of the large industry transitions that are likely to play out over the next few years. On this last point, I would like to highlight that we secured our first 400 gigs win during the June quarter with opportunities that span across each of the verticals and geographies that we serve. While our initial wins are for wide area use cases, these opportunities represent net new footprint and increased confidence in our ability to deliver the system density, programmability, power footprint and software needed to gain share in both wide area and data center used cases. While our pipeline of 400 gig opportunities is healthy and we are encouraged by recent wins we secured, many of the bigger opportunities we are targeting have yet to be decided. Based on our latest customer conversations, we continue to expect our 400 gig revenue opportunities to begin in earnest during early 2021 and become a more material driver through the course of the year. Despite healthy momentum entering the second half of the year, the macro environment remains very uncertain and our longer term visibility remains limited, particularly with respect to the trajectory of our enterprise business. As a result, we are continuing to offer limited full year guidance and would encourage you to build your model conservatively. Now I would like to provide some additional insight into the quarter and address some of the key developments we are seeing within each of our core verticals. Starting with cloud, we experienced healthy results during the June quarter as the business was up slightly and grew for fifth consecutive quarter despite a more difficult year-over-year comp. We continue to see momentum within our customers' wide area networks, particularly for some of our routing products. Order trends remained healthy with good momentum at multiple hyperscale accounts as well as with our Tier 2 cloud customers. Highlighting the increased diversity of our hyperscale business, our largest cloud customer in the June quarter was different as compared to the March period. Based on our Q2 results and recent orders, we still expect to see low to mid single digit cloud growth in 2020, although we would expect to see some seasonality during the September quarter. We maintain strong durable franchises at each of our hyperscale customers and should be well-positioned to benefit from continued capacity growth in the use cases we own. While our service provider revenue modestly declined during Q2, this business continued to be most impacted by our stock supply chain challenges with orders being a second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Although we are seeing some COVID-19 related capacity benefits, we believe much of the service provider order strength we experienced is attributable to our diversification efforts across customers and products over the last few years. To this point, we are continuing to see improved momentum with several of our U.S. cable customers as well as Tier 2 and Tier 3 carriers in international markets. We are also seeing increased carrier adoption of our switching and security offerings in addition to our traditional routing platforms. We believe we remain well-positioned with our service provider customers and that our continuing efforts to diversify our customer base and increase the breadth of our offering should benefit this business through the remainder of the year. While we acknowledge that some of our service provider customers are continuing to face business challenges that may impact their ability to spend in future quarters, based on our recent momentum and customer conversations, we continue to believe our service provider business is likely to see a mid single digit decline in 2020. Our enterprise business slightly declined year-over-year, but exceeded our initial expectations for the period. Strength in the financial services business as well as with some of our largest strategic accounts more than offset weaker than anticipated results from our U.S. federal business which was impacted by COVID-19 timing dynamics that we expect to reverse during the current quarter. While our overall enterprise business is being impacted by the uncertain macro environment which have caused some customers to reevaluate plans, we are continuing to see very strong momentum with Mist, which is driving an increasing level of confidence in our ability to gain enterprise share and return to growth once the pandemic subsides. To this point, I would like to highlight that Mist reported another record quarter with orders rising more than 170% on a year-over-year basis and new logos increasing by more than 100% year-over-year. Mist has now secured four Fortune 10 accounts and we saw a material increase in demand generation from the channel reflecting the true differentiation of the product. In addition, Mist launched a new software subscription premium analytics that has generated strong interest due to its ability to enable use cases such as proximity tracing, journey mapping and hot zone alerting to help enterprises enable social distancing and keep employees safe as they start returning to work. Our enterprise at home offering also generated strong interest from enterprises due to the increase in work from home. While Mist is continuing to exceed expectations, our strategy to Mystify additional elements of our switching, enterprise routing and security portfolio through the year is helping us take share from competitors and should create incremental pull-through opportunities for our enterprise offering in future periods. Our software revenue declined in the quarter and accounted for less than 10% of sales due to a lower mix of certain products that drive higher on-box attach rates of perpetual licenses. That said, our software orders grew 7% year-over-year due to a combination of strong Mist and security subscriptions as well as our efforts to transition certain perpetual software offerings to term-based subscription. We believe growth in these recurring software offerings is an encouraging dynamic that should improve visibility over time and give us confidence in the long term outlook for our software revenue. I would like to mention that our services team delivered another solid quarter and continues to grow on a year-over-year basis due to strong renewals and service attach rates. Our services margins continued to improve year-over-year and our customer satisfaction rates are currently at record levels. Our services team continues to execute extremely well and ensure our customers receive an excellent experience. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ken who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail.
Ken Miller: Thank you Rami and good afternoon everyone. I will start by discussing our second quarter results, then provide some color on our outlook. We ended the second quarter of 2020 at $1,086 million in revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.35, both above the midpoint of our guidance range. We experienced strong demand in the quarter with orders growing mid single digits year-over-year exceeding our expectations. Revenue was down 1% year-over-year, as expected supply constraints resulted in extended lead times throughout the quarter. Looking at our revenue by vertical. On a sequential basis, all verticals grew with service provider growing 16%, cloud growing 9% and enterprise growing 1%. On a year-over-year basis, cloud grew slightly year-over-year while both enterprise and service provider declined 2%. From a technology perspective, routing and switching decreased 3% year-over-year and security decreased 1% year-over-year. Our services business increased 1% year-over-year. As Rami mentioned, software revenue was below 10% of total revenue for the quarter and declined year-over-year. However, software bookings grew 7% year-over-year. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, six were cloud, three were service provider and one was an enterprise. Non-GAAP gross margins were 58.3%, below our expectations primarily due to higher than anticipated COVID-19 related logistics cost. If it weren't for the COVID-19 elevated logistics cost, we would have posted non-gap gross margins of approximately 59.5%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were flat year-over-year and declined 3% sequentially, which is in line with our guidance range. Our operating expenses in Q2 benefited from COVID-19 related savings. Cash flow from operations was $98 million. We paid $66 million in dividends reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of the second quarter of 2020 was $2.6 billion, slightly up from the first quarter of 2020. Now I would like to provide some color on our guidance, which you could find detailed in the CFO commentary available on our website. At the midpoint of our Q3 guidance, we expect to see sequential revenue and earnings growth. Confidence in our forecast is driven by strong backlog and strength within our service provider and cloud verticals. We believe these factors should help offset continued uncertainty in parts of our enterprise market. We expect to see sequential volume driven improvements in our non-GAAP gross margin and a more favorable customer mix during the September quarter. We expect logistics and other supply chain related costs to remain elevated, consistent with Q2 levels due to the effects of the ongoing pandemic. We expect third quarter non-GAAP operating expenses to be essentially flat compared Q2 as we continue to benefit from lower travel costs due to COVID-19. We will remain focused on prudent cost management while continuing to invest to capture future opportunities. Turning to our capital return program. Our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.20 per share to be paid during the third quarter. We remain committed to paying our dividend and will remain opportunistic with respect to share buybacks. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success, especially in this challenging environment. Now, I would like to open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Rod Hall: Yes. Hi guys. Thanks for the question. I wanted to start off with the service provider trends. Those are way better this quarter than they have been for many quarters. Actually, the sequential on that is up a lot and the year-over-year down not much. So I wondered if you could dig into that a little bit more, talk about how sustainable that trend is and maybe what drove it a little bit in terms of color? And then I have got a follow-up to that.
Rami Rahim: Yes. Thanks, Rod, for the question. Certainly, we are pleased with the results that we saw for service provider in not just Q2 but in the first half of the year. Revenue doesn't point to the whole story. As we mentioned, orders in the service provider vertical were up double digits. And I think there are a number of different factors. There is an element of this that is COVID related, customers that are trying to deal with an increase in network capacity or customers that are trying to get ahead of any potential for supply chain disruptions. That's an element of it. But I actually think the bigger factor at play here are a couple of things that have to do with the first customer diversity. We have as a matter of strategy been diversifying our reach within the telco segment to Tier 2 and Tier 3. telcos, both here as well as internationally. And then there is a technology diversity element to it. We saw really strong switching momentum among our telco customers and e-security. We have a strong mobile and especially 5G related security solution that's seeing some really great demand with our customers. So certainly, I think that to the extent that we are in a new normal relative to telco spending dealing with capacity constraints, that should last. And there is a meaningful element that's just not COVID related at all and that's really a matter of execution and that's where I just think we are executing really well, Rod.
Rod Hall: Okay. Thanks Rami. And then on the follow-up, I wanted to ask you guys about the supply chain elongation of lead times and whether, I know you started talking about that last quarter and it continued this quarter and now you are saying they will continue the following quarter. Is it a case now where revenues are kind of normalized for that? Or so we just keep pushing revenue out into the future because of these supply chain disruptions? Or do you think you are actually losing revenue as a result of it? Can you comment on the effect on what we should expect in terms of the underlying revenue trajectory? And if you have got any thoughts on when that might ease in terms of impact to you, that would be interesting as well?
Ken Miller: Yes. So we are continuing to manage through various supply chain challenges that we talked about last quarter. Lead time did remain extended throughout the quarter. Normal lead times for us on average is about two to four weeks. We are seeing today's lead times or Q2's lead times, I should say, closer to that four to eight weeks on average level. So you can see the level of extension there. We did see some stabilization, quite a bit of it, towards the end of Q2. We do expect things to stabilize throughout Q3 and actually get better over the second half. We just don't have perfect line of sight as to when those improvements are going to happen. So we are not factoring any improvements into our Q3 guide. However, clearly, the team is driving to get improvements each and every week. So we do expect improvements in the second half, just not factoring it in the Q3 guide, given all the uncertainties involved. From a revenue perspective, I would say, it's a similar dynamic where you saw the bookings growth in the quarter but revenue was modestly down, similar to what we saw in Q1. When we start to actually ship more backlog than we book, you will see revenue growth be faster than bookings. But for Q2, we saw kind of a similar dynamic that we saw in Q1 which is more of a backlog build.
Ken Miller: Yes. Just to add, Rod, to the question. I don't believe we are losing as a result of this. There is no doubt, it's a challenging situation. But I don't think it's unique to Juniper and I think our customers recognize that this is an industrywide challenge that we are dealing with here. Couple that with the fact that, these products are not typically interchangeable from one technology provider to another technology provider, depending on the particular use case that you are addressing.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Tim Long with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Tim Long: Thank you. If I could just start off with the 400 gig side. Rami, you talked about a win there and some larger opportunity still to come. Could you just give us a sense, as those started to come in or materialize next year, how are you thinking about the breadth of that business and where it will be playing? And curious if you can just give us some of your thoughts on Nokia's announcements to kind of go after this market a little bit more? Does that change the dynamic? And then I have a separate follow-up.
Rami Rahim: Yes. Thank you for the question, Tim. So 400 gig has been a big bet for us for quite some time. This is an area that we have invested in. And as I have mentioned previously, we have introduced really a brand-new technology stack that includes new silicon technology, systems and we have also revamped significant portions of our operating system to make it essentially cloud-ready for 400 gig deployments. There have been early wins and we are very pleased with that because of the fact that they have been competitive wins. They have been wins that have taken up into net new networks. I know at least a couple of those went into WAN for service providers as well as WAN for cloud providers where they are essentially net new use cases that we have now been selected to deploy. So although they are not all that meaningful yet from the standpoint of revenue for our business, to me the important thing is that it gives us the confidence that that new technology stack that we have brought into the market is working, is working well and is very competitive. So that leads me to the next part of your question around the competition. We are very used to operating in an environment where there are competitors, strong competitors. And I would just say that we are very confident that the technology stack that we have is competitive. We are seeing the early proof points. And then after that, I think the footprint that we have among telcos and the cloud providers that truly gives us the opportunity to leverage to launch into 400 gig use cases and deployments, I think, it's something that we can absolutely use to grow this part of our business.
Tim Long: Okay. Great. And then just to follow up on the enterprise side. It sounds like Mist is doing well. You guys have obviously had a good big push there. Just talk, Rami, a little bit about, obviously, the changing dynamic on what the workspace of the enterprise or the campus is going to look like from a number of people? So do you think there is an impact on your growth medium to longer term based on the slope of employee repopulating and the scale to which there is enterprise? Or do you think the growth rate there for you is unaffected? Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Yes. It's a great question and obviously one that we thought long and hard about. The net of the answer to your question is that, whereas in the short term, there is going to be some disruption and there is going to be some challenges as a result of the macro situation, I do believe that as we emerge from the pandemic, we will see actually strong momentum and growth, both in the markets that we serve and in terms of the strength of our technology and our ability to take share. And the reason being that, we focused not just on your standard legacy-based enterprise wireless LAN deployments, we are really focusing on an end-to-end solution that includes wireless LAN, LAN and WAN. And many enterprises, even today, are thinking about how to transform their businesses to take into account or to take advantage of these cloud-delivered AI driven solutions. I think our solution here is very strong. Honestly, the win rate is phenomenal, even in this environment. So yes, we saw some weakness in the Q2 timeframe. It was still better than what we expected and I believe we are actually take share on the strength of our portfolio. The last comment I will mention here is, we really are addressing solutions that are very pertinent to what our customers are thinking about today. So our customers want safe return to work solutions that will allow them to understand that there are hotspots in their campuses or if there is in fact an issue with an employee getting sick they can understand where that employee has been and who needs to be notified. These are solutions that really go to the heart of the kinds of problems that need to be solved as a company starts to return to work.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson with Needham. Please proceed with your question.
Alex Henderson: Thank you. I was hoping you would talk a little about your comment on the enterprise business. Specifically, you stated that the U.S. federal business was well-off in the quarter, but you expected it to rebound and it seemed somewhat countervailing to the trajectory of spending in government and state and local given the clear physical constraints that are developing as a result of the COVID. What gives you confidence that's going to recover and improve in the third quarter?
Rami Rahim: Well, the third quarter is traditionally the fiscal year-end for the federal government. So it's typically been a stronger quarter. There is that dynamic. But I think it's more than that. We have obviously had our business reviews and we are looking at our pipelines, we are looking at projects and in all of those dimensions, there are opportunities out there. There are projects out there. We don't believe, although we are monitoring very closely, we don't believe that the projects have been canceled or even moved out in any meaningful way. There has been disruption as a result of COVID to the short term timing of the project. But we still remain pretty optimistic about this part of our business.
Alex Henderson: The follow-up question is, obviously enterprise is a very important piece of the puzzle and a driver going forward. Mist is a key piece of that. It looks like your Mist business is booming yet your enterprise business was soft. Is that a function of the timing differential between current revenue recognition and the incremental pull-through? When would the pull-through cast aside post a Mist order? Is that lagged somewhat?
Ken Miller: Yes. So the Mist model is, about 60% of the revenue is recognized upfront in the form of hardware and then there is a good amount that's deferred in a SaaS delivered license, cloud delivered license. So there is a fair amount of deferred revenue in a Mist transaction. I would just also highlight, our enterprise business is quite large and has many used cases, data center use cases, campus and enterprise switching, security, routing, et cetera. So while Mist is very fast growing, it is still relatively small as compared to the rest of our enterprise portfolio at this point, but it is growing quite nicely obviously. And it is pulling through other resolutions as part of the Mist sale.
Rami Rahim: Yes. And Alex --
Alex Henderson: The question was the timing of the pull-through relative to Mist orders. When orders come in, how long a lead time before you get pull through for other products?
Rami Rahim: I see. Yes, first, I can tell you that when we sell Mist, we are really selling a portfolio. I know Mist, when we acquired the company, it was a wireless LAN solution. But when we combined with Mist, we really did it because the strategy was to take that cloud-delivered AI-driven engine and to extend it across our entire portfolio. We started to do that with our wired switching and then now we are starting to incorporate our WAN transformation, our SD-WAN solution. In at least three of the four Fortune 10 accounts that I mentioned in my prepared remarks, those are combined wireless LAN and LAN switching under the Mist umbrella. But when you have a break in, especially in a large account, typically it's a small break in, to begin with. And then you build on it over time. The glue, the real secret sauce here is the cloud-delivered AI driven experience for our customers. Once you have sort of start captured and impressed your customers with that solution, it becomes much easier to scale over time. So I would say, we are early days in terms of reaping the full benefit or the full potential of these solutions.
Ken Miller: Yes. It's hard to quantify precisely. But in our models, we think it's a three to six months kind of pull-through effort to really start to see the leverage of the Mist for the rest of the portfolio through.
Alex Henderson: That's helpful. Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.
Ittai Kidron: Hi guys. Just a couple questions for me, first on the enterprise. Rami, can you talk about the linearity in the quarter? Was this kind of an even quarter? Or started strong, ended soft? I know it sounded like a lot of the issues you have had with enterprise last quarter seems like a repeat this quarter. I am just trying to understand, from a pattern standpoint, did it end on a positive note or not?
Rami Rahim: I think it was normal. I look to Ken here, but I think there was nothing out of the normal in terms of the linearity of the quarter. And as I mentioned, the results that we saw in the enterprise were really as expected or maybe even a little bit better than what we expected, considering the dynamics. It's left to be seen, but based on our win rates and our competitive positioning, I believe we are taking share in the enterprise.
Ittai Kidron: Got it. And then as a follow-up from on the software side of that. It was down there and with Mist clearly having a good quarter. Can you help me understand what components of software did not do well? Is that the on-box software that I assume underperformed in the quarter?
Rami Rahim: Ittai, let me give you a couple of statistics on our software business. Off-box orders increased by 50% year-over-year. And in off-box, subscriptions orders increased by even more than that, more than 50%. And then SaaS subscription increased by over 85% year-over-year. So the off-box metrics are very healthy. The weakness was entirely a result of on-box flex licenses. And it just so happened that many of the products that we sold in the Q2 timeframe were products that did not yet benefit or don't have the flex on-box licensing component.
Ken Miller: Yes. And just to clarify, it was actually some of the on-box perpetual licenses that we sold as disaggregated model. The flex license model is actually ramping within the on-box. Those are the term-based licenses. We are seeing an increase in term-based subscription licenses. But the perpetual disaggregated hardware software licensing scheme that we had in the past, we saw a decline in that model.
Ittai Kidron: Just so maybe I can add to that, Ken, on that front. Given that the component that was software perpetual, is there anything to be learned or to deduct from that with respect to the mix of chassis versus blades or something like that? Is there a correlation there between that and your perpetual mix?
Ken Miller: It's really not a chassis versus blade thing. Its really a transition from legacy perpetual into more term-based subscription recurring revenue models that we are driving. And we did see good success in those metrics. That's really what's important to us. So we expect to grow software from Q2 as we enter into Q3.
Rami Rahim: And just to add, our strategy has always been to grow the number of platforms that will leverage our flex licensing model and that certainly is going to help in the out quarters.
Ken Miller: Absolutely.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of George Notter with Jefferies. Proceed you are your question.
George Notter: Hi guys. Thanks very much. I guess I wanted to ask about switching business. I know you guys have been working on transceiver development that was kind of feeding into your 400 gig efforts and obviously you are having a bit of success now on 400 gig in terms of customer wins. But can you talk about transceiver development? Where is that? And is it translating at the win level? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: The short answer to the translating to our win is no, because it's not actually shipping yet. This is a pretty ambitious project where we believe we have truly differentiated technology that will achieve a level of integration in optical transceivers that is better than anything else that's out there. But it's a difficult project, a challenging project and one that we are working through. Our objective, our goal has always been to release products in time for the ramp of 400 gig next year. And that's what we are working towards. The success, the early success that we are seeing in 400 gig, quite frankly, is based on the merits of our software, our silicon and our system strategy. Transceivers, our optical transceivers, once we ship them would really be sort of an icing on top, not mandatory for our success of 400 gig.
George Notter: Okay. Thank you.
Rami Rahim: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Proceed with the question.
Samik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to dig into the cloud vertical a bit here and have a couple of questions on that. Firstly, you had a good quarter with the cloud customers. But when I look at the product segments there, it seems like the strength really came from routing and sort of switching. So I just wanted to understand what kind of insights can draw in terms of what is driving the spend from the cloud customers with your product there? Is it more of the upgrade of the certain layers that's not really benefiting you on the switching side? I just wanted to understand the dynamics there. And I have a follow-up. Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Yes. Thanks for the question, Samik. So just keep in mind that our switching solutions that we sell into the hyperscale cloud provider space are actually used in wide area networks. So this is something that we have talked to you about in past quarter as well. It remains true today. So to think of switching in sort of the traditional sense of switching, it's not really the use case that's deployed by hyperscale cloud providers. All our routing and wide-area use cases within the cloud provider segment, especially hyperscale cloud providers, was very strong. We saw meaningful order strength on a year-over-year basis. And that's, I think, a function of the existing deployments or the footprint that we have and the strength of our portfolio.
Samik Chatterjee: And then just following up on the 400 gig win here. I understand it seems like it's one of the smaller cloud providers. But in terms of timing, are you expecting most of the, based on your visibility, are you expecting most of Tier 2 to kind of have a similar timing in terms of their upgrade cycles? And any updates on how you are thinking about the timing for the hyperscalers as well on 400 gig?
Rami Rahim: Yes. I believe that it's going to be very much based on the economics and availability of 400 gig optics. And that's very much sort of end of year and really getting to revenue growth next year. So I believe that's true for both hyperscale as well as some of the smaller cloud providers.
Samik Chatterjee: Okay. Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Tal Liani: Hi. Thanks guys. I went back to previous quarters and 2Q is always strong. It was two years ago, it was up 11% sequentially, last year 10% percent, this year 9%. So I am trying to understand why you are focusing on the sequential trends and not on the year-over-year trends? Because last year, the comps were not very difficult. The comps in the year was down 8%, the quarter was down 8% on year-over-year. So the question is, what drives you to be positive given that year-over-year you the growth is minus 1.5% and higher declines of the products? Are there any projects that you are waiting for that are starting to materialize? Or can you link some of the trends you see beneath the surface that maybe the numbers don't tell us? Can you link it to some bigger kind of agendas of carriers like 5G or anything that you can refer to?
Ken Miller: Yes. So why don't I start and pass it to you, Rami, to add more color. But a lot of the commentary is based on, as compared to guidance expectations we had when we entered the quarter. Clearly those numbers, those expectations were lowered, as compared to when we entered the year. We absolutely have a long term principle to grow topline and to expand bottomline. That was our expectation this year as well. Not too long ago, but kind of in a pre-COVID world, we felt we were on track for that. With COVID, we do believe that could have a negative impact on our business, particularly in enterprise. And so we reset expectations, if you will. And we are ahead of those reset expectations. I think that's the main takeaway. We did see year-over-year growth in bookings which is a great sign. From a revenue perspective, it was modestly down year-over-year. but the opportunity to deliver against the expectations we have internally now, I feel pretty good about. Rami, do you want to add any more color there?
Rami Rahim: Nothing other than just that, you are asking about underlying trends. I think the order strength and the order momentum is that trend, a double digit growth in cloud provider, double digit growth on a year-over-year basis in the service provider segment. And like I said, I think we are executing well in a challenging dynamic environment on the enterprise side based on just the strength of our portfolio.
Tal Liani: Got it. I don't know if I have time for another question. But it is your outlook for routing better now than before? And let's COVID aside. Touting has been going under pressure for more than five years, seven years. And the question is whether we have get to a point where routing finally starts growing because there is just a need for bandwidth processing power?
Rami Rahim: Well, let me put it this way. We said cloud providers should grow mid single digit for the year all up on a full year basis, not your year-over-year and service provider would be sort of mid single digit decline. We are off to a very strong start in both of those segments. We are not yet ready to change our full year perspective. But let's just say, I am very encouraged by the momentum that we see today.
Tal Liani: Great. Thank you.
Rami Rahim: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
Simon Leopold: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I want to see if maybe you could unpack the cloud customers a little bit. I think I heard you mention in the prepared remarks that the top cloud customer was different this quarter than the last quarter. And what I am really trying to get an understanding of is, what kind of concentration you have within this particular group of customers and maybe the mix of what you classify as Tier 2 versus hyperscale? Just trying to really get down to understanding diversity in that? And then I have got a follow-up.
Rami Rahim: Yes. Let me see how I can answer that. There is always a high degree of concentration when you are talking about hyperscale, just by virtue of the fact there are very few number of hyperscale customers. I mean we measure them top five by their revenue, right, their own services revenue. So within hyperscale, the point that we just wanted to make is, we enjoy really unique solid footprint with a number of them. It's not a one hyperscale customer story. And the fact that in the last couple of quarters we have had two different cloud providers, hyperscale cloud providers emerge as the number one cloud provider customer in particular quarter is, I think, indicative of that. And then there is the broader cloud provider opportunity where we have really focused on broadening our reach into Tier 2, Tier 3 as well as into the large cloud providers in Asia and China in particular, where we have seen some success. So that's how I would respond to your question around the concentration of the opportunity and the diversity of our opportunity.
Simon Leopold: And just to clarify, how material would be Tier 2s in that overall cloud numbers? Is it sort of roughly a third of that? Is that the way to think about it? I guess I am looking for how material Tier 2 is?
Ken Miller: Yes. We haven't broken down exactly Tier 2 but we have said previously that the top 10 customers account for approximately 80% of the overall vertical. It's a very concentrated vertical. That gives you a good, a pretty good feel for how big our Tier 2 business is.
Rami Rahim: And if you were to look at that from the standpoint of what CapEx spend by those customers, it would look probably similar.
Simon Leopold: And then the follow-up I had was regarding the MX. You have announced a series of refresh elements, new line cards. And I have the impression that a lot of the certification evaluations maybe took longer than you once expected. And I want to see if you have got a sense of whether or not the completion of evaluations by your service provider customers of MX refreshes is contributing to the improved router growth? If this is sort of what we been looking for? Or if that's still on to come or whether that occurred and didn't really move the needle? Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Yes. It's a good question. In both MX and PTX, we saw very strong sequential growth as we expected from a revenue standpoint and we saw solid bookings growth on a year-over-year basis. And yes, part of the momentum in the MX is that we are starting to see a ramp in some of these new line cards that have emerged from the certification phase and they are going into the early revenue phase.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Meta Marshall: Great. Thanks. Two questions for me. Maybe on kind of the campus business. Have conversation started with customers as to what changes of investments are potentially going to take place if a greater portion of their employees work from home, either additional in-home equipment or less kind of on-campus equipment? And then maybe second question, just on maybe the Tier 2 cloud. Clearly, a lot of those SaaS providers saw a huge increase in traffic due to COVID related instances. And has there been any change in conversation as to whether they will continue to build their own data centers versus leveraging other public clouds? That's it. Thanks guys.
Rami Rahim: Yes. Two great questions. First on the campus opportunity. I think there are a couple of things that we should keep in mind. First is, we are focusing on enterprises that are large, that typically have businesses that are going to be more resilient to the pandemic crisis. Government, public sector, higher ed are all, even retail, large retailers that have businesses that are resilient, especially those that are in e-commerce that are resilient to COVID are areas that we are very much deliberately focusing on. And that's helping our business in the current state and I think it certainly will help us post-pandemic. The second element is that many of our customers today are looking for next-gen cloud-delivered AI driven solutions, not sort of the legacy on-prem stuff. They are really looking at transforming their wireless LAN, LAN and WAN solutions. And that's true now and it's certainly true for post-pandemic. And those are the opportunities that we are sort of laser targeting right now and we are seeing some very good success there. On Tier 2 and Tier 3 cloud and sort to shift to public cloud, it's a mixed bag. I think there are puts and takes. There are definitely some Tier 2s and 3s that will, in this time in particular, pivot to using public cloud and honestly will benefit from that through serving the public cloud, the hyperscale cloud providers. But there are a lot of Tier 2, Tier 3 cloud providers that we have benefited from over the last couple of quarters with momentum in this part of our business that are sticking to their own solutions because they believe that's just going to be the most economical way forward for them.
Meta Marshall: Great. Thanks guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Koontz with Rosenblatt Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Ryan Koontz: Hi. Thanks for the question. Maybe you can comment on your strength in APAC, both year-over-year and Q-over-Q? You have got some fairly easy compares there. But how much of that do you tribute to like 5G programs in Japan and Korea? And then the second question, kind of more broadly, how do you see 5G driving Metro upgrades globally in some of your SPs. Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Yes. Great question. So I am happy with our results in APAC. In fact, sequentially all of our geos were up. So we saw good momentum sequentially across Americas, EMEA and APAC. APAC, you are right. I mean it's working off of an easier compare after several quarters of decline. I think we are executing well in APAC. I think Asia-Pacific is also a little bit ahead of the U.S. when it comes to dealing with the pandemic and emerging from the economic turmoil that we are benefiting from. A lot of strength is telco related and I do believe that some of it is 5G related. And in particular to 5G, there are a number of ways that we benefit. One is in transport, whether it would be Metro buildouts or edge and core opportunities. The other one would be in security, where we have seen now for a number of quarters real strength in our security business specific to telcos and especially telcos that are starting to build out their security infrastructure in preparation for 5G. And then the last dimension of success that we have seen, again not just in APAC but really worldwide but included APAC would be in our telco cloud solutions. 5G will be a cloud native solution. Many of the services that will be offered in 5G will essentially be offered in software in a virtualized form. And we have very strong solution for that today that we are benefiting from.
Ryan Koontz: Helpful. A little follow-up there on the telco cloud. Are you seeing more of a trend, swinging back towards telco looking to outsource that cloud? We have seen announcements from Microsoft and Amazon there. And how do you see that playing out in the telco cloud?
Rami Rahim: Yes. It's also very good question. Again, there I think it's very much a mixed bag. There are going to be some telcos that are comfortable and want to work with the hyperscale cloud providers and again, there I think we benefit in indirect ways. But there is definitely an opportunity that we see where telcos really want more of a, I wouldn't say build it themselves but to partner with technology providers like Juniper and others to put together telco solutions to offer differentiated edge services, where they have the best locations already in their networks available to deliver those services. And that turns out to be an area where we have a lot of experience, some great technology and good momentum with the telco customers.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
Irvin Liu: Hi. Thanks. This is Irvin Liu, dialing in from Amit. I had a question and a follow-up as well. My first question is on your off-box software subscription momentum driven by Mist. Can you talk about the originations of some of these sales? Are you seeing these wins from mid-cycle add-ons? Or is this more of an upgrade cycle driven story? And longer term, should we still expect software revenue to trend above 10% of revenue?
Rami Rahim: Yes. So on the first question, a lot of the Mist momentum we are seeing are net new wins and net new logos. So there is essentially the introduction of SaaS based subscription services into net new accounts. There are certainly some renewals that are out there. I don't know the exact numbers off the top of my head, but a lot of the Mist momentum has been as a result of the 100% year-over-year growth in net new logos, new opportunities that we are winning.
Ken Miller: Yes. On the 10% of the revenue, that's clearly our goal is to grow software over time. We have that goals beyond 10% over the next couple years. As far as going forward, I do expect us to grow in Q3 off the Q2 levels, but really no commitment yet on the 10% going forward, other than, yes, we do expect to get back there and surpass it over time as our subscription business starts to a become more and more relevant in overall software story.
Irvin Liu: Got it. Thanks. And I actually wanted to ask about the other technology transition which is the Wi-Fi 6 cycle. Can you share your thoughts on when you expect wireless LAN to become a more material portion of your revenue looking forward? Is there potential for there to be a standalone revenue breakout for wireless LAN on your P&L in the near future?
Rami Rahim: Well, that's a homework assignment for Ken. We are not baking it out now. But I will say this, Wi-Fi 6 is a great opportunity for us. We already have our Wi-Fi 6 access points in the market today that are selling. But Wi-Fi 6 on its own, I think is there are going to be many vendors that offer it. AI powered cloud-delivered Wi-Fi 6, because with Wi-Fi 6 comes a certain level of complexity that operators need opportunity to overcome and you want to offer them a solution that's essentially, it runs itself. And quite frankly, there is just nothing out there that comes even close to what we have on that front. So I think we have the right combination of the high-performance Wi-Fi 6 access points as well as the AI driven solutions that simplifies the deployments and the ongoing operations of these solutions that's helping us win large accounts around the world.
Jess Lubert: Operator, we are going to take three more questions.
Operator: No problem. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.
Jeff Kvaal: Yes. Thank you all very much. I was hoping for a little bit more color on the cloud business and the timing of that. At one hand, it sounds as though you have got some pretty good orders teed up, which is nice. On the other hand, we should be a little bit careful about seasonality in September. And I am wondering if you could ferret that out for us a little bit?
Rami Rahim: Yes. Let me start and then maybe, Ken, you want to add some color. For cloud all up, what we have been saying is single digit growth for the full year is sort of a good assumption to make. Obviously, we are encouraged by the momentum that we have seen in the first half of the year. That gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to meet if not exceed that outlook that we have provided. And again, I think there is a COVID related element to this, either whether it would be supply chain related or capacity related where cloud providers are actually seeing meaningful growth in their network. But I also think that there is another component which is not small, a large elements of this, around execution, Tier 2, Tier 3 clouds, international cloud, strength of our solutions and the unique footprint that we enjoy with our cloud provider customers.
Ken Miller: Yes. As Rami mentioned, we do expect it to be up on a full year basis clearly. That said, we do have a seasonality we have seen it last couple of years where we have seen a little bit of drop in Q3 in our cloud business. We actually expect, obviously, revenue to be up in Q3 at the midpoint of our guidance. If you break it down by vertical, we expect to see growth in service provider and modest growth in enterprise and cloud to be slightly down. Now those numbers could obviously differ from those expectations but that's our current expectation at this point.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Jim Suva: Thank you. Rami, in your prepared comments you mentioned an example of some trends or products selling that didn't quite have the typical, I believe, it was you said software attach rate that we are used to. Can you maybe clarify a little bit, is this is a trend that we should expect going forward? Why or why not? Or kind of what happened there? And maybe I just didn't catch the full example that you are giving. Thank you.
Rami Rahim: It's entirely based on mix of products. There are some products that we sell that just have a larger term-based software component attached to them than others. And it turned out that we sold more of the product that didn't have that software component. And that might change over time. Ken, do you want to add anything?
Ken Miller: Yes. I was just going to say. So we have had a software business for a long, long time that's been largely in on-box perpetual license software business. And it really has additional features and function that we have monetized via Junos. What we are doing now is transitioning that business to more of a sustained subscription business with term licenses or even cloud-delivered SaaS licenses over time. And what we are seeing, depending on what products you buy and how you buy it, you could have differences in the overall revenue for software. And we saw that the on-box perpetual licenses were down, but the rest of the business was actually up in Q2.
Rami Rahim: And just to add. Again, our strategy is to make Flex the one licensing scheme for software on-box and off-box across all of our portfolio. That can't happen overnight. We have been working this methodically throughout our portfolio. And over time, as Flex starts to touch all of the portfolio, it will sort of alleviate some of these ups and downs that we see from a quarter-to-quarter standpoint.
Jim Suva: Now I fully comprehend it. Thank you so much for the clarification.
Rami Rahim: You bet. Thank you.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.
Paul Silverstein: I greatly appreciate you all squeezing me in. I am hoping before my cellphone runs out of battery to return to the questions asked by Tal, Simon and some others. First off with respect to routing, service provider routing, in particular, I too once upon a time thought that routing was in secular decline, but looking at the numbers, it's not. I think contrary to what many in investment community were to think, that market actually all-in is growing, albeit modestly. And also for that matter, the same is true of edge and core. You have got 5G impact ahead of you, I suspect in the next 12 to 18 months. Rami, you mentioned tight capacity leading to increased demand among your service provider customers. You have got your new MX line cards that have been in the market now for I think a little over year. They should be ramping. You have got the Ericsson relationship. I assume that that's starting to pay some dividends or whether or not you have got expansion, as you said, of footprint into non-U.S. Tier 2 service providers. But at the same time, you have got Cisco with some pretty impressive, at least on paper, performance in the 8000 family ongoing Nokia strength. So now for the question which is, I appreciate that you all characterize your service provider business, which I assume is mostly routing, not all but mostly routing, I appreciate that you all have been referencing a low single digit decline for some time now. Why isn't there the possibility, given the growth in the market, the coming 5G impact, your new MX line cards, et cetera for that business to return to some semblance of growth, albeit perhaps not dramatic growth?? Or is that just not practical?
Rami Rahim: Yes. Paul, look, it's a great question. I think there are a lot of trends coming our way that actually could be tailwinds for us, okay. 400 gig is going to be, there is a service provider element to that. And what I mentioned earlier, around early wins, I mean there are telco early wins that are net new footprints for us in accounts, international accounts in particular where we have relatively little footprint, little deployments. 5G is going to be another area. And that's something that we capture, not just with routing, but with other elements of our portfolio as well. I think the reason why we just are sometimes cautious when we talk about telco business is that telcos in general, the long term trends around telcos is that they are challenged. Their business models are somewhat challenged. They are seeing revenue stagnate. At the same time, they are dealing with growth in their networks. And that puts pressure on their margins. And they translate that pressure into pressure on their technology vendors like Juniper. So we have to be a little bit cautious and careful in the long term modeling and outlook. But certainly, we are doing everything we can from our Metro portfolio to our 400 gig portfolio to our automation solutions for the wide area network to solutions that span into telco cloud and security to capture that telco opportunity. And telco, of course, still represents 45% of our business. So it remains a very important vertical for us. I am very encouraged by the strength of the first half of this year and certainly I would say it's exceeded our own expectations.
Paul Silverstein: Rami, before asking the question about margins, my final question, can you just remind us what percentage of service provider is routing and what percentage of routing is service provider?
Ken Miller: We haven't updated the numbers, but we did in late 2018 and it was about 80% routing at that time.
Paul Silverstein: Service providers, 80%.
Ken Miller: Sorry. Service provider is routing. We haven't gone the other direction. But that will help you. That will give you the bit lion share of the routing number.
Paul Silverstein: Got it. All right. Ken, I have a question for you on gross margins. It sounds like your third quarter guidance would be something closer to 60.5% to 61% book for the expedite costs. Is that a correct assumption before I ask you the question?
Ken Miller: Yes. That is a correct assumption. We saw a 120 basis point in value point and were 1.2 impact in Q2 and I expect similar elevated levels in Q3, so it would be approximately at the same level of impact in Q3.
Paul Silverstein: All right. The very basic question is, over the next 12 to 24 months, where can you get your gross margin to in a reasonable best case? Can you remind us of what the key levers are in getting there?
Ken Miller: Yes. So we put out, from a model perspective, 58% to 62%. We have been hovering at that kind of midpoint 60% on an annualized basis for the last couple of years. The path to growth is multifaceted, I should say. Clearly, software is a big part of that strategy. And as we shift more of our business to software, especially recurring software over time, that will carry a margin lift for us. We are doing a lot from an engineering perspective and the design per value and value engineering front. We have talked about this in the past where particularly in our switching line up, we didn't have as competitive of cost of goods sold as we thought we needed. We think we have fixed that and we are excited about the opportunity ahead, particularly in 400 gig on that front, making sure we get the cost per bit right. A lot going on in just inventory levels and management and supply chain optimization, et cetera as well as pricing. So it's really not one answer, but a lot of moving parts there. I would say, the biggest headwind that these moving parts are meant to more than offset is going to be just shift in business. Our margin profile for many of our enterprise products are less than our service provider products, as an example. And we do expect enterprise to outpace service provider. So we do need to improve mix of software predominantly as we move forward.
Paul Silverstein: I appreciate it. Thanks guys.
Rami Rahim: Thanks Paul.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our question-and-answer session as well as today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a wonderful day.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-04-28 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Juniper Networks First Quarter 2020 Earnings Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Jess Lubert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.
Jess Lubert: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to our first quarter 2020 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today’s call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results might differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release and CFO commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today and Juniper undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the company’s financial results is included in today’s press release. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami.
Rami Rahim: Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us during these difficult times. Before I comment on our results, I'd like make a few comments regarding the Covid-19 pandemic which is impacting the way all of us work and live. I like to emphasis that the help and safety of our employees, customers and business partners remain our top priority and remain an integral part of all we do. I couldn't be more proud of the Juniper team which has worked tirelessly to meet the needs of our customer and deliver new innovation to market despite the recent challenges introduced by Covid-19. I believe we are well positioned not only navigate the current crisis, but also to emerge stronger player. In the meantime, we are helping to support the fight against Covid-19 by offering free secured wireless connectivity kit to pop up field hospitals and giving back to the community through the Juniper Foundation which is working to support those in needs during this difficult time. And now on to our results. We reported Q1 revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $998 million and $0.23 respectively both slightly below the low end of our guidance. Revenue for Q1 was impacted due to Covid-19 related supply chain challenges, which negatively affected customer lead time and our ability to recognize the revenue in the quarter, particularly within our service provider business. However, actual Q1 demand remained healthy with product orders growing 10% year-over-year.  We experienced Q1 order growth across all customers vertical, if not for challenges securing supply, we believe our Q1 revenue and non-GAAP EPS would have been between the mid and high end of our guidance range. We are entering Q2 with strong backlog and starting to see improvements within our supply chain, which Ken will touch on in greater detail during his prepared remarks. We are also seeing healthy momentum in our Cloud and Service Provider businesses, which typically account for approximately 55% of sales in any given quarter. We believe these businesses are likely to prove resilience within the current environment and could even benefit from the recent surge in traffic that is straining many networks around the world. While our enterprise pipeline has softened as a result of Covid-19 induced macro pressure, this has been factored into our near-term forecasts and is the primary driver behind our increased range for the June quarter and the withdrawal of prior commentary for the full year. I'd like to emphasize that Juniper remains financially strong with more than $2.5 billion in cash and highly liquid securities as compared to just $1.7 billion in debt. We also maintain an untapped $500 million credit facility. We expect to generate positive free cash flow in 2020 and we have no debt maturing until 2024. We believe these attributes should not only position us to weather the current crisis but also to support our customers and take opportunistic action that helped us come out stronger and gain share as a business environment eventually improve. Now I'd like to provide some insight into the quarter and address some of the key developments we are seeing within each of our core vertical. Starting with Cloud, we experienced better than expected results during the March quarter as a business grew 17% year-over-year and increased year-over-year for a fourth consecutive quarter. We continue to see momentum within our Cloud customers wide area network particularly for some of our switching products although our clouds routing business also saw double-digit growth year-over-year. Order trends remained healthy as we saw improved momentum across multiple hyperscale account and continued strength with our Tier-2 customers. Based on our Q1 results and recent order, we still expect to modestly grow our cloud business in 2020. We maintain strong and durable franchises at each of our hyper skilled customers and should be well positioned to benefit from the capacity growth in use cases we own. We continue to remain optimistic regarding our potential to win net new hyperscale use cases during the 400 gig cycle. We are in the process of working through customer qualifications and believe we have delivered the software systems and silicon needed to gain share within the opportunities we are targeting. While we are ready to meet our customers' requirement, we do anticipate some risk to 400 gig timeline in light of the current Covid-19 challenges, which may slow testing and cause some customers to focus more on scaling existing, footprint and less on deployment of new network architectures. While our Service Provider Business declined 14% year-over-year during Q1, this business was most heavily impacted by Covid-19 related supply chain challenges as I previously mentioned. If not for these challenges, we anticipate our service provider business would have experienced a mid to high single digit year-over-year decline and performed in line with our original expectations for the period. Importantly, our service provider orders increased 4% year-over-year in Q1 representing the first year-over-year increase since 2017. While we believe we are seeing some modest Covid-19 related benefits within our service provider business, we believe most of the service provider orders strength we experience is attributable to our diversification efforts across customers and products over the last few years. To this point, we are starting to see improved momentum with several of our US Cable customers as well as tier-2 and tier-3 carriers in international markets. We are also seeing increased carrier adoption of our switching and security offering in addition to our traditional routing platforms. We believe we remain well-positioned with our service provider customers and that our continuing efforts to diversify our customer base and increase the breadth of our offering should benefit this business throughout the remainder of the year. While we acknowledge that some of our service provider customers are continuing to face business challenges that may impact their ability to spend in future quarters, based on our recent momentum and customer conversation, we continue to believe our service provider business is likely to see a mid-single digit decline in 2020. Our enterprise business experienced 5% sales growth and double-digit order growth during Q1. We experienced growth in both our Campus and datacenter offering with strengthened US more than offsetting some enterprise headwinds in EMEA and APAC where demand impacts of Covid-19 became more apparent earlier in the quarter. We believe our Q1 results speak to the strength of our enterprise portfolio and ability to gain share even in the challenged environment. While our enterprise orders were strong during the March quarter, we lost some momentum towards the end of the period and our pipeline has been impacted by Covid-19 related macro dynamics that are clouding our visibility into Q2 and the remainder of the year. We now believe our enterprise business is likely to decline sequentially during the June quarter and come in weaker than we previously expected for the year. Despite the Covid-19 related headwind we are facing, we remain confidence regarding our ability to gain enterprise share for the following reason. First, we continue to see strong momentum with Mist which we acquired in April 1st of last year and are the center piece of our AI enterprise strategy. Mist makes networking simple for customers and improves the user experience and reduces its operational costs. We believe these attributes are likely to resonate with customers under any environment. We are seeing this in our continued business momentum. New Mist logos through more than a 100% year-over-year in the March quarter and standalone Mist bookings exceeded a $100 million run rate on an annualized basis. While Mist is continuing to exceed expectation, we believe we have just scratched the surface of Mist potential and the impact it is likely to have on the broader Juniper portfolio. To this point, we are seeing strong demand for our Mist wired assurance offering that launched in Q4 of last year and brings cloud management and AI capabilities to the ES portfolio. This capability has now enabled us to secure EX wins with three Fortune 10 account and in Q1 over a 100 joint Mist and EX customers. We plan to mystify additional elements of our switching and security portfolio throughout the year, which should create increment pull through opportunities for enterprise offering in future period. Second, we believe our enterprise switching portfolios continuing to gain share with both revenues and orders growing during the March quarter. We believe our industry-leading EVPN VXLAN capabilities and Contrail Fabric Management are positioned to win in the datacenter market while our ES portfolio is likely to benefit from synergy with Mist and pull through from our Wired Assurance offerings in future quarters. Third, I believe the investments we have made in our go-to-market organization over the last 12-months should position us to capitalize on our innovation, particularly in the enterprise market as conditions improve and our account reps ramp to full productivity. And fourth, our enterprise mix should work in our favor given our high exposure to government sector and mid to large-sized enterprise account, which are likely to prove more resilient to recent industry headwind and be well positioned to recover when the environment normalizes. I'd like to mention that we are continuing to see momentum in our security and software segment. Our security revenue increased 10% year-over-year in Q1 due to strong demand for our high-end portfolio, which continues to gain traction particularly with our cloud and service provider customers. We remain encouraged by the momentum we are seeing and the success of our secured networking strategy which focuses on embedded security of the key elements of several routing and switching solution. We think customers are increasingly looking to consume security as part of a networking solution and believe we are well positioned to capitalize on this trend. Our software business grew 9% year-over-year and accounted for more than 11% of revenue in Q1. While much of our software revenue today is driven by on box software licenses, our off box software orders increase more than 50% year-over-year and off box subscriptions increased more than 180% year-over-year due to Mist.  Based on the momentum we're seeing, we believe our software; the percentage of revenue will continue to increase over time especially as subscription-based pricing models become more pervasive and gain traction in the market. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ken who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail.
Ken Miller: Thank you, Rami. And good afternoon, everyone. I'll start by discussing our first quarter results inclusive of supply chain challenges due to the Covid-19 pandemic, then provide some color on our outlook and end with an overview of our financial position in light of the pandemic. We ended the first quarter of 2020 at $998 million in revenue flat year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.23. Both results were slightly below the low end of our guidance range due to supply constraints related to the Covid-19 pandemic. Without the impact of the pandemic related supply constraints, we estimate that revenue and non-GAAP EPS would have been between the mid and high end of the range we provided in January. I'd like to briefly address some of the dynamics in our supply chain. We have a global supply chain footprint with our primary manufacturing partners located in China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Mexico and the United States. Our component suppliers are even more geographically distributed with suppliers from many countries throughout the world. During the quarter, the supply constraints we experienced were due to both constrained manufacturing capacity particularly in China and Malaysia, as well as component parts shortages as our component suppliers were also facing manufacturing challenges. These challenges resulted in extended lead times to our customers and ultimately caused us to fall short of our revenue guidance for the quarter. While the situation remains very dynamic, we have improvements to our manufacturing capacity. However, we expect several of our component suppliers will remain challenged throughout most of the second quarter as they are operating under restricted work condition. As a result, we have factored continued supply chain challenges into our current Q2 forecast. While we have a robust and flexible supply chain, the Covid-19 pandemic has brought the industry unprecedented challenges. Our supply chain teams have been working tirelessly to meet our customer needs during the pandemic. We have been executing a strong risk mitigation plan including multi-sourcing, pre-ordering components, transforming our logistics network and prioritizing critical customers, all the while we are working with local government agencies to understand challenges and partner on solutions that ensure the safety of our employees, partners and suppliers. As a result of these mitigation efforts, we believe we are delivering the best possible outcomes for safety and satisfying customer needs and we will continue to do so. Turning back to the first quarter results, while supply constraints negatively impacted our top and bottom line results, we saw strong demand in the quarter with orders growing 10% year-over-year exceeding our expectations. Additionally, the order strength was broad-based with all verticals and all geographies growing year-over-year. Looking at our revenue by vertical on a year-over-year basis, Cloud increased 17% and Enterprise increased 5% while service provider declined 14%. If not for the supply constraints related to the Covid-19 pandemic, service provider revenue decline would have likely been in the mid to high single digits. From a technology perspective, switching revenue increased 25% year-over-year and security revenue increased 10% year-over-year. Routing revenue which was the most impacted by supply constraints related to the Covid-19 pandemic decreased 16% year-over-year. Our services business increased 2% year-over-year. We continue to see solid performance from our software offerings where software revenue was approximately 11% of total revenue and grew 9% year-over-year. In reviewing our Top 10 customers for the quarter, four were Cloud, five were Service Provider, and one was an Enterprise. Non-GAAP gross margins were 59.6%, in-line with our expectations. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 1%year-over-year and were flat sequentially, which was slightly below the low-end of our guidance range. As expected, cash flow from operations in the first quarter was strong at $272 million. We paid $66million in dividends, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share. Also repurchased $200 million worth of shares in the open market and completed accelerated share repurchase program we entered into in the fourth quarter of 2019. Total cash, cash equivalents, and investments at the end of the first quarter of 2020 were $2.5 billion which was flat from the fourth quarter 2019. Now I'd like to provide some color on our guidance which you could find details in the CFO commentary available on our website. While we are seeing uncertainty in our business due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we expect to see sequential revenue and earnings growth in the second quarter. Confidence in our forecast is driven by strong backlog and healthy momentum with our service provider and cloud customers. We believe these factors should help offset increased uncertainty in certain segments of the enterprise market. Due to the uncertain macro environment, we have widened our revenue range for the second quarter. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be essentially flat sequentially relative to the first quarter. We expect to see sequential volume driven improvements in margin during the June quarter to be offset by certain strategic insertion opportunities in addition to increased logistics and other supply chain related cost due to the Covid-19 pandemic. We expect second quarter non-GAAP operating expense to decline sequentially as we continue to focus on prudent cost management, while continuing to invest to capture future opportunities. While we are optimistic regarding our long-term prospects and opportunity to gain share across each of our customer verticals, we are withdrawing our previously announced full year 2020 commentary because we cannot predict the specific extent or duration of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our financial results. Turning to our capital return program, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.20 per share to be paid during the second quarter. We remain committed to paying our dividend. And while we expect to remain opportunistic with respect to share buybacks, we expect to place a greater emphasis on further building liquidity in this uncertain environment. Before we move on to Q&A, I would like to spend a few moments outlining the financial strength of Juniper in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. We have a high degree of confidence and our ability to meet our commitment and weather the current economic environment. Juniper is a financially strong company with over $2.5 billion in highly liquid, high credit rated cash and investments with access to additional liquidity sources, if needed. We are profitable and generate strong operating cash flows, both of which we currently expect will continue. Further, the diversity of our revenue streams is favorable and our position with our cloud and service provider customers should help offset pressure in the enterprise market. We intend to implement additional cost controls by continuing to invest in areas to take advantage of the market opportunities ahead. Our objective is to protect our talent and at this time we expect to retain our workforce. Despite the uncertain macroeconomic environment, we believe we are well positioned to sustain a financial strength. Our long-term financial principles remain unchanged. Our objective is to grow revenue, expand earnings over time and maintain our balanced capital strategy. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper success, especially in this challenging environment. Now I'd like to open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question,
SamikChatterjee: Hi. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. If I can just start off with the cloud revenue growth that you had double-digit growth for a couple of quarters now. If you can help me think about how much of that growth is being driven by your existing customers and if there were any new logo wins in the tier-2 cloud side that helped on that front? And I believe you've briefly mentioned WAN upgrades with cloud customers. Are you expecting any cloud customers to act straight line upgrade activities as they scale the current architecture that you were referring to?
RamiRahim: Yes. Thanks for the questions, Samik. So obviously very pleased with our results in the cloud vertical, 70% year-over-year growth in revenue. This is actually the fourth quarter in a row where we've seen year-over-year strengths and in fact the strength was pretty broad based across technologies both sorry -- in all three areas of routing, switching and security. The other thing that I liked about the results in Q1 is the breadth across Tier-1 hyperscale cloud providers, as well as Tier-2 and Tier-3. In the Tier-1 space, it's mostly around the deployed footprint that we already have and the traffic requirements over those networks which resulted in goods bookings and revenue momentum and in the Tier-2, 3 space there were some of that as well as and in that area because we've really been focusing on net new logos in our go-to-market organization. There were probably a few new accounts that contributed to the momentum as well.
SamikChatterjee: Okay and if I can just quickly follow up with, Ken, on the gross margin. Was there any headwind in 1Q gross margin from the supply chain challenges that you have? And I think you mentioned in your commentary here strategic insertion opportunities that are offset to gross margins in 2Q. Can you just elaborate on that?
KenMiller: Yes. So from a gross margin perspective we did have a strong Q1. We did have some cost rated Covid-19 was fairly immaterial. I do expect to have additional cost in Q2 that's actually one reason why the Q2 guide is relatively flat even though volume is up. So we had some cost in Q1, we should have a little bit more in Q2, still not super material but it's going to be a few tenths of a points of a headwind in Q2 as compared to Q1, but overall margin is tracking fairly in line with that exception.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
SimonLeopold: Thanks for taking the question. First, I wanted to see if maybe you could help us unpack your enterprise market vertical a little bit in that, I think one of the points you've tried to make is that you've got exposure to generally healthy enterprises. And I am assuming that would be financial services, governments and just if there's some more color you can give us as to the uncertain verticals that you reference in the prepared remarks. Thank you.
RamiRahim: Thanks for the question, Simon. So again pleased with our performance in what is a dynamic and competitive environment in the enterprise space. We saw strength in switching, US government performed well; our sales transformation that we have been embarking on over the last year starting to pay off. Mist had a record quarter and the momentum there has been strong. You're absolutely right. I think if you look at our enterprise business and unpack it, we have significant exposure to elements of the enterprise market like federal government, public sector, education, financial services that we believe are going to be more resilient to any economic downturn. The parts of the enterprise market like retail that is probably going to be less resilience we just have less exposure to.
SimonLeopold: And just in terms of my follow up, I'd like to see whether you've done anything in terms of actions to help out particularly your enterprise customers. Whether it's financing or more flexible terms on payments. Whether we should expect maybe DSOs become more extended just what are you doing in terms of the response and the adjustment to the shifting environment? Thanks.
KenMiller: Yes. So and just to add on to Rami's previous answer, the travel, retail and hospitality, those segments of the enterprise which we think are more exposed that's less than 15% of our total enterprise sales on the average core. So we feel good about our, the exposure levels we have in some of the more resilient enterprise sub segments. On a financing and cash receivable perspective, we have not seen any change to date. We are anticipating some modest push outs of collectibility and perhaps a little bit more bad debt, but to date we haven't seen it. We are aggressively working with customers on our Juniper financing services programs that we do offer leasing and extended payment term programs and we have revamped some of those and are offering those to customers as we speak. And I do expect to see some more traction in that space going forward.
Operator: From line of Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.
PaulSilverstein: I appreciate it. Ken, is it -- it's just too much inserting the market to talk about where gross margin and operating margin can go over the next 12- months or so?
KenMiller: Yes. I would say there is, in particular on enterprise side and we feel pretty good about our cloud and service provider visibility for the year; really nothing has changed there from where we were 90 days ago, but from the enterprise side it's very difficult to predict the second half and therefore the full P&L.
PaulSilverstein: All right. And just two clarifications, if I may, sort of a follow up. So the question I was asked earlier in your comment about strategic insertion opportunities impacting margin and you're giving it, I assume that's a clever way of putting that you're using, understandably using discounting to get into market opportunities. And then you mention exposure to government. Can you tell us how - remind how large government as a percentage of revenue? Appreciate it. 
KenMiller: Yes. So the strategic insertion opportunities, there's really a couple deals that we have in our Q2 pipeline that are in emerging markets. They'd carry a higher discount and lower margin. These are breaking opportunities. They also have an unfavorable mix where it's heavy on chassis, light on LAN card, so these insertion opportunities are typically lower margin and we expect to recoup some of that margin over time as they add more line cards into the install base of the chassis. And we have a couple of those deals in the Q2 forecast that are impacting margin a bit. I'm sorry second part of the question?
PaulSilverstein: Government business and federal revenue. 
KenMiller: Yes. I'm sorry. So we did break out a couple years back that the US federal government was 15% of total enterprise and that percentage is largely unchanged. That's just the US Federal. We obviously have international federal government, local, state government and other government agencies that are not part of that 15%, but that gives you some sort of order of magnitude there.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.
IttaiKidron: Thanks. Appreciate it. Ken, I just, I want to make sure you can help me walk through from the first quarter to the second quarter. It sounds like there's about $50 million that you could have shipped that you didn't. Ken, tell me in your guidance for the second quarter how much of that you expect to capture in the second quarter and then with regards to the order patterns, clearly, you had a very good quarter orders, but maybe you could talk by linearity in the quarter, and how do we should we think about orders in the second quarter? And I'm really trying to triangulate and what kind of backlog do you hope to finish the second quarter?
KenMiller: Yes. So the linearity in Q2 was actually in line with our normal expectations that across geography kind of across vertical et cetera. So linearity was on track. We already mentioned booking -- I am sorry in Q1. Bookings was stronger than we expected but it wasn't kind of a last week booking, it was really throughout the quarter, we saw strength. We expect most of what we weren't able to ship in Q1 to ship in Q2. We still have certain supply constraints that we are working through, but I feel like most of the backlog we carried in Q2 will ship in Q2. That said Q2, we do believe cloud and SP momentum will continue. So we expect another quarter of strong bookings there. Enterprise is probably the one that has the most uncertainty. We have seen some pipeline softness in our enterprise business. Clearly, we factored all that into our Q2 guide.
IttaiKidron: Very good and for, Rami, as a follow up as I try to think about the clouds and the service providers sounds like you have some interesting opportunities there. Is there a way for you to get your hands around how much of that is clearly just a reaction to traffic patterns given everything that's going on? And I am asking more in the context of timing of spend. What are the odds and what you're seeing right here right now? It's just time shifting those customers just saying you're not, we had strong plans for the second half, let's just put them in the first half and then we get to a little bit of our, we're low on gas as we get to the second half of the year.
RamiRahim: Yes. It's a good question, Ittai. We obviously took a hard look at this and when we analyzed the numbers and we saw where the bookings momentum was coming from, I'd say that the Covid related orders were there, but they represented a relatively small part of the performance that we saw in the Q1 timeframe. And so let me expand on that a little bit more. In the service broader space, we have had a deliberate strategy over the last few years to diversify not just in the Tier-1 accounts where we have strength and footprint, but in to Tier-2 and Tier-3 and we saw the Tier 2, Tier-3 SPs kick in. We saw good momentum in the cable space for example especially here in the US. So I actually think the diversification of our SP business has helped us more than any Covid related increases in traffic. And on the cloud side, again, I do think that there were certain elements of cloud momentum that were a result of cloud services especially those that were in the business of offering connectivity and services like video conferencing for work from home users, but there the exposure to tier 2, tier 3 that strategy certainly helped us and of course, the hard work over the last couple of years in transitioning our customers to a new scale of product set and as a result of that retaining that footprint has allowed us to be in a position where we can reap the benefits of deployments today.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
TalLiani: Hi, guys. I'm trying to understand the source for the strength with cloud and with service providers and also on the enterprise, its kind of the same question. Do you feel that customers had brought in or brought forward demand from future quarters just because of either on the service of either side it could be because of increased traffic, so they just deployed plans sooner than they wanted? And on the enterprise side maybe there was also a concern that the budgets will shut down. So do you see any abnormal behavior of customers that is driving what you're seeing on the positive side is driving the strength in the order you're discussing.
RamiRahim: Yes. Tal, thanks for the question and my answer is largely similar to that I just provided to Ittai. Like I said there has been some order patterns especially in cloud and SP that were clearly tied to increase traffic within network as a result of the Covid-19 situation. But in our analysis that is a relatively small portion of the overall performance that we saw especially from a booking standpoint in those verticals. And in the enterprise side, we actually saw sort of a balance of maybe some pull in but also some push out near the end of the quarter in particular, so on average I think it was probably a wash at least in the Q1 timeframe.
TalLiani: Got it. Can we talk about, I want to talk it's a bigger question not about the quarter. We hosted many calls recently about white box routing; Cisco launched a product in December. Where do you stand with your position on white box routing and your preparation for this change in this market?
RamiRahim: Yes. A good question as well. So we were one of the first established networking vendors to embrace white box routing and switching years ago. We've never resisted the movement. We've actually offered that as a business model to our customers where they can procure software and hardware separately or procure software and deploy on white boxes if they choose to do. So we've had many customer conversations about this over the years and we've actually invested in the architectural principles behind white box routing where we decoupled software from hardware because it makes sense for us to do so irrespective of whether customers embrace the business model. Quite frankly, the uptake, the interest level from customers in embracing it has just been limited. And I think that many of our customers appreciate the fact that we're not resisting it. We're offering it as an option but also appreciate the fact and choose to deploy the simpler model of just an integrated stack whether software running on systems that are merchants silicon-based or software that's running on systems that's custom silicon-based.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Long with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
TimLong: Thank you. Rami, I was hoping you could discuss kind of the 400 gig switching into the cloud vertical. Do you think any of the disruptions that we've seen impacts timeframe or Juniper's position to kind of insert into that market? And then I have a follow-up.
RamiRahim: Yes. Certainly, Tim. I mean if anything Covid-19 has been a reminder of just how important the performance and the resilience of global networks are to Juniper, but also certainly to the world and the big industry trends 400 gig being one of them, one that we've invested in; one that we're certainly counting on are going to be more important rather than less important as a result of the this pandemic. Your question is around timing, my belief is if there is an impact to timing to the deployment of 400 gig, it will be fairly minimal because I do see that many cloud providers, some of the service providers today are just so focused on deployment in existing network to meet the capacity requirements of those networks that there might be some defocusing from the projects for 400 gig. But that said, I think, if it is an impact it will be relatively small and the opportunity remains large and our ability to compete in our opportunity I feel very good about.
TimLong: Okay. Great. And then just to follow up on the service provider side. It sounds like it's pretty diversified business now which is helped and it's not just Covid impact. Seeing the orders being the best it's been in several years, it's probably early to call but how do you feel about this kind of being a turning point for this business where it could turn back into a more sustainable growth business kind of like you saw in the cloud vertical over the past year.
RamiRahim: Yes. There are two elements to the diversification in this business that I like. The first is around diversification in customers, geographically and also in segments sort of tier-1 and tier-2, tier-3, but then the second thing that I really like is the diversification of the solutions that we're offering them. So certainly there is traditional routing, but we saw double-digit growth in switching; double-digit growth in security that we sold into the service provider market. And I think that diversity is certainly healthy. We exited Q1 with solid booking, so I actually expect you to see a meaningful sequential recovery. And I think for the full year seeing sort of what we expected sort of mid-single digit declines in service provider probably a good way to think about the business.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson with Needham. Please proceed with your question.
AlexHenderson: Thank you very much. So I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the inability to supply not so much in the first quarter because you think you're pretty clear on that, but rather to what extent you're holding back your expectation for the second quarter. What's the size and nut on the supply chain challenges for 2Q as you're exiting the quarter in your assumed guide.
KenMiller: Yes. So we're presuming similar dynamics in Q2 that's what we're assuming when we created our Q2 guide. We're not counting on significant improvements in the supply chain. Lead time started to extend in kind of early February. They've been extended throughout the rest of Q1 and they're currently still extended and I believe that's going to improve over time. Exactly when is still yet to be determined. There's obviously every day we seem to get a different update on what country is struggling to actually get into the factories and produced goods. So we anticipate similar dynamics. Again, we're trying to improve them. We're working very diligently to improve our flexibility and supply chain, but we're not counting on that when we set the Q2 guide. 
AlexHenderson: So if I'm hearing that correctly does that imply that you're expecting a book-to-bill in the June quarter to continue to be above one as it was in the March quarter?
KenMiller: I would say we expect to maintain a healthy backlog as we execute to, as we enter Q2. So I won't comment specifically on book-to-bill, but I do believe our backlog that we've grown in Q1 will remain strong as we exit Q2. 
AlexHenderson: And just one more clarification on the backlog assumptions. I assume that that's going to continue to be in the routing space and predominantly in the service providers space as we continue through 2Q or is there shift in the mix of the type of business that you're looking at.
KenMiller: Yes. It's pretty hard to predict to be honest with you. I mean a lot of us going to do adjust the timing of the orders; the particular components that that we're struggling to procure. So I wouldn't assume it's going to be one vertical or the other in Q2. Clearly, in Q1, it did impact service provider more than the other verticals, but again it wasn't some sort of structural reason; it was just really the timing and the situation that we ran in this last quarter that could very well change moving forward. All lead times are extended not just service provider lead times, in enterprise and cloud lead times; we've also seen an extension in those due to supply constraints.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
RodHall: Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I wanted to just come back to the geographic assumptions you're making in the guide. I think if I heard the answer that last question right, when you say similar dynamics, Ken, do you mean $50 million or so of impact in the guide because you assume supply shortages. What do you mean by similar dynamics? I guess just to clarify.
KenMiller: What I mean by similar dynamics is, I think, our ability to ship product as compared to what we book will be in similar from a ratio perspective. So based on the linearity that we expect, I think, our ability to fulfill orders on a percentage basis of total orders will be largely in line with what we did in Q1 which would literally right. As we were not able to ship as many orders as we normally do.
RodHall: Yes. Okay. That makes sense. And then if I think about that then in the context of the guide and the geographies, I'm just wondering what do you expect for the Americas? I mean it's grown year-over-year the last couple quarters, so about the same rate, it closes just under 7%. Do you think that's flat or do you think it's down or what are you thinking happens in the Americas and then maybe you could drill into enterprise versus service provider within that context?
KenMiller: Yes. So because we saw booking strength across all geographies in Q1 and yet revenue you'll note the only Americas grew the rest of world did not. I do believe that the rest of world has a strong sequential growth opportunity had given the backlog we built in Q1. On the Americas side, there is a heavy cloud focus there. We had a very strong cloud quarter in Q1, expected to remain strong and I expect a quarter you're going to see if some lumpiness there and we do have a more difficult compared Q2 last year than growth will be what we've had the last few quarters. And that will impact Americas, but beyond that, Rod, it's difficult to get into specifics on geographic mix of Q2. We feel good about the overall revenue objective. I do think SP will be up sequentially quite strong and the rest of business as we outlined.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
MetaMarshall: Great. I wanted to dig a little bit into the enterprise market. You had noted that you were kind of seeing a pause in that market, but I just wondered if any of the conversation it kind of turned to cost-saving initiatives. So whether that be SD-WAN projects or whether there have been focused on kind of outfitting Wi-Fi while people were out of the office. And then maybe just second follow-up question on professional services you noted kind of services being down because of professional services sequentially and just should we expect services to grow in Q2 or will the professional services kind of down tick prevent that? Thanks.
RamiRahim: Yes. Let me let me answer the first question and then I'll pass it on to Ken to talk a little bit about your question on services. In the enterprise space, I wouldn't actually classify it as a pause in so much as a weakening of pipeline. The outlook and especially over the next immediate few quarters that pipeline we were counting on just softened up a little bit, but actually the momentum as I mentioned in Q1 was relatively strong all up and that's true for both the datacenter side, as well as the Campus and LAN side. Your question around transformation initiatives, enterprise transformations as they pertain to things like when transformation or SD-WAN Campus transformation moving to cloud managed solutions for wireless LAN and LAN, is actually a very good one. I do think there will be some perturbation in the business as a result of economic uncertainty due to Covid in the short term. I also think that as we emerge from the Covid crisis and things normal, I believe that those transformational efforts, especially Enterprise are going to become more important as opposed to less important.  So that's exactly what we have been counting on as a trend that shapes our strategy and where we have been investing. We're not going after the generic wireless LAN and LAN market. We're going after the AI driven, cloud delivered wireless LAN and LAN market and even in the WAN the things we are after is the SD-WAN transformation and I think that the long-term prospects for that part of the enterprise market is actually good. And that's what we're investing in.
KenMiller: Yes and on the services front, the business continues to do quite well. We grew a 2% in this first quarter and most of that revenue and the vast majority of that revenue is service and maintenance contracts. We do have a smaller kind of professional services business and in that's out of the business it is a bit lumpy based on when we actually complete services. So really the PS, professional services volatility you're going to see a quarter-to-quarter has to do with just timing of revenue recognition and current quarter as compared to the prior compare whether it be the private quarter or the prior year quarter. So really nothing unusual there. I expect the service business to remain strong the rest of this year and I think the growth rates we've been seeing in the recent past kind of the low single-digit growth rates are what I would expect going forward in aggregate basis.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.
AmitDaryanani: Yes. Thanks a lot for taking my question, guys. I think it's true for me as well, first one just on gross margins, perhaps I missed this earlier, but sequentially in June, looks like you have some decent revenue leverage but gross margins I think are guided flat. Maybe what are the offsets to that and then the supply chain disruptions impacting you? What - is there a gross margin headwind in Q1 and Q2 as well from there?
KenMiller: Yes. So, yes, I do think that the things that are going in our favor sequentially in the Q2 gross margin would be volume. Increase in volume is typically favorable as well as the customer mix as we expect service provider to actually have a nice sequential growth in Q2. Those are both positives. The reasons that while we're guiding to flat is there are a couple offsetting factors. One of which is we've mentioned a certain strategic insertion opportunities in some of the emerging markets that we forecast to LAN in the second quarter. And those are lower margin deals with the opportunity to expand margin over time, but those handful of deals are negatively impacting our forward guide from a gross margin perspective. In addition, we do expect there to be some supply chain related cost due to Covid-19. We're doing everything we can to securing source supply. We're doing everything we can to ship and create the logistics machines that we need to actually deliver products to customers. It's very challenging in today's environment. So some of those -- some of those actions are actually more costly than they would have been in a normal environment.
AmitDaryanani: Got it. That's really helpful. If I just follow up on Mist. I think you talked about a couple of metrics that showed a lot of traction that you're gaining over there. I think you mentioned $100 million in bookings if I am not mistaken. Is it a bit to think about the strengths you see with Mist, how much of that is from cross something to Juniper's existing customer base versus net new logo wins for you as you go forward.
KenMiller: Yes. Mist had a record quarter and I did say that the customer count grew a 100% year-over-year and standalone bookings have now exceeded a $100 million on an annualized basis on a standalone basis. So it does not include any pull through of other products. So your question is a good one because we're very much now investing in a strategy where Mist, the platform behind Mist, the clouds enabled AI driven platform actually starts to manage and monitor more and more of our enterprise focus. The first one being our EX wired switching platform that happened. We delivered that as a product offering in the Q4 timeframe and we're already seeing meaningful momentum. So while most of the Mist strength has been in just wireless LAN, the component which is due to sort of attached products under the Mist umbrella is becoming increasingly significant quarter-by-quarter. And I think that's going to be a big part of the success story in the next several quarters and years.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal with Nomura Internet. Please proceed with your question.
JeffreyKvaal: Thank you, gentlemen for taking the question. My first question is fairly a broad one. I think we appreciate now is that customers are compressing three or four years worth of changes into three or four weeks worth of your time frame. What do you see as just some sustainable changes on the other side of this crisis? You talked a little bit about what might be different enterprise to that, what might we see in service provider or cloud. And I preference that by saying there has been some talk that the cloud networks have not necessarily held up wholly as well as the service provider networks have.
RamiRahim: Jeff thanks for the question. Well, I will say this, if I think about how well Juniper as a company has been executing in a work-from-home basis over the last several weeks, I think it's eye-opening to see just how well we have done under those extreme conditions. And in many of the conversations that I've had with customers CEOs, CTOs, CIOs many would express the same thing. So there has -- this has been this grand experiment in some ways of trying to determine how well we can work remotely. And the one thing that enabled us to do this is the global network that we Juniper as well as our peers in this industry have had a hand in building over the years. In some sense like the network has almost been taken for granted for the last few years and this has been a reminder of just how important it is. Your question is about lasting effect, and I do think there is going to be a lasting effect. My belief is more meetings will happen after, even after we return to offices. And I'm sure that will happen at some point. There will be more meetings that will be held through video conferencing as opposed to travel. More conferences will be conducted virtually as opposed to conferences that require a lot of travel and people congregating in similar places. And I think that's good for obviously for our business. We're on the right side of that change and specifically when you look at the areas where we've invested. And I just mentioned around enterprise transformation, cloud delivered AI driven et cetera. These are elements of the new normal that I think are going to work in our favor.
JeffreyKvaal: Okay. Thanks Rami. And then a follow up would be on the enterprise sales build. I think last quarter, we talked that it was going to be a little bit ahead of what you had previously thought. This time it sounds like you've ratcheted that down a little bit. Can you help us square that circle?
RamiRahim: Yes. You're talking about the sales go-to-market investment that we've talked about historically?
JeffreyKvaal: Yes. I think yes. 
RamiRahim: Okay. So we have as you know restructured sales to create an opportunity for us to invest in more quota carrying sellers. I think that started now more than a year ago. We started to see the benefits of that in Q4 and I think they continued into Q1 to the extent that the Covid uncertainty will impact the enterprise market more than anything else. We will monitor and modulate our investments in sales accordingly. So we're going to keep a very close eye on what happens in that vertical. And we won't -- the last thing we want to do is get ahead of ourselves and invest more than what we need to do, but at the same time I think the momentum that we have seen; the differentiation that we have in the market. The strengths of our products and the fact that we have relatively small share and an opportunity to take share even in a more challenging market gives us the confidence that some investment as we're doing today still makes sense.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question
JimSuva: Hey. Thank you so much and especially for fitting me in as the last question. I think you saved the smartest and handsome for the last question anyway so. I think what I'll do to make it very easy, I'll just ask one question and it's probably kind of both of you can chime in on that just to show my appreciation. When we look at the orders and the bookings you have, is there any change to the historical linearity in the world that we live in now and what I'm getting at is if Juniper had orders that they couldn't fill because there weren't enough parts out there, it's fair to assume that Juniper wants to order a little bit sooner and so your customers probably would have liked to have their product a week or two ago instead of when it was delivered. So I'm thinking about the linearity of the orders; the visibility both on your customer side, as well as your supplier side. Thank you, gentlemen so much.
KenMiller: I think at the highest level, we haven't seen a material difference to linearity. Q1 linearity was largely tracking as we would normally expect Q1 linearity to track. That said I do believe there are situations where our sellers and our customers are working together on when they actually need the product. When the time to deploy is currently scheduled and they might be backtracking forward maybe a couple more months and they normally would to place that order. So I do believe there's going to be some of that going forward, Jim. But it's been -- has it been big enough -- has it been enough of that to really move the numbers materially at a macro level.
RamiRahim: I would completely agree, have nothing more to add.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
SamiBadri: Well, that means I get to steal Jim's statement. And so I just wanted to clarify one specific thing which is given you saw some supply constraints and that in turn led to less sales generation in the quarter. The real kind of question I have as kind of two parts or is looking for two-part answers. First, as your customers probably didn't have many alternatives so where they went. So for where they went that would be very helpful to understand if they even did choose an alternative vendor. And then the second thing is do you perceive these Mist sales opportunities as potential like catch-up sales opportunities through the rest of the year or even 2021 or should we think of these as just lost sales for the time being and the sharp clock recommences and you guys need to go back and win in the market.
RamiRahim: Okay. Sami, so the first question, if I understood correctly in terms of Juniper versus alternative to Juniper and the decisions our customers make. I mean that's not a new dynamic in the industry. This is a competitive industry and we're very comfortable operating in a competitive industry. I did mention earlier in the call and I believe this is true that when you have periods like this where traffic capacities and traffic dynamics are changing and your service providers and cloud providers in particular are supporting a work from home type of scenario. I think that environment favors those cut -- those technology providers that have deployed footprint. And we certainly have a very wide global deployed footprint that we can and continue to take advantage of. On your question around Mist, in the enterprise space in Q1 in particular what we saw was more broadly than just Mist really an enterprise all up and Mist obviously the significant component of enterprises. There were some orders that pushed out in time and there were some ordered that were pulled in and net-net is probably a wash in terms of how that affected the performance of the enterprise business in the Q1 timeframe.
KenMiller: The only thing I would add is from the orders and shipments perspective, we had strong orders. We are dealing with extended lead times. We talked about that. Just to give you guys some data there, the average lead time for our product is two to four weeks depending on the product and we've seen that extend by about two weeks. So we're looking at four to six weeks on average as the current lead times. And we've seen that for the last couple months. Customers, if we're working with our customers, we're booking order; we're doing our best to get them the product; the timelines they need. We have not seen customers de-book orders. Customers aren't -- when we aren't able to fill the timeline that we are driving to, we're working with those customers and we're still being able to retain those bookings. So we're not seeing de-booking, they're not shipping from our gear to something else because of supplies constraint at this point, obviously, we continue to look to avoid that type of behavior, but we haven't seen any to date. End of Q&A
Operator: That is all the time we have for questions. I'd like to hand it back to management for closing remarks.
Jess Lubert: Thank you everyone for your great questions. We look forward to meeting and speaking with you during the quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And have a wonderful day.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-01-28 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Juniper Networks Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Jess Lubert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. Please begin.
Jess Lubert: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to our fourth quarter 2019 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today’s call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results might differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release and CFO commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today and Juniper undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the company’s financial results is included in today’s press release. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami.
Rami Rahim: Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. We reported solid results during the December quarter. Total revenue of $1.280 billion was above the midpoint of our guidance and we returned to growth on a year-over-year basis. Strength for the quarter was driven by our cloud and enterprise verticals which more than offset expected weakness within our service provider business. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.58 came in $0.01 above the midpoint of our forecast as top line strength flowed through to the bottom line. For the year, 2019 played out largely as we anticipated and we were encouraged to finish the year on a high note. Some of the highlights from the year included a third consecutive year of enterprise growth, including a record quarterly performance during the December quarter, a return to year-over-year growth in the cloud vertical following a difficult product transition which we believe will position us for additional growth in the years to come, the successful acquisition of Mist, which is already exceeding our initial expectations and has the potential to have a material positive impact on our P&L on a go forward basis. Strong software growth that we expect is likely to continue due to the value of our off-box platforms like Contrail and efforts to better monetize the value of our existing solutions and significant progress enhancing our go-to-market organization which we believe will help us capitalize on the various technology innovations we are bringing to market and gain share as many of our markets transitioned over the next 2 years. We expect to build on many of these accomplishments in 2020. We believe we are executing well and positioned to sustainably grow the business starting this year. While this will require some incremental investment, particularly in go-to-market, we remain committed to growing non-GAAP earnings this year and expect the investments we are making in 2020 will create the top line momentum needed to drive incremental leverage and earnings growth in future years. Now, I would like to provide some insights into the quarter and address some of the key developments we are seeing within each of our core verticals. Starting with cloud, we experienced better than expected results during the December quarter as the business grew 18% year-over-year, an increase year-over-year for a third consecutive quarter. We continue to see momentum within our customers, wide area networks, particularly for some of our switching products this past quarter, although our Cloud routing business also saw double-digit growth year-over-year. Order trends remained healthy and despite some likely seasonality, we are optimistic regarding our ability to once again grow this business on a year-over-year basis during the March quarter. We are encouraged by the success we are seeing with some of our largest cloud customers and continue to believe we are positioned to grow with their capacity requirements now that the MX to PTX transition is largely behind us. That said, we have also been experiencing growth with Tier 2 cloud providers and believe we are gaining share as many of these accounts increasingly leverage their own private clouds. While our existing cloud use cases should present modest growth opportunities for us over the next few years, we are very much focused on leveraging the 400-gig cycle to capture hyperscale switching opportunities inside the data center, where historically we have maintained limited share. On this last point, we believe we have delivered the systems silicon and software needed to win hyperscale switching share during the 400-gig cycle and plan to introduce additional solutions and capabilities over the next few quarters. These solutions are now in our customers’ labs and we remained optimistic regarding our ability to secure wins. While early 400-gig deployments are expected to begin during the second half of the year, we do no expect material revenue to materialize until 2021 due to the availability and cost of optics. We achieved record enterprise results in the December quarter with this business growing 2% year-over-year despite the difficult comparison. These results were better than expected and we were pleased to grow despite a year-over-year decline in our federal business which moderated following several strong quarters. We believe our portfolio of enterprise solutions is truly differentiated and resonating in the market, which is driving increased confidence that the go-to-market investments we are making should position us to take share and grow this business in the years to come even in a challenging macro environment. Some of the items driving confidence in our enterprise outlook include the following. First, I couldn’t be more pleased by the momentum we are seeing with Mist and the opportunity to bring AI to the broader enterprise market. Mist is a truly differentiated platform that offers industry leading scale and AI capabilities. Mist AI engine leverages more than 4 years of advanced learning to help customers improve network operations and the user experience as compared to our peers which simply focus on uptime of the network access points, routers and switches. Mist capabilities are clearly resonating in the market. Mist’s customer base grew more than 150% year-over-year in the December quarter and aggregate bookings for Mist and the direct pull-through it enables exceeded $100 million run-rate on an annualized basis. While Mist is already exceeding our initial expectations, we believe we have just scratched the surface of Mist’s potential and the impact it is likely to have on the broader Juniper portfolio. To this point, we are seeing strong initial demand for our recently launched Mist Wired Assurance that brings cloud management and AI capabilities to the EX portfolio. This capability has already enabled us to secure EX wins with several Fortune 100 accounts, including a Fortune 10 that previously were not Juniper EX customers. We plan to Mistify additional elements of our switching and security portfolio through the year, which we believe should create incremental pull-through opportunities in future periods. We are investing to further monetize Mist with our existing customer base and capture new logos as the industry transitions to Wi-Fi 6 and the AI driven enterprise. Second, our enterprise switching business is seeing healthy momentum growing both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year in the December quarter with our QFX data center products experiencing record orders. We believe our industry-leading EVPN VXLAN capabilities and Contrail Fabric Management software platforms are resonating in the data center market and should position us to grow this business moving forward. While our EX portfolio declined year-over-year, sequential momentum has been strong now for several quarters and we expect to see better year-over-year trends on a go forward basis as the productivity of our go-to-market organization improves after last year’s organizational transformation and the Mist pull-through we are starting to see further materializes. Third, our secure SD-WAN capabilities are seeing healthy traction. While this opportunity remains in the early innings, we believe our ability to offer cloud management, security and Wi-Fi capabilities is resonating with many of our customers and should not only position us to gain share in what is expected to be a large and fast growing market, but also present another catalyst that helps pull through our broader campus networking portfolio. Our service provider business remains challenged. However, we experienced healthy quarter-over-quarter growth in the December quarter and the pace of year-over-year declines began to moderate, which is a trend that we expect to continue during the upcoming year. The move of our MX 5G line card from qualifications to deployments, the success of our Contrail telco cloud platform, high-end security opportunities and the availability of new edge products are amongst some of the reasons we expect our service provider vertical to present less of a headwind in future periods. While our security revenue slightly declined year-over-year during Q4, our security orders grew 24% quarter-over-quarter and 3% year-over-year and came in at the highest levels in the last 4 years. We saw notable strength in our mid-range portfolio, which saw orders increase nearly 35% year-over-year and we remain optimistic regarding the outlook for our high-end offerings. We believe our security portfolio is highly competitive, which was recently validated by NSS Labs, which provided a recommended rating for our high-end data center offerings and Gartner which ranked us as a top supplier for both data center and distributed enterprise security use cases in its critical capabilities report. We are encouraged by the momentum we are seeing and the success of our connected security strategy, which focuses on bundling security with our traditional networking platforms. We think customers are increasingly looking to consume security as part of a networking solution and believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. We are continuing to see success in our software business, which grew 25% year-over-year and accounted for more than 12% of our revenue during the December quarter. While much of our software revenue today is driven by on-box software licenses, our off-box software orders increased more than 90% year-over-year and off-box subscriptions increased more than 170% year-over-year due to Contrail, security subscriptions and Mist. Based on the momentum we are seeing, we believe our software as a percentage of sales will continue to increase over time especially as subscription-based pricing models become more pervasive and gain traction in the market. Not to be overlooked, our services business delivered a record quarter and the business grew more than 2% on a full year basis. Our services team continues to execute extremely well with improved attach rates and renewals, the primary factor driving strength in both the quarter and the year. Our service pipeline remains healthy and we remain confident in our ability to once again grow this business during the upcoming year. Finally, I would like to highlight that we are making solid progress in our sales transformation initiatives. Our population of quota carrying sales reps is up by approximately 20% from the trough levels we experienced during the Q1 of 2019 and we are making solid progress against our productivity goals. We believe our investments in go-to-market should create tailwinds through the course of the year and present an important revenue driver that helps us capitalize on the various innovations we are bringing to market, particularly within the enterprise vertical during the upcoming year. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ken who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail.
Ken Miller: Thank you, Rami and good afternoon everyone. I will start by discussing our fourth quarter results and then cover the full fiscal year and end with some color on our outlook. We ended the fourth quarter with $1.208 billion in revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.58 both above the midpoint of guidance. The higher than midpoint results were driven by greater than anticipated strength in cloud, and to a lesser extent, enterprise. As we expected, we are exiting the year stronger than we entered. We are pleased with our 2% year-over-year growth in total revenue. Looking at our revenue by vertical, on a year-over-year basis, cloud increased 18% and enterprise increased 2%, while service provider declined 5%. On a sequential basis, all verticals, all technologies and all geographies are up. Service provider increased 9% sequentially with growth across all products and services. Enterprise growth of 7% on a sequential basis was primarily driven by switching. Our cloud business increased 3% on a sequential basis primarily driven by routing and services. From a technology perspective, routing grew 4%, switching increased 11% and security grew 7% sequentially. Our services business increased to 3% year-over-year and 7% sequentially primarily due to strong renewals. As Rami mentioned, we saw continued solid performance from our software offerings, which increased 25% year-over-year and was more than 12% of total revenue in the quarter. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, 3 were cloud, 6 were service provider, and 1 was an enterprise. Product deferred revenue was $133 million, up 3% sequentially and down 8% year-over-year due to the timing of the delivery of contractual commitments. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 4% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Cash flow from operations was $96 million, down sequentially and year-over-year primarily due to timing differences related to payments to suppliers and customer collections. We expect to see a rebound in cash flow in the first quarter when it will likely exceed $200 million. We paid $64 million in dividends reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share. We entered into an accelerated share repurchase program for $200 million in shares, which was completed earlier this month. Moving on to the results for the full year, fiscal 2019 largely played out as we expected with revenue declining 4% versus last year. While the service provider business remained challenged declining 12%, our enterprise business grew for the third consecutive year, and our cloud business returned to full year growth. On a full year basis, security grew 3% year-over-year and our services business grew 2%. Software grew 16% and was greater than 10% of total revenue for the full year. However, routing declined 12% and switching declined 4% versus 2018. Both results were primarily due to weakness in service provider. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the year, 4 were cloud, 5 were service provider and 1 was an enterprise. Non-GAAP gross margin expanded over 20 basis points due to the strength in our service margin, which more than offset lower product volume and China’s tariffs. Our focus on disciplined non-GAAP operating expense management continued with a decline in operating expenses of $10 million. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share declined 9%. For the year, we had cash flow from operations of $529 million. During 2019, we took a balanced approach to capital allocation. From a return to shareholder perspective, we repurchased $550 million worth of shares and paid $260 million in dividends totaling 193% of free cash flow. In addition, we used approximately $360 million to acquire Mist, and approximately $450 million to pay down debt. Before we move on to Q&A, I would like to provide some color on our guidance which you could find detailed in the CFO commentary available on our website. At the midpoint of our first quarter guidance, we expect year-over-year growth in both revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share. Beyond the first quarter, we expect revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share to grow on a sequential basis and we expect modest growth for the full year. We expect non-GAAP gross margins to experience normal seasonal patterns in the first quarter and improve with volume throughout the course of the year. While non-GAAP gross margins can be difficult to predict and can be impacted by deal and customer mix, we currently expect full year gross margin to be flat to slightly up versus 2019 levels. We expect first quarter non-GAAP operating expense to increase sequentially due to the reset of variable compensation and typical seasonal increase in fringe costs. Through the course of 2020, we expect quarterly non-GAAP operating expense to remain near Q1 levels. While we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be up on a full year basis, as we invest to take advantage of market opportunities, we remain committed to discipline operating expense management and expect earnings to grow in 2020. For 2020, we expect non-GAAP tax rate on worldwide earnings to be 19% plus or minus 1%. Finally, our Board of Directors has declared a 5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.20 per share to be paid this quarter to stockholders of record. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper’s success. Now, I’d like to open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed.
Ittai Kidron: Thanks. Hey, guys. Nice to see the cloud business clicking again. Can you talk about visibility in the cloud business and revenue concentration there? How has that improved? And as 400 kicks in, I know you’ve talked about more the next year event, but you expect that ramp to be lumpy. How should we think about that?
Rami Rahim: Yes. Thanks for the question. So first, needless to say, it’s great to see the performance in our cloud business in the Q4 time frame. The year largely played out as we expected, in fact, probably saw a little bit stronger results in the Q4 timeframe than what we had originally anticipated. The success in the hyperscaler is always going to be concentrated and CapEx concentrated. However, I’m pleased with the fact that we saw success across a broad number of customers, not just within the hyperscalars, but also in Tier 2 cloud where I think we’re doing actually quite well. Also the breadth of the technologies with strength in those switching and in routing, that we’re quite pleased with. We have a unique position when it comes to the routing footprint that we retain in the hyperscale space. And we fought hard to retain it, as you know, with the prior transition that we’ve undertaken over the last year and a half. At this point, I think that is largely behind us and we are now in a situation where the strength of the business, the momentum is going to be very much based on the timing of deployments. So that I think gets us to sort of mid to low single digit growth type rates in the cloud segments in the 2020 timeframe. Certainly, as you get into the 400 gig deployments, and in particular, in the data centre and DCI that post, that presents a much bigger opportunity for us to go after. And we’re doing just that. I mean, all of our focus, our energy, our investments are going into the 400 gig system, the software, the specific features that our customers are requiring and we are engaging with our customers in order to have a very good shot at not just getting our fair share, but more than our fair share in that segment. And timing of that is going to be closer to the end of the year into next year for where meaningful revenue happens. And it’s largely tied to the timing of the projects within hyperscale as well as the finding and availability of 400-gig optics.
Ittai Kidron: Got it. And as a follow-up it’s very nice to see that mist is kind of pulling EX, but maybe can you tell us, is that the mode of operation? Do you lead with a bundle right now or mid sales people try to make introductions or – and vice versa? How much of this is truly the preferred path for you into customers?
Rami Rahim: That’s a great question. I think there are really two sales plays that we undertake when it comes to the enterprise space and the specific customer and their requirements, their presence. So one sales play is very much data center oriented and it is around satisfying the sort of highly automated private cloud data center with a simple fabric management, high performance, EVP and VXLAN type functionality that I think we have real strength and we saw really good momentum in the data center, switching space in the Q4 time-frame, in fact, record orders for the QFX in Q4, largely driven by both cloud as well as the enterprise. The second sales play is very much aligned with what you’re talking about, which is around the campus. And there we are finding a lot of success in leading with Mist, the highly differentiated cloud-based management, AI-driven simplicity and user experience that now allows us to start the conversation to open the door and then to insert EX switching, which I think is leading to the sequential performance that we’re starting to see with the EX portfolio. And I’ll just mention that we just recently introduced functionality that makes that sales play not just one of a commercial play, where we start with one product and then leads us to a conversation with the other, it’s very much a technical tie-in where the Mist cloud, the management, the AI analytics and assurance now actually technically ties in the acts where you give the customer the ability to look at the performance of their network across both wired and wireless and I think that’s a very unique offering that we have now in the market.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please proceed.
Amit Daryanani: Thanks a lot for taking my question. I have two as well. I guess supposed to adjusting the free cash flow numbers, historically I think December quarter has been one of the better free cash flow quarters for you guys, the conversion at least versus net income was fairly low. Can we just talk about what happened in the December quarter free cash? When should we expect that to pick-up as you go into the March quarter?
Ken Miller: Yes. So free cash flow was down a little bit compared to our normal kind of seasonal average, primarily just due to timing of both purchases as well as some cash collections from customers. We did see a build-up in deferred revenue and we saw some strong bookings particularly in the services side, service renewals and you see our DSL also went up in the Q4 time period which is not abnormal. We absolutely expect that timing to revert. We expect Q1 to be a strong cash flow quarter for us. In fact, I would expect it to exceed $200 million in Q1. So the cash – the cash flow that you were expecting to see in Q4 was just pushed down a bit into the Q1 timing.
Amit Daryanani: Perfect. Really appreciate that. And then, I guess, I’ll just follow up. When I listened to your calendar ‘20 commentary around gross margin being flat to slightly up, OpEx, I think, you said would be up year-over-year as well. What does that embed from a revenue perspective for you guys? Is that going to be some flat volumes or does that factor in some revenue leverage as well? Because, I guess, I would think if revenues are up we would see better leverage, especially in the gross margin line.
Ken Miller: Yes. For revenue, we were comfortable with current Street estimates for 2020, which we’re looking for about 1% growth. From a gross margin perspective, we think flat to slightly up volume would help, but modest growth, call 1% level, it’s not going to have a tremendous impact on gross margins. I’d expect flat to slightly up gross margin perspective. We are driving for a full year earnings growth in 2020 as well.
Amit Daryanani: Perfect. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Samik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. If I could just start off with the telecom vertical and kind of what’s embedded in terms of revenue outlook. As you mentioned, your full year outlook is for modest revenue growth, but how you think about the telecom vertical within that? And what could potentially drive some upside to the expectations. What do you need to see from the service providers?
Rami Rahim: Yes, certainly, Samik. So, we actually saw a pretty good recovery on a sequential basis in telcos and the service provider vertical in Q4. 2019 was largely played out as we expected, we had expected the second half to be stronger than the first half, and that essentially panned out as expected. A lot of the momentum was in the Q4 timeframe. There is a couple of reasons for this: one is, timing of orders, timing of projects that we had visited into. There’s only so much time that a service provider can go without having to invest in their network. So that certainly benefited us. The other thing that I’d like to call out is, the breadth of the solutions that we’re now selling into the telco domain where we have, obviously, very tight relationships and strategic discussions with is increasing. So not only are we now selling routing technology, which is our traditional business, but we saw good strength in switching and in security. Not to mention in software, in particularly, around the cloud and telco cloud solutions that we’re now offering across a large number of customers. So when I extrapolate out into 2020, I would not return – I would not estimate or predict a return to growth. I think growth is in the cards for further out in a couple of years timeframe, but for 2020, I’d say, less headwinds supported by some of these other solutions that we are now introducing and selling to our telco customers. I do think that there are going to be some catalysts out there that we can leverage. 5G, although the timing is somewhat unpredictable, I do believe it’s going to be big and it’s going to be a catalyst for investments that will play out over a number of years. Our Metro portfolio which will start to come together for us later this year, I think will be good. Our partnerships, our strategic partnerships with companies like Ericsson, I think starts to help and not to mention just the portfolio. So we introduced last year some pretty meaningful enhancements and upgrades to our MX portfolio and those have gone through certifications. And I think we’ve now started getting into the early deployments I think, starts to benefit us throughout this year.
Samik Chatterjee: Got it. If I can just follow-up, on the last earnings call, you had mentioned you are seeing some weakness in the bookings from the enterprise customers. You had revenue growth with the Enterprise vertical this quarter. But if you can just kind of help us with whatever the trends you saw play-out during the quarter, how did it end the quarter in terms of bookings? How did you end the quarter?
Rami Rahim: Yes. We did mention in Q3 that we were seeing some more caution from some of our Enterprise customers. And I’d say that Q4 played out largely as Q3 did. There is some level of caution that is out there that is maybe delaying some orders, however, look, I mean, we had a good enterprise quarter. I think even in a scenario where there is weakness in the macro, our share in the enterprise vertical leaves a lot of room for growth and I have optimism based on the strength of our portfolio, especially around the data center switching portfolio as well as the campus wired wireless switching solution as well. And couple that with the hard work that the that we did over the last year in restructuring our sales force, cutting in order to invest in front line sellers that we are now starting to see the benefit of. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, compared to trough levels of last year, where we stopped we are now at 20% increase in the number of quota carrying sales reps that are out already. Now many of them are relatively new and are still in the process of becoming fully productive. I think as that happens throughout this year, we’re going to start – we are going to really benefit from it, especially second half of the year.
Samik Chatterjee: Got it. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions.
Rami Rahim: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please proceed.
Simon Leopold: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask two. The first one is, just maybe if we could double click a little bit on what’s occurring in your gross margins. In other words, I guess I’m trying to get a better understanding of how much of the forecast for the year as well as the March quarter is related to mix, geographies, customer mix, product mix. I know all these sort of factor-in, but maybe if you could help us with a bridge to get an idea of how to model that?
Ken Miller: Yes. So deal mix is very much two factor, I would say. If you look at the full year basis, 2019 versus 2018, the primary driver to the drop-in product gross margin was both tariff and volume. So mix did not play a big factor on full year basis ‘19 versus ‘18 however in a quarterly basis, so for example, Q3 last year versus Q4, the quarter we just ended, you did see some negative mix trends that affected the margin marginally. So any given quarter, it’s going to vary based on deal mix on a kind of a more longer term period, we’re managing it quite effectively. We did see some headwinds last year with tariffs as well as boiling things down. Those are really the two drivers in the product was margin. We saw tremendous strength in service gross margin, which enabled us to deliver fairly flattish, overall gross margins for the company.
Simon Leopold: And then as follow-up, just want to get a better sense of the 400-gig market opportunity. It sounds like you are a little bit more pessimistic about the timing, pushing the volume into 2021. And I guess one of the things I’m trying to understand here is, will you be shipping essentially 400-gig capable chassis in essentially establishing a footprint that might be equipped with 100-gig optics waiting for the optics to be at the right price point or does the whole product cycle really go along with the optics availability and is really a 2021 cycle? Hopefully that makes sense.
Rami Rahim: It certainly does. And let me be clear, I think that’s what we are seeing with respect to the timing of 400-gig. Of the solution, deployments, the opportunity that is there for us is not different than anything that our peers are seeing as well. We’ve done everything that is in our control right now. I mean, retaining our routing footprint was necessary because that gives us an amazing platform off of which to increase our relevance within the cloud vertical and we’ve done that. In terms of the solutions and the product, we already have our first 400-gig systems that are in the market based on both custom and merchant silicon, the new operating system that’s very much developed with our cloud vertical in mind, with the kind of modularity, Linux-native capability, the programmability has now seen its way into the market. We are very much engaged with our customers in early deployments, in early lab certifications. And the timing is essentially tied to the timing that our customers are looking to deploy. And yes, optics plays a big role in the timing and not just the availability of the optics, but also in the – the economics of those optics.
Simon Leopold: Great. Thank you very much.
Rami Rahim: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
Aaron Rakers: Thanks for taking the questions. If I can start just on a strategic basis, one of your biggest competitors has talked recently about selling silicon directly into the cloud verticals, obviously, getting what’s your proprietary silicon strategy? I’m just curious of how you think about whether or not that would present an opportunity for Juniper to do something similar or how you see that engagement possibly, with some of the cloud customers? I do have a follow-up.
Rami Rahim: Yes. Thanks for the question, Aaron. I will start by just saying that, I have a ton of confidence and I certainly have a lot of experience and background in this domain from my engineering days here at Juniper. In our silicon strategy, in our silicon execution and the strength and the competitiveness of our silicon products that make their way into a variety of our systems, in particular, when it comes to 400-gig, I think we have a unique offering already in the market, but still to come in terms of the full breadth of the solutions that we are bringing to market based both up on merchants silicon, in certain classes of switching silicon, but also on custom silicon that we have developed over the last several years. When it comes to sort of efficiency performance coupled with security and encryption, we really believe that we have done something very special here. So very well equipped to deal with what we know is a competitive environment. Disaggregation, selling software and silicon separately is not a new concept. In fact, I believe architecturally we have done a lot over the last couple of years to disaggregate our software from our silicon in a way that allows us to achieve much more nimbleness in how we develop our systems and can move and adapt to different silicon offerings. That said, in terms of the business model of selling software and silicon separately, we certainly we have experienced, because we have now done this for quite some time in selling software separately from the system and from silicon. We did – we started this doing – we started this, years ago. As far as selling silicon separately, while I have confidence in our silicon itself, that business model, I am not sure that there would be a huge market for it, quite frankly. So it’s something that we would be open to, it is something that we would take a close look at going forward. But for now, we’re going to be very focused on selling the systems, the software and the silicon photonics capabilities when they hit the market later this year.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. That’s great answer. And then just as a quick follow-up, just on a model basis back to the gross margin. When I look at gross margin here in this last quarter, you saw a pretty healthy services gross margin. Was there a one-time items in there or how do we think about the services gross margin going forward relative to the – I think it was 65% you just reported.
Ken Miller: Yes. So services gross margin clearly benefited from the very strong services revenue. As you saw, actually a little bit more less there than we expected beginning in the quarter. The cost is little more fixed. Most of our cost of services is really our – our services JTech facilities, labs, etcetera. So we are seeing a relatively stable cost line and its revenue ramps sequentially as it did last year. You did see a bigger market than normal. I would expect that to come down a bit in Q1 as revenue seasonally will come down for services and the cost will remain kind of at fixed levels.
Aaron Rakers: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal with Nomura. Please proceed.
Jeff Kvaal: Yes, thank you. And Rami, I am hoping to peel back that answer on the independent ship a little bit, why don’t you think that there would be a market for standalone silicon? And then I guess the broader question with that is do you feel like the Cisco announcement makes the web scale market more or potentially less competitive heading into the 400G cycle?
Rami Rahim: I think the cloud demand has always been a very competitive environment and let’s just say that we are very used to and comfortable operating in that competitive environment and doing well despite the competition. Again, I will just reiterate part of my answer I think that there is a large market out there for selling the software. Many of our customers are looking at buying especially off-box software. The opportunity to sell a network operating system disaggregated from silicon, we have a ton of experience here is limited. There are only a few number of customers that are interested in that model. Lot of them talked about it, but ultimately they desire the simplicity of a system that includes the software and in some case merchant silicon, in other cases in custom silicon. As far as selling silicon separately like I said, the focus for us right now is on a technology that we believe has breadth in demand and that is in the 400-gig silicon photonics space. As far as silicon forwarding engines and switch silicon is concerned, I doubt that if we entered that market, we are going to see the other OEMs being customers of ours. So that really limits it to the cloud providers themselves. And based on our conversations, very specific engagements that we are having with them, I think for now the demand is more in the converged systems and meeting their requirements in terms of the programmability, the telemetry capabilities, the power, efficiency, the performance of their requirements that we are confident that we are satisfying.
Jeff Kvaal: Okay, thank you. And then it seems you say that Tier 2 cloud was an area of success for you, how much runway do you have in that? Is that a sustainable theme for 2020 and beyond?
Rami Rahim: I think so yes, because what we are seeing with Tier 2 cloud is. First, there are number of customers that we have seen sort of pivot back to a strategy where they want to deploy their own data centers as opposed to just moving to or embracing the public cloud offering. So that certainly is a trend that will help Tier 2 specifically. Second, not only did we retain customers and saw sort of strength in the build out of data center worldwide, but we have won some new logos that I think will help us in coming quarters.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson with Needham. Please proceed.
Alex Henderson: Thank you very much. Just wanted to make sure I understood the mechanics around what you are suggesting for the 2020 timeframe. It sounds like 2% revenue growth, modest increase in gross margins. Are you suggesting that your OpEx increases will be roughly comparable to the revenue growth? And therefore the only margin leverage you will have is slight improvement in gross margin hence operating profit growth fairly consistent with the revenue growth? Is that the way we should be reading the commentary on 2020?
Ken Miller: Yes. So we are comfortable with the current Street revenue estimates for 2020, which are approximately 1% revenue growth. I believe at those kind of revenue numbers we should expect gross margin to be flat to slightly up. OpEx will be up on a full year basis. I do expect us to continue to be opportunistic with our capital return program as well with share buybacks. So the combination of that we believe will get us to earnings growth on a full year basis next year or this year.
Alex Henderson: I see. And just going back to the commentary around the switching market, is your co-packaged technology helping you penetrate into any of the Tier 1 cloud companies where they want to get experience with that co-packaging functionality? It seems that, that’s one of the distinguishing characteristics of your 100-gig products currently and obviously, it would be better to learn about it at 100-gig and then try to deploy it at 400-gig?
Rami Rahim: Alex, I am not sure I fully understand the question, but when I think co-packaging really that comes to co-packaging of optics and switching silicon. That’s something that’s more a future trend that we do believe in, but it’s not a here and now it will actually take a number of years before that becomes a necessity or something that’s technically or economically feasible. Having said that, we do very much believe that our silicon photonics technology, our IP that we have that we are initially embracing to put into standalone pluggable transceivers has future applicability into co-packaging. And that is an outcome that we very much are working towards, but it’s certainly not a here and now, it’s really more of a future trend.
Alex Henderson: Yes, thank you.
Rami Rahim: My pleasure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Ashwin Kesireddy: Hi, thank you for taking my question. This is Ashwin on behalf of Rod. I got one two-part question and one another question on APAC. First on 400-gig, Rami, can you give us an update on the timing of 400-gig silicon photonics and any update on the progress there? And sort of related to that, I wanted to check if you guys are willing to sell 400-gig boxes to run someone else’s software on it? And I have a follow-up.
Rami Rahim: Yes. Thanks, Ashwin. So silicon photonics, a lot of progress has been made. The big challenge with silicon photonics is not so much about the technology itself. I believe from a technology standpoint we have something that’s unique, highly differentiated in the market today or relative to what’s out there in the market today. The challenges around production manufacturing in large volumes and what we have done over the last several months now is that we have struck up strategic partnerships with strong manufacturing entities, companies, fab houses that specialize in this type of technology that will mitigate the risks associated with the large scale manufacturing of the technology. So at this point, I feel good about the differentiation. I feel good and confident that we are going to get to a solution that we can ship to our customers later this year. And this is not easy, this is certainly a lot of technical hurdles that are in the way, but I do believe that we are overcoming one by one. And like I said, before the end of the year we should have our first products in the market. As far as your question, yes, a question about 400-gig, so it is – it’s an interesting question, I actually think the demand – there is a greater demand for software – network operating system software that will sit on white box hardware than there is for something that is the other way around. That said, what there is of course an interest in by some of our cloud customers in particular is a very efficient implementation of SONiC on a system that we build that could either be merchant or in some cases custom. And so SONiC as sort of this lightweight NOS, network operating system that some of our cloud customers are asking for, something that we have very much embraced, we have invested in, we have demoed versions of this on our systems that I think have demonstrated to our customers how seriously we are and there is more to come in this space.
Ashwin Kesireddy: Thank you. And just as a follow-up on Asia-Pacific and the revenue growth there, I think that region has been declining for about eight quarters straight now. Just wondering what’s driving that and what could sort of turn around the business there?
Rami Rahim: Yes, I will take that. So, I think part of this has to do with the fact that some of our big customers in the APAC region, we really had – we had some level of concentration, especially in the telco space and to a lesser degree in the cloud space that – just we are not spending as much over the last few quarters as they had done traditionally and that resulted in some weakness. I also just would acknowledge, I think we have had some execution challenges in Asia-Pacific that we have had to address and we are actually going to be announcing a new APAC leader fairly imminently at this point.
Ken Miller: Yes. I would just add that we did see two consecutive quarters of sequential growth in Asia-Pac and we did see enterprise up on a year-on-your basis. So we are seeing some pockets of strength there. I think there is more to come. I would expect all of our geographies to have the potential to grow in 2020.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Meta Marshall: Great. Thanks, guys. You spoke about the 20% increase in quota-carrying comps and I just wanted to kind of check and make sure that kind of all positions that you were looking to hire for are filled at this point and then just increases in OpEx throughout 2020 are just more commissions as they become productive? And then I have a second question.
Rami Rahim: Yes, thanks for the questions. So, most of the positions have been filled. Our OpEx outlook certainly factors in both the filled positions and those that we anticipate will be filled shortly. And I just highlight the fact that we took the harder path here of cutting to invest. We have restructured. We reduced layers and increased span of control and simplified the organization, which freed up the capacity for us to go and to invest in frontline sellers and I think that has – that was tough to do, but it was the right thing to do. So certainly, you will not see a 20% increase in OpEx for our sales organization, but it’s great to see that we are going to have 20% more sellers that are actively positioning and selling the technology and the differentiation that we believe we have, especially in the enterprise space.
Meta Marshall: Got it. And then just maybe on the CTO transition, just any kind of customer feedback or kind of as Raj starts making the rounds with customers any kind of early commentary would be helpful? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Yes. Thanks for the question. I think that the CTO transition has gone remarkably smoothly. Bikash did a very nice job in sort of seamlessly transition over to Raj. There was in fact a period of overlap between the two executives. Raj is an outstanding technical leader that has experience in the cloud provider space, but also in the enterprise, was at Intel for a number of years, so has some experience in the silicon photonics space, at VMware, lot of experience in enterprise software. So, I think the breadth of his experience has already in just the month or two that he has been onboard been a huge benefit to us and I think he is going to do a fantastic job leading the technical strategy in this company going forward.
Meta Marshall: Got it. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Please proceed.
Paul Silverstein: Thanks guys for taking the question. And I will apologize because I am going to ask you to revisit some questions from earlier. First off, Ken, on the margin questions you have been asked, a couple of things. One, I thought that the announced reduction in the last round of tariffs, I thought that, that would benefit you and your peers, will that not be the case? Secondly, what is the rate of price erosion, has that changed one way or the other? I assume from your margin guidance, it hasn’t. And third, going back to Simon’s question, when we think about the levers going forward, it sounds like mix is the number one lever. If I look at what you did back when before you had the whole MX to PTX and the impact to new revenue, you were doing 64 and 63 off several 100 million or higher revenue. Is it to get back to that level or to get back to the 62 plus, is it primarily a function of better volumes that magnitude or is there something else? And then I have got a straightforward question Rami in your response to the demand question, if I may?
Rami Rahim: Yes. So with respect to tariffs, first, I would say that we have been predicting tariffs would impact our business by 30 to 50 basis points for the year and that’s largely played out as we expected. I would remind you that’s a total gross margin impact. If you actually take the impact of product gross margin, it’s greater than that as the denominator gets smaller, right. So if you look at product only gross margin, the tariff impact is greater than 30 to 50 basis points. As it relates to Wave 4 and the change there, we did not see a benefit in time to impact Q2. We will slightly benefit from that in the Q1 tariffs. But our biggest opportunity is to continue to mitigate the entirety of the tariff as we continue to look at retooling our supply chain. So, that’s something that’s ongoing. We weren’t able to mitigate much in Q4. In fact, our Q4 tariff exposure was the highest of any of the quarters in 2019 which is time, just not having enough time to really react to Wave 4. We are now reacting and we expect to be able to mitigate some tariff impact going forward. As far as the big levers, I would order them and volume is number one. I mean, we did although we are pleased with our Q4 returned to growth we are still seeing product revenue down. That is obviously a negative to our gross margin, our product gross margin in particular. So getting the volume back would be number one. Obviously, if we can mitigate tariffs further that would help. And last but not least, on a mixed perspective, as our software business continues to get stronger, particularly as we start to get more renewals in our subscription software business, we should see some lift in our software margin as well.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Yun with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Brian Yun: Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Also I had kind of a question on 2020 outlook, mainly the levers for sort of top line growth. Wondering in your view sort of what those are that can kind of cause revenue to perform better than expected and then any headwinds or speed bumps we should kind of be aware of in 2020, maybe if you could talk about the cloud and enterprise vertical, I think you touched on service provider earlier? So that would that would be helpful. Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Yes. Thanks, Brian. Let me start and maybe Ken has something to add. And it’s best to think about it from the standpoint of verticals. I think in the cloud space we saw good – we closed the year strong in 2019. I wouldn’t expect that Q4 performance is sort of sustainable on an ongoing basis based purely on the footprint that we have. I think sort of mid single-digit – mid to low single-digit growth rates in the cloud provider space based on existing footprint is a reasonable assumption. In the enterprise space, I would say continued momentum and if anything maybe even better strength in the second half of the year as we get to more productivity with the increased number of sellers that we have, that’s out there not to mention the continuously increasing strength of our joint portfolio. So, the EX switching portfolio being managed by the Mist cloud, the initial versions of that have now entered the market, it’s only going to get stronger and more competitive throughout the year. So I am quite optimistic about the enterprise vertical in 2020. And I think that’s going to be a good growth catalyst for us. In SP, it’s moderating declines, right, sort of mid single-digit declines in SP is probably in the right ballpark. And it’s based on a number of factors that have already highlighted around the fact that SPs need to invest eventually, 5G becoming more of a catalyst to investments, the fact that we are broadening our solutions in our portfolio that we are selling to the SP into software switching and security. That’s how we think about it.
Ken Miller: No, I think that makes sense. I think if you wanted to ask what could go wrong, I would say, clearly the enterprise business operating in that dynamic macro environment, if that were to change materially that could have an impact on our ability to grow enterprise, Rami already mentioned kind of service provider and cloud.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question will come from the line of Tejas Venkatesh with UBS. Please proceed.
Tejas Venkatesh: Thank you. I have two questions. You had new MX and PTX products out in the market recently, I wonder if you could update us on the uptake and refresh opportunities? And then secondly, you have talked about switching strength into when opportunities in the cloud, I wonder if you could clarify whether these were new wins that were coming through? Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Yes. So as far as the routing products, MX and PTX, I think we have now seen a few quarters of PTX momentum driven largely by the cloud vertical. And I am quite optimistic that, that can continue. The MX, we introduced new MX 5G line cards, roughly at first half of last year timeframe. Those typically take 6 months to 9 months of certification. That has happened now over the last couple of quarters. And I think that starts to result in some growth opportunities for us into 2020. And I think the second question was around switching in the cloud provider space and whether there were net new logos? And the answer is, yes, in the Tier 2 space I think we have seen momentum as a result of both satisfying the growth demand of Tier 2 clouds, especially Tier 2 cloud providers that have made a strategic decision to either stick with or to in-source their data center infrastructure, but also net new logos worldwide that I think will help us throughout this year.
Operator: Thank you. That is all the time we have allotted for our question-and-answer session. Allow me to hand the floor back over to Jess Lubert for closing remarks.
Jess Lubert: Before we conclude the call, I do want to make you aware we will be hosting a Tech Talk on our secure SD-WAN strategy on Thursday, February 13. We will also be attending the Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley technology conferences this quarter. Thank you for your questions and we look forward to meeting and speaking with you through the quarter.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today’s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-24 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Juniper Networks Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jess Lubert, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jess Lubert: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to our third quarter 2019 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today’s call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results might differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-K, the press release and CFO commentary, furnished with our 8-K filed today, and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and Juniper undertakes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the Company’s financial results is included in today’s press release. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami.
Rami Rahim: Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. We reported mixed results during the September quarter. Total revenue of $1.133 billion was slightly below midpoint of our guidance due to weaker than expected trends within our service provider business. Challenges within this vertical more than offset healthy cloud and enterprise sales, both of which grew year-over-year. Non-GAAP, earnings per share of $0.48 came in $0.02 above the midpoint of our forecast as better than expected non-GAAP gross margins and strong cost controls more than offset the impact from our incremental China tariffs. While we remain on track to deliver a return to year-over-year growth during the December quarter, we are now expecting a lower level of growth than we previously anticipated. The change versus our prior expectations reflects our belief that the Service Provider weakness we experienced over the last few quarters is likely to continue and that our enterprise momentum will moderate from recent levels based on the order trends we experienced this past quarter. We believe these dynamics will more than offset the improved momentum we're seeing with our cloud customers. We believe we are executing well in a dynamic environment. We continue to believe in the long-term growth prospects of our business, and we are investing to win in each of our core markets, many of which are expected to undergo material technology transitions over the next few years. Typically, transitions present opportunities to gain share and we believe we have the right products, strategy, and go-to-market motions needed to capitalize on the 5G, 400 gig enterprise multicloud, and WiFi 6 opportunities that are likely to play-out over the next several years. Given our conviction in our prospects and belief that the innovations we are bringing to market should position us to drive a sustainable return to modest growth starting next year, our board has increased our buyback authorization by $1 billion, and we intend to enter into a $200 million ASR this quarter. Now, I'd like to provide some insight into the September quarter and address some of the key developments we are seeing within each of our core verticals. Starting with the positive, we experienced a second consecutive quarter of improved trends within our cloud business during the September quarter, which grew 6% year-over-year as we continue to see momentum within our customers’ wide area network, particularly from some of our Switching Products this past quarter. Order trends remained healthy and we are optimistic regarding our ability to once again grow this business year-over-year during the December quarter. We're encouraged by the success we are seeing within our cloud customers’ wide area network and continue to believe we are positioned to grow with their capacity requirements in this segment now that the MX to PTX transition is largely behind us. While cloud wide area spending trends should present growth opportunities for us over the next few years, we are very much focused on leveraging the 400-gig cycle to capture hyperscale switching opportunities, where historically we have maintained limited share. On this last point, we've started to deliver the systems, silicon, and software needed to win hyperscale switching share during the 400-gig cycle, and plan to introduce additional solutions and capabilities over the next few quarters. We have started to introduce these solutions into our customers’ labs and we remain optimistic regarding our ability to secure wins or even a modest level of success could present material tailwind for our business in the years to come. Within our service provider vertical, we experienced weaker than expected trends during the September quarter with this business declining 17% year-over-year due to ongoing challenges many of our carrier customers are facing. While our carrier relationships remain strong, we did see a number of expected projects push out of the quarter as many of these customers are choosing to run their networks harder, some are capital constrained, and others have shifted resources to spectrum licenses and RAN build-outs. Despite these challenges, we do expect our service provider business to experience sequential growth during the December quarter and see more modest year-over-year declines in 2020. The move of our MX 5G line cards from qualification to deployment, the success of our Contrail Telco Cloud platform, and the availability of new access products are some of the reasons we expect our Service Provider vertical to present less of a headwind in future periods. While we reported very healthy enterprise revenue during Q3 with this business growing 8% year-over-year, we saw a deceleration in orders toward the end of the period that is leading us to moderate our enterprise expectations for the remainder of the year. We believe this deceleration was due to lingering effects associated with the sales transformation actions we took earlier in the year and macro related weakening in the customer spending environment. Despite these dynamics, we are seeing some pockets of strengths within our enterprise business that are providing optimism and longer-term prospects for this business. First, our QFX switching business experienced growth both on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis. QFX orders grew 20% year-over-year driven by improved demand within the cloud as well as enterprise datacenter market. We believe our industry leading EVPN-VXLAN capabilities and Contrail fabric management software are resonating in the datacenter market and should position us to grow this business moving forward. Second, I'm pleased by the momentum we are seeing with Mist and the opportunity to bring AI to the broader Enterprise market. While the numbers remain small, the momentum we are seeing is real, and I am increasingly convinced that Mist and the associated pull through it enables should become a material driver for Juniper in 2020. To this point, Mist customer base has grown 42% since we closed the deal and doubled year-over-year; two proof points of the momentum we are seeing. It's also worth mentioning we secured over 100 new Mist customer proof-of-concepts in just this past quarter, more than 80% of which included an EX or SRX opportunity. We believe we have just scratched the surface of Mist potential and we are investing to further monetize our existing customer base and capture new logos as the industry transitions to WiFi 6 and the AI driven enterprise. The WiFi 6 refresh and Mist differentiator architecture is already enabling us to win wireless and wired opportunities we previously were unable to address and should present further tailwind in the year to come. Third, our SD-WAN capabilities are starting to see healthy traction in the market. While this opportunity remains in the very early innings, we believe our ability to offer cloud management, security, and WiFi capabilities is resonating with many of our customers and should not only position us to gain share in what is likely to be a large and fast growing market, but it also presents another catalyst that helps pull through our broader campus networking portfolio. I think it's important to highlight that our security business is continuing to see strength with this business growing 22% year-over-year in the September quarter, driven by strength at the high-end and mid-range of our portfolio. While we do not expect our security business to sustain the level of growth we experienced in Q3, we are encouraged by the momentum we're seeing and the success of our secured networking strategy which focuses on bundling security with our networking platforms across several customer use cases. We think customers are increasingly looking to consume security as part of a networking solution and believe we are well positioned to capitalize on this trend. We're also continuing to see success in our software business, which grew 13% year-over-year and accounted for approximately 10% of revenue during the September quarter. While much of our software revenue today is driven by on-box software licenses, our off-box software orders increased more than 100% year-over-year and off-box subscriptions increased more than 200% year-over-year due to Contrail, security subscriptions and Mist. Based on the momentum we're seeing, we believe our software as a percentage of sales will continue to increase over time especially a subscription based pricing models become more pervasive and gain traction in the market. Before I turn it over to Ken, I'd like to touch upon where we are with our sales transformation efforts which were set into motion under the leadership of Marcus Jewell earlier this year. The goal of these initiatives is to drive improved sales productivity by leveraging a more data-oriented approach, putting the right sales incentives into place to encourage the best behaviors and identifying areas of potential savings that could be reinvested into additional quota carrying sales teams. I firmly believe these actions will not only position us to grow on a sustainable basis, but also to take advantage of the innovations we are delivering across our portfolio to take share. However, with an organizational change of this magnitude, it is not uncommon to see an elevated level of turnover for a short period of time, which is something we encountered earlier this year. While this disruption was largely behind us exiting the June quarter and we have made solid progress versus our hiring goals year-to-date, we have not been able to fill our open positions as quickly as we would have liked and many of our newer sellers are now early in the process of ramping to productivity. The combination of which has slightly impacted the trajectory of our enterprise orders. This disruption along with the emergence of some macro related caution has caused us to expect a slightly more conservative enterprise revenue outlook for the December quarter. Longer term, I believe the investments we are making in our go-to-market organization along with the products and innovations we're bringing to market are the right ones and should position us to deliver a return to modest growth next year. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail.
Ken Miller: Thank you, Rami and good afternoon everyone. I will start by discussing our third quarter results and end with some color on our outlook. Our third quarter results were mixed with total revenue of $1.133 billion, an increase of 3% sequentially but slightly below the midpoint of our guidance range. Strong non-GAAP gross margin of 61.1% was 1.1 points higher than the midpoint of our guidance. This strength was driven by favorable deal mix and improved inventory management. Gross margin strength as well as prudent operating expense management drove the non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.48, $0.02 above the midpoint of our guidance range. Looking at our revenue by vertical on a year-over-year basis, Cloud increased 6% and we are pleased with the return to growth in this vertical. While Enterprise revenue increased 8% year-over-year, we did see some weakness in bookings towards the end of the quarter. Finally, Service Provider declined 17% year-over-year, which was weaker than expected. On a sequential basis, Enterprise increased 10%; Service Provider increased 1% and Cloud was down 5%. From a technology perspective, Switching increased 9%, Security increased 22% while Routing decreased 18% year-over-year. Software revenue continued to grow, increasing 13% year-over-year and was approximately 10% of total revenue. Our services business increased 1% year-over-year and was flat sequentially. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, three were Cloud, six were Service Provider and one was an Enterprise. Product deferred revenue was $129 million, down 3% year-over-year due to the timing of the delivery of contractual commitments. Non-GAAP operating expenses were flat year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. Looking at our balance sheet, total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of the quarter was $2.8 billion. We generated solid cash flow from operations of $185 million for the third quarter. The sequential increase was primarily due to lower payments to suppliers and lower cash tax payments, partially offset by higher payments related to variable compensation. I would like to provide some color on our guidance, which you could find detailed in the CFO commentary available on our website. Our revenue outlook shows a modest return to year-over-year growth at the midpoint. However, it is lower than previously expected due to continued business challenges as some of our largest Service Provider customers, lingering impacts from our sales force transformation and macroeconomic uncertainty. We remain confident in our position in the markets we serve, and in our relationships with our customers. Our fourth quarter 2019 non-GAAP gross margin guidance reflects the recent increase in China tariffs, which is offset partially by the expected increase in revenue. We continue to undertake specific efforts to improve our gross margin. These efforts include value engineering, optimizing our supply chain and service business, pricing management and increased software and solution sales. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 17% in the fourth quarter due to the anticipated reduction in India's corporate tax rate. Despite the lower than expected revenue outlook, we continue to manage costs prudently, and still expect to achieve the low-end of our $1.70 to $1.80 earnings range for the full-year 2019. As Rami mentioned, our board of directors has approved an additional $1 billion of share repurchase authorization, which brings our current authorization to $1.9 billion. In addition, we intend to enter into an accelerated share repurchase program for $200 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. We expect to be opportunistic on future capital returns. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. Now I'd like to open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal with Nomura Instinet. Please proceed with your question.
Jeff Kvaal: Thank you, gentlemen. I guess, I would love Rami if you would spend a little bit more time adding some color to your commentary about starting to deliver software and silicon into some hyperscale for testing. What does that mean in terms of how deep in the process you are with them? What are some of the milestones and timing that we can look for over the next quarter or so?
Rami Rahim: Thanks for the question, Jeff. So first, as a bit of a context here, I'm pleased with the results in the cloud provider space in the Q3 timeframe. It is in no little part due to the really amazing efforts of the engineering team, our sales team, and what is essentially a pretty impactful product transition from MX to PTX. The net of it is now we're in a position where we have retained the footprint that honestly leaves Juniper in a very unique position in terms of share in the routing space. Now that allows us to grow with the capacity requirements of our cloud provider customers, and it also allows us to focus on net new footprint, in particular around 400 gig. And the 400 gig opportunity will initially be in the data center interconnect and the data center switching opportunity, and will eventually expand to more use cases. From a technology standpoint, we've already released into the market the new Junos operating system that has been designed very purposefully for the cloud provider space. So, it has all of the capabilities, the Linux-native capabilities, modularity, the programmability, the telemetry aspects of what we know our cloud providers need and want. We also have our very first systems based both on merchant silicon and custom silicon offerings that run that operating system and there will be more to come. So, we're working on a roadmap of different systems with different capacities that will be delivered over the next couple of quarters. In terms of the engagement with our customers, it's very strong. We have the initial proof-of-concepts that are already in flight right now. We are not confused about the fact that it's going to be a very competitive space because the opportunities are lucrative, but I think that we are well positioned to gain more than our fair share. And even a small share take in this space would be quite meaningful in terms of the tailwinds it will give us starting next year. Time wise, I expect that the initial deployments for 400 gig will be in the second half of next year, and that's very much time to the availability of 400 gig optics. And I just remind you that that includes both the third-party 400 gig optics, but also Juniper’s own 400 gig optics through our silicon-photonics project that is currently underway.
Jeff Kvaal: Okay. Super. And then, Ken, perhaps a clarification, you talked about modest growth starting next year. How does that compare to the modest growth in the fourth quarter and how should we think about that over the course of the year? Thank you.
Ken Miller: Yes, thanks Jeff. So while we remain opportunistic about our long-term growth prospects, and we are going to be looking for growth in 2020, I do think it's important to note that we are seeing some additional surge about a weakness and some macroeconomic uncertainties. Therefore, I really would caution you to be, conservative with your models, and we'll provide more detail later on 2020, but flat-to-low, single-digit growth would be a good way to think about 2020 at this point in time given some of the uncertainties that we see out there in the markets that we serve.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Yun with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Yun: Hi, thanks for taking my question. So you mentioned, weakening enterprise outlook. I was wondering if you could expand on what you're seeing there. Is this a Juniper-specific issue due to the enterprise transformation kind of sales force initiatives you detailed or are you also seeing a broader enterprise market environment?
Rami Rahim: Yes, thanks for the question, Brian. First, I should say that we're really pleased with the revenue performance that we saw in the enterprise space in Q3 timeframe, both year-over-year and quarter-to-quarter growth across pretty much all technologies and geos. Real great strengths in Q3 in our federal business in particular helped the performance in the Enterprise space. We did mention that, yes, near the end of the quarter, we started to see some weakening of orders and there are really a couple of factors that have impacted the business and they're roughly equal in terms of the total impact. First is the sales transition. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the issue there is really around the fact that we have a lot of new sellers that are not quite as productive as sellers that have been in seat for quite some time. We haven't been able to fill the open wrecks that we created as a part of the transition as quickly as we would like. That of course, it resolved itself over time. And in fact, I expect that to fully be beneficial to the business over the next few quarters. But in addition to that and separate to that, I do believe that there have been some overall macroeconomic factors that have impacted the timing of orders. So, what we saw are some of the opportunities that we were competing for took longer to close, some moved out into Q4 and into next year. And I'd say that that's a really a very orthogonal issue and one that's somewhat out of our control. We're going to focus on what we can control, which is really around getting through the sales transformation. The good news about that is the hard part, it is really behind us at this point and it is really around rebuilding and getting our new sellers as productive as possible in the shorter timeframe as possible.
Brian Yun: Great. Thanks Rami. And Ken, maybe one for you, on gross margins, you outlined various margin improvement initiatives. Can you talk about which ones are more the immediate opportunities versus the longer-term opportunities? I'd imagine that increasing software sales that's more longer term, whereas supply chain optimization or pricing management that could be more near-term. Is that the right way to think about it? And if you could quantify any of those 2020 and beyond, that'd be helpful. Thank you.
Ken Miller: Yes, I do think that’s the right way to think about it as far as kind of what's been impacting us to date, pricing, supply chain management, obviously mitigating the tariffs have been a big focus over the last several quarters, and we've done a pretty good job on all those regards. Value engineering and design for value was longer term. However, I would say that we've been working on it for a few years, right. So, as we introduce new products this year and into next year and beyond, we are very focused on the cost of those products and really some of that will pay off over the long-term. So, at this point in time, all of the attributes are starting to benefit us because we are in a cycle where some products are coming to market that we started value engineering work a year or two ago.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
Simon Leopold: Great. Thanks. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if we could maybe triangulate the disclosures you offer on products and verticals, specifically seeing a lot of strength in your security business, and strength in switching, coincident with strength in the enterprise vertical. And so I want to see if we can get a better understanding of what's specifically going on with enterprise customers since I think historically, many folks associate security with enterprise and switching with cloud. And I think it's probably much more nuanced, if you could double click on that topic.
Rami Rahim: Happy to, Simon. So you're roughly right. There’s a big element of security and switching that's tied to enterprise momentum at Juniper. But I think if you take a look at both of these technology areas, the strength is actually somewhat broad-based. So in switching, we saw strength in the enterprise, but we also saw strength in the cloud provider in particular, the hyperscale cloud provider space. In Security, I think we saw strength really all up across all of the verticals and it's very much, I think an artifacts of the technology that we're developing and solutions and use cases that we're addressing. So take for example, switching really it's around 100 gig. That's very interesting to the hyperscale space. It's also very interesting to large enterprises that are building out their own private data centers. We have implemented really world-class protocol technologies like EVPN-VXLAN on our 100 gig switches that make it well suited for, again, large enterprises that are building out their own data centers. It goes without saying, I'm really pleased with the performance that we saw in security. And again, broad base across SPs, cloud providers and enterprise up 22% year-over-year. There, the strength was mainly in areas where there is a combination of features that are required, efficacy of stopping attacks and also performance. So large enterprise, cloud providers, service providers that are securing mobile infrastructure, users, data, this is where we have some unique strengths that we are benefiting from right now in the security space. I would not expect this kind of performance in security on an ongoing basis. I think we benefit from a little bit of an easy compare in Q3 and the compare gets much more difficult, as you look into Q4. But nonetheless, I do have confidence in the trajectory of security across all our verticals going forward.
Simon Leopold: Great. And one quick follow-up, you did in an earlier question indicate that you expected your optics products would be part of the availability ramp in the second half of 2020. And I am interpreting that comment to mean that you're on track and that your silicon-based photonics are going to be available around the turn of the calendar year, but your expectation is that they would be volume production in the second half of calendar 2020, am I understanding this correctly?
Rami Rahim: We will introduce – our plan is to introduce 400 gig silicon-photonics based optics next year and with certainly in volume by the end of the year and sort of the specific milestones to get us there. We're not really ready to talk about that right now. The most important thing is to catch the beginning of the 400 gig wave. And I believe that we can do that. At this point, just to give you a bit more color on where we are. We have confidence in the technology because we proved it out in a lab environment. I think it's really going to be differentiated, but we still have work to do in terms of making it available and at scale. And in order to de-risk that, we have signed strategic partnerships with fab houses that are out there that specialized in taking technology like this and manufacturing it in volume. I would say that most of the risk is behind us, but there's still a lot of work ahead of us in order to get to the important ship dates next year. So in summary, I think if – when we deliver it should be really right at the sweet spot of the growth in 400 gig next year.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.
Samik Chatterjee: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to start off with a question, primarily around kind of Mist and I got few other comments that you had on the strength you are seeing with Mist Systems and we’re hearing the same from customers that we are talking to. Just want to see what, how you're kind of thinking about the pull through of other products, particularly some of the campus switching portfolio with the strength you're seeing in Mist. Because I think last quarter when you spoke about Mist, you mentioned, you will have a separate specialist team for it. So do you need more integration or kind of more of those go-to-market motion to be able to drive more pull towards your other products with Mist?
Rami Rahim: Yes. Thanks for the question, Samik. So interest level in Mist is very high both from our customers and importantly from our own sales teams that are very excited about positioning and competing with the technology, I mentioned the proof points, the customer base for Mist has now grown by 40% since the close of the transaction. You're right that there is a significant opportunity to pull through additional Juniper products and that was part of the synergy thesis behind the acquisition that we've made. And thus far what we are seeing in many of the net new customers that we are winning. There is in fact a significant portion or opportunity of attached for both switching and security, in particular switching. So many people who look at Mist and think of it as primarily filling a wireless LAN gap in our portfolio are honestly missing the bigger picture, which is that Mist offers the framework of cloud management and analytics and AI that can simplify the job of a network operator and enhanced the end user experience. What we want to do now is expand that to include other portfolio – enterprise portfolio products in Juniper. The first of which will be EX. And we're seeing a very high level of interest from our customers from doing that and we're executing on that roadmap as we speak.
Samik Chatterjee: Got it. I just want to follow up quickly on the 400 gig data center switching opportunities that you've talked about and you gave quite a bit of details on that already. I just wanted to understand, you mentioned you're trialing with both merchant silicone-based solution as well as the custom silicon solution. What do you – how do you feel about the rate of positioning of those products as well as the differentiation that you have? And which one do you think will be the preferred solution for the hyperscalers to go with?
Rami Rahim: Yes, I appreciate the question. I should clarify that we don't see those products addressing the same use case. So we have chosen to use merchant silicon in certain parts of the network. For example, the access layers of a service provider or a cloud WAN deployment or the top of rack in – first level access and aggregation within a hyperscale network. The custom solutions that we're offering address more of a spine layer within the data center, data center interconnect, wide area deployments in the cloud provider space as well as the service provider space. So they're very much complimentary. To your question around differentiation, I feel very good. I think we have both the goods that are necessary in software with our new Junos evolved software that gives the modularity, the programmability, the telemetry capabilities that our customers need. It is the most modern operating system that's now out in the industry. And now couple that with the silicon offering that give I think an advantage to our customers in terms of price performance and honestly, the gravy on top it would be silicon-photonics once we introduced that capability into the market next year.
Samik Chatterjee: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Long with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Tim Long: Thank you. Just wanted to follow-up if I could, first, Rami, could you just go back to the kind of the whole campus WiFi area obviously, Mist is off to a good start as a part of the portfolio here, but it seems to be a time, if you could talk a little bit about competition, obviously Cisco has a product cycle and HP seems to be reinvesting and Arista is trying to do a better job as well there. So just talk a little bit about what you're seeing competitively there. And then the second one is on the Service Providers side, I mean you're not alone here seeing the weakness. In your view, what is it going to take to turn this business around more broadly, this vertical? Does it have to be 5G or is there something else that you see over the next several quarters that can maybe reverse the trend that we've seen across the SP markets? Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Okay. For the questions, Tim. So first Mist, I think the level of differentiation that we have right now with Mist is truly unique compared to any competitive offerings that are out there. I think that the competitive advantage that we have is measured in the years, not less than that. And I truly do believe now having a much closer view of the technology as they are part of the Juniper family. That in order to achieve the kind of cloud-native management and AI capabilities that Mist offers, you have to start from scratch. You have to build a true cloud-native management solution from the beginning. And that's something that Mist started to do – the Mist team started to do years ago and now we are benefiting from that today. So I feel very confident about the differentiation, but more importantly the proof points of that confidence in terms of wins in the market and new opportunities, net new accounts is absolutely there. As we take that technology and extend it across other portfolio products, the most obvious one would be our EX campus wired switching portfolio. I think we will get additional lift in that area. On the Service Provider space, the business challenges that we're seeing right now are not new. We have been citing this now for a number of quarters and yes, you're right, our peer, they're also seeing some of these. I think that we're already dealing with limited budgets and flattish CapEx environment with SP customers and now what they're doing is reprioritizing investments so that – they're addressing spectrum and ran build out first. And that means that they have less to invest in IP. Having said that, there is a positive side to the story, which is that to the extent that 5G RAN and radio becomes a reality, access networks get built out. That means that there's more traffic that needs to be carried within the service provider, core and edge networks where we have strength. So, this is not something that I expect we will benefit from anytime soon. It's not going to be a next quarter thing. But I do believe that this will be a catalyst over time, measured in many quarters, that will help us benefits from net new investments in the SP space. Additionally, all telcos today are thinking about how they can change their networks and their operations to reap the efficiency and agility benefits of cloud. And we've got the premiere telco cloud software stack that's available in the market today with Contrail cloud. And we're seeing that evidenced by net new wins, which is great and encouraging, but it's early days to the extent that 5G deployments start to really get built out. And the services over 5G become virtualized. I think we benefit from that with the wins that we have at – we have had to-date. So these are a couple of factors that I think would be required in order to change the trajectory of our SP business. I do think next year the headwinds in SP will be less than what we have been experiencing this year.
Tim Long: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Rod Hall: Yes. Hey guys, thanks for fitting me in. I wanted to, I guess ask a couple of questions. One is on 400 gig and the proof-of-concept trial that you're involved in, could you say, are there any situations where other operating systems are being used on your switches or is it all Junos? And just talk us through kind of the operating system, competitive environment as well, is it the likely suspects, are there new OSs emerging, et cetera, just interested in that. And then secondly, wanted to go back to service providers, I know it's kind of be beaten up. And I, just a structural question on service providers, are you seeing any change in what types of routing ports people are buying? Like are you, are we seeing any structural changes here that are putting pressure on the service provider market or is it strictly, being delayed ahead of 5G and architectural decisions and things like that? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Yes, thanks for the questions Rod. On 400 gig, the question around other operating systems running on our hardware, no, I have not heard of that and I doubt that that's actually happening. More broadly for, I think your question was about sort of the competitive nature of the different software stacks that are available. And we've been working on our Junos Evolved software now for a number of years and we have done so with a very tight eye on and engagement with our cloud provider customers. So we've developed it to address the most pressing, requirements of our cloud customers, which gives me the confidence that, we've developed the right stack, that allows us to compete effectively in that space. In the service provider space, no, not really. I'm not seeing any sort of, I don’t know, architectural or structural changes, as you know, we have the benefit of both these scale ups, like the traditional MX routing technology as well as scale-out with PTX and QFX. I would argue that we probably have the most experience right now among all of our peers in that transition from scale up to scale out because of what we have done with our hyperscale customers. But having said that, I would, I would just reiterate what I've said in the past that I do not see, a rapid transition from one architecture to another the way that we have seen it in the cloud space, and there are reasons for this. I mean, SP used cases, the services that they deliver tend to be more complicated. They're much more tied to the underlying networking infrastructure. And so whereas that transition might happen over time, I think it's going to be in a much longer timeframe than that we experienced in the cloud space.
Rod Hall: Okay. Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Thanks, Rod.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.
Ittai Kidron: Hey guys, couple for me. First for you Rami on the hiring front, you've kind of mentioned that you're not clicking as fast as you do like on that front. Is this an HR issue or is this just a talent availability? It's just not out there. Is there no way to may perhaps repurpose some of your service provider people, it seems to be growing capacity there, maybe they can really repurpose. And then for Ken on the buyback front, great to see the expansion there. But why only 200 million? I guess I'm kind of wondering with the portfolio revolving and the opportunities seem to be gradually kind of working for you. Why not be more aggressive on the buy-back near term, or rather than just $200 million, it feels like there's more that you can do there near term.
Rami Rahim: Thank you. So let me start on the hiring question. So, I would first point out that we are starting to see momentum in hiring. We have now, over a hundred new sales reps compared to just a quarter ago. So the ramp is really starting, and it's just not as fast as what we would like. And probably, the biggest reason for that is it's a competitive environment out there in terms of attracting and recruiting talent. But I think now with the energy and focus that we put on the problem, we will start to benefit from, being able to fill the open reps that are available. I also just want to point out that as important as hiring is getting our sales teams to full productivity as quickly as possible. And we have put in place, a really professional and robust enablement process at Juniper that’s starting to work very effectively in our favor that will accelerate the time to productivity. So, more work to do, but I'm pleased with the direction that we're taking now and the speed that we're moving ahead.
Ken Miller: Yes. And on the buyback front, I would just call out that we did $300 million in a Q2 ASR that just closed last quarter. In addition to that we did $50 million in Q3 at opportunistic purchases and we intend to enter into a $200 million, buy back soon. So that's $550 million this year, that plus our dividends is well over a 100% of our free cash flow. And I feel good about that. That said, we will continue to be opportunistic, right? We are announcing our intent to enter into a $200 million ASR. But we'll look to be opportunistic beyond that as we exit this year and into the next.
Ittai Kidron: Very good. Good luck guys.
Ken Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.
Paul Silverstein: I appreciate you all taking the questions. First off, Ken I feel bad for you? I don't think you said too much on this call. So, from a margin perspective, you've gotten back, I think, close is not exactly to where you were before the PTX to MX transition. Any visibility as to how much better you can do without the benefit of meaningful revenue growth and with the benefit of more meaningful, relatively speaking more meaningful revenue growth before I have a follow-up.
Ken Miller: Yes, but don't feel bad, first of all, Paul. It's good to be here on the call. On a gross margin perspective, I would say, on a full year basis we're going to be about 60%. Right? So, although we had a strong Q3 and our guide for Q4 is also strong, full year base is about 60%. So we still have a ways to go to get to the high-end of our model of 58% to 62%. We're very focused on that over time. Volume will be the driver that said, so is product mix. So, making sure that our software solutions continue to grow as they have been for the last several quarters is a big part of the long-term gross margin profile. I am continuing being too focused on cost per byte, and margin management, pricing management, et cetera. So there is a lot of initiatives underway to help the company get to the higher end of that range but volume is definitely a driving factor.
Paul Silverstein: All right. And Rami, a two part question here. One, how would you characterize the challenge in terms of the opportunity in breaking into the inch rod data center or leaf spine or perhaps core portion of web-scale relative to the risk of one of your competitors breaking into your bailey with your stronghold of wide area within that cloud customer base, what are the differences, what are the similarities, in terms of the risk relative to the opportunity? And the other question is if you would, can you give us any incremental insight on U.S. Enterprise and U.S. Service Provider in particular beyond the more general comments on the call, appreciate it.
Rami Rahim: Okay. Thanks for the questions Paul. So, first it's good to understand our footprint in the hyperscale networks. We’re very strong in the wide area and core networks. We are reasonably strong when it comes to data center interconnect and then we have relatively little, if any share in hyperscale leaf spine. We've got good deployments in sort of the tier two, tier three cloud providers switching but in hyperscale switching as it pertains to at leaf spine, they are a very limited footprint. If you look at where the initial opportunities are going to be for 400-gig, I expect them to be in the data center and in the data center interconnect where our penetration is not as strong as it is in the wide area and in the core market. The second part of your question around sort of the ease of which there is share shift in any one of these different layers. I’d point out that, share shift is always more difficult, but it is easier when there is inflection point and 400 gig is such an inflection point. And I would also argue that the software capabilities in DCI and in the data center, they're not small by any means, but they're no where near as sophisticated from a routing scale functionality features, of the true core wide area deployments. So, I in no way want to make it sound like this is going to be an easy slam dunk. It's going to be an extremely competitive process. But I think we have the goods, the technology, the engagement model, the relationships that allow us to compete very effectively. And then I think the second question was around enterprise and SP as it pertains to the U.S. specifically. Today the trends in both of those areas are largely the same worldwide. In the service provider space, the challenges that are being felt by tier one SPs as they gear up towards 5G deployments are roughly the same internationally or certainly where we have a strength in the U.S. in Western Europe in some parts of Asia Pacific as well. And then the enterprise, I would say the same thing, which is that both factors are at play in terms of the macro economic outlook and the impact of that on spending, as well as our sales transformation, which is really a worldwide sales transformation. So that I don't think there's anything specific to the U.S. in both cases.
Ken Miller: The only thing I would add is the U.S. Federal business is, is typically strong. In Q3 we had a very strong result in Q3. We typically see that go down in Q4 seasonally. That said, we do expect all up enterprise on a worldwide basis, to be up sequentially, despite the fact that U.S. Federal will likely be down.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.
Amit Daryanani: Yes. Thanks for taking my question guys. Two for me. First up on the Enterprise softness side, maybe I missed this, but could you quantify the weakness that you guys saw towards the end of the quarter, either in terms of the change in bookings trajectory or how much revenues do you think you left on the table towards end of the quarter. And then do you think you can pick up at least half of that, which might be attributed to Juniper specific dynamics?
Rami Rahim: Yes, so on the Q3 results, from the revenue results, we actually didn't see the weakness, right? So there was nothing left on the table, if you will from a Q3 revenue perspective, the commentary is really more about guidance into Q4 and, we are off, $20 million to $40 million in total books, which is why we previously were in our Q4 guide. So, we're still guiding to modest growth, but it is down slightly from where we were before. The both, that delta is really split between Enterprise and an SP weakness. So we're talking, $10 million to $20 million range of kind of softness.
Amit Daryanani: Got it. That's really helpful. And then that's helpful. Just follow-up with, when I think about calendar 2020 and the commentary around, flat to I think low single digit growth is what you guys have talked about? Can you just talk about what sort of trend line do you need the service provider business to be at for the overall company to have that kind of growth? Can you do this low single-digit growth, even if service providers are down mid-teens, or do you need a step-up there to achieve those overall calendar 2020 target?
Ken Miller: Yes, so for next year we are really not prepared to talk about specific guidance. I do think overall we have a lot of opportunity to grow across many verticals, cloud and enterprise in particular and service provider. Rami already mentioned, we think we have an opportunity to lessen the decline, if you will. But how it's going to actually shake out next year, it's a little too early to call out at this point. I’d just caution you to be got, I encourage you to be cautious just given some of the macro certainties the continued weakness. That's why I think flat to perhaps some slight growth next year is a good model at this point.
Rami Rahim: Operator, we'll take two more questions.
Operator: Okay. Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Erik Lapinski: Hi team. You have Erik on for James. Thanks for taking our question. Maybe just to touch on the share repurchases and the increased authorization today, can you maybe walk us through the decision process on moving forward with share repurchases versus maybe maintaining extra dry power for acquisitions and given the success of Mist and if anything was attractive in the space?
Ken Miller: Yes, it's a good question, Erik. I mean balance is very important. We clearly want to maintain our flexibility for future value enhancing M&A. At the same time, I think it's prudent to return capital to shareholders, particularly when we feel, it is an opportunistic time to do so. And that's kind of what we are now. We feel good about our prospects in the future and we still are going to maintain, well north of $2.5 billion, even post ASR, we’ll grow cash in Q4 with cash flow from operations. So our cash balances remain very strong, as well, so that gives us opportunity to continue to be, as needed from an M&A front.
Erik Lapinski: Thanks. And then maybe if I could just sneak in a second one, as you were mentioning actions to mitigate tariffs and kind of maintain gross margins, could you just walk us through maybe some of the specific actions that you're doing there?
Ken Miller: Yes, well, the primary action is really just, the geographic footprint of where our products are produced. So we have products, we have plants in China as well as outside of China and Asia and other parts of North America. So, really it's about, shifting some of the supply chain, particularly that headed into the U.S. to some of our alternative supply plants and that's what we've been doing over the last several quarters.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of George Notter with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
George Notter: Hi. Thanks a lot guys. I guess I'm curious about your views on the cost structure of the company. I'm thinking about it from an OpEx perspective. If I look back, you've got two years of year-on-year top line declines. The OpEx run rates are still clipping along at $480 million, $490 million a quarter, about the same as even two years ago. So, I guess I'm just curious about your thoughts on an opportunity for cost reductions here or is there something about the business now that makes it more R&D intensive or sales and marketing intensive, any thoughts that would be great. Thanks.
Ken Miller: Yes, so I actually feel pretty good about our ability to control costs. We've been flat to slightly down over the last couple of years, this would be the second year we're actually on a full year basis, we’ll be slightly down. Clearly that's in the headwinds of cost of living and et cetera. That said, I do think that we are quite honestly, we're optimized where we are. I don't see us going deeper. We've been pretty committed that when we don't grow revenue, we're not going to grow OpEx. But I do think, we've done the low hanging fruit over the last several years on cost controls and OpEx. Take out, if you will, at this point, it requires investment for us to grow and that's what we're focused on. So, going forward, you could expect us to remain prudent, when revenue is challenged we will not be investing much in OpEx, but we want to continue with these investment levels to take advantage of the opportunities we have ahead of us to grow.
Rami Rahim: I would just add that, whereas we have been really careful and prudent in how we invest across the board, including R&D, where we have been investing in technologies like 400 gigs, silicon-photonics or our cloud delivered enterprise, which includes our Mist portfolio, our data center technology, I believe are the right areas for us to invest in, in order to achieve long-term growth for this company. So for that reason, I do think that these investments are truly going to payoff for us.
George Notter: Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session and I would like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.
Rami Rahim: Thank you everyone for your questions. We look forward to speaking and meeting with you during the quarter. That concludes today's call.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-25 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings. Welcome to the Juniper Networks Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Jess Lubert, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Lubert, you may begin.
Jess Lubert: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to our second quarter 2019 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today’s call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results might differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-K, the press release and CFO Commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today, and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and Juniper undertakes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the company’s financial results is included in today’s press release. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami.
Rami Rahim: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. The June quarter came in largely as we had expected. Total revenue of $1,102 million were towards the midpoint of our guidance and in line with normal seasonal trends for the June quarter. We experienced sequential growth across all verticals and technologies with a notable sequential improvement in our cloud vertical, which stabilized on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.40 came in a $0.01 above the midpoint of our forecast, as strong cost controls more than offset the impact from the recent increase in China tariffs and a higher non-GAAP tax rate in the period. The first-half of 2019 played out largely as we expected and we are seeing healthy momentum in several areas of our business, which is providing confidence in our ability to not only deliver sequential revenue growth through the remainder of the year, but also a return to year-over-year revenue growth during the December quarter. Now I’d like to walk you through some of the highlights of the quarter and some of the items driving our confidence for the rest of the year. We experienced improved trends within our cloud business during the June quarter, due to an acceleration of some wide area deployments, which had previously been proceeding at a slower rate. While our cloud business is likely to remain lumpy on a go-forward basis and maybe down sequentially during the September quarter, current momentum is healthy and we feel good about the outlook of this business, especially now that the MX to PTX transition is largely behind us. We continue to believe we are holding our footprints in our cloud customers wide area networks and our position to grow with their capacity requirements in the segments. While cloud wide area spending trends should present growth opportunities for us over the next few years, we are very much focused on leveraging the 400-gig cycle to capture new use cases in the hyperscale market, particularly in the data center interconnect and spine-and-leaf Switching segments. On this last point, we have not only begun shipping our first merchant and custom silicon-based 400-gig capable product, but also introduced a cloud optimized version of Junos that we believe offers superior programmability, modularity and open API support needed to win the footprint we are targeting. We plan to introduce additional 400-gig capable products through the course of this year and next, and we believe we will further strengthen our ability to win new hyperscale use cases, or even a modest level of success to present material tailwind for our business in the years to come. We are continuing to see very healthy trends in the enterprise business. While our Q2 enterprise revenue declined 6% year-over-year, this is largely a function of timing as our enterprise bookings increased double-digit sequentially and 12% year-over-year, with sequential and year-over-year growth across all technologies, and we were able to build backlog on both a sequential and a year-over-year basis. We believe we have the right product and strategy to win in the enterprise market and remain confident this vertical will grow for the year. This confidence is being fueled by the strength of our data center and campus offering, which we believe are differentiated and positioned to win in the market. In the data center, we believe the combination of Contrail Enterprise Multi-cloud and our QFX switches offer a compelling value proposition for customers looking to move from single-vendor private cloud environments to a multi-vendor multi-cloud state. These trends are beginning to play out in the market now and should accelerate in the years to come. The value of our data center strategy is resonating in the market and Gartner for a second year in a row named Juniper as a leader in its Magic Quadrant for Data Center Networking. We are also confident that we are very well-positioned in the enterprise campus and branch market. With the acquisition of Mist Systems, we are now one of only two industry players that can offer a full portfolio of enterprise Wi-Fi switching, routing, security and SD-WAN solution. We believe our AI for enterprise capabilities are truly differentiated and that we are well-positioned to benefit as the industry transitions to Wi-Fi 6 over the next several years. The Mist acquisition is proceeding well with strong field engagement and early wins providing optimism for our acquisition. In addition to maintaining a comprehensive campus and branch portfolio that brings differentiated AI, cloud management and security capabilities, I also want to highlight that we maintain a large established channel, a dedicated enterprise sales force where we are investing and more than 15,000 established enterprise customers, many of which we believe can be further monetized with these new solutions like SD-WAN and Mist. We believe these attributes differentiate us from our peers and should enable us to gain share in the years to come. We are continuing to see success in our software business, which grew 17% year-over-year and accounted for more than 10% of revenue during the June quarter. This strength was driven by a combination of on-box and off-box offerings. While our success may not be linear, we believe our software as a percentage of sales will continue to increase over time, especially as subscription-based pricing models become more pervasive and gain traction in the market. Finally, we are continuing to see strength in our services business, which grew 2% year-over-year and accounted for 35% of our overall revenue. Our service team continues to execute well driving strong service attach rates and renewals. While not a surprise, our service provider business remains challenge. We believe our service provider relationships remain strong and the weakness we’re seeing is tied to our customers business model pressures and the expected timing of project deployments. Despite these challenges, we do expect our service provider business to experience better sequential trends during the second-half of the year, based on our current pipeline of known opportunity. With the availability of our new MX 5G line cards, the strength of our Contrail orchestration platform and our partnership with Ericsson, we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on our service provider customers 5G and telco cloud initiative, which could begin to start playing out later this year. I think it’s worth highlighting that we have begun to shift several important new products. While these platforms will take time to work through customer qualifications, they should strengthen our competitive position across our service provider, cloud and enterprise markets. Some of these include new MX 5G line cards that enhance our ability to capitalize on the service provider capacity requirements, new QFX switches and PTX routing platforms designed to capitalize on customer 400-gig upgrades, enhanced Contrail Enterprise Multi-cloud software capabilities that breaks down the barriers of incumbency and make moving to a multi-vendor, multi-cloud state a reality with increased simplicity and reduced cost, and new SD-WAN capabilities to enhance our ability to penetrate enterprise campus and branch opportunities. We believe 5G, the 400-gig upgrade cycle, SD-WAN, Wi-Fi 6 and enterprise multi-cloud initiatives, each represent large multi-year opportunities, where we should be well-positioned to benefit over the next few years. Importantly, I would like to note that I’m very pleased with the progress we’re making with our sales transformation. The changes we have made are already starting to yield benefits in the form of improved sales productivity and enhanced level of confidence in the pipeline driving our forecasts. We are now in the process of adding more quota-carrying sales headwinds to the field. While it is likely to take these new reps at least a few quarters to achieve full productivity, we do expect them to start contributing during the second-half of the year, with a further ramp in coverage and productivity that should present additional tailwind through the 2020. Based on these dynamics, I remain confidence in our ability to deliver sequential revenue growth during the second-half of the year and a return to year-over-year revenue growth during the December quarter. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders. I will now turn over the call to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail.
Ken Miller: Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start by discussing our second quarter results and end with some color on our outlook. Second quarter revenue of $1,102 million was an increase of 10% sequentially and in line with our guidance. As expected, we saw sequential revenue growth across all verticals and all technologies. Looking at our revenue by vertical, Cloud increased 28%, Enterprise increased 8% and Service Provider increased 3% sequentially. From a technology perspective, Routing increased 11%, Switching increased 22% and Security increased 20% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, Service Provider declined 15%, Cloud was flat and Enterprise declined 6%. Although enterprise revenue decreased year-over-year, our bookings increased double digits versus last year. As Rami mentioned, we are pleased with our momentum and success in the enterprise vertical. Our services business continue to grow posting growth of 2% year-over-year and 1% sequentially due to strong renewals and attach rates of support contracts. Software revenue was a highlight growing year-over-year and was greater than 10% of total revenue. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, four were Cloud, five were Service Provider and one was an Enterprise. We had one customer from the cloud vertical that accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue in the second quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 59.2%, slightly below the midpoint of our guidance, primarily due to the increase in China tariffs from 10% to 25%. Overall, non-GAAP operating expenses were down 2% year-over-year and 1% sequentially due to lower headcount-related cost and improving operating expense management. Headcount was slightly down sequentially, primarily as a result of outsourcing IT services to IBM, which was partially offset by the acquisition of Mist Systems and additional hires in our go-to-market organization. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.40, a $0.01 above the midpoint of our guidance. Looking at our balance sheet. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of the second quarter were $2.9 billion. The sequential decline was primarily due to the cash outflows associated with the acquisition of Mist Systems and our recent accelerated share repurchase program or ASR. We generated cash flow from operations of $89 million for the second quarter. The primary reasons for the sequential decline despite stronger net income, where lower cash collections and timing of working capital related to supplier payments. We expect to see stronger cash generation in the second-half of 2019. As part of our ongoing capital return program, we paid $66 million in dividends and entered into a $300 million ASR. Before we move onto Q&A, I would like to provide some color on our guidance, which you could find details in the CFO commentary available on our website. Our second-half revenue outlook reiterates the commentary we stated previously, which reflects our expectation for above normal seasonal trends and a return to growth in the fourth quarter, due to our current pipeline of opportunities, as well as the expected positive impact from our go-to-market transformation activities. I like to reiterate our confidence in the long-term financial model we outlined at our Investor Day in November last year. Full-year non-GAAP gross margin is expected to continue to be pressured by China tariffs. I’m proud of our team as we’ve been able to mitigate the vast majority of potential impact of the China tariffs. Despite these ongoing mitigation efforts, the increase in tariffs from 10% to 25% is expected to have a 30 to 50 basis point impact on full-year non-GAAP gross margin. We plan to manage our operating expenses prudently. However, we continue to expect non-GAAP operating expenses on a full-year basis to be flat to slightly up versus 2018, inclusive of the acquisition of Mist Systems. In the second quarter of 2019, we adopted a full-year projected tax rate in our computation of the non-GAAP income tax provision to provide better consistency across reporting periods. For the remainder of 2019, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 19.5%. Due to the increased China tariffs and a higher non-GAAP tax rate, we now expect our full-year non-GAAP earnings per share to be at the low-end of the previously stated range of $1.75 per share plus or minus $0.05. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper’s success. Now I’d like to open the call for questions.
Operator: At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Paul Silverstein, Cowen. Please proceed with your question.
Paul Silverstein: I appreciate you for taking the question, guys. Two quick questions. One, I know it’s hard to discern how much of an improvement is due to macro and how much is improved competitive stance from execution? But that said, can you take a crack and get response to that question? And then I’ve got a quick follow-up.
Rami Rahim: Okay. Hey, Paul, thanks for the question. I think the improvement in cloud is very much based on the fact that we are now through the big product transition that we’ve been talking about now for a year from MX to PTX. As a result of that, the blended pricing is now at a much more normalized level. And as we have been seeing, we’ll see a recovery in that business based on the pace at which deployments happen in the routing space within the vertical and, in particular, in the hyperscale part of that vertical. In the enterprise, the strong year-over-year bookings and the sequential performance in that business, I believe that the combination of robust spending in the enterprise space, which we’re taking advantage of, but certainly also a very strong product portfolio that spans both the data center, as well as the campus and branch. And, in particular, in the campus and branch now where we have the combination of a really strong portfolio in the wired switching space and now with what I believe to be the best wireless LAN solution with Mist Systems. So we’re certainly benefiting from that. In the service provider space, it’s really more of the same in terms of some of the market dynamics, but it’s a challenging environment. We expect it to remain challenging for sometime, but there are some catalysts there over the long-term around 5G that can certainly help.
Paul Silverstein: Rami, on the – on your responses on the cloud and enterprise, first, on the cloud. The MX – the PTX transition was a while ago, and since then, you’ve been commenting that the volumes haven’t come in. What’s changed now, especially given that when a lot of us look at the CapEx trends in cloud, obviously, they’re not what they were last year, albeit there have been some crosscurrents. What do you think it’s changing as it relates to your product portfolio? And then on the enterprise, when you talk about strength and in demand, is that pretty uniform across the major geos, or is it particular in the U.S. or other markets?
Rami Rahim: Yes. So on the – in the cloud space, now what we’re seeing is essentially a reacceleration of some of the routing deployments among some of our largest cloud customers that we have benefited from. I expect that, we’re going to see a continued recovery over the next few years in the cloud routing space, primarily because of the fact that their businesses are doing very well. And in order to continue to support their businesses, they’re going to need to invest in their network infrastructure. In order to get to even better performance in the cloud vertical, we’re very focused on net new footprint and use cases, especially as it in the switching space for data center interconnect and spine-and-leaf. In the enterprise, we saw really great strength in the government space internationally, but especially here in the U.S. And I think Europe and the U.S., in particular, were strong for us in the enterprise beyond government, right, and larger enterprise banks financials and the mid range of the market, which obviously spans many different verticals. Again, I do think that the spending environment there remains fairly robust and we’re taking advantage of that. And I believe our technology roadmap and the products we have in the market are really strong.
Ken Miller: Yes. Just to add on the cloud space, I agree that the PTX transition is largely behind us and I would say that the cloud vertical has largely stabilized. That said, any given 90-day period, you’re going to see some lumpiness in our quarter-to-quarter revenue, based just on customer deployments. In fact, I would expect Q3 to be down slightly off of this very positive Q2 result. I do think the second-half will be largely in line or largely stable to the first-half, but I do think sequential decline in Q3 is expected.
Paul Silverstein: Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question comes from Simon Leopold, Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
Simon Leopold: Thank you. I wanted to see if maybe you could drill down a little bit more on your thoughts on the 400-gig Ethernet switch opportunity. I think there might be some confusion about the opportunity as it relates to timing, given the limited availability of the optics going into the switches. It sounds like that market is beginning without the optics. If you could maybe help us understand how to think about the trajectory there? And then I’ve got a follow-up.
Rami Rahim: Yes, thanks for the question, Simon. So you are right. I think, the market opportunity for the 400-gig capable product starts before the availability of 400-gig optics, primarily because many of these products are actually, in fact, capable of supporting both 100-gig denser 100-gig configurations, as well as 400-gig. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have our first set of platforms, a custom silicon-based platform and a merchant silicon-based platform, both of which support dense 400-gig, but even denser 100-gig configurations. Those are now being tested by our customers and we are essentially competing for net new footprint. The ramps in terms of meaningful revenue contribution really won’t start until the 400-gig optics become available. I expect that to happen in first-half to middle of next year. And then keep in mind that we do have an investment that’s happening in the silicon photonics space that enables us to become masters of our own destiny in terms of providing the types of 400-gig optics, which we believe will have superior economic value propositions in order to support our 400-gig systems and software roadmap that will see light of day over the next couple of quarters.
Simon Leopold: Yes. So that was actually – my follow-up is, if you could give us an update on the silicon photonics efforts, given last quarter, you had talked about not focusing on 100, so that you could put your energy into a 400-gig product. I’d appreciate just an update of the progress and timeline for availability of 400-gig optics from Juniper?
Rami Rahim: Yes, certainly. So you’re right. We explained, described a change in strategy around our silicon photonics effort. We were primarily using 100-gig as a way to learn. As you know, this is a new area of of innovation for us, and there are always going to be lessons learned whenever you’re sort of charting new territory. We have diverted focus on the 400-gig. The lessons that we’ve learned in the 100-gig effort have already been applied to our 400-gig effort. I remain optimistic about the opportunity and our ability to introduce into the market 400-gig optics in the first-half of next year, which will be perfectly timed with what we believe to be the ramp within our customers for 400-gig networks. I do think that we’ll have optics that will have a superior economic value proposition, superior power profile that is obviously very meaningful to all of our customers, but especially our cloud customers. There is still some risk, because again, this is a new innovation area for us. But with every passing month and the lessons that we’ve learned, I believe that we have mitigated – we’re mitigating more and more of the risk. So at this point, I’m quite optimistic of our ability to deliver on the roadmap.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeffrey Kvaal, Nomura Instinet. Please proceed with your question.
Jeffrey Kvaal: Thank you very much. I would love to dial into that 400-gig in cloud overlap a little bit more. It sounds like you are shipping some of these items, and it seems as though cloud is going well. Are you suggesting that you’ve actually won some 400-gig footprint now, or are these shipments primarily going into trials for the moment?
Rami Rahim: We are primarily in the trial phase of the 400-gig cycle right now. So in some cases, those are in labs, in some cases, we’ve actually seen some very early sort of limited production type of testing that is happening. And this is the time in which we engage with our customers to make sure that we’re tucked and tied across the entire innovation stack from our new software capabilities and with our cloud-oriented Junos software that we’ve now introduced into the market and the new systems, and it’s looking good. It’s still early days, but I have to say that the feedback from our customers is very encouraging. We still got a lot of execution ahead of us. But based on what we’ve seen from a competitive standpoint, the products that have been in the roadmap for sometime, the feedback that we’re getting from our customers, the early testing that we’re doing, I think we’re in good shape to be able to take some net new footprint, which has always been the strategy.
Ken Miller: Yes, and just to clarify, the Q2 results in cloud had very little impact with 400-gig. We are starting to ship getting into trials, getting into testing labs, et cetera. But the revenue that we posted in Q2 was really more of our typical revenue pairs [ph] we have from the cloud vertical, not 400-gig-related.
Jeffrey Kvaal: Okay. That makes sense, Ken. Thank you. How long do you think it will be before some of these items actually make it out of production testing into actual shipments that you would then be able to talk about with us?
Rami Rahim: I think that the volume shipments will largely be based on the availability of 400-gig optics, which is in the first-half of next year. The activities are happening now and the awards are going to happen over the next couple of quarters. And that’s what we’re absolutely focused on right now is essentially proving ourselves, so that we can get a real crack at net new footprints. And as I mentioned, I think, we’re in good shape to do that.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Roy, UBS. Please proceed with your question.
John Roy: Great, thank you. Rami, you obviously are very optimistic about the back-half. I wonder if you could give us a little more color on what of the number of things you see happening in the back-half are really giving you the confidence maybe in rank order? It’d be good, if you could give us, helpful?
Rami Rahim: Certainly, John. So I think there are a number of factors. First is just the timing of build-outs among our customers, especially in the service provider space, where we have visibility into some projects that are happening in the back-half that will contribute to the momentum in that vertical. I do think if you see our performance in the enterprise, exiting the first-half of the year, where we build some good backlog, I think, that momentum is solid and will certainly contribute to the second-half. The investments that we have been making in the sales organization where we have undertaken a fairly significant and somewhat difficult transformation, the hard work of the transformation effort is now behind us. And it really is now around investing in net new quota-carrying sales or reps that will take time to become productive. And I think by the time we get to the sort of Q4 timeframe and into next year, certainly, I do believe that they will contribute meaningfully to our momentum all up. I will also add the innovation cycle. So we’ve announced a number of new products and, in fact, introduced a number of products into the market. So the MX 5G, for example, net new line cards that triple the performance and capacity of those platforms, those are now in customer trials. They’re being tested. And I think that will start to contribute in the second-half of the year. Mist, our software efforts around enterprise, multi-cloud connectivity will start to payoff increasingly near the second-half of the year. The last thing I will mention is just about forecasting rigor, which has been a real focus of ours as a function of this sales transformation effort. We’ve really added more emphasis on our ability to improve forecasting and predictability. And so all of these factors together, I think, is what’s contributing to the confidence we have in the second-half of the year.
John Roy: Great. It’s very helpful. And one other final question, you were talking about you’re holding your share, or at least your footprint you think in the cloud. Are you seeing any other share changes in any of the other areas? Obviously, you expect share gains in the back-half, I would think. But could you give us any color on the quarter’s possible share changes?
Rami Rahim: Well, you’re right. We believe that the strategy that we have been embarking on of proactively taking our customers from the MX product line to the PTX product line in areas where it makes sense to do so has achieved the net goal that we were after, which is to maintain that footprint. We don’t believe that we have been displaced from any of the networks where we have that strength. I think the next opportunity for share shift will happen in the 400-gig cycle. And that just goes back to the commentary I just provided around the trial, the proof-of-concept testing that is happening right now. The words that I believe will start to happen over the next couple of quarters. And then ultimately, the deployments that will result in potential share shift from a revenue standpoint in the first-half and sort of middle of next year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Yun, Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Yun: Hey, guys. I just had a question on 400-gig and the optics as well, particularly as it relates to your go-to-market. So I know you highlighted sort of like the engineered partnerships with some of the large cloud – to large cloud guys and building the custom silicon. But with Cisco’s kind of intent to purchase Acacia, does that change any of the competitive dynamics in 400-gig?
Rami Rahim: Yes, thanks for the question, Brian. On your question about Acacia, Acacia is a relatively small technology provider for us. So I don’t expect that to impact us in anyway than there are alternative sources for the kinds of products that we were buying from Acacia. From a 400-gig cycle and go-to-market, the first customers that will consume 400-gig, we believe will be the cloud providers and that will be followed up by the service providers. In the cloud space, we have everything we need from a go-to-market standpoint. And you’re right, there is the sales effort that we put into our cloud provider vertical, but just as importantly is the engineering effort. In fact, often our best sales people in the cloud vertical are our engineers that are developing the software, the systems, the optics that ultimately make their way into those networks. That engagement model is something that we’re very comfortable with. We’re very used to because of the strengths that we hold in the routing space. We’re just now extending that sales model and the engineering engagements across new footprint.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rod Hall, Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Rod Hall: Yes. Hi, guys, thanks for the question. I just wanted to revisit the question of second-half drivers, I guess, in the context of the service provider vertical being so weak this quarter. And then what I keep hearing you guys say, I got this service providers, kind of at the top end of the list of drivers. I think you said that last quarter as well. And so, can you just juxtapose those two things for us and let us know kind of what you’re thinking in terms of visibility and is – what you’re seeing this quarter kind of consistent with what you had expected to see? And then I have a follow-up?
Rami Rahim: Yes. Sure, Rod. So in the service provider vertical, I think, it’s more of the same in terms of market dynamics that we have been calling out now for a number of quarters. The service – many of our service provider customers are under business model challenges. And as a result of that, there’s consolidation. There are all sorts of distractions. There’s also investment priorities around RAN and spectrum purchases and so forth that we have anticipated will impact this part of our business for sometime. There are sort of catalysts and even some green shoots that I do think will play out over the next few years around 5G, around our partnership effort with Ericsson, around our telco cloud momentum that we are seeing in the market, some of the portfolio enhancements that we’re making around the metro and mobile backhaul, which is very much aligned with the 5G growth. So I – we still expect that service provider all up for 2019 is going to be down on a year-over-year basis. What we’re calling out is, if I – if we take a look at the pipeline, the specific opportunities that we see in front of us, the second-half of the year will be better than the first-half of the year. That’s really the extent of the commentary that we’ve made around the remainder of this year.
Rod Hall: Okay. Thank you, Rami. I appreciate that. And then, Ken, I just had modeling question, the days payable jumped down a lot and I know you’ve made a comment in the prepared remarks. But could you just revisit that comment and maybe go into a little bit more detail about why days payable was such a big change for the quarter?
Rami Rahim: Yes. So it really just has to do with the timing and how we’ve landed in a quarter. There was nothing intentional about the timing from our payable side. It’s just the way that – our invoicing from our contract manufacturers, in particular, worked out. It resulted in a little more cash went out the door than expense. I expect that to kind of recover in the future quarter – in this quarter in Q3.
Rod Hall: Is that affected by the tariffs at all, Ken, or is it just kind of a random event that…
Ken Miller: No.
Rod Hall: …doesn’t relate to anything that we would see happening out there?
Ken Miller: Yes.
Rod Hall: Okay.
Ken Miller: I really would – I really call it a random, but then it has no impact from the tariffs.
Rod Hall: Okay, great. I appreciate that.
Rami Rahim: Thanks, Rod.
Operator: Our next question comes from James Fawcett, Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Meta Marshall: This is Meta Marshall from – for James. Quick question. Just stepping back on tariffs, you noted the changes that you had made to kind of largely mitigate the impact, but that there would be kind of an ongoing impact in the second-half. And so can you just walk through whether production is being moved or whether there would be kind of a remaining ongoing impact that we should model unless the trade agreement is reached? And then, maybe just following-up on that. Is – what is kind of the ability to pass on a price change? And what have you found as an ability to do so? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Yes. From a tariff, the primary mitigation efforts have revolved around really changing where our manufacturing is being completed as an interest into the U.S. So we have a global footprint. As you know, we manufacture within China. We manufacture in other parts of Asia, which are non-tariff and we also manufacture in parts of North America, Mexico and U.S. So we have opportunity to move most of the production to other locations that was primarily done in China previously. And that’s really resulted us mitigating the vast majority. That said, we’re not able – we are not – we’ve chosen not to move all production out of China, so there are still some products that we still manufacturer only in China. And as always going to the U.S., we are seeing a tariff. It’s, again, it’s the minority of our total tariff exposure, if you were to go back, say, a year ago before tariffs, because we’ve been able to offset most of it. That 30 to 50 basis point impact that I’m talking about is really a difference between a 10% and a 25% tariff. So there is – we still expect to be a tariff in the second-half. In addition to the actual cost of tariff, we know some of the mitigation efforts by moving manufacturing from location to different locations has resulted in overall slight uptick in our cost of goods sold really as part of the mitigation. So there is some costs associated with that as well. We are passing along some of that tariff increase to our customers. We’ve been fairly successful of doing that. But there have been some situations where we haven’t been able to pass all the cost through, which is why we are seeing some impact to our gross margin.
Meta Marshall: Got it. And so would you kind of – if there were a trade agreement reach tomorrow, would that go away, because you would move that production back, or like how should we just consider the timing of how long the 30 to 50 basis point impact would kind of impact margins?
Rami Rahim: Yes, I think we would get a benefit of hover an agreement tomorrow to eliminate the tariff. I don’t think we would get back to our previous cost of goods sold, because I do not believe we would move manufacturing back into China. We would likely keep it where it currently is, which is – has a slight impact, but much less than the actual cost of the tariff. So we would see a benefit if the tariff would be eliminated.
Operator: Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee, JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Samik Chatterjee: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to start off with a question on the Wi-Fi upgrades, the cycle that you’ve mentioned a couple of times in the prepared remarks. As you’re talking to customers about the Wi-Fi 6, upcoming cycle around Wi-Fi 6, I know we have kind of earlier to that cycle. But are you getting a sense that customers are willing to upgrade to the Wi-Fi 6 product? And as you’re looking at kind of campus switching and Wi-Fi 6 together, should we think about it as a kind of a combined product cycle, or are customers thinking about it independently in terms of an upgrade?
Rami Rahim: Yes, thanks for the question, Samik. So I do think it’s still early days, but Wi-Fi 6 is going to be a pretty significant growth driver for us in the campus and branch segment. The first Mist Systems Wi-Fi 6 products are actually now shipping, and we even have a few early deployments with some of our high-end enterprise customers that are starting to leverage that technology. To your question around whether is standalone or more combined, it’s all of the above. There are customers that have decoupled buying cycles between wireless LAN and wired technology. And in those customers, we’ll certainly – we’ll sell them the technology that they want. But with every customer that buys wireless LAN from us, there is an opportunity to either attach immediately, or at some point in the future through the fact that we’ve now created a channel into that customer and built the relationships with the IT team to sell them additional technology, whether it be wired or security, or SD-WAN, as an example. So that synergy based on the early days of the integration with Mist is becoming more and more of a reality for us and we’re proving out the thesis that we had. I just also just want to point out, in order to realize the full potential of the AX standard, which typically add some level of complexity to a network, you really need to have the kind of cloud managed AI engine that Mist Systems brings to the table that I’m now seeing firsthand how valuable it is for our customers. It simplifies not only the deployment, but it also simplifies the ongoing operations of a wired wireless LAN network and many of our customers are absolutely loving it. And I think that can be extended – that experience can be extended to other parts of our portfolio as well.
Samik Chatterjee: Got it. If I could clarify on the cloud revenue that you had, you had a strong sequential growth this quarter. But you’re kind of guiding to a sequential decline next quarter that does suggest that they might have been some exceptional pull forward of revenues this quarter. So just want to clarify if revenues from the cloud side did come in better because of some pull forward from 3Q that’s what you saw?
Rami Rahim: No, I don’t believe this because of a pull forward. I think if you take a look at our cloud business over the last couple of years, we’re sort of seeing a bit of a cyclicality that’s happening throughout the year, where Q2 tends to be a little quite strong just based on the timing of deployments and seeing a bit of moderation on a sequential basis is not anything that I’m really concerned about. We’re going to see some ebbs and flows in this business based on timing of deployments. But the Meta points for cloud is that the really hard transition is now behind us. We’re now at a point in a very unique position in terms of the footprint that we enjoy in the cloud routing space. We will see a recovery in that business, a continued recovery based on the continued investments that our big cloud customers are making in the routing segment. And, of course, then that focus that we have on net new segments, especially in our net new technology areas and footprint, especially in switching.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Notter, Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
George Notter: Hey, thanks a lot, guys. Ken, maybe first one for you on the tax rate. 19.5%, I think is a certainly a bump up from the kinds of tax rates, I think, we talked about in the past. I guess, I’m wondering what’s really changing there? And then for Rami, I guess, I’m inferring from the conversation here that the service provider routing business really took a big step down in Q2. Your cloud business overall was flat year-on-year. We know that business is really heavily centered on routing, and yet the routing business was down 15% year-on-year. So I guess, again, I’m inferring that the difference there is service provider routing. Is that a hold up from customers waiting for the MX 5G line cards, or is there something else going on in service provider routing? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Yes. Let me start and then, Ken, why don’t you jump in on the question around with a tax rate. In the service provider space, which is largely determined by our routing technology, it really is just much of the business model challenges and the macro challenges, the challenges around service providers, as well as their focus on areas of investments that are outside of routing. Beyond that, I do think that, we’re in a mode right now where our traditional customers in the service provider space, especially Tier 1 customers in North America, are in and of themselves, not going to be enough for us to achieve growth in this vertical. So there is a very concerted effort within the company right now to build net new footprint, especially in International Service Provider account. So that’s going to take a number of quarters to build out. But that’s the thing that we need to do internally in order to sort of recover this – that routing and in particular routing in the SP space. That’s kind of the bulk of what’s happening in routing for us.
Ken Miller: On tax rate front, there’s really a couple of things if you really want to kind of reconcile to, say, last year’s rate, one would be the discrete items. Last year, we had some kind of discrete items that positively impacted our tax rate, which is why it was lower last year. This year, those discrete items are actually going the other direction slightly. And also really, it’s the international mix of earnings is a big factor on attach rate as well. So that also resulted in the rate being 19.5% for Q2. Now I’m trying to take some of that volatility out going forward by fixing the rate for the rest of the year on a non-GAAP basis at 19.5%. And the plan would be to, as we enter into next year, we’ll have a fixed rate for the full-year next year as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sami Badri, Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Sami Badri: Sure. Thank you. Regarding the software percentage of total revenue, the 10%, was the fair majority of that security revenues? Because there was a bit of an uptick in security and maybe you could just give me more color on that side?
Rami Rahim: Yes. Thanks for the question, Sami. I don’t think it’s just security, but certainly there is an element of it that’s tied to security because out of all of our technology areas, the software attach rate for security has traditionally been the strongest. The momentum we’re seeing in software is the combination of on-box software. So software that’s attached to systems, security, switching and routing that’s either way into our customers networks, and also the off-box software with things like the cloud management and AI solution for Mist or Contrail Enterprise Multi-cloud solution for the data center or for telco cloud. It’s that combination. There is a real strategy that we’re executing internally to increase software, the percentage of revenue. We’re very pleased with the progress that we’ve made. I think we are on track to achieve the objective of 16% software as a component of total revenue in the 2021 timeframe. And I think that the roadmap and the business models around those roadmaps that we have, we are introducing it to the market allow us to continue to see this momentum.
Sami Badri: Got it. Thank you. And then the – my next question has to do with the major customer that you called out approximately 10% or more of total revenues and I’m sure if you said more approximately. But did this customer spend or consume products across multiple segments, or was it predominantly just routing or switch, or switching? Maybe just give me an idea on what exactly the buying patterns are when these big customers come to you?
Rami Rahim: Yes. So we mentioned this is a customer that is in our cloud vertical and the technology areas are routing and switching, mostly.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Suva, Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Jim Suva: Thank you very much. Rami, you spoke quite positively about enterprise for the September or Q3 quarter. Looking at the results for this quarter, it looks like it was down year-over-year, I think it was about 6% or so you said or mentioned. Was there some delays or push outs to Q3? Or can you help us understand your confidence or why a challenge June quarter and then a quite positive outlook for the September quarter for the Enterprise segment? Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Yes. Thanks for the question, Jim. So we saw double-digit, in fact, 12% year-over-year growth in bookings in the enterprise vertical and even stronger sequential growth in bookings for the Q2 period in the enterprise space. That was fueled by a number of different factors. We had strength in the U.S. government, and I believe that is going to be a good vertical for us going forward. But we also have real strength in the technologies that we’re now introducing to the market that are giving us some real differentiation. I mentioned the campus and branch. SD-WAN is an area where we have been investing in and putting focus in over the last couple of years, that now is starting to become a contributor to our performance, where we’re seeing a very healthy pipeline. We’re seeing both accounts that we’re winning with a direct enterprise model, as well as leveraging our service providers as a channel into net new enterprise footprints. All of this is leading to the confidence that we have in the second-half of the year. Ken, you might want to talk a little bit about the difference between the revenue performance and bookings performance for the quarter?
Ken Miller: Sure. So as Rami mentioned, bookings were up double digits. Revenue, as you mentioned, Jim, was down 6%. That’s really a result of this – the deployments that our customers wanted there for our shipments into those orders. Linearity on the bookings perspective was actually quite normal. So we didn’t have a back-end in quarter or anything like that from bookings perspective. However, the way the shipments laid out, it resulted in the results that we have, and therefore, backlog went up in Q2. Our enterprise focus backlog went up, which gives us more confidence about Q3.
Jim Suva: Thank you so much for the details. That’s greatly appreciates.
Rami Rahim: Sure. Thanks, Jim.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Genovese, MKM Partners. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Genovese: Great. Thanks very much. Hey, Rami, I’m thinking about the verticals that Juniper competes in and they go through them in service provider. I see a company that reported this morning, just released a new product and had pretty strong results in that segment. I’m claiming to take a lot of share. In the cloud vertical, there’s a competitor reporting next week who has consistently outperformed for years here versus [indiscernible]. And then in enterprise, you’re kind of a point solution versus a much broader vendor. So I’m just sort of struggling, I’m sorry to put it this way. But I’m struggling to sort of think where is Juniper the best at. Like what technology, what market, what vertical are you bringing a unique – I mean, I know you bring differentiation? But where is it really taking hold? And where should I look for Juniper to really show some leadership in the market and gain some share over the next year?
Rami Rahim: Okay. Thanks for the question. There’s a lot to unpack there, but let me try. In the cloud space, we have a very unique position in cloud routing, a position that we have built over a number of years, where that strength in terms of the footprint that we hold has remained as a result of a very deliberate strategy to ensure that our customers have the very best technology in order to build out what is networks that carry a huge amount of traffic. That strength is really unique to Juniper. We have substantial market share. And the path forward is one, where we leverage that footprint to continue to grow in that vertical based on timing of deployment, but also the ability to grow into net new footprint, which we have a real opportunity to do so, especially with the 400-gig cycle that’s coming. In the enterprise. I would respectfully disagree with the notion that Juniper is a point player. In fact, we’re one of only two vendors in the market that has a full portfolio in the campus and branch that extends wired and wireless, as well as SD-WAN to provide our customers with an end-to-end solution that’s, in fact, embedded in security that is actually working in the markets. The momentum that we’re seeing in the market is not by accident, it’s very much a function of the fact that this is an area we focused in from a technology standpoint and from a sales standpoint. And then there’s the data center side, where we have some unique differentiation there as well, in terms of the software and the hardware capabilities. In the SP space, I think there is a market dynamic that people need to understand. If you’re going to compare us to others in the industry, you really have to look at this across a number of different areas. First, our strength has traditionally been more in North America. And as I mentioned earlier, I believe some of the bigger build-outs now are happening more internationally and we need to tap into that. And we do that through great partnerships, but also by betting on go-to-market for net new footprint, which is in the process of happening right now. Secondarily, it’s around sort of where are our technology strength lies. Today, it’s mostly in the core, in the edge and the metro. I believe that there are build-outs happening internationally that are more in the access mobile backhaul space, where our portfolio is still now sort of coming together. So as that comes together, we’ll be able to leverage the strength and the relationships we have with a number of customers to see a rebuilding of momentum in the SP space. That’s how I would characterize the strength we have, but as well as the opportunity that we have across the different verticals.
Michael Genovese: Well, that’s a very good answer to a tough question. Thank you.
Rami Rahim: You bet. My pleasure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tejas Venkatesh, UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Tejas Venkatesh: Thank you. I was hoping you could parse your switching performance between data center and campus in 2Q and what you see from an orders perspective, looking forward?
Rami Rahim: Yes, certainly. So, in the switching space, I saw, I think, we saw a meaningful sequential recovery off of a tough Q1. We still have ways to go and a lot of opportunity ahead of us in the switching space. I’d say that it’s sort of equally split roughly more or less between the campus and the data center environment. We’re certainly seeing some momentum in the campus space because of the fact that we’ve now plugged what was a gap in our portfolio and wireless LAN. In the data center, I think that our differentiation and our ability to penetrate net new footprints and to reaccelerate that portion of our business comes down to a couple of different things. There’s the hyperscalar opportunity with 400-gig, which is obviously very important in a key area focus. But then in the enterprise, it’s – getting the enterprise multi-cloud software solution that simplifies the deployments and the ongoing operations of data center build-outs in the enterprise that I think is going to help. Now we’ve introduced the first version of that solution, that software solution just recently. We’re in the mode of making sort of a very rapid enhancements that are based on specific customer feedback that we are getting. And I think as we get into the back-half of the year, it’s going to contribute and going to help us in the data center portion of our switching business.
Ken Miller: The only thing I would add to that is both our QFX product line, which is predominantly focused on data center and our EX, which is focused on the campus and branch, both grew sequentially. So we are seeing momentum across both sets of really switching platforms.
Tejas Venkatesh: Thank you. And as a follow-up, you mentioned, Rami, earlier that some of the bigger service provider deployments are happening internationally and that’s not traditionally where your strength has been. I wonder if you could speak specifically about the EMEA region, other routing companies appear to have outperformed Juniper in EMEA over the last few quarters. And now you’ve made leadership changes and so forth. We also have the Huawei dynamic. So talk to us a little bit about the EMEA region and your efforts there?
Rami Rahim: Yes. The EMEA region, of course, is a huge region that includes Western Europe, where we have a real strength in a number of specific accounts, Tier 1 operators, in particular. It also includes a number of emerging markets, Middle East and Africa, et cetera, where we’re still relatively a small player, but where we do see some real opportunity to grow the business. In fact, that is a big area of focus in net new accounts where we traditionally have not had a lot of presence and strength. So that is definitely a big part of the focus I just mentioned to expand into net new opportunities. Yes, outside of the U.S. where we have traditionally been strong, also outside of just Western Europe, which has been a driver of our EMEA performance historically, I think, we can sort of add fuel to that with more of the emerging market opportunities that I believe exist ahead of us.
Operator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I will now turn the call back over to Jess Lubert for closing remarks.
Jess Lubert: Thank you, operator. Before we conclude the call, we would like to make everyone aware that we will be hosting an AI for Enterprise TED Talk on August 14. We will also be participating in sell-side conferences hosted by Oppenheimer, Jefferies, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank this quarter. Additional details regarding our participation in these events will be available on our IR website. We look forward to meeting and speaking with many of you during the quarter. That concludes today’s call.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-04-25 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings. Welcome to the Juniper Networks First Quarter 2019 Earnings Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jess Lubert, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Lubert, you may begin.
Jess Lubert: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to our first quarter 2019 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release and CFO Commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today, and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and Juniper undertakes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the Company's financial results is included in today's press release. Following our prepared remarks we will take questions. Please lime yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami.
Rami Rahim: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. The March quarter played out largely as expected total revenue of $1.2 billion [ph] was above the midpoint of our guidance, as we experienced slightly better than anticipated trends across each of our core verticals. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.26 came in above our guidance range due to better than expected sales, stronger gross margins, continued cost controls and higher interest income, which together offset a higher than anticipated tax rate and share count. We're pleased with the progress we experienced versus our forecast. However, we are not satisfied with our Q1 results and remain laser focused on delivering a return to growth later this year. We believe we remain on track to achieve this objective and I'd like to walk through some of the items that are driving confidence in our ability to achieve this goal. First, we are continuing to invest in our go to market organization, which underwent a restructuring and a change in leadership earlier this year. While changes such as these are never easy and our actions created some anticipated headwinds, we saw improved momentum through the course of the quarter. Based on this momentum, I'm increasingly confident we have the right sales structure and strategy in place to win in the market. We are now in the process of adding sales headcount, which I believe should help accelerate our momentum through the course of the year. Second, we are continuing to see healthy trends in our Enterprise business. While this vertical was most impacted by the go to market disruption we experienced in the start of the year, Enterprise still experienced 3% year-over-year growth in Q1. Normalizing for an unusually large financial services transaction a year ago, our run rate Enterprise business grew double-digits in the quarter, which we think highlights the underlying health of the business. We remain optimistic regarding the outlook for our Enterprise business, which we believe is likely to see the greatest impact from our investment in incremental go to market headcount, as well as the recent acquisition of Mist Systems which closed in the second quarter. Third and building upon this last point, we're very excited about the acquisition of Mist Systems, a pioneer in cloud managed, wireless networks, powered by artificial intelligence. We believe Mist is truly disruptive technology and the early feedback from both customers and the field has been very positive. We are early in the process of integrating Mist into our go to market motion and educating the field on how to sell the company's products. While we do not expect Mist to generate material revenue during the 2019, we believe the Mist portfolio positions Juniper to disrupt the $6 billion wireless LAN market and pull-through sales of our campus switching solutions which could positively impact our results later in the year. Fourth, we are continuing to see success in our software business, which grew 8% year-over-year and accounted for more than 10% of revenue during the first quarter. This strength was driven by a combination of on-box and off-box offerings with revenue from our Contrail family of SDN-enabled management and control software solutions increasing nearly 40% year-over-year. While our success may not be linear, we believe our software as a percentage of sales will continue to increase over time, especially as we introduce new products and new business models designed to better monetize the value of our offerings over the next few quarters. Finally, we are continuing to see strength in our services business, which grew 3% year-over-year and accounted for 38% of our overall revenue. Our service team continues to execute well, driving strong services attach rates and renewals. While not a surprise, we continue to experience weakness within the cloud and service provider verticals. Our cloud business remains challenged as several of our large customers continue to run their networks hatter and the pace of port deployments was not great enough to offset ASP declines. While this dynamic caused our cloud revenue to accelerate as expected during the March quarter, we were encouraged to see a pickup in order toward the end of the period, which is providing confidence that momentum should improve over the next few quarters. Based on the capacity demand we are currently seeing, we remain confident we are holding our cloud footprint in the areas of the network where we have historically played. While we see the potential for improved port growth in our existing footprint to drive a return to growth over time, new use cases will be needed to achieve our long-term model. We are laser focused on capturing this opportunity and view 400 gig as an inflection point that creates opportunities for wins later this year that should drive share gains in future period. Our current product roadmap and strong customer relationships are driving confidence in our ability to secure these net new use cases in the cloud, particularly in the data center where we have a little present today. Within the service provider vertical, we continue to experience headwinds tied to our customer's business model pressures and the expected timing of project deployments. While we believe our service provider business is likely to remain challenged during the June quarter, we do expect the vertical to experience better trends during the second half of the year. We believe our service provider relationships remain strong and with our new MX 5G line cards about to start shipping, the Ericsson relationship off to a good start and our Contrail orchestration platform deeply entrenched at a number of global Tier 1 service providers, we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on carrier 5G and telco cloud initiatives that are likely to start playing out later this year. I think it's worth highlighting that we are in the early stages of launching several important new products that should strengthen our competitive position across our service provider, cloud and enterprise markets. Some of these anticipated products include, new MX 5G line cards that will enhance our 5G positioning and ability to capitalize on service provider capacity requirements. New QFX switches and PTX routing platforms designed to capitalize on customer 400-gig upgrades, enhanced Contrail enterprise multi cloud software capabilities that break down the barriers of incumbency and make moving to a multi-vendor, multi-cloud state a reality with increased simplicity and reduced cost. New cloud delivered enterprise capabilities that enhance our ability to penetrate enterprise campus and branch opportunities and new silicon photonics capabilities that potentially open new addressable market and enhance our competitive position during the 400 gig cycle. We believe 5G, the 400 gig upgrade cycle, SD enterprise and enterprise multi-cloud initiatives each represent large multi-year opportunities where we should be well-positioned to benefit over the next few years. Based on our current pipeline of opportunities, we expect to see normal seasonal trends during the June quarter. While we expect to see sequential growth through the remainder of the year and return to year-over-year growth during the fourth quarter, we do see the potential for seasonality to have some impact during the September quarter. Importantly, we remain confident in the long-term model we highlighted at our November 2018 Investor Day. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail.
Ken Miller: Thank you, Rami. And good afternoon, everyone. I will start by discussing our first quarter results and end with some color on our outlook. First quarter revenue of 1.2 billion [ph] was above the midpoint of our guidance. In addition non-GAAP gross margin at 59.3% was toward the higher end of our guidance range. These results, along with prudent expense management and higher than anticipated other income build non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.26 above our guidance range. Looking at revenue by vertical, results were largely in line with our expectations. Enterprise increased 3% year-over-year. Sequentially enterprise decreased 20% which is more than normal seasonality. As expected, our enterprise business was impacted by transitions in our go to market organization. Service provider decreased 9% year-over-year and 16% sequentially due to weakness across all geographies. Cloud decreased 18% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. While cloud capacity continue to grow, the growth in units was not enough to offset expected ASP erosion. From a technology perspective, routing decreased 8% year-over-year and 16% sequentially. Switching decreased to 23% year-over-year and sequentially. Security decreased 7% year-over-year and 35% sequentially. Our services business increased 3$ year-over-year, but decreased 5% sequentially. Software grew year-over-year and was greater than 10% of total revenue. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, three were cloud, six were service provider and one was an enterprise. Product deferred revenue was $140 million, down 12% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was due to the timing of the delivery of contractual commitments. For the first quarter, non-GAAP gross margin was 59.3%. The stronger than expected non-GAAP margin was primarily due to lower service costs and increased software. In the quarter we had cash flow from operations of $159 million. The primary reason for the sequential decline was due to lower net income, partially offset by net changes in working capital. We continue to execute our capital return program paying $66 million in dividends in the quarter, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of the first quarter of 2019 was $3.5 billion. The sequential decline was primarily due to the repayment of our $350 million bond that matured in the quarter. We continue to focus on maintaining an efficient capital structure. Before we move on to Q&A, I would like to provide you some color on our guidance, which you could find detailed in the CFO commentary available on our website. Our Q2 revenue outlook reflects normal seasonal trends, and while we expect revenue grow on a sequential basis beyond the second quarter, we do expect to see some impact from seasonality in Q3. We expect to return to year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. We remain confident in our long-term financial model that we outlined at our Investor Day in November of last year. Full year non-GAAP gross margin is expected to improve directionally with revenue volume from Q1 '19 levels and we believe gross margin for the year will be toward the midpoint of our long-term model. We plan to manage our operating expenses prudently; however, we expect the Mist Systems acquisition will be dilutive to earnings in 2019. Based on our current forecast we expect non-GAAP operating expenses on a full year basis to be flat to slightly up versus 2018. For the remainder of 2019, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be lower than Q1'19 levels. We expect higher interest income compared to the prior years due to favourable interest rates. Due to the impact of the acquisition of Mist Systems and a higher than anticipated tax rate, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.75 plus or minus $0.05 for 2019. If not for these items, our previous non-GAAP EPS guidance for the year would remain unchanged. The accelerated share repurchase program or ASR initially planned for Q1 '19 was delayed due to the acquisition of Mist Systems. We now anticipate entering into an ASR for approximately three $300 million this quarter, reflecting our continued conviction in our future prospects. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper success. Now, I'd like to open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Vijay Bhagavath, Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Vijay Bhagavath: Hi. My question is in the back half, please help us understand two big product cycles out there Wi-Fi 6 [ph] 400 gig in the cloud. Are these weighted more towards the fourth quarter or we could see any actions targeting the September quarter? Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Thanks, Vijay. So there is in fact a number of different product cycles that we're expecting will help this year. I think it starts with just our routing portfolio, in particular the MX 5G line card upgrades and we anticipate that those will shift this quarter. And typically the ramp for products like that where there is a large deployed base will start in the second half of the year. So that does feed into the confidence that we have in the second half. I've talked at length about the 400 gig, pretty broad product transition that cuts across routing and switching. The main focus for 400 gig will be on Wind [ph] this year that will feed into volume deployments and share next year. And then you mentioned wireless LAN, that's obviously a new and very important area of focus for us. There are a number of opportunities that we're seeing already in the early stages of integrating Mist into our portfolio and you know, not just in terms of wireless LAN, but the - it looks like our thesis for the pull-through effect of wireless LAN into other areas, like security and switching is playing out as expected thus far. So I'm quite optimistic about that. And then the Wi-Fi 6 standard that's going to be coming about, I think starts to work its way into volume deployments, not probably latter half of this year and into next year. So we're well-equipped to capture that trend as well. But I do believe that even prior to that we're going to see some good growth in that area.
Vijay Bhagavath: Thanks, Rami. A quick follow up for Ken if I may. Ken, you know recently you mentioned about, like staffing up sales headcount, how should we think about OpEx as percentage of revenue and you know any dynamics on the product gross margin line heading into the back half? Thanks.
Ken Miller: Yeah. So we did talk about full year OpEx for the year would be flat to slightly up. That is the last call we talked about it being approximately slow. So I do expect it to be flat to slightly up, that is a slight change, that is predominantly due to the Mist acquisition which as we mentioned on the Mist acquisition call a couple of months ago, it is going to be dilutive this year, the acquisition of Mist, but we do expect it to be accretive next year. So that OpEx is now in our forecast. In addition to that, I do - we are investing a bit in sales. Now a lot of the sales investment is being fueled or funded by some of the transformation we've already done in sales. We've taken some cost out, but we are putting more back in, so we will see a little bit of OpEx growth on the go to market side as well. But overall our OpEx as percentage of revenue should improve as I expect revenue to grow sequentially much faster and you know, that OpEx.
Vijay Bhagavath: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeffrey Kvaal, Nomura. Please proceed with your question.
Jeffrey Kvaal: Yes. I guess, I have a question and a clarification if I could. I think first on the question, when should we start to hear about progress in 400. Are you going to be able to share that in the second half? And to what extent do you have confidence that you'll be able to win on both the switching and potentially on the routing side as well?
Rami Rahim: Yeah. Thanks for the question Jeff. So we're doing everything. At this point right now we're laser focused on the 400 gig opportunity that is ahead of us. And there is obviously a big technology dimension to this and across the entire technology stack from our software capabilities, we've - as I've mentioned in the past made some very meaningful modifications and enhancements to our operating system to provide the modularity, the API program ability that our cloud customers want. We're working very closely with our big hyperscale cloud provider, as well as the Tier 2 worldwide cloud providers and meeting some of the specific requirements that they have, sometimes for example in terms of hosting third party agents that are very important to their network deployments. We're also, I believe based on what we know today, we have made exactly the right decisions in choosing merchant silicon technology for some parts or some layers of the data center network and our own custom silicon technology that I actually believe quite strongly that should give us some meaningful advantage and differentiation from a - especially a cost performance and the power efficiency standpoint. And then of course, there's engagement. Right now the engagement level with our large cloud provider customers is very high, engineer to engineer and talking about specific opportunities, what's required to capture them. I have no doubt this is going to be a very competitive space, but I'm quite confident that we're doing everything that we can. And we have a very competitive portfolio that will allow us to take share. You know, in terms of when it will become visible. Winds [ph] are rarely announced in this space. Our customers, our cloud customers in particular tend to be somewhat quiet about this. But I do think if we start to secure layers of the network, in particular data center interconnect and the data center itself that will start to contribute meaningfully to revenue next year.
Jeffrey Kvaal: Okay, perfect. And then my second more of a clarification. Do you feel like the changes in the enterprise go to market strategy are behind you now and we should get back to that low double-digit growth rate in the second quarter and through the balance of the year?
Rami Rahim: Yeah. So, no doubt there was some disruption in Q1 as we had anticipated and these changes are never easy, but honestly I'm very happy that we went through them. I do believe that the hard part is behind us. I think we have a much more efficient sales organization. Right now we removed layers, we increased span of control, we of course changed leadership and all of that I believe is going to result in better sales execution in the future. There still as we mentioned upfront some hiring to do to fill some of the gaps we've created in the sales organization or the opportunities I should say in the sales organization where we're going to be primarily focusing on you know front lines, native quota carrying sales representatives, across the whole segment, but in particular in the enterprise segment, we'll be filling those opportunities throughout the rest of the year. And I'm very optimistic and in fact confident that this will start to help us in the second half of the year. So part of our confidence in the improved sequential performance of the company comes from the fact that we're investing now in sales that will help us in the second part of this year and certainly into next year.
Jeffrey Kvaal: Thank you, Rami.
Rami Rahim: You bet. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ittai Kidron, Oppenheimer and Company. Please proceed with your question.
Ittai Kidron: Thanks. Hi, guys. A couple for me. First, Rami you've kind of laid out a very detailed new product roadmap here. It sounds like the next couple two, three quarters are going to be very busy from a refresh cycle standpoint. I guess, how do I get my hands around the risks that are associated with the refresh in the context of potentially customers pausing ahead of a refresh, how you accounting for that in your outlook for the year?
Rami Rahim: Yeah. We don't anticipate a lot of overhang or pausing in anticipation of new products that are coming. There's always some element of risk associated with that when you're introducing new products. But honestly I don't believe that it's going to be a big factor and certainly we've weaved that or we have anticipated that in the outlook that we have provided.
Ittai Kidron: Okay. Very good. And then with regards to Mist, can you be a little bit more specific with respect to the contribution of Mist in the June quarter, how much revenue you expect this to deliver and perhaps how was - how big is the headcount that you've added to with this acquisition?
Rami Rahim: Yeah. So we mentioned previously that we do expect it to be dilutive for this year and accretive next. All of the OpEx we take on day one and they're still in a ramp mode for revenue obviously. They have fairly immature amounts of revenue and we take in fairly immature amounts into this calendar year. That said, they're growing quite nicely and we do see it as a very strategic opportunity to insert into net new customers. But from a revenue perspective, particularly Q2 revenue it's quite immaterial, but we should start to ramp from there.
Ittai Kidron: Rami, when you look at Mist, how quickly do you think they get fully incorporated into your sell cycle. Are they going to be kept separate from a sales standpoint or mandated to sell Juniper gear [ph] as well? Help me think about that.
Rami Rahim: Yeah. So we are largely keeping Mist as a standalone entity within the company with the goal of ensuring that the momentum that they've seen over the last couple of years not only continues but accelerates. We're focusing primarily now on educating and enabling our broad sales organization to be able to sell the technology. And we're keeping the sales - the Mist most sales team as a standalone specialist team that can go after net new wireless LAN opportunity. And like I said earlier, so far we're seeing that it's become a great door opener for us in net new accounts where we have an opportunity to sell more of the portfolio, in addition of course to wireless LAN. Now over time, there will be more technical integration. But honestly we're being cautious, careful and taking our time. As you might have seen we announced not too long ago a software defined enterprise offering that comes across as the WAN, as the security, SD switching and we have done some integration with Mist already to provide a holistic solution for enterprise customers. And so thus far the reception from customers, although it's early has been really encouraging.
Ittai Kidron: Very good. Good luck, guys.
Rami Rahim: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Simon Leopold, Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
Simon Leopold: Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to first touch on - and sort of try and understand product mix versus vertical mix, in that I would expect that that routing would tend to be stronger than service provider and cloud and less strong in the Enterprise group, yet the vertical mix sort of moved in the wrong direction in terms of relative to what I'd expect on product mix. Could you help me sort of think about the correlation between your product groups and your verticals? Thank you. And I have a follow up.
Rami Rahim: Sure. So yeah, I mean, you're right that SP [ph] is predominantly routing. We've talked about that at on analyst day, I want to say 80% plus of our service provider business is routing. Cloud is majority is routing, but switching actually has a bigger share than it doesn't say service provider. But still the majority of our cloud business has been routing, has always been that case, that way. With an enterprise, it's predominately switching and security and - but we have a very - over the last several quarters we've been actually growing our routing business, albeit it's still the third in rank order of technologies into that vertical.
Simon Leopold: Can you explain that quarter because the movement was the opposite, routing got better, but service provider and cloud are weak and enterprise was strong, so that's where I'm confused
Rami Rahim: I mean, all verticals were down and all technologies were down sequentially. I think you're better comment is more about tempering of growth rates. But you know, on a year-on-year basis we did see routing down eight and service provider down nine, pretty highly correlated. Enterprise was the one vertical they grew on a year-on-year basis and the one technology that grew within enterprise, actually two technologies, routing and a little bit of security growth within enterprise switching was down in enterprise. It's worth mentioning that some of the newer routing products that we've introduced over the last year have been really optimized for net new footprint, where we have not really participated in the past in the route, in the enterprise space. So products like the MX10003, the MX204 have been very well received by the enterprise market.
Simon Leopold: That's helpful Rami. So just to follow up, I wanted to get a perspective of you - in terms of your longer term vision on your silicon photonics products that you discussed at the Optical Trade Show in March. So I understand you're really just getting started, but we've sized the market for data center transceivers at maybe 1.5 kind of plus billion for 100 gig. I just want to get your sense of where you think you can take that particular business as you grow it? Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Yeah. I appreciate the question. So we remain optimistic, excited about the silicon photonics opportunity. I mean, the fact of the matter is, there is a large part of the network investment that happens by our customers. That's not in the network elements themselves, but it's in the interconnect between networking elements. We've always looked at the 100 gig cycle as an opportunity to learn, because 100 gig cycle as you know is very mature right now. There are a number of offerings that are in the market right now. Pricing is already quite competitive and we are doing just that from 100 gig. We have run into some challenges with our 100 gig silicon photonics efforts, not in the core technology, but in the assembly level 400 gig. And those - the lessons from that are all feeding their way into 400 gig and we decided basically we're going to emphasize or put most of our energy and attention on getting 400 gig and the goal for 400 gig will be to release 400 gig optics using our core, very differentiated IP technology right at the beginning of the volume deployment for 100 gig. So whereas we had anticipated shipping, you know, 100 gig products in the first half of the year, I would say that's not going to happen, but we're on track to deliver the 400 gig product where I believe the opportunity to really differentiate from an economic standpoint in time for the volume ramps.
Simon Leopold: And you think that's maybe the turn of the calendar year?
Rami Rahim: Is around that time frame, yes.
Simon Leopold: Great. Thank you very much for that. Helpful.
Rami Rahim: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Silverstein, Cohen. Please proceed with your question.
Paul Silverstein: Thanks, Ken, did I hear you correctly that you expect gross margins to hit the midpoint of your 58% to 62% fiscal '19 through '21 guidance this year, was that the comment?
Ken Miller: Yeah. So for full year FY '19, I expect margin to be approximate the midpoint, which is 60%.
Paul Silverstein: And can you discuss the visibility and the opportunities and risks to getting there. And I recognize it's a journey and there's still a ways to go. But can you talk about the ability to get to the higher end of that 58% to 62% range. What it will take and what timeframe?
Ken Miller: Yeah. So to get to the higher end it really comes down to mix and most of it is product mix that drives our margin more than anything. In addition, between now and the end of this year volumes will definitely play a factor in a positive way. So as we gain more volume this helps out our fixed cost, variable cost ratio, so that improves margin quite significantly as we ramp up throughout the year. But going forward long term, the answer is predominantly in mix. You'll see more software sales is obviously a positive. And then having you know, the value engineering that we've been doing, the design for value efforts, we've been doing across all of our platforms. We've talked a lot about 400 gig just as an example, those platforms we believe are going to better cost performance than our previous generation routing and switching lineups. So we should see improvements, on kind of like-to-like product, but more significantly mix is the biggest factor moving forward.
Paul Silverstein: Ken, any change in pricing dynamics in the marketplace?
Ken Miller: We definitely have the pricing ASP erosion built into our long-term model. We're presuming those are going to be you know, normal kind of trends. There's nothing that we're expecting beyond kind of typical you know, cost per bit kind of price erosion.
Paul Silverstein: No accelerations?
Ken Miller: No.
Paul Silverstein: Great. Appreciate it. Thanks, guys.
Ken Miller: Thanks, Paul.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tejas Venkatesh, UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Tejas Venkatesh: Thank you. You talk about improved cloud orders toward the end of the quarter and you're making incremental sales investments into the enterprise. So I wonder how might you rank order the incremental growth opportunities by vertical over the next one to two years. You did lay out detailed targets at Analyst Day, but a lot has changed since then.
Rami Rahim: Yeah, thanks for the question. So in terms of cloud, I think this is going be a year of stability. Basically last year was you know was a tough year. We saw some meaningful declines as a result of the product transition. This year, I think we can say that the bulk of that product transition is behind us and we are in stability and rebuild mode off of you know, the base that we have created for ourselves now coming into this year. I remain optimistic, that we have retained our footprint. We have done everything that is within our control and power to ensure that we are you know very relevant within our hyperscale cloud and our broader cloud customers. And I've talked at length about the technology that we have been working on will introduce into the market to see growth from here. And you know with the addition of net new footprint, I believe that the long term model that we provided in our Analyst event in November of last year is certainly within our grasp. As far as the other two verticals you know, as you know in the SPE [ph] space, we anticipate that there is going to be - it's going remain a dynamic environment. Our service fighter customers are dealing with business model challenges of their own, and so for that reason our longer term outlook, our long term model has been slight declines in SP. I do believe that there are catalysts that could improve things in the future. We're just not baking that into our model at this point. Things like 5G, our telco cloud, transformation efforts where we're essentially now building a new muscle and emotion in the SP space to help them transform their central offices into essentially service next generation highly automated service delivery engine. And the way we monetize that is not just through boxes, but by selling software. In particular, our Contrail software suite. And enterprise is where I believe we should see growth this year, despite the fact that we lost the momentum in the Q1 period, primarily because of the trend - the changes that we made in the go to market organization, I believe that the market opportunity remains healthy. There's a lot of growth potential for us across both the data center, as well as the campus environment. We as you know have made now investments, including M&A, in Mist systems that I believe gives us a really compelling portfolio. So I'm actually quite bullish on growth for the enterprise all of this year.
Tejas Venkatesh: And as a follow up, revenue this year will be similar to 2011. Now I know you're making organic investments and you've acquired Mist. But I wonder if there's been any additional thinking on M&A and what other parts of the portfolio you might want to round out. And is that why you have inked this $500 million credit revolver?
Rami Rahim: Yeah. In terms of M&A, I would say that if you look at what we did with Mist systems, it's a good example of the kind of what I would say really value creating M&A opportunities that we would pursue to accelerate a strategy that we were already embarking on. You know, we have seen now for two years solid year-over-year growth in the enterprise space. We believe that the shift in the enterprise towards cloud delivered SaaS software based offerings is creating new opportunities. In fact, levelling the playing kph field, whereas in the past it was much more difficult to compete. We have our own organic efforts that we have put into the market that have helped us in achieving the momentum thus far. And we look to inorganic ideas like Mist systems that can only accelerate the pace of growth and that's a wonderful example of what we would be thinking about going forward as well.
Ken Miller: On a credit revolver side, I would urge you not to read too much into that, that's just really a timing situation, we had a revolver before, it was a five year life. It expires. We re-opt for another five years effectively. This I just think is good hygiene, it's a low cost, access to quick cash if needed. We have never drawn against our revolver in the past. At this point, I don't anticipate having to draw against this one either. It's just nice to have as a backstop.
Tejas Venkatesh: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rod Hall, Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Rod Hall: Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I guess, I want to come back to this OpEx issue and you know the fact that 100 gig is doesn't sound like it's going to be available in Q2, but it's only - I mean, that's less than two months since I guess you guys talked about so look at the [indiscernible] And so I wonder when did you determine that it wasn't going to be available? And then I also want to clarify whether are you saying that you'll still deliver 100 gig at about the same time as 400 gig or are you skipping this? Can you just clarify what the roadmap now looks like with respect to those different speed technologies?
Rami Rahim: Yeah, Rod. Thanks for the question. I'm happy to clarify. So we've always thought about 100 gig as an opportunity for us to essentially flush out the technology, prove that the core technology works and then really make meaningful progress in terms of market share capture and differentiating our products in the 400 gig cycle, primarily because 100 gig have been - it's already a very mature market today. In terms of timing of the assembly issues, it's very recent and we'll make a decision on 100 gigs later this year and we're certainly happy to keep you posted on that. But again, I want to emphasize the fact that we've always thought that 400 gig is where the opportunity largely lies. And I do believe that we'll be able to capture that opportunity the beginning of volume ramps, which is really around the beginning of next year.
Rod Hall: Okay. Thanks, Rami. And then I wanted to just - this is more of a clarification, but just as I look at the revenue trajectory, you guys are saying seasonality in Q3, but the last couple of years seasonality has been down quarter-on-quarter, so I'm assuming you're saying up a little bit, like low single digits in Q3. But if that's the case then your Q4 to get the year-over-year growth you've got to be up $50 million or $100 million, not you know, not maybe quite that much, but at least 50 sequentially and that's a pretty good sized quantum of revenue that you've got to achieve in the fourth quarter. And I just wonder, it sounds like you feel pretty confident on the MX 5G line cards, but how much visibility do you have there and why do you have confidence you can get to growth in December?
Ken Miller: Let me talk about the seasonality and then I'll let - Rami, do you want to touch on the confidence in Q4. But - so you know, first of all to start off with this year is largely playing out as we expected, including the second half. We've been calling for improved second half trends throughout the whole year and historically it's important to note that Q2 and Q4 are typically our strongest quarter season from a sequential perspective, Q1 and Q3 have been challenged. To your point, the last couple of years. Q3 has been kind of flattish. We do expect to do better and flat. We expect some sequential growth in Q3. But I think you know, about 3% is a good kind of expectation for Q3, about 3% sequential growth, which would be better than historical seasonal. But you know, kind of - you know, not as robust as Q2 and Q4, we expect goes to be stronger sequential quarters for us.
Rami Rahim: As far as the qualitative assessment of the second half, I'd say there are a number of things that give us some confidence. First is, we do have visibility into timing the of buildout. In the SP space in particular, but also in the enterprise and the cloud. A big part of the sales transformation that we embarked on in the Q4 and Q1 has been around improving our forecast - forecasting rigour and I think we're going to start to see more of that benefit as we go - as this year plays out. It's already I believe helped us. Second, I mentioned that coming out of Q1 we were encouraged by the momentum, relative to when how the quarter started, that I think feeds into our confidence. The sales investment, we we've essentially through the tough decisions and actions that we've made created the opportunity for us to invest in sales and I think that the product pipeline supports that investment. And then yes, the innovation, both the organic innovation MX 5G, our software enhancements that we've made across all of our products really, especially in terms of management and simplicity of our switching, and then our security assets. And then last but not least, you know, our inorganic efforts with Mist that I think start to help in the latter part of the year as well.
Rod Hall: Okay, great. Thank you, guys.
Rami Rahim: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee, JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Samik Chatterjee: Hi. I just wanted to start off with the security business. Can you just help me understand the lumpiness you're seeing there? You had a good quarter in 4Q and then new 1Q you had a softer quarter. Can you just help us understand the lumpiness there? And can you also talk about kind of what you seeing in terms of discussions with some of these service providers relative to your security portfolio?
Rami Rahim: Yeah. Happy to address that. So security, we certainly lost some momentum in the Q1 period. Now a big part of that was the fact that there is a component of our security business that's very lumpy because it's essentially captured or its product that's sold to large customers in the cloud and service provider space. So whereas we had healthy cloud and SP spending in the Q4 period, we just had much less of that in Q1 period. There's no good reason other than just timing of deployments. Despite the fact that I do believe the sales transition had an impact, we actually saw our security grow on a year-over-year basis in the enterprise space, but I think that momentum has continued. Looking forward for security, I think that the investment in go to market is going to help, especially on the enterprise side. In terms of the portfolio, we recently introduced the - or have significantly enhanced the high end of our security portfolio and we're seeing a lot of interest, especially in cloud and service provider, as well as some large enterprises, like financial services and banking. In that product line, now many of the interest today shows up in terms of proof of concept testing, validation of features, et cetera. And that has a good potential of translating to sales and revenue in the up quarters. And the last thing I wanted to say about security is that, we've really now integrated security into our solutions, our enterprise focused, service provider focused solutions. So if you take for example our software defined enterprise offering, that includes wireless LAN, now that includes switching. It also includes security with a single pane of glass, very simple, management interface that very much appeals to the enterprise market. We're thinking about security as a component of a portfolio sale increasingly and that has worked for us in the past. I think it's going to work for us going forward.
Samik Chatterjee: Got it. Can I quickly ask for an update, on at the Investor Day you talked about rolling out subscription offerings in the Frontiers [ph] and can we just ask for update where you stand ready for that. Is that something that's coming through in the remainder of the year or ramping up kind of as we go through to kind of the remaining quarters here?
Rami Rahim: Yes. Thanks for the question. So we did see good year-over-year growth in security - sorry in software and as we mentioned software is starting to contribute an increasingly significant portion of total revenue for the company. This is very much a part of the strategy that we have been executing on for the last couple of years. It cuts across both on-box software offerings, as well as off-box offerings. You're right we presented to you at the November Analyst Day a very simple uniform business model around software for all of our products that we introduced into the market starting this year. And as an example of that the MX 5G products that will be shipped this quarter will adhere to that new simple model. It will have a base perpetual component. And then the opportunity to up sell into additional features and value using subscription models. So I expect that all of this effort, the energy, that the simplicity of the model that we've introduced is going to actually help us achieve our long-term projections for security or switching as a component of sales which is up 16% by 2021.
Samik Chatterjee: Okay, great. Thanks for the update. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Notter, Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
George Notter: Hi, guys. Thanks very much. I wanted to ask about the Cloud business. If I go back over the last few quarters we've had lots of conversations about the MX, the PJX transition and you know obviously if I go back that was a big source of erosion in terms of you know, the price realization per gig that you were getting. And we got the impression that you guys were you know through the meat of that transition. But if I look at the financials here, I mean we're still seeing down I think 18% year on year. It seems like - and you're saying there's capacity growth among that customer set. So it feels like we're still getting pretty significant erosion here. I guess, I was trying to understand you know exactly what the dynamic is. Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Yeah. So you're right in that, the bulk of the transition, the product transition is behind us at this point. We're not entirely through it, but we're mostly through it at this point. I think the bigger impact right now is really around the pace and the timing of deployments. And you know, as painful as the product transition was I do it all over again because it has resulted in us now be holding the footprint that's so important for us, that will event eventually translate to growth and will give us the opportunity to sell into net new footprint. What I look at - when I look at the cloud space is even though the CapEx spending might moderate, I look at the businesses of our cloud customers and across the boards you see that they are all crushing it, they're doing amazing things with their businesses. And as a result of that they will need to continue to invest in their networks. I think that eventually helps us in the routing space where we have the strength and it's exceptionally important for us to grow into net new footprint which we're doing, as I mentioned everything we need to do from a technology and engagement standpoint that will enable us to grow. Going forward the last the last thing I'll just mention is, you know exiting the Q1 period we did see a pick up in momentum that has fed into our confidence that we should see sequential improvement from this Q1 low.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tal Liani, Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Rami Rahim: Hey, Tal. Are you there?
Operator: Tal, your line is now live. Our next question comes from James Fawcett, Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
James Fawcett: Yeah. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask really quickly on Mist, we've heard some positive feedback on from channel partners et cetera on that product and you've talked about like hopefully being able to pull that through or use that to pull through other Juniper products into the enterprise et cetera. Do you - I know you're not expecting revenue directly from Mist to contribute much this year, but really ramp in 2020. But can you talk about like what the time to, I guess training and productivity and how we should think about starting to see evidence of Mist traction and how it can help the rest of the portfolio?
Rami Rahim: Yeah. Thanks for the question James. So first I will re-emphasize that I truly believe that Mist is very unique technology in the industry that brings to bear their AI capabilities, the cloud management, superior visibility and very importantly the scale to capture a very large enterprise customers that other solutions - that are cloud managed just simply don't have the capability of doing. We are already in the middle of training our broad sales team worldwide to understand how to articulate the value proposition of the product. I personally have been involved in many of the early customer conversations and have heard firsthand the excitement from those customers and I have seen again firsthand how Mist can be used as a door opener that gives us the opportunity to position other products. So not meaningful from a revenue standpoint in the Q2 period, I do believe that it starts to be meaningful based on net new footprint, based on the capability of our broad sales team, to position the technology, you know, in the latter part of this year and certainly I believe it becomes now accretive to us next year. And I think it's important to note that I mean, Mist has sold [ph] with the hardware, as well as the software delivered from the cloud, so that software also is going to be recognized ratably over a period of time. So although the bookings, you know, ones will start to come sooner rather later, the revenue will be drawn out a bit, which is in line with our long-term kind of software subscription model.
James Fawcett: Got it. And thanks for the clarification on recognition, that's helpful. Ken, just a follow up question. Normally I hate to kind of parse guidance and language, but I just want to understand is that - in the first quarter you posted $0.05 of EPS upside, you're saying excluding the impact of taxes and the Mist acquisition that your EPS guidance would remain unchanged for the year. And it seems like at least, where you're pointing people for revenue, at least for the third quarter is a little bit below where the street is. So I'm just wondering where those deltas, like why they're emerging and what's different maybe then perhaps how at the very least the street had things modeled and kind of what's making for those small changes if you will?
Ken Miller: Yes, I would say kind of at the highest level. Revenue is largely in line with what we expected for the full year. I mean, I do think Q3 - you know I already mentioned I think you bringing that growth rate to 3% makes more sense to me, given the seasonality we normally see in Q3 is a tough quarter for us, but the upside in Q1 somewhat offsets any of the model there. So I think the full year is largely in line. The biggest change of the year is going to be OpEx, you know, OpEx I do think will be flat to slightly up, whereas before we thought approximately flat, plus or minus, so and now taking flat, plus and that's largely...
James Fawcett: Sorry - sorry just to make clear. So it's flattish, it's flat up slightly up, plus Mist or because of Mist acquisition?
Ken Miller: Because of Mist, because of Mist.
James Fawcett: Right. Right.
Ken Miller: Because of Mist, and that's you know, that's now downs now Juniper, right. So that's now baked into our full year OpEx expectation. The other thing I would mention is tax rate. You know I do think it's going to trend up from last year's levels, it improve from Q1. The tax rate would be a bit of a headwind. Last but not least, into the ASR timing which pushed, we expect to that in Q1. Now it's going to be done in Q2. We expect we do have some favorableness on the other income line due to interest rate improvement. But those are kind of the puts and takes to the full year EPS guidance.
James Fawcett: That's great. Thank you so much for that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sami Badri, Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Sami Badri: Hi. Thank you. My question really pertains to Juniper legacy Xmas [ph] networks or Mist Systems and more specifically if I look at your customer revenue mixes across enterprise, telecom and cable and cloud and from 1Q 2018 to 4Q '18 you did have a year on year ramp in your revenue growth rate. And as we think about 2019 excluding Mist, do you expect to see a very similar type of ramp going through 2019, as we saw in 2018 mainly driven by enterprises? And maybe I have a follow up after that.
Rami Rahim: Yes. So we absolutely expect sequential growth in revenue throughout this year. Mist, it will be a factor but not the reason. I mean, Mist will be relatively immaterial to the grand scheme of kind of Juniper's size and scale from a revenue perspective, but it should growth as well, but it won't be the driver of the overall growth of Juniper. We expect sequential growth. Enterprise as the one vertical that we expect full year growth, year-on-year we expect that momentum to continue and actually accelerate as we kind of move through the salesforce transition that we - that we were kind of in the middle of exiting and moving on to more productivity as we're hiring more sales folks. Cloud NSP, We also expect sequential growth off of Q1 levels and actually off of the Q2 guide, we expect sequential growth.
Sami Badri: Got it. And just to be clear, this is all excluding - is it excluding Mist throughout this ramp, right, the enterprise commentary?
Rami Rahim: Correct. Yes, yes.
Sami Badri: Okay.
Rami Rahim: We view Mist as an accelerator [ph] obviously, I mean, Mist will accelerate our enterprise plan that we had, an organic plan without Mist. We did believe we would grow enterprise.
Sami Badri: Got it. Thank you. The other follow up. I really have is regarding Mist and dilution now based on how the numbers have actually come about, I guess the dilution dynamic is between $0.5 and $0.15 of dilution from the acquisition. I know you guys can give us a tangible number, but are we on the higher end of this range or in the lower end of this range?
Ken Miller: So that the guide that we gave up prior to Mist was a $1.80, plus or minus 5 and revise that to $1.75, plus or minus five. So about $0.05 is the guide down and that encompasses Mist, as well as some tax rate adjustment, somewhat offset by interest income.
Sami Badri: Got it. And then just this is kind of more thinking like afar [ph] just given the announcement of Mist and as Contrail progresses, but - what would you anticipate the software revenue mix of total revenues probably a year out from today, just given there are a lot of moving pieces and changes occurring in the model, they will kick off 2020. What would be a reasonable mix assume or to shoot for in the model just from software?
Rami Rahim: So we have - we have the target of 16% for 20 21, I expect us to directly grow towards that between now and there. You know, it's not going to be perfectly linear, but I think from a forecasting perspective some sort of linear progression between here and there would be probably the best model.
Jess Lubert: Operator, we're going to take one more question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Suva, Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Jim Suva: Thanks very much for squeezing me in. I would say the best question for the last, but anyway. Regarding your commentary at the beginning, you mentioned customers are sweating their assets. Typically when that happens there's a certain duration then they absolutely have to come back and they come back feasting and indulging themselves on purchasing orders or something has structurally changed like you know some type of data compression or some type of optimization programs or something. Can you help us understand is that true in the situation from where you sit and see or has something changed because at some point the sweating cannot continue with the heated assets?
Rami Rahim: So I believe you're referring to the commentary we made around the cloud…
Jim Suva: Correct.
Rami Rahim: Customers essentially running their networks a little hotter.
Jim Suva: Correct.
Rami Rahim: And like I said earlier, when I look at the business performance of our cloud customers, they can't achieve that performance on a continuous basis and deliver the kind of experience that's so important for them to their customers without investing in their networks. So I - even if spending moderates, I do believe that this remains an incredible opportunity for us and this is why we're investing in it. So yeah, my belief is that cloud is in fact a growth opportunity for Juniper. There might be some ebbs and flows in the business based on deployment cycles, but network investment is going to be required and we're ready to capture that investment with a footprint that we have, as well as the you know all the effort that we're making to capture net new footprint.
Jim Suva: When do you think that will happen, I mean, at some point, I mean, they're just killing it with their you know trends and so it seems like it's got to be sooner or am I wrong with that because your outlook doesn't look like it's coming pretty quick?
Rami Rahim: I think last year you know, we saw a meaningful decline, this year I think we get to stability and then next year I think we can start to get to growth. And I believe that the long term model that we provided for cloud which is growth is absolutely in the cards, especially as we capture net new footprint and new cloud customers worldwide.
Jim Suva: Thank you so much.
Rami Rahim: Thank you. I appreciate it.
Operator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session and I will now turn the call back over to Jess Lubert for closing remarks. Thank you everyone for your questions. We look forward to speaking and meeting with you during the quarter.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-01-29 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Juniper Networks Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jess Lubert. Thank you. You may begin.
Jess Lubert: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to our fourth quarter 2018 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release and CFO Commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today, and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and Juniper undertakes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the Company's financial results is included in today's press release. Our Q4 '18 and fiscal '18 results and forward-looking guidance are provided under ASC 606, which we adopted on January 1, 2018, on a modified retrospective basis. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami.
Rami Rahim: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. We experienced mix results during the December quarter. Total revenue of 1,181 million was below the low end of our guidance as another quarter of strength in our enterprise business was more than offset by weaker than expected trends with our cloud and service provider customers. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.59 came in slightly above the midpoint of our forecast due to healthy gross margins, continued cost control and a lower tax rate. While we are disappointed by our Q4 sales, we are seeing success in several areas of our business that we expect to continue through the upcoming year and should help drive the business back to year-over-year growth at some point during the second half of 2019. We are particularly encouraged by the momentum. We are seeing in our enterprise business which grew 13% quarter-over-quarter and 14% year-over-year due to broad based strength across product and geographies. Given the breadth and the strength in our enterprise vertical, strong customer interest in new platforms such as Contrail Enterprise Multicloud and MX10003 along with the investment we are making in our enterprise go-to-market engine, we remain optimistic this business will continue to see healthy trend over the coming quarters and remain a growth driver for Juniper in 2019. I think it's also worth mentioning the success we are seeing in security, which grew 34% quarter over quarter and 18% year-over-year and surpassed a 100 million in quarterly revenue for the first time in several years. Our new product continued to resonate in the market and drive broad-based strength across a wide variety of customers. Our recently introduced high-end firewall line card saw particularly strong demand, which helped drive a high volume of deals greater than 1 million. Based on the momentum we're seeing, we remain confident that our security business will grow in 2019. We're continuing to see success in our software business which grew 32% year-over-year and accounted for more than 10% of total revenue during the fourth quarter. This strength was driven by a combination of on-box and off-box offerings with revenues from our Contrail family increasing more than 100% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis and rising more than 200% for the full year 2018. While we do not expect our success to be linear, we believe software will continue to increase as a percentage of our revenue over time, especially as we introduce new products and new business models designed to better monetize the value of our software offerings over the next few quarters. Conversely, we continue to experience weakness within the cloud and service provider verticals. Our cloud business has remained challenged over the last few quarters as several of our hyperscale customers have continued to run their networks harder. While continued support growth is driving confident that we are holding our hyperscale footprint and the MX to PTX transition is now largely behind us. The pace of this port growth in the portion of our cloud customer's network where we have historically played is slower than we expected. Based on what we're hearing from our customers, we believe wins and new used cases will be needed to drive the cloud growth we guided for at our November, Analyst Day. We are laser focused on capturing these opportunities and view the 400 gig transition as an inflection point that will present the opportunities for us to take share starting later this year. Our current product roadmap and strong customer relationships are driving a high level of confidence in our ability to secure these net new used cases in the cloud particularly in the data center where we have relatively low presence today. While business model pressures and the impact of consolidation may continue to impact service provider spending for at least a few more quarters, with our MX 5G product refresh and Contrail Solutions to drive telco cloud transformation, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on carrier 5G deployment and remain optimistic regarding our partnership with Ericsson. We believe these products and partnerships should position us to deliver better service provider results later in the year. We remain confident in our strategy and that we are taking the necessary actions needed to win in the market as each of our industry verticals transitions to cloud. We believe these transitions are likely to drive major technological change that will create significant opportunities to disrupt the status quo and take share. We intend to capitalize on these opportunities and while some of these changes may create disruptions in the near term, we believe they will play a critical role in returning the business to year-over-year growth at some point during the second half of 2019. Some of these actions we are taking are as follows. First, we have made significant changes to our go-to-market structure in order to better align our sales strategies to each of our core customer verticals. While many of these changes have been made over the last few months and may drive some near term disruption in our go to market engine, we believe more closely aligning our sales leadership and product management teams across our core vertical will result in greater accountability better products and a superior customer experience. We are also flattening our go to market organization and reallocating captured savings towards placing more product sharing sales reps into the field. We believe these actions will position us to see improved sales force productivity later this year. While our Chief Customer Officer left Juniper earlier this month, we are confident that the changes we have implemented are supportive of our strategy and should position Juniper to better capitalize on the market opportunities that will unfold over the next two years. Second, we are on the verge of introducing several new products over the next few quarters that we believe will further strengthen our competitive position across our service provider, cloud and enterprise market. By the end of this year, we expect that nearly all of our product lines will have undergone a major refresh that should enhance our position relative to key competitors. These anticipated offerings will include new MX line card that will strengthen our ability to capitalize on carrier 5G initiatives, new 400 gig platform that will improve our ability to capture data centric footprint particularly in the cloud and new enhancement to our Contrail Enterprise Multicloud platform that will help our mid to large enterprise customers transition to a multicloud world with increased simplicity and reduced cost. We also plan to introduce new silicon photonics capability that will further enhance our competitive positioning, and we plan to share more with you on this topic at the upcoming OFC Conference. We believe the 400 gig upgrade cycle, 5G deployment and enterprise multicloud initiatives each represents large opportunities where we are well-positioned to benefit over the next several years. Finally, we are taking actions to better monetize the value of our software which should help us capture more recurring revenue and build on the success we've experienced over the last few quarters. Going forward while we continue to sell hardware-based systems with a base level of software, we expect to increasingly look to monetize our more advanced software features through recurring licenses. We believe these efforts will not only prove beneficial for our customers but also create net new revenue for Juniper that will improve visibility, profitability and customer retention. We believe we have the right systems and sales strategies in place to drive this transition that should benefit our software sales over the next few years. While the changes we are making was held position Juniper to see sequential growth beyond the March quarter and a return to year-over-year growth at some point during the second half of 2019, some of these actions are likely to present near-term headwinds that we have factored into our Q1 outlook. We are also anticipating that the weakness we have been seeing in our cloud business continues through the March period. In addition, our Q1 forecast also factors in the potential to see below seasonal trends in our U.S. government business due to the recent shutdown of the U.S. Federal government which is historically accounted for about 15% of our enterprise revenue. Despite the potential to see near-term revenue headwinds, we remain focused on improving gross margin and optimizing our cost structure with the goal of positioning the business to see material earnings growth as the business recovers overtime. In summary while our business is lumpy and difficult to predict on a quarterly basis, we continue to believe in the long-term financial model we presented at our recent Analyst Day and remain optimistic regarding our long-term prospects. We are innovating in ways that truly matter to our customers in which we believe should position the business to see improved long term success. As evidenced of the confidence we have in our business, we are increasing our quarterly dividend by $0.01 per share and we expect to initiate an approximately $300 million accelerated share repurchase program. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper, I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for all of our stakeholders. I will now turn over the call to Ken who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more details.
Ken Miller: Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon everyone. I'll start by discussing our fourth quarter results then cover the full fiscal year and end with some color on our outlook. Fourth quarter revenue of 1,181 million was below our guidance range, primarily due to the slower than anticipated pace of deployments with some of our cloud and service provider customers. Despite lower revenue, non-GAAP gross margin of 60.9% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.59 which was the high-end of our guidance range. Looking at revenue by vertical, Enterprise increased 14% year-over-year, driven by strength across all geographies and technologies. The 13% sequential increase enterprise was better than normal seasonality and slightly above our expectations. Service provider revenue declined 15% year-over-year, primarily due to the weakness in Americas, partially offset by strength in EMEA. Sequentially, service provider declined 5% primarily due to weakness in the Americas and APAC. Cloud revenues declined 8% year-over-year and sequentially due to the pace of deployments. As Rami mentioned, we are confident in our position with our strategic cloud customers and that we are holding our footprint. However, the pace of deployments is proceeding more slowly than we previously expected. From a technology perspective, routing and switching businesses both declined year-over-year. Routing declines were largely due to the pace of deployments and service provider, which was partially offset by strength in enterprise. On a sequential basis routing was down 10%, driven by service provider and to a lesser extent cloud, partially offset by an increase in enterprise. Switching declined 2% year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of the adoption of ASC 606, which was partially offset by the strength in enterprise. The 3% sequential growth was driven by enterprise and service provider, partially offset by a decline in cloud. Security was up 34% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, security saw strength in enterprise. Sequentially growth was driven across all verticals. Our Services business declined 1% year-over-year and increased 5% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was due to the adoption of ASC 606. Without the impact of ASC 606, Services would have increased 4% year-over-year. We are pleased with the performance of our software offerings, which were greater than 10% of total revenue in Q4. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, four were cloud, five were service providers and one was in enterprise. Product deferred revenue was $144 million, a decline versus prior year. However, without the impact of the adoption of ASC 606, product deferred revenue would have increased 6% year-over-year. For the fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margin was 60.9% stronger-than-expected non-GAAP gross margin was primarily due to the increased software revenue and strong service margin offset by mix. Non-GAAP operating expenses declined 2% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. In the quarter, we had cash flow from operations of $212 million. We paid $62 million in dividends, reflecting a quarterly dividend of $0.18 per share. Moving onto the results for the full year, fiscal 2018 was a challenging year with revenue declining 8% and non-GAAP earnings per share declining 11%. The Enterprise vertical was an area of strength where we saw sustaining momentum growing 10% for the year. Security was another highlight for 2018, growing year-over-year for five consecutive quarters and posting 14% growth for the full year. Looking at our other technologies, routing declined 16% versus 2017, due to the ongoing architectural transitions in cloud and a deceleration in our service provider business. Switching declined 3%, primarily due to the weakness in cloud, which was partially offset by enterprise. Our Services business remains strong with 5% growth normalized for the adoption of ASC 606. The strength in this business was primarily driven by strong renewal and the tax rates of support contracts. Looking at revenue from a geographic perspective, EMEA grew 8% while the Americas declined 14% and Asia-Pac declined 8%. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the year, fiber cloud four were service provider and one was an enterprise. Total non-GAAP gross margin of 59.9% was a decline of 2 points year-over-year. In 2018, we continue to focus on prudent and disciplined operating expense management, resulting in a non-GAAP operating expense decline of 26 million or 1%. For the year, we had good cash flow from operations of $861 million. From the capital return perspective, we repurchased $750 million worth of shares and paid 249 million in dividends in 2018. Our total capital return for the year was nearly $1 billion and represented 140% of free cash flow. Before we move on to Q&A, I would like to provide some color on our guidance which you could find details in the CFO commentary available on our website. Our Q1 revenue outlook reflects continued weakness with our cloud customers. In addition, we are transitioning our go to market organization to enable our strategy. While we are confident these changes will lead to long-term growth, this may result in short-term challenges. We have also factored in the partial U.S. Federal government shutdown and geopolitical uncertainty which we believe could adversely impact our business in the early part of 2019. These factors lead us to expect below normal seasonality for the first quarter. Beyond the first quarter, we expect revenue to grow on a sequential basis with better trends during the second half of the year. A return to year-over-year growth is expected at some point in the second half of the year. We remain confident in our long-term financial model we outlined at our Investor Day in November last year. Gross margin on a non-GAAP basis is expected toward the low-end of our long-term model in the first quarter due to lower revenue volume, product mix and the impact of China tariffs. Full year non-GAAP gross margins are expected to improve directionally from Q1 '19 levels and we believe gross margin for the year will be toward the midpoint of our long-term model. Moving on to operating expenses, despite the reset of variable compensation and typical seasonal increase of fringe costs in the first quarter we plan to manage our operating expenses prudently throughout the year. Based on our current forecast we expect operating expenses on a full year basis to be relatively flat versus 2018. For 2019, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate on worldwide earnings to be approximately flat versus 2018, plus or minus 1%. And we expect non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.75 to $1.85 for 2019. And finally, as Rami discussed previously, our Board of Directors have declared the increase of our quarterly cash dividend to $0.19 per share to be paid this quarter, to stockholders of record. This reflects an increase of approximately 6% compared to previous quarterly dividends. In addition, we plan to enter an accelerated share repurchase program of approximately $300 million. These activities reflect our confidence and the future prospects of the business. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. Now, I would like to open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Simon Leopold: It sounds like you are pretty optimistic about the second half of 2019 and expect that you get to growth again. Just wondering if you could help us to understand or appreciate. What opportunities you see as really the key drivers just things I'm thinking of whether it's 400 gig or 5G opportunities or a snap back in the cloud demand? Could you maybe rank order what are the key drivers we should be paying attention to for that return to growth?
Rami Rahim: I'll take that. So, there are few factors. First and foremost, as we mentioned within the cloud vertical, the MX to PTX transition is at this point largely behind us. And so while the pace of deployments in the cloud within the areas where we have strengths has been slower, we at least have reduced the impact of the product transition that was a big impact for us in 2018. Second, I would put the product roadmap. 2019 is a very big year for us from the standpoint of introducing new products across the board, especially in routing and switching. And yes, in particular for 400 gig but even in advance of 400 gig will be denser 100 gig products. Couple that with some of the optics innovations that we are going to be introducing to the market and we are going to have a very big year from the standpoint of just new innovation that we're putting into the market. Some of those happened this quarter, so our MX refresh, our MX5G refresh which gives us an opportunity to upgrade our very broad based MX product portfolio with tens of thousands of chassis, hundreds of thousands of empty slots worldwide, gives us an opportunity to start selling and seeing a meaningful revenue contribution in the second half. The third factor that I would add would be just the sales changes that we are making. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are making changes that are somewhat challenging in the short-term, but I have complete conviction are the right changes for the Company in the longer term, and I do believe that we will start to see the benefits of those changes in the second half of the year. So that’s how I would that stack rank or at least provide a color on the factors that give us confidence in the second half.
Simon Leopold: And Rami just to follow up on those comments. Is there any aspect of the weakness that you would attribute to the classic Osborne effect? Or are customers waiting for the new generation of products so buying fewer of the current offerings?
Rami Rahim: Simon, it's always difficult to predict how much that is a factor, but I would say thus far that has not been a big contribution to the impact. I think it's mostly the general weakness within the service provider vertical and the slowing of deployments in areas where we have strength within the cloud vertical. And on the cloud, I would say that the opportunity is still very much there to take net new footprints and that's what we are absolutely focused on right now.
Operator: Our next question is from Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Vijay Bhagavath: Two-part question quickly. 5G and the drumbeat is on, I mean, we recovered names like keys and others. So, would it be second half Rami? Or when would be the timeframe when Juniper's starting portfolio would start inserting itself into 5G broadband? And then the second part of the question is approximately, would second half also be the timeframe for any positive news on 400 gig cloud switching?
Rami Rahim: Let me address those in order. So first 5G, 5G I think does represent a meaningful opportunity for Juniper to see not just a recovery in our routing business, but honestly it takes share opportunity for us. That said I think it's going to be slow and steady. We are going to be running our business assuming that the challenges within the service provider vertical persist, but we are going to be preparing ourselves to capitalize on 5G opportunities as they become increasingly meaningful to our business. And to be more specific, first you mentioned routing, yes, I mean routing is a big area of innovation for 5G because 5G promises to put lot more capacity in the networking demand and we are going to be prepared for that with our silicon and software roadmap to capture the opportunity. Secondarily security, you saw the strength that we experienced in our security vertical in our security technology in the Q4 timeframe. A big contributor that strength has been in our high end firewall technology that has seen its way into all the key segment but especially in service provider and especially to support mobile networks. And I think as the world moves to 5G the need to secure the infrastructure the data the users at scale without impacting performance only increases. And third is telco cloud. 5G is necessarily going to be a cloud needed technology. Many of the most strategic engagement that we have with our SP customers today are around the transition towards a telco cloud architecture. And I'm happy to report the win rate has been really, really encouraging. Across the globe we are now entering into more and more strategic build out of telco cloud opportunity that start with Contrail edge cloud as a software, but gives us the opportunity to up sell into switching routing security and our virtual services. It's not yet a meaningful revenue contributor, but I do think it starts to meaningfully contribute especially as 5G becomes more of a factor. On your question about 400 gig, I think the real revenue contribution for 400 gig will be next year in the 2020 timeframe, but the decisions or at least some of the decisions will start to be made third in the cloud space and then followed shortly by the service provider space. So I think we are going to be well prepared with really fantastic technology and there is right timing for that technology this year to capture that opportunity across our entire routing and switching footprint and product line.
Operator: Our next question is from Paul Silverstein from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
Paul Silverstein: Rami, I think you made it clear that it’s a function of slowness and in demand in a part of carriers and the cloud. But I got to ask the question which is, is there any weakness due to competitive losses or due to place degradation and depending on connection with that slowness in demand?
Rami Rahim: Thank you, Paul. Yes, another one.
Paul Silverstein: Well, I do, but I'll let you respond to that. And then if I could, I have got quick clarifications of previous questions.
Rami Rahim: Yes, sure, so look within the cloud vertical as I mentioned, the product transition is now largely behind us and is less and less of factor with every passing quarter. The new build outs are taking longer to happen slower than what we had originally anticipated, but importantly you have to recognize that the port growth is actually still growing and growing meaningfully. So based on that based on our very tight connection that we have with our cloud provider customers, I do not believe that we are losing footprint that is not the issue that is slowing us down here. It really is just a matter of our cloud provider customers now consuming the capacity that they have built into their networks, and yes, running them harder before they increase their buildup. The cloud CapEx opportunity all up for us I think remained healthy. What we need to do now is capture new footprint in particular as we get closer and closer to the data center where our penetration within the hyperscale cloud providers is still very low. We have done a great job of penetrating the smaller cloud providers and enterprises and switching we have not yet been able to penetrate the hyperscale switching environment and that’s a big focus for us going forward.
Ken Miller: Yes and just to add Paul, from an ASP perspective, we are seeing what I would refer to just kind of normal pricing decline on a per capacity basis. You know the big headwind of MX to PTX is behind as Rami mentioned are largely behind us. There is still going to traditional routing pricing erosion that we are still seeing. And what's happening in the port growth although it's up, it's not enough to offset that kind of normal price curve. So port growth is up and that will be expected it to be and therefore the math has yet to turn to our favor on a real cloud routing.
Paul Silverstein: So just some very quick clarifications, so normal pricing of the extraordinary. Rami in response to the question of cloud, I hear your response on the service provider things, you're down 15% year-over-year. Is that just softness in spend or you also going to pick up to some extent? And then Rami just to be clear in your statement about new products, the '19 is a really big year. Was '18 a relatively light year on your new product intros?
Rami Rahim: '19 relative to '18 is definitely a very different picture in terms of new product introductions. So '18, it was probably more of a normal year maybe a little bit light, '19 is a very different picture in terms of the sheer of volume of product we will be introducing into the markets. Just to give you an idea four new custom silicon engines being their way into very different routing and switching product lines as well as merchant silicon offerings for the switching environment as well. And not to mention across the board in terms of our automation telemetry orchestration management software that we are going to continue to see substantial enhancements throughout year. So 2019 is a very big year from a product standpoint. On the SP side, I think the market dynamics are just difficult within the service providers right now. As you know CapEx is sort of flattish, has been flattish for some period of time. I think many of the service providers are focusing on things like 5G ran on acquisition of content providers et cetera et cetera and we have to play that out. I do very much believe that we are maintaining the strong connections to our Tier 1 telco customer that we enjoy worldwide. And again in areas of future growth, especially in telco 5 transformation I think we are doing very well but just not enough to contribute and to offset the weakness in the more traditional areas.
Ken Miller: Yes, we were expecting general pressure in service provider. We have experienced that for several quarters in a row. Down 15% year on year though that was not what we expected as we entered the quarter, nor do I think that’s the new normal going forward, that's really just customer concentration and lumpiness of the business. It really does fluctuate quarter to quarter but that’s not a trend that we expect persist going forward at that level.
Operator: Our next question is from Jeff Kvaal from Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.
Jeff Kvaal: I have a question and a clarification. I think perhaps Rami my clarification is for you. I was wondering if you could help us eliminate what you meant when you said that the cloud target or targeted growth rates in cloud require some new wins for you to hit. And then my second question which is a bigger one is. The outlook that you shared with us at the Analyst Day in November I would guess didn't anticipate necessarily as week of the March quarter as what we were facing now. Could you talk us through about how things changed over the course of the second half of the quarter because it was quite a big shift?
Rami Rahim: Let me start on the question about the cloud maybe, Ken, can address some of the questions about the outlook. So, the factors within the cloud vertical were one the product transition itself that we talked that linked about over a number of quarters now. And then last quarter we talked about some of the slowness that’s happening within the card vertical and investment in areas where we have strength. Assuming that that slowness continues that the pace of investments in the WAN area, the routing areas of the cloud market in particular the hyperscale cloud market persist, then yes, I think we will need net new footprint in order to achieve the growth that we outlined in our long-term model that we provided in our November analyst event. If for any reason the pace that which they are investing in the routing area picks up then obviously that’s lessens the requirements on obtaining net new footprints. Either way, we are absolutely focused from a technology, from an engagement from a software, a hardware standpoint on winning net new footprints, and I'm confident that we can.
Ken Miller: Yes, on the revenue side as we mentioned on the remarks and in the commentary we do expect sequential growth from here. I also highlighted that I expect the second half to be a stronger trend in the first half. And we expect to return to growth at some point in the second half. That said the EPS guidance that I put out there of a $1.75 to $1.85 does not depend on full year revenue growth this year. We are still striving for full year revenue growth but our EPS model does not depend on that. From a Q1 specific what is kind of changed, I would say the two things that what's calling out are obviously the federal government shutdown as we mentioned earlier, the sales disruption. So based on visibilities that I see now for Q1, I believe the Q1 guidance is very appropriate. I do believe some of the sales force option has been factored into that visibility and that should improve throughout the year. And we are still committed to long-term model I think that’s important to note.
Operator: Our next question is from Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Balaji Krishnamurthy: This is Balaji on behalf of Rod. I think I wanted to go back to the routing and pretty clearly the PTX discussion a little bit more. When we were looking at the PTX transition a year ago, you had been considering a large increase in PTX ports to offset the ASP declines. And clearly, that's not what's happening at this moment. So I wanted to check how confident you are that kind of port growth can still happen in 2019 versus potential for any kind of displacement are share losses that you may have there? And then I have a quick follow-up.
Rami Rahim: So I have utmost confidence that the PTX product line is the right product line, especially for cloud routing buildups. And as I mentioned, the transition from MX to PTX happened for a reason and that is that the PTX was extremely well received by our largest hyperscale cloud providers. And I do think, it's actually a unique platform in the industry in terms of robustness, physical scale, logical scale, programmability. All the things that are cloud customers truly care about. And the port growth within the PTX product line has actually been quite healthy. The factor that is impacting us today is simply the pace of which these build outs would with the PGF are happening they are slower than what we had anticipated and so even with more normalized pricing declines on a year-over-year basis it just has not been enough to get us to growth. That's essentially what's happening with the product in that transition. But again, I just want to emphasize, I think the PTX is a wonderful product and it's extremely well receive by all of our cloud customers.
Balaji Krishnamurthy: And then on the go-to-market transition that you announced, could you just walk us through a little bit of the thinking there to how you got and came to the conclusion that it is the gap in the go-to-market approach that you need to change versus any kind of technological or partnerships that you may need otherwise?
Rami Rahim: Certainly, so, first the changes that we've made in go-to-market are changes that we have been thinking about now for several months and we've now put into effect. The first of which is around having a more of its segments based model in go-to-market while we protect resources and we create more focused on success in each of our key verticals HP cloud and enterprise. But additionally, we've made some really tough decisions, but I think the right decisions and addressing benefit tool and minimizing the layers of the organization in making the overall go-to-market organization much more efficient. And even while preserving the investments in the quarter market our organizations, we have now increased the number of quota-carrying sales reps that will help us, especially in continuing the momentum or even accelerating the momentum that we've enjoyed in the enterprise vertical. None of these changes are easy, but I have utmost conviction that they are the right ones for the Company and they are going to pay off for us later this year. And I should just point out that Ken and I and Jeff are actually in Las Vegas right now at our global sales kickoff, where we have the opportunity to engage with our global sales and support organization. And I think people are feeling very good about the changes, even though they are disruptive and can be little unsettling in the short-term. There is general consensus they are absolutely the right changes for the Company and people are quite optimistic that we can leverage these changes to achieve success and win.
Operator: Our next question is from Tejas Venkatesh from UBS. Please go ahead.
Tejas Venkatesh: A couple of vendors this earnings season have alluded to cloud demand being weaker. So, it's true as how much visibility do you have into when cloud demand might get better?
Rami Rahim: We're not calling that right now. We are essentially seeing the slowdown in the routing market where we have the strength. But I do want to emphasize, when I look at the overall cloud opportunity. And yet we have real strength in the wider area in routing and DCI, data center interconnect, we have an incredible opportunity to move into net new footprint. And again, when we have a CTO, Bikash Koley that comes from that world that has been shaping our product strategy and our engagement strategy to attach towards that opportunity especially a 400 gig becomes a real momentum driver later this year. I think our ability to capture more of that share in the broader cloud opportunity is absolutely there.
Tejas Venkatesh: And as a follow-up, any chance you will parse the delta in 1Q guidance versus expectations? Essentially, I'm wondering how much of that delta is from weaker cloud versus weaker federal versus all the go-to-market changes?
Ken Miller: Yes, so I won't give you exact numbers, but I will tell you kind of the order of magnitude I would put, I would put cloud first and you think of that is kind of continuation of our Q4 results. So I think sequential is Q4 to Q1 are down primarily because of our actions in Q4, largely cloud deployment base and some service providers as well that would be number one. The second one I would argue with sales force disruption and then the third factor would be U.S. government shutdown. Although, they are obviously our largest enterprise customer, I don't -- I would rank them third, and we are trying to bridge that 100 million delta.
Operator: Our next question is from Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Sami Badri: I have a two-part question. So result from strength in the security and services segment and just two parts to this. The services revenue as a percentage of product revenue intensified to a pretty higher rate over 50% in 4Q 2018. What exactly is driving this? And then the second part is, on security you clearly have hit a new run rate of 100 million in the quarter. Should we expect this going forward through 2019 for each quarter? Or is this one-off in 4Q '18?
Rami Rahim: Let me start with the security question and then, Ken, why don’t you address the services piece. So first I have to say that I'm very pleased with the momentum that we've now seen in security for a number of quarters in the Q4 timeframe growing 34% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. What I like about the security number that we posted is broad-based momentum across cloud providers, service providers and enterprises. We saw strong demand across the different lines of products in high end to mid range and in the branch. And the diversity of used cases and just number of net new million dollar deals all point to the fact that I think we can see continued momentum in security. Will every quarter be as strong this quarter? I think that’s an unrealistic expectation. So I think you are going to have some lumpiness and some moderation especially as now the comps become more difficult. But generally speaking, I think that we have cracked the recipe for success in security in terms of the strength of product portfolio, but even more importantly in attaching security to our overall solution offering. So when we go to our customers and offer them a cloud data center solution, we know how to integrate security in that overall offering and I think that has worked quite well for us. Ken?
Ken Miller: And from a services perspective, it was really due to the strength of our attaching renewal rates and I would call out that majority of our services revenue is actually in that renewal category. It is product we sold over the last several years and we continue to service contracts. So, the correlation between current quarter product revenue and service revenue is really not that strong at all. The majority of the service revenue is prior period product sales and we continue to enjoy good renewal rates if we hold that revenue stream for us. I would add although it's still relatively small. We have seen a growth in our professional services business as well. And we obviously had a pretty strong quarter in Q4 in professional services.
Sami Badri: And I just have one other question regarding Asia and EMEA. In Asia and EMEA we have seen clear indicators from Huawei and CTA and they are being replaced by alternative vendors across the equipment stack and we saw some of the industry data in 3Q 2018 point to this. Can you just give us an idea on Juniper's win rate for some of these open market share opportunities given that you are seeing U.S. vendors starting to win in those opportunities?
Rami Rahim: Yes, I think it's still too early to call any sort of the benefit from the new cycle and the concern around Huawei technology. However, having said that, I mean Juniper is a company that takes the security and the safety of our product extremely seriously and to the extent to more and more of our customers internationally put focus on these types of concerns and I do think it could present an opportunity that we will be capitalizing on. But at this point and were still competing on the merits of our technology.
Operator: Our next question is from George Notter from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
George Notter: I guess I wanted to ask about the mix of port shipments into the cloud providers. On the rounding side I think in the past, you talked about 80% being PTX versus MX. I guess I'm wondering what that percentage is now? And then also I just want to go back to the question of routing market share among cloud provider customers and I heard what you said about port growth coming out of those customers, but at the same time, those customers have been growing at tremendous rates and it's particularly if you look at their businesses from a revenue perspective. You're talking about them running their networks hotter. I guess I'm trying to understand where you're getting that point of view. Is that something that's coming in anecdotally? Or is just simply an observation based on ordering transiting in new business? Anymore flavor you could add around the demand trends there would be great in the market share?
Ken Miller: I'll start with port count and then Rami can go on the last question. So from four comp perspective, as we've been saying, there is like the MX to PTX largely behind as Q4 was another quarter of roughly 80%, 20%. So 80% of the products ports sold in Q4 where PTX ports 20% MX products. I do expect that percentage to still get move slightly up from 80%, but again it's low to the high end at this point and that's it's not going to go to zero. So we're finally settled to 8,515 maybe 9,010 part of the delta at this point but were mostly there at this time.
Rami Rahim: And I think, George, the part of your question is really around. Are we seeing competitive displacement? Or is it really just consumption of capacity that we're selling into the areas of the network within the cloud base that is that has traditionally been very strong for us? And I can tell you just based on all the information we have the engagements what we have this is not a matter of competitive displacement. We are as you might imagine working very closely with our key hyperscale customers in their network buildout and particular in the routing domains and the wider year domain. And we are fulfilling their capacitor requirements and we see this and based on that engagement, but also based on the port growth that we are seeing and what we are selling. It's just a matter of the more normalized pricing compression that we're now seeing on a year-over-year basis, has not yet sort of outpace if there is by the it's not yet outpace by the increase in capacity. As that plays out if the pace accelerate so I think we benefit from that and we do have an opportunity to capture net new footprints opening routing areas where we don't yet have presence as well as especially internationally, as well as in the switching domain.
Operator: Our next question is from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. I'm sorry, James, maybe mute by accident. And we will go to the next question here from Ryan McGregor from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Q - : This is Ryan on behalf of Steve Milunovich, just a quick question for me. Going back to EMEA, the region continues to show strong growth. Could you guys talk about what's driving that and what might be working in that that maybe could translate back to APAC or the Americas?
Rami Rahim: Certainly, yes, so we are pleased with our momentum in the EMEA region growing 6% year-over-year. It's actually broad based so the strength is across enterprise and service providers cloud as well as cloud is less of a factor in the EMEA region. It's also we are seeing strength across all technologies areas routing and switching. I think it really comes down to strong sales execution in that region. In fact, our new sales leader, Marcus Jewell, for a global sales organization was running in the EMEA region until he was promoted to that role. And I do think that one thing that we have done very effectively in the EMEA region is to sale the broad strength of our solutions. So when I talk about our telco cloud transformation or Contrail Enterprise Multicloud to help in multicloud connectivity for the enterprise domain, EMEA has led the way and demonstrating what's possible by up selling into these solutions, and I think they have benefited from that. The key now, especially with some of these go to market changes that we have put in place is to replicate that model that has proven itself to be successful need in that region across the world.
Ryan McGregor: And then just one follow-up in terms of software revenue as a percent of total revenue, so it's been about 10% for two quarters in a row now. Last quarter when it was about 10 you guys guided down, saying it probably would maintain that level, but it's about 10 again, but you are guiding down again. So just curious what your thought process is around that?
Rami Rahim: Yes, so last quarter was approximately 10 this quarter actually crossed 10 for the first time. And based on the deals that we see and visibility we have, I do think it's going to modulate plus or minus a bit off of that category. I'm not expecting a material drop down to something 7 to 5 or anything that nature, but I do think 10% that we crossed in Q4 is not repeatable in the first half of next year. But directionally over the next several years, I'm quite confident that software as a percent for total revenue will only go up and exactly put a long-term model out there of greater than 15% by 2021. So, we are well on track to achieve that on a full year basis quarter getting fluctuate a bit quarter-to-quarter.
Ken Miller: And just some additional commentary on that, this is a matter of strategy. We have been really focused on increasing our software as a percentage of total product revenue in total revenue. We have now implemented a pricing model and a business model first to offer across all of our product lines that have been well received by our customers. We are introducing new software capabilities software products into the markets, especially our Contrail suite of products that has been very well received by our customers and we are seeing the momentum there. So, I do think that over time on a long-term basis, we are going to see software become much more meaningful. I think that’s good for our customers. I think that’s good for Juniper. So even if it fluctuates, I think thus far we are very pleased with the results that we've been able to achieve.
Jess Lubert: Operator, we have time for two more questions.
Operator: Our next question here is from James Fish from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
James Fish: Just wanted to touch base on the security side of things, good quarter there kind of going off to another question with the strong growth, and Rami you are saying that you don't think it's sustainable. I guess how should we think about the competitive nature for the high end firewall refresh especially as you've had a competitor now come out with a targeted service fiber firewall?
Rami Rahim: Look, the security market has always been extremely competitive and I think the recipe for us was to come-up with a technological advantage but and also a solution and the go-to-market advantage. From a technology standpoint one of things that I think we've always done better than anybody else is, the combination of richness of the features coupled with scale and performance and then we've seen that in the high-end firewall and I think that has work for us. Honestly one of the reasons why we saw some weakness in security prior to a year-ago was because it took us a little too long to do that high-end refresh. As soon as we determined that this was necessary we really started to spread up but as soon as we introduce that we have confidence that it would work for us we knew there would be differentiated and it's doing exactly that is working very effectively for us. Additionally, now as I mentioned earlier, we have integrated security into all of our solution offering so as we think about multi-cloud solutions that help our customers to manage distributed assets across private and public cloud. We've now worked security into that broad offering and it's become a real compelling reason for our customers and to purchase securities for us. So across the board I think we found the recipe and it is working well. Yes, I mean 18% double-digit growth on a sustained basis, I don't -- I do not think is a practical thing to assume. But I do think that continued momentum in the cards yet.
James Fish: And then just two quick housekeeping items, you guys kind of started breaking out Contrails and software in terms of growth, I guess, how big is Contrails now within the software business today? And then secondly, did you guys give a weight Q4 from the tariffs on in terms of lift on revenue, and if so can you quantify it?
Rami Rahim: Yes, so Contrail is relatively small. We're not going breakout the total dollars. I would say that the primary value that as we've been talking about for quite some time is not just the monetization of Contrail, but the actual discussion around the customers and architectures that were promoting with Contrail and the strategic nature of the sale. So, we're not going to breakout the numbers, but it is growing by itself, but it's actually alignment to win large opportunities in both service provider and enterprise and that's really a biggest impact to our numbers. On a tariff perspective, I will say from a gross margin perspective, it had about a 30 basis point impact to the Q4 gross margin. I've also factored a similar level into the Q1 gross margin. From a revenue perspective, again, it's difficult to quantify whether any pool ends because of potentially concerns of higher tariffs. I do not believe we have a material revenue change because of tariff. I think it was pretty much normal course and speed in Q4. At this point, I'm expecting similar in Q1. I'm not expecting anything impact of tariffs on the top line.
Operator: Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: This is [indiscernible] on for Samik. So just two questions, one was about the award win in Japan with broadband tower. Just curious on what drove the customer's decision to chose Juniper. And were there other competitors considered? And then I have a quick follow up after that.
Rami Rahim: Yes, so we are very pleased with that award. I think it's just one of many that we would see with net new logos in the quarter. I believe that was more of a routing opportunity but one that we are very proud of. Beyond that I think as we highlighted in the press release.
Unidentified Analyst: And then my second question is just on the recent agreement with IBM. I'm just curious that we should be thinking about any synergies there whether that would be cost the revenue from consolidating that outsourcing partner?
Rami Rahim: Yes.
Ken Miller: And the primary thing you should there you will see there is actually some efficiencies on cost side that source of large part of our IT organization to IBM. It should enable efficiencies due to their scale and automation that they built over years. So we are very excited about the opportunity to keep our service levels high for our customers and our IT service levels high but actually get a benefit on the cost side over the term of the IBM contract.
Rami Rahim: Thank you everyone for your questions. We look forward to speaking and meeting with you over the next couple of months.
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Juniper Networks Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jess Lubert. Thank you. You may begin.
Jess Lubert: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter 2018 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release and CFO Commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today, and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and Juniper undertakes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussions today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results is included in today's press release. Our Q3 results and forward-looking guidance are provided under ASC 606, which we adopted on January 1, 2018, on a modified retrospective basis. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. With that, I will now turn the call over to Rami. 
Rami Rahim: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. We reported better than expected results during the September quarter. Total revenues of 1.180 million was above the midpoint of our guidance, as continued strength in our enterprise business along with better than expected service provider sales more than offset weakness within the cloud. In addition, gross margin exceeded the high end of our guidance, while operating expenses came in towards the low end of our forecast, resulting in non-GAAP EPS of $0.54, $0.07 above the high end of our outlook. We're seeing encouraging development in many areas of our business, which are providing confidence in our long term growth prospects. Some of these developments include the following. Our enterprise business continues to see solid momentum, rising 15% year-over-year and growing year-over-year for the seventh consecutive quarter. Strength was experienced across all technologies and we benefited from a diverse base of customers. While our enterprise switching and security business both grew year-over-year, we also saw very strong demand for our enterprise routing portfolio, as new solutions such as the MX204 and the MX10003 are seeing solid success in areas of the market where we previously didn't play. We believe we have the right products and strategy to win in the enterprise markets and we are strengthening our go to market focus on this vertical, under our new Chief Customer Officer, Pierre-Paul Allard. Security was another bright spot in Q3, growing 8% year-over-year and rising for a fourth consecutive quarter. While our breadth of security deals was strong in the period, we were also encouraged to see an uptick in the number of transactions over $1 million. We experienced strong security booking during the September quarter and we remain optimistic, regarding the growth prospects for our security business. While our service provider revenue declined 6% year-over-year, the business grew 4% sequentially and performed better than we expected. We believe the upside relative to our expectations reflects the strengthening of our relationships with many of our top service provider customers who recognize the value of the innovations we're bringing to market. We believe our orchestration telemetry, node slicing cups and universal chassis capabilities are leading the industry and should position us to win with our service provider customers. We are also optimistic regarding the potential of our MX5G offerings, which we spec to begin shipping early next year. We believe customers are increasingly recognizing the value that Juniper is offering. We believe this was highlighted at our recent NXTWORK’s user conference, where customer and partner attendance more than doubled year-over-year. We’re excited about new and expanding partnerships with firms like Nutanix and Ericsson, which we expect to not only strengthen our ability to capitalize on multi-cloud and 5G initiatives, but also broaden our reach and drive competitive advantage versus alternative offerings. We're also in the early stages of ramping several important new innovations, such as Contrail Enterprise Multicloud and the SPC3 line cards for our high end SRX firewall, both of which began shipping in the third quarter. These platforms bring material differentiation to the market and are already seeing strong customer traction, which should prove accretive to growth in future quarters. Not to be overlooked, we're on the verge of introducing the industry's first 400-gig product and believe we will be well positioned to gain share, as cloud, service provider and enterprise customers look to meet surging bandwidth requirements. Our software business had another strong quarter, rising both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year and accounting for nearly 10% of our revenue. While this strength was due to several one-time license buys and we do not expect our software business to remain at this level over the next few quarters, we continue to introduce new software solutions to the market and are putting go to market strategies in place in order to drive higher software attach rates in future periods. While we remain optimistic regarding our long term prospects, we are also seeing some challenges in the market, particularly within the cloud vertical where we believe several of our customers are running their networks harder and the pace of deployments are proceeding more slowly than we previously anticipated. Based on our current forecast, we're not expecting a material improvement in cloud revenue during the December quarter, which is the primary reason the midpoint of our revenue forecast no longer embed a return to year-over-year growth in Q4. This weakness relative to our prior forecast is mostly due to our expectations regarding the impact of cloud driving sales and to a lesser extent cloud switching revenue. Although the timing and pace of cloud deployments remains difficult to predict, we maintain a high level of engagement with these important customers and remain confident we are not only holding our cloud footprint, but also positioning to benefit as incremental capacity requirements eventually drive improved demand. As we announced earlier in the quarter, Pierre-Paul Allard joined us as our new Chief Customer Officer. I'm excited to have him on my team and believe the changes we will make under Pierre-Paul’s leadership will help further drive improved sales execution.  In summary, while our business is lumpy and sometimes difficult to predict on a quarterly basis, we remain confident regarding our pipeline of opportunities and our ability to grow the business in 2019. Perhaps, more importantly, we are innovating in ways, which truly matter to our customers and should position the business to see improved long term success. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for all of our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ken who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail.
Ken Miller: Thank you, Rami and good afternoon, everyone. The results for the third quarter were better than expected with revenue of $1.180 million, above the midpoint of our guidance. Non-GAAP gross margin of 61.1% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.54 were both above our guidance range.  Our enterprise vertical posted its seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, increasing 15%, driven by strength across all technologies. The 4% sequential decline was consistent with normal seasonality and in line with our expectations. The service provider vertical declined 6% year-over-year, but increased 4% sequentially. The sequential growth was better than expected, primarily due to strength in EMEA. Cloud revenues declined 28% year-over-year and 11% sequentially. The declines reflect a slower than expected pace of deployments. As Rami mentioned, we remain confident in opposition with our strategic cloud customers, however, the pace of deployments is difficult to predict. During the quarter, routing saw 15% decline year-over-year, primarily due to cloud, partially offset by strength in Enterprise. Our switching business grew 4% year-over-year, primarily driven by the impact of the adoption of ASC 606. Security posted a fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, increasing 8% and the growth was driven by strength in all verticals. Our services business declined 1% year-over-year, due to the impact of the adoption of ASC 606. Without the impact of ASC 606, services would have increased approximately 6% year-over-year. In reviewing our top ten customers for the quarter, five were cloud, four were service provider and one was an Enterprise. Product deferred revenue declined in the third quarter, primarily due to the adoption of ASC 606. Without the impact of ASC 606, product deferred revenue would have increased 1% year-over-year. For the quarter, non-GAAP gross margin was 61.1%. The sequential improvement was primarily driven by favorable product mix, including the positive effect of higher software sales and geographic mix. Non-GAAP operating expenses were flat year-over-year and declined 1% sequentially. Cash flow from operations was $207 million for the quarter, an increase of 6 million year-over-year and $37 million quarter-over-quarter. The sequential increase was primarily due to lower tax payments. Our $750 million ASR, which was initiated in Q1 of this year concluded in the third quarter, resulting in the retirement of an additional 6 million shares in the third quarter. We also paid $62 million in dividends in the third quarter. Our total cash, cash equivalents and investment balance at the end of September quarter was $3.6 billion, a modest increase versus last quarter.  Before we move on to the question-and-answer part of the call, I would like to provide some color on our guidance, which you can find details in the CFO commentary available on our Investor Relations website. While we were expecting to return to year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter, the midpoint of our guidance reflects a year-over-year decline. This is due to the slower pace of expected deployments from cloud customers. In addition, while the recently implemented China tariffs are not expected to have a material direct impact on our Q4 ‘18 financial results, customer buying behavior could be affected and gross margin may be slightly impacted. While we expect to see gross margin benefit from volume in the fourth quarter, our guidance is down sequentially due to a more normalized product and geographic mix. We expect full year non-GAAP operating expenses to slightly decline on a year-over-year basis. It's also worth noting that the higher interest rates, other income and expense is likely to be lower going forward, in line with our Q3 ’18 results. While we expect our Q4 ’18 non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 18%, we believe our go forward non-GAAP tax rate will be approximately 19% to 20%. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper’s success. Now, I'd like to open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jeff Kvaal from Nomura Instinet.
Jeff Kvaal: Yes. Thank you very much, gentlemen and two questions for me. I guess number one, could we start on your visibility on the cloud. What can you tell us about the projects and what have you in the past? You've been able to look a little bit further out there one quarter. Perhaps, you can help us understand where the PTX migration is. And when we might be able to expect an uptick? And then secondly, if you could give us a little bit of visibility into the 400-gig cycle and what -- how you expect that to play out for you through 2019? Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Thank you, Jeff. This is Rami. I'll start with your questions. And the first one on the cloud, clearly, the timing of project build outs have been difficult to predict. I just point out that it really is tied to a very few number of cloud providers, so you only have to get it wrong for a couple of customers to get it wrong all up. Having said all that, I still maintain that we have all of the ingredients in line to get this part of our business back to growth, from a technology standpoint, talent standpoint, the engagement at the engineer level within our organization that's all working very well. So I do think 2019 all up will be a growth year for us in the cloud based on the visibility that we have, the timing of deployments. To your question around the product set, all or most of the big product projects that we are or projects that we're working on right now that should see deployment in the coming quarters are PTX based. So I don't think that there is any difference based on what we've articulated in the past from a product standpoint. And tied to that is 400-gig. So very importantly, if you look at our cloud provider strategy all up, one element of the strategy is to ensure that we're doing everything that's necessary to maintain our footprint where we already have incumbency and of course that's a large footprint that exists among the major cloud providers.  And to return that part of the business to growth as the capacity requirements dictates or requires more networking capacity throughout their networks. But beyond that, there is a deliberate strategy to move into new footprint, especially closer to and into the data center with our switching portfolio. And honestly based on everything that we are working on from a software standpoint, from a silicon technology standpoint as well as the 400-gig roadmap, we have a lot of confidence that we can in fact expand our footprint. The last point I'll make around the cloud provider space, because I know it is top of mind for many of you is just that, we look closely at the health of the market from the standpoint of the health of our customers’ businesses, right, the businesses of our cloud providers is thriving and we don't anticipate any major slowdown from that front and that should only maintain the requirement for them to invest in their network, so I remain optimistic about this part of our business in the future.
Jeff Kvaal: It's a little difficult for us to square the growth in those businesses with your down cloud revenues, Rami and I think that's what has us scratching our heads a little.
Rami Rahim: I totally understand that, but it's actually not that confusing when you think about it, because the major element of the revenue shortfall is the product transition. We’re moving from a product that has a certain price per port to a different product that has a lower and substantially we’ve been open with you about this, they’re substantially lower price per port. We did this deliberately to avoid a scenario where we find that we will lose footprint, if we don't. So we are, in effect, disrupting ourselves to make it much more difficult for anybody else to come in and to disrupt us. So while, yes, it will be painful and dilutive to revenue in the short term, I think it's exactly the thing that we must do today to preserve that footprint and to get back to growth in the coming quarters. So I think that's the biggest element of the downturn in revenue that you're seeing today.
Ken Miller: And the only thing I would add, this is Ken, is that our actual port count has grown here to date FY18 as compared to this point last year. So we are seeing growth and volume growth in port count and we're also seeing stabilization in pricing per port. So, as we continue to see growth, we will start to see revenue come back to growth as well as our expectation.
Operator: Our next question is from Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank.
Vijay Bhagavath: Two questions if I may quickly, Rami and Ken. The first is the delays in the cloud customers. How did that get you caught by surprise, because the delays or the slowdowns were generally known? And then the second part of the question is, the 5G cycle is starting to crank up here with Verizon in particular, when would you see kind of any order uptake in the routing business, as 5G broadband starts getting commercially deployed? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Thank you, Vijay. Again, I want to sort of emphasize the fact that the timing of projects within the major cloud providers is really tied to a very few number of customers. And so if you get it wrong for just those customers, then obviously that puts challenges all up. Now, the guidance that we provided for Q4 is not that different than what it had was originally, so I don't think that there is a massive change in our outlook, relative to where we were just a quarter ago. And again, I want to emphasize the fact that I think we're doing everything necessary across the board to ensure that we are there to take advantage of the build outs when they occur and I do believe that they will occur based on our very tight engagement and conversations that we're having with our cloud customers. Second is your question about 5G. I'm very excited about the opportunity that 5G presents. I think the only question mark around 5G is really around the timing of those opportunities. Yes. I think you're starting to see some news and some very early deployments for 5G and in particular in the rand space, but we're gearing up across the board with our technology, so the MX5G capabilities that come in to the market in the Q1 timeframe with a feature set, it's really honed towards 5G option.  Our partnerships with companies like Ericsson that I think helps us in relevance in penetration, in accounts where our customers are clearly thinking about their 5G roadmaps and then last but not least is the fact that most of the 5G deployments are really going to be cloud native in nature and we're seeing a really solid win rate right now in our telco cloud solution that includes Contrail as an SDN controller as well as the underlying switching, routing and security infrastructure to support that telco cloud architecture and this is being done -- basically rolled out by our customers in anticipation of 5G.  So we're not waiting until 5G becomes a big spend cycle before we start to take advantage of the opportunities that are out there.
Operator: Our next question is from Simon Leopold from Raymond James.
Victor Chiu: This is Victor Chiu in for Simon Leopold. I know you said that the tariffs weren't expected to be -- to have too much of a material impact in the fourth quarter, but can you tell us -- can you help us understand what’s the expected effect of the tariffs, assuming the step up to 25% in January.
Ken Miller: Sure. So, this is Ken. So, clearly, we're watching it closely and we're not -- our position is not unique here. All of us are watching intently. Our strategy is to mitigate the impact of tariffs as much as we can. We have a global footprint. We do manufacture in multiple places, including China. There will be an impact. We were not able to mitigate and our current strategy is to pass an impact along to our customers and partners in the form of an import tax charge. Presuming we're successful in doing that would be largely profit neutral gross margin, sorry gross profit neutral, but it does have the potential to have a negative impact to gross margin as we move forward. Clearly, as we move to 25% or the potential to go to 25% would have a much more significant impact than the current tariffs. We're watching closely and we'll look to mitigate as we can going forward.
Victor Chiu: Do you have a sense of how successful you may be in passing those or having customers absorb the increases?
Ken Miller: Yeah. It's early days right now, but at this point, we feel pretty good about our position with the Q4 tariff in place and our ability to not only mitigate, but also pass along a relatively small increase to our customers.
Victor Chiu: And given that this is an impact that’s kind of across the board, are there competitive implications here for Juniper or.
Ken Miller: We're watching the industry close. Clearly, in our case, it is important to note that all products are impacted, right. We do have many products that are not impacted. So mix is going to also matter as a result – as the impact of the tariff to the P&L, looking to optimize our footprint to put more in the non-tariff locations is something we're looking at very closely as well and we will continue to remain competitive in the marketplace.
Operator: Our next question is from Paul Silverstein from Cowen & Company.
Paul Silverstein: A couple of clarifications and a question. And the clarification is, Ken, I think I heard you say pretty clearly that pricing normalized on a year-over-year basis, on a like-for-like per port basis. I just want to confirm that. I recognize you had a big reset with the cloud situation, but is pricing now is ready to kind of normalize? And --
Ken Miller: Yes. I'll just jump in. Yes. That is correct.
Paul Silverstein: And I assume, you're trying to exposure to just both direct and indirect with the indirect piece being by virtue of suppliers that it is just contract manufacturers or purchase components and their self-assemblies and I assume before we’re going through that quantification, I'm hoping you give us some sense for what both the direct and the indirect exposure is and then the real question, from a competitive landscape standpoint, with the understand that revenues are backward looking, so I'm asking I'm looking out into the future, are you seeing any impact at this point from Cisco or Nokia, which both have introduced new platforms relatively recently, Arista, which has come in to the market as well with their own routing stacks, are you seeing them impact either your win rate in terms of new projects that haven't shown up in revenue yet and/or pricing.
Rami Rahim: Let me take the competitive question. I -- honestly I haven't been this confident and optimistic about our technology roadmap ever at Juniper. If I look across the board from our switching portfolio, our routing portfolio and our security portfolio, I look at the underlying technology elements from a silicon development standpoint, our silicon photonics efforts, our operating system developments that we are making on, on an ongoing basis. And then the systems that we're introducing into the market just over the next year that are going to be 400-gig capable that are going to have operating system capabilities that are absolutely aligned with the direction of the market, I think we are going to be extremely competitive and I think we're also adding to that new layers of innovation in particular around the enterprise where our Contrail Enterprise Multicloud solution is really resonating with many of our enterprise customers that are looking to move to Multicloud solutions that I think is giving us a real leg up right now in the marketplace. So if anything, my expectation is that as we continue to introduce these systems, the software capabilities, our win rate will only increase going into next year.
Paul Silverstein: Rami, do you think you can convert, there's obviously been secular issues on top of the competitive landscape in these service provider routing markets, do you think that can return to growth, are you going to have the benefit of using comps that are getting into, again, I understand there are secular challenges, but is it your internal expectation that that will return to growth or at least stabilize.
Rami Rahim: So, in our November Analyst Day, we'll provide you with a longer term outlook for our business across each of our key market verticals. In the SP space, what I'll tell you for now is we're not going to model into our outlook a return to growth next year. We're going to be prudent and careful in our expectation for this SP-based, primarily because of the secular issues that you're talking about.  Having said that, there are a number of opportunities that are out there, that we are out to capture. These are net new footprint type opportunity for us in the demand of telco cloud in preparation for 5G deployments. In the cable space, remote fi type architectural solutions, metro build outs in anticipation of increased capacity requirements for 5G deployments, all of these are examples of net new opportunities that we're going after. The last one I will mention that we're actually already seeing really meaningful progress in is in our smaller form factor MX solutions that 204 and the 10003 that are already bringing us into footprints and new tier 2 type service providers that we never had a shot at in the past. So, there's a lot from a opportunity standpoint that I'm optimistic about, but I'm -- I also just want to be cautious because of the all up secular issues in our outlook for next year.
Ken Miller: Yeah. And on the tariff front, I'm not going to break out the direct versus indirect. I will tell you that the majority of our exposure is on the direct side. Just to give you some numbers, I mean, for the balance of this year, we expect the import tax charge to be 3.5% of the net invoice for those impacted skews. So again not all skews are impacted, but for those impacted skews selling into the US from China, there will be an uplift on invoice of 3.5%. At that level, it should have a negative impact to gross margin of about 20 to 30 basis points, but it should be relatively profit neutral and clearly the exposure would go up, if the tariff did increase next year.
Operator: Our next question is from Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer.
Ittai Kidron: Let's talk about some of the things that work like enterprise and security. Maybe you could talk about, Rami, about the pipeline activity. I guess the one thing that people will be concerned about that is finally the time when cloud recovers, those things start slowing down. So help me think about the business momentum that you have there, how does the pipeline look like and how do you separate just the general strong spending environment from your performance, how do you tell how much of it is just all lifted versus you're delivering something that others do not.
Rami Rahim: So I'm honestly very pleased with our performance in the enterprise space all up and in security. There is definitely a robust spending environment in the enterprise globally that we're taking advantage of, but we're now seeing seven consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth in the enterprise, the last quarter in Q3, 15% year-over-year. So I think that this is a emotion that's really working for us, a focus area that I'm quite optimistic about. To double click on it, we're seeing strength in customers that truly value and view their networks as mission critical to their businesses. So in the federal space, financial services, large banks, the momentum there is very strong. We're delivering solutions that are very meaningful for the direction of travel of many of the CIOs within those customers. Everybody today is thinking about how to move a Multicloud architecture. Few have the tools and the capabilities to do it. So in our view, this is an unsolved problem that is ripe for us to jump in and to help them solve it and our enterprise Multicloud solutions are doing just that. We have gotten third party validation from analyst firms like Gartner and Forrester recently about our data center networking technology and software defined networking capabilities that our enterprise customers pay very close attention to. And then of course, there is the sales motion. There is some solid sales execution that is happening in the enterprise due to a focus on going after net new logos and I expect that to only improve with the sales leadership changes that we have made in the company, primarily with the welcoming of Pierre-Paul to the company. So when I – and may be the last point on the enterprise, the enterprise routing, it's not just about switching and security, enterprise routing with our newer products or newer innovations like the 204 to 10003 are really working for us and enabling us to capture new footprint that we have not done in the past. So I expect that momentum to continue because bookings are solid, the engagement level is great and the execution all up I believe will only improve from here. Now going into security, in the security space, we had mentioned in last quarter that we had refreshed practically our entire product line with the exception of the high end, which was due for a refresh and that refresh happened in the Q3 timeframe with the third generation of our SBC line card for our high end firewall and as expected, the uptake and the pipeline built immediately again in a number of different customer verticals, in particular, in the banking sector, where that kind of security performance is just mandatory and honestly, they can't get from anybody else out there. And so we benefited from that in Q3, not just from a revenue standpoint, but from a booking standpoint, which will help us in future quarters. So both from an enterprise and security standpoint, I'm quite optimistic looking forward.
Ken Miller: Yeah. The only thing I would add is just the breadth of the string. So for security, it was -- all verticals were up, both service provider cloud and enterprise. For enterprise, all technologies were up, routing, switching and security, so that breadth is very encouraging. I would also add that for both enterprise and security, our number of million dollar customers were up in the quarter. So we’re seeing it kind of a broad based growth across the board for those two parts of our business.
Operator: Our next question is form Tal Liani from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Tal Liani: Hi. I'm trying to go back to the cloud question, and I'm trying to understand two things. First going into this quarter, we started hearing that few big cloud vendors, hyperscalers are reducing spending, because they started the year very, very strong with spending, and it's concentrated, but if you aggregate the numbers are so big, if you aggregate, you still see a decline in second half versus first half. So that's one driver, which is weak spending possibly. The second driver is that you've been working on architectural changes at some of your biggest customers, and the PTX was entering this quarter, the migration was 80% done, you said it in the past. And also at the switching level, the migration was happening, and I'm trying to understand what's the source for the weakness in cloud, is it because there is no spending and there is pressure on spending by cloud vendors, or is it because some of the components of your technology changes, some of this is not working according to the timetable that we expected or so is it technology or is it spending? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Thanks for the question, Tal. So I'll answer it in reverse order. I don't think it's a technology issue. The PTX, the product that we build, the technology, the feature capabilities were all developed exactly to capture the future cloud opportunity and our view has not changed at all in terms of the strength of that platform for those use case and those deployments. From a spending standpoint, I mean, we look at the same CapEx reports for the cloud providers that you do and obviously these are all encompassing CapEx reports that capture all of their investments across many different technology areas. And yes, there could be shifts and priorities for some of the largest cloud providers in terms of where they're going to be focusing their investment in different layers of the network or between different areas of IT that can impact the timing of deployments, and I suspect that is a function of what we're seeing out in the market. This is why, I don't just look at the CapEx reports, I also look at just the overall health of their own businesses, and I mean they're going to report soon. I don't expect any major slowdown. I expect that they are going to see robust business growth for them, and that is going to translate into a need to continue to invest into their networking infrastructure. We obviously can't predict the timing of build outs perfectly. Sometimes, they themselves can't predict their own timing, which makes it especially challenging for us. But what we can do is control everything that we can control in order to ensure that we capture the uptick in spending when it actually happen and there is the technology element to that, the talent element to that and the engagement element to that, that I've already talked to.
Tal Liani: If I measure your performance in terms of units, ports and I apologize, I missed the first two questions. So maybe you answered this, but if I measure your performance with cloud in different ways, not in dollars, but rather ports, units, any other way. Will you have the same answer and I'm asking the question just because there is a pricing difference between PTX and MX and per ports. I'm trying to understand if what we're seeing is more of a pricing transition or what we're seeing is really overall kind of big picture spending pressure?
Rami Rahim: I would say that the port or the number of ports or this volume of capacity that we have shipped into the cloud vertical this year has already far exceeded what it was year-to-date last year. So, I mean and port spending and consumption will fluctuate on a quarter-over-quarter basis, so it's actually more instructive to look at this on a yearly basis, but what we're seeing is, it's much more a function of price per port at least as it pertains to Juniper and our own projects, then it is volume of ports that we're actually shipping to the cloud providers. And again this since it's actually a good question that you're asking here. At the November analyst day conference, I think we can provide you with some more data that would give you the, what you're looking for in terms of actual port and capacity introduction into their networks.
Operator: Our next question is from Tejas Venkatesh from UBS.
Tejas Venkatesh: Thank you. I’m on for John Roy. Following on from the previous question, I was wondering how 100-gig pricing for routing was in the quarter. You had indicated stability in the prior quarter. Is that still the case?
Rami Rahim: Yeah. Our pricing has been very consistent from a like to like perspective, whether it be 100-gig to 100-gig or PTX to PTX. So we are seeing that normalize within the cloud routing as well as the SP routing. In fact, from a cloud all up routing perspective, we saw the ASP go up per port because we didn't see as much PTX mix as we expected to see as we enter the quarter, but on a like-for-like, it was very, very stable.
Tejas Venkatesh: Thank you. And a long-term question as a follow-up, you've made a number of announcements around network automation and Contrail in recent months. Is there a way of thinking about how much incremental TAM this brings to Juniper and perhaps the industry?
Rami Rahim: Yeah, it's a good question. In some sense, it does introduce new TAM because there is in fact a certain amount of spend that goes into automation and orchestration across a number of different use cases, whether it be in telco cloud or in multi-cloud for the enterprises and so on. It's a TAM that’s measured in billions, it's something that we can’t provide you with some more specifics around. It's not a small TAM, but that's only part of the strategy. Capturing that software investment as net new revenue for Juniper is something that we, of course, intend to do, but what we're also seeing, which is equally important to us is the fact that the software, the automation capabilities that we're introducing into the market are giving us an ability to sell holistic solutions. So for a Tier 1 telecom operator in Europe, we are essentially providing a complete stack from the server compute storage up through orchestration and VNF, the Virtual Network Functions, all up as a solution. There is the software and the hardware element to that sale. Increasingly in the enterprise space, as we're selling Contrail, whether it's immediate or eventually over time, Contrail Enterprise Multicloud becomes a strategic control point that allows us to sell additional infrastructure like switching and like security and like routing in time and we're already seeing that play out. Contrail Enterprise Multicloud has only been shipping now for a few weeks. We already have our first few wins that validate that solution sales thesis that I just described and this is why we are so optimistic about these capabilities that we're introducing to the market.
Operator: Our next question is from Sami Badri from Credit Suisse.
Sami Badri: Hi, thank you for the question. I wanted to touch on the cloud deals very quickly and regarding them getting pushed out. I wanted to get more color on what type of cloud deals these actually are and more specifically, are these the very major 100 megawatt datacenter facilities that our cloud providers building or are they more Metro dense sites that aggregate significant traffic on the routing level. I just want to get an understanding on where exactly in the cloud supply chain this stall and deployments is occurring?
Rami Rahim: It's most -- the way I would characterize it is, it is the pace at which deployments are happening. And this is -- this touches the footprint that we have already deployed across the cloud space, which is in the wide area. So, data center interconnect backbone, it's -- these are real routing footprints that carry large volumes of traffic between data centers and connect the data centers to peering points that varies from cloud provider to cloud provider, but generally speaking, we're talking about wide area connectivity.
Sami Badri: And then those are predominantly PTX deployments not MX or historically MX was used, but now moving forward, using mainly PTX?
Rami Rahim: That is the nature of the transition. Yes. So historically, they've primarily been MX-based and going forward, they will mostly be PTX based. There will still be even within the cloud vertical, some use cases that rely on the programmability, the sophisticated feature set of the MX, but most of the major projects and certainly the projects that we're monitoring closely in terms of pace of deployments is -- are all around PTX.
Sami Badri: And the second question I had was more of a big picture regarding 5G, based on your conversations with customers or the expectations of demand for 5G deployments, which products do you see customers deploying first from your suite of systems? And are there products that may they may potentially move away from, given the type of infrastructure they're looking to scale up as 5G ramps?
Rami Rahim: Yeah. It's another good question. It really depends a lot on use case and we view it as follows. There is a very big telco cloud solution that involves our switching technology as well as Contrail Enterprise Multicloud and our own network functions like security network functions as well as third-party network functions that all stitched together in preparation for 5G. In the backbone, it's a combination of MX and PTX. In the Metro, it's mostly MX and ACX. And so the product that will depend very much on the particular use case that you are talking about. I will also just mention here that we're working very closely with our partners to capture the 5G opportunity. Ericsson being a partnership that is long standing, but certainly one that we've only increased the strategic nature of recently and there are a number of solutions, yet to be announced externally that we're working on in concert with Ericsson to I think give us both an additional sort of means of competing in the 5G opportunity. So just stay tuned for that.
Operator: Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan.
Samik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to start off with digging into the gross margin performance in the quarter a bit. You saw strong improvements in the gross margin on both products and services sequentially, even when like product revenues were sequentially lower. So just wanted to understand if there were any cost actions that you started off in 3Q itself outside of normal seasonality, what the other things that help gross margin here. And I think if I can ask more kind of 4Q and then beyond are there cost actions on the core business that you can take to improve gross margins?
Rami Rahim: Yes. So we're very pleased with our gross margin results in Q3 being above the range that we set in the beginning of the quarter. Clearly, we continue to undertake specific efforts to improve our gross margin, including innovation and design for value efforts as well as cost optimization within supply chain and customer service. Customer service, actually, the majority of the increase that they saw was not only a better volume from a sequential basis, but also good cost controls on the service delivery costs. So, that was really more of a cost controls perspective on the services gross margin uplift. On the product side, really the biggest driver was product mix as well as a little bit of geographic mix, but within product mix, we did see sequential growth in service provider and in routing all up and that's our highest margin product and within routing, even seen more mix of MX as compared to PTX was also a bit of a tailwind for our overall margin. So, those kind of product mix phenomenons that we saw in Q3, I do not expect to have similar mix in Q4. So when I guided Q4 at 60%, very much in line with our expectation and very much in line with our expectation that it would grow sequentially throughout the year. It is still down sequentially due to those mix impacts, not necessarily being as favorable in Q4 as we saw in Q3.
Samik Chatterjee: And if I can just follow up with one on the tariff impact. You mentioned that once you kind of take pricing, you might see some customer buying behavior changes. When you look at Europe customer segments, enterprises, service providers, customers, where do you see the most sensitivity to kind of pricing actions, if you take any pricing, where do you think you'll see kind of the most impact when it comes to buying behavior?
Rami Rahim: Yeah, I mean, difficult to predict at this point. At this point, I don't expect a material change in behavior. But it is a risk worth calling out. I think many customers are evaluating their own strategies within the tariffs and what is going to be monitoring and at this point, I don't expect it to be to impact our guide. However, it's just in a new risk I wanted to call out on the call.
Operator: Our next question is form Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs.
Unidentified Analyst: This is [indiscernible] on behalf of Rod. I have two questions. The first one I really wanted to just check in on the EMEA strength that you've been posting. Clearly, your EMEA business throughout 2018 has been better than at least the last couple of years. Wondering what's driving that strength, is it market share gains, is it service providers or enterprise traction, if you could quantify, that would be very helpful.
Rami Rahim: I'd be happy to. So very proud of the EMEA team for delivery and consistently throughout the year across the board really. So the strength is pretty broad-based across all technologies, routing, switching and security as well as in the service provider and we had pretty substantial momentum in the enterprise space as well. I think that the EMEA team under relatively new sales leadership has been executing well. I think that the solutions that we have developed, both for the telcos, in particular, what we have real strength in tier 1 telcos have resonated with many of our customers there that are looking for partners in making this cloud transition. And then in the enterprise space, I think there, our cloud delivered enterprise strategy where we're delivering value through a cloud delivered motion like SD-WAN being an example of that is resonating well with our customers over there as well. And from a momentum standpoint, I'm pretty optimistic that it can continue.
Unidentified Analyst: And just a quick one on switching as well. I think the performance in that business for the last three quarters or call it four quarters has been a little bit disappointing relative to consensus expectations. And if you look at the numbers that the street is modeling, the expectation for 2019 is a mid-single digit growth, while I recognize you won't be commenting on how much growth you expect, maybe would you care to elaborate on what would need to work for you for you to be able to get to that sort of growth or perform better than that.
Rami Rahim: Yeah. So let me say, I am disappointed in our performance in switching for Q3. I think that we can and we'll do better. And let me just double click on the switching business a bit for you to explain where the weakness was, but also where there is a strength and momentum that might not be evident by looking at the, the All Up number. First, there is an element of our switching business that is very much tied to the cloud architectural transitions in our large hyper scalers that has had an impact and continues to have an impact as we work through the timing of new deployments within the large hyper scale data centers or large hyper scale opportunities that are out there. Second, we had some specific weakness in Asia Pacific in switching mostly as a result of sort of difficult compares and timing of opportunities. But if I put those two factors aside, what I like about our switching business is first momentum in the enterprise, both in the data center and also in the campus and we've introduced new capabilities, new products like multi-rate capabilities in our switching portfolio that is gaining some real potential, real momentum and building pipeline for the enterprise in particular. Second, we're seeing solid telco growth with our switching portfolio, primarily driven by telco data center and telco cloud build outs that I've already talked about. Third 100-gig adoption in our switching portfolio is working quite well for us. So the pace of 100-gig growth or 100-gig capable product is actually growing far faster than the overall switching number is growing. And then last but not least, a big part of the very healthy all up software business that we posted for Q3 is a result of selling software capabilities, along with our switching portfolio. So I think these underlying elements of the business give me confidence that once we address the hyper scale architectural transition and of course we continue the momentum we're seeing in the rest of the switching business, we can get this business to growth next year.
Ken Miller: Yeah. And we will update our long-term model at the upcoming Investor Day on November 9 and we're not going to get into specifics of 2019 right now, but I will say overall, we expect revenues to be up in 2018. As Rami mentioned, the architectural shift in the cloud should largely be behind us and we expect the cloud vertical to be a growth year in 2019. And we see continued strength in enterprise. We believe those factors have more than offset potential weakness in the service provider space. In addition to the top line growth, we are expecting profits and operating margins to expand in FY19 as well, but again, more details to come in our upcoming Investor Day.
Operator: And our next question is from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo.
Aaron Rakers: Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions. I just want to go back on the MX and PTX router transition and maybe take a little bit differently in your service provider vertical. Can you just remind us again of what keeps that vertical from seeing a similar transition from MX to PTX longer term and how would you characterize the competitive landscape as you move towards the new Penta Silicon relative to what would be probably new platforms based on Jericho2, as we start to look into 2019 and I have a quick follow-up.
Rami Rahim: Certainly. So it's having understanding of how the ratio of MX to PTX looks like between the different verticals, really comes down to understanding the use cases. In the cloud space, in particular in the hyper-scale cloud, most of the use cases are about high-performance connectivity. The value is primarily delivered from the data center, right, software that's running in the datacenter. And so what the cloud providers value our cost optimization, programmability, telemetry capabilities, the ability to host their own applications on the systems for certain elements of control that they really need in their networks, whether that be in the data center or in the wide area and all of these factors point towards the PTX. And that's why the transition has happened so rapidly. In the telco space, as I've mentioned, the ratio of MX to PTX has largely been unchanged. I do expect that the PTX will pick up more dedicated, very optimized core use cases in time, but it will be a slow and sort of moderate transition. The main reason is that in the telco space, many of the services that are being offered by telecom operators have embedded in the networks themselves and have a degree of requirement sophistication, the only products like the MX can in fact offer. And you've mentioned the roadmap with the Penta Silicon. What we do is, even if our customers start to think about what it is that they need to deploy in order to satisfy their use cases, we're always innovating with new generations in the MX that are improving the capacity, the performance and improving the cost efficiency of that platform substantially that makes it so that, it's just not worth in many use cases to look at alternative platform. That Penta silicon gives us a 300% improvement in performance at half of the power consumption with all of the programmability capabilities that our customers love, built in encryption and a whole host of other capabilities that just our customers truly love. The last question, I think, since you've mentioned Jericho, the MX is really in a class of its own when it comes to the inherent programmability and flexibility of that platform. The Jericho platform, Jericho based platforms are more competitive with PTX type systems out there and that's the comparison that I would make, the MX really from a silicon and the software standpoint is not one that one could easily, in any way build using merchant silicon at least for the time being.
Operator: Our final question is from Jamie Fish from Piper Jaffray.
Jamie Fish: Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Actually, most of my questions have been answered and I won't ask the 10th question on the cloud vertical for you. I guess just on the software side, I assume you're going to give more color around what you guys expect that to get longer term. But what were the one-time items this quarter again on the 10% and why should we now expect that 10% level to sort of be maintained, as we move forward as your attach rates of software seem to be doing fairly well.
Rami Rahim: Yeah. Thanks for the question, James. So the components of software are broken out as follows. There is the newer software capabilities that we would describe as off-box. Our orchestration, our management software currently are -- obviously our enterprise Multicloud solutions, our off box software capabilities that would fit into that bucket and that is a small, but growing element of the overall software business. What is a more meaningful component is our Junos capabilities, our network operating system capabilities, where we have been executing on a very deliberate strategy over the last several years to disaggregate our operating system capabilities and give our customers choice of how much flexibility they want to buy and that's really working for us because it allows us to be very competitive with the appropriate pricing for less sophisticated use cases, but then to monetize the solution better as they go into more sophisticated use cases where the full breadth of routing and MPLS capabilities are required. I would say that that is a big part of the performance that we saw in the Q3 timeframe. There is a third leg of the software store, which is really around the solutions that are going to be offered to the enterprise like SD-WAN and so on. There is still a very small element today, but I expect, based on the momentum we're seeing in the market, I mean you saw just recently our Vodafone SD-WAN announcement that this element will grow in time.  The reason why I wouldn't expect 10% on an ongoing basis is simply lumpiness, I mean, customers are going to buy the capabilities and the upgrades to existing deployed infrastructure based on the requirements and where I don't think it's reasonable to assume that every quarter going forward will be this level. However, I do think that this part of the business is working and over a longer term period, I do expect it to grow.
Ken Miller: Yeah. And just to add to that, the on-box advanced Junos kind of features and functions are what we saw an uptick in, in Q3. While we have many different software models, the majority of our software today, particularly the on-box software is in perpetual model. So when those orders come in, which we saw a fair amount of those in Q3, they show up as a bit of a lumpy transition. As we move forward, we're working on different business models that would make that revenue more ratable, but at this point, some of that perpetual revenue was hitting Q3 and I don't expect that to be similar in the next couple of quarters.
Jess Lubert: So that's all the time we have today. Thank you all for your questions and we look forward to hopefully seeing you at our November 9 Analyst Day in New York.
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Juniper Networks Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jess Lubert, VP of Investor Relations.
Jess Lubert - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to our second quarter 2018 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results might differ materially. These risks are discussed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release and CFO Commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today, and in our other SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and Juniper undertakes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements. Our discussions today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results is included in today's press release. Our 2Q 2018 results and forward-looking guidance are provided under ASC 606, which we adopted on January 1, 2018, on a modified retrospective basis. Following our prepared remarks, we will take questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. We reported better-than-expected results during the June quarter. Total revenue of $1,204 million was at the high end of our guidance, as strong results in our Enterprise business complemented seasonal sequential improvements in our Cloud and Service Provider verticals. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.48 exceeded the high end of our guidance due to higher revenue, gross margin improvement and continued cost discipline. While our Q2 results were better than guidance, I'd like to provide some insight into our Q3 forecast, which is being impacted by the following factors. First, we experienced a strong close to the June quarter, and some of the Enterprise business we expected to close in Q3 happened a bit sooner than we previously anticipated. Second, the timing of certain Cloud and Service Provider orders we had expected in Q3 are taking a bit longer to materialize, although some are likely to contribute later this year. We remain confident that we are holding or expanding our footprint, and in many cases, gaining mindshare at our most important customers. My confidence is based on the rich conversations we're having with these customers, as well as strong pipeline for the December quarter. These factors are not only leading us to believe that our soft Q3 forecast is mostly a function of timing, but that we remain on track to see a return to year-over-year growth during the December quarter. I'm confident that we have the right products and strategy to win across our core verticals, and we are continuing to innovate with a goal of disrupting our markets and gaining share. In this regard, we expect to bring a number of new innovations to market over the next few quarters, including the industry's first 400-gig optimized routing platform, new programmable high-performance MX systems and line cards, an upgrade to our SRX High-End Firewall offering and an industry-leading, multi-cloud orchestration and telemetry platform, each of which, we believe, will help strengthen our position across our core markets. Now for a few highlights of the quarter. Our Enterprise business experienced strong momentum during the June quarter, growing 9% year-over-year, marking the 6th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Strength was broad-based across geographies, verticals and technologies. While we expect some seasonality during Q3, we believe our Enterprise momentum remained strong due to execution and a compelling portfolio of Enterprise offerings. We saw a modest sequential improvement in the Cloud vertical, where several of our largest customers are transitioning from our MX to our PTX platforms. While this process is creating year-over-year ASC pressure in our cloud routing business that is likely to persist over the next few quarters, we believe we are making progress through this transition, despite some lumpiness in the business. As evidence of our progress, I would like to highlight that our cloud routing business experienced a second consecutive quarter of sequential growth during the June quarter. Our PTX products accounted for approximately 80% of cloud routing ports we shipped on a 10-gig equivalent basis during Q2, compared to roughly 60% a year ago. Our cloud routing ASPs continue to see signs of stabilization on a sequential basis, a trend we think is likely to continue through the rest of the year. Based on the feedback from our customer engagements, we remain confident that we are holding our cloud routing footprint and positioning the business to capitalize on this customer set's rising network requirements. Our Service Provider business experienced normal seasonal trends during the June period. While we expect our Service Provider sales to decline sequentially during the September quarter, we do see the potential for some improvement during the December period, due to the expected timing of deployment. We are continuing to innovate in this vertical and differentiate our solutions relative to those of our peers. We believe these efforts are resonating in the market and should position Juniper to gain share as service providers move forward with Metro initiatives and 5G build-outs, which could present tailwinds for our business over the next few years. Now I would like to summarize our performance across Routing, Switching and Security. In Routing, our business increased sequentially, but declined year-over-year. While the architectural transition within the cloud continued to present year-over-year headwinds, we experienced healthy quarter-over-quarter growth during the June period due to strong uptake of several new products and a seasonal recovery in our Service Provider business, which bounced back following a soft Q1. Though cloud customers are transitioning to our PTX platform, we're not seeing this dynamic in our Service Provider vertical, due to the need for service creation capabilities the MX provides. In Switching, our business increased quarter-over-quarter, but declined year-over-year. While our concentrated hyperscale switching business declined year-over-year on a difficult comparison due to the same scale out architectural transition impacting Routing, excluding this business, we saw high single-digit growth, including double-digit growth in QFX. Based on our pipeline and customer feedback, we remain optimistic regarding the outlook for our QFX and EX product lines, which we believe remain well-positioned to compete across industry verticals, including Cloud and hyperscale accounts. The strength of our Switching portfolio was recently validated by being named a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Data Center Networking. In Security, our business grew 16% year-over-year, representing a third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. We believe more customers are recognizing the value of leveraging the entire network for detection enforcement against cyber threats. We believe our portfolio remains very competitive and remain optimistic that our Security business will see year-over-year growth for the full year, 2018. We are making progress with our efforts to capture more software revenue, which grew 28% year-over-year. We're seeing momentum with Contrail and had several new customer wins in the quarter, including three global Tier 1 carriers and a Fortune 500 Enterprise account. We believe we are executing on an extremely compelling product roadmap for Contrail, and we expect our Enterprise Multicloud capability will begin shipping this quarter. Additionally, AppFormix continues to gain traction with new wins in the Service Provider and Enterprise verticals. While the impact of ASC 606 caused our Services revenue to decline year-over-year, we saw strong renewal and a tax rate of support contracts and an increase in demand for professional services. If not for ASC 606 accounting change, our Service business would have experienced 9% growth year-over-year. In summary, while our business remains lumpy and sometimes difficult to predict on a quarterly basis, we remain confident that we are on track to deliver a return to growth by the end of the year. We believe we are innovating in ways which truly matter to our customers. We are executing on the right side of change in our industry and positioning the business to see improved long-term success. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for all of our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. The results for the second quarter were better than expected with a total second quarter revenue of $1.204 billion non-GAAP gross margin of 59.1%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.48; all above the midpoint of our guidance. We saw sequential growth across all verticals, led by Enterprise, which increased 20%, driven by the growth in all technologies. Enterprise also posted its 6th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth at 9%. The Service Provider vertical was up 9% sequentially, in line with seasonal trends, and declined 7% year-over-year, due to the impact of the adoption of ASC 606. Without this revenue recognition change, Service Provider would have been essentially flat year-over-year. Cloud revenues increased 4% sequentially, but declined 26% year-over-year. The year-over-year decline reflects continued architectural headwinds and the pace of deployments. As Rami mentioned, we remain confident in our position with our strategic cloud customers. However, the timing of deployments may continue to vary. During the quarter, Routing and Switching both increased to double-digits sequentially, and the positive momentum in Security continued, growing 9% quarter over quarter. Security posted a third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, increasing 16%. Our Switching business declined 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by the weakness in Cloud and Service Provider. Routing saw a 14% decline year-over-year, primarily due to the ongoing architectural shift in Cloud. PTX grew on a year-over-year basis. In reviewing our top-10 customers for the quarter, six were Cloud, three were Service Provider and one was in Enterprise. Product deferred revenue declined in the second quarter, primarily due to the adoption of ASC 606. Without the impact of the adoption of ASC 606, product deferred revenue would have increased 13% year-over-year. For the quarter, non-GAAP gross margin was 59.1%. The sequential improvement was primarily due to higher revenue, while the year-over-year decline was primarily related to mix and lower revenue. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 2% sequentially, and 1% year-over-year, due to prudent cost management. Cash flow from operations was $170 million for the quarter, a decline of $128 million year-over-year, and $101 million sequentially. These declines reflect lower collections and higher tax payments. The higher tax payments are a result of the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including the first of eight annual installments related to the transition tax. In addition, we paid $63 million in dividends. Our total cash, cash equivalents and investment balance at the end of the June quarter was $3.5 billion, a modest increase versus last quarter. Before we move on to the question and answer part of the call, I would like to provide some color on our guidance, which you could find detailed in the CFO Commentary available on our Investor Relations site. Our Q3 revenue guidance reflects stronger-than-expected Q2 business, particularly in Enterprise, as well as the timing of certain Cloud and Service Provider deployments which are taking longer to materialize. In addition, we are working through some industry-wide supply constraints related to certain power management components, which could further impact our lead times in Q3. At this time, we believe we will be largely able to mitigate this issue. Therefore, it is not a significant factor within our guidance. However, it could impact our future results. While customer spending remains dynamic and difficult to predict, we continue to expect to return to year-over-year growth during the December quarter. We expect non-GAAP gross margins for the quarter to remain stable in Q3 and improve with volume over time. However, the pace of this improvement could be impacted by mix, as well as other factors. We expect annual non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately flat on a year-over-year basis. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. Now I would like to open the call for questions.
Operator: At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Tim Long, BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you. Yeah, just a question and a clarification; so just on the Cloud delays, maybe if you could just talk a little bit, Rami, about maybe how broad across the customer base are those delays; is it just one or two customers and kind of what the root cause is. Is it just still testing the product or is there something else at bay there? I'm assuming you don't think it's looking at other solutions – competitive solutions. And then secondly, on the Cloud topic, can you talk a little bit about Switching and trying to get a little bit more traction into the Cloud vertical and the hyperscale players and maybe touch on where you're thinking the insertion point would be, and does 400 gig help you there – give you a window into that customer base? Thank you.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Tim. So, good set of questions. First, as far as the cloud routing goes and our position with cloud routing, it's the same architectural shift we've been talking about, 10 gig to 100 gig scale-out. Certainly, a platform transition from MX to PTX, that are all coming to bear. Our view – coming into the year, our view of the full year in terms of that transition has always been this is going to take multiple quarters, and it's playing out that way. Predicting exactly when the big deployments are going to happen, especially internationally, as data centers get deployed around the globe, is easier said than done. However, I do want to just make sure that you all understand, I remain very confident that we are in an extremely strong position with our Cloud customers. As you just heard from Ken, 6 of our 10 top customers in Q2 were, in fact, Cloud customers were already designed into many of the next generation networks that need to be deployed. You asked about, sort of, how broad-based or not; well, we're talking about hyperscalers here, so it only takes a couple of customers to move the needle pretty significantly. Certification of our software and our products, for the most part, have either already been completely done or is getting completed and the conversations with our customers at – down at the engineering level have never been stronger. And finally, maybe the last data point I'll offer is just that we've seen abnormally rapid ASP declines as a result of the MX to PTX transition over the last several quarters, but now that's starting to stabilize, which is a good indication of the fact that at least a good part of that transition is behind us. So, all of these factors give me a lot of confidence that this is more a quarter timing issue than it is anything more fundamental than that. I do not believe it's a competitive issue. And then on your question around Switching, I'm glad you asked it because I still believe that Switching is an incredible opportunity for us to take share in the large cloud or Tier 1 cloud vertical. We're already seeing great momentum in the Enterprise, validated now by being in the leader's quadrant in the Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Networking; we are seeing really good and solid momentum in the Tier 2 space; we are looking at the 400-gig inflection point that is coming next year as an opportunity for us to take share in hyperscale switching; and we've announced a broad set of products, 400-gig interfaces, across all of our Routing and Switching portfolio, as well as two new platforms, Routing and Switching, that will be available before the end of this year that are 400-gig optimized. So, our intention of capturing that wave early is playing out as we expect, and I think that's going to be very helpful for us.
Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Thank you.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: My pleasure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Simon Leopold, Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you very much. I wanted to see if we could talk a little bit about maybe levers that influence your gross margin, and in particular, what I'm trying to really get to is, in the fourth quarter, when you expect to return to year-over-year growth, it would imply improved volume. And so, I'm just trying to get an idea, how much of the gross margin would be driven by volume versus mix? Thank you.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Simon. Good questions. So as we we've been stating, the decline this year is largely both volume and mix related; volumes should recover, and we expect Q4 to be growth year-on-year as you mentioned. However, the mixed headwinds that we've seen, namely the Switching in becoming a bigger piece of overall revenue stream, as well as the MX to PTX, some of those mix headwinds on the product side will not recover this year. I do expect us to grow margin beyond this year as volume grows and mix kind of stabilizes, but I don't expect a recovery beyond that. We'll see some improvement from volume, but we won't get back to FY2017 levels because the mixed impacts will remain throughout this year.
Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. And just as a follow up, I wanted to see if you could quantify the software business. I think, in the past, you've given us a couple metrics; I think 2015 was 3%; 2017, if I recall, 6% of revenue from software; I just want to see where we are today to help me understand the baseline.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, so those metrics still hold, and we did say this quarter we grew software 27% year-on-year. So our software business continues to outpace the rest of our businesses actually, from a growth perspective, and we're very excited about the opportunity. We've talked – we've recently talked a lot about the Contrail Enterprise Multicloud product that we announced earlier this year; that should be shipping soon, and we think that's going to drive a lot of momentum in the whole Enterprise data center solution, which is really a software-led solution.
Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: But as a portion of revenue, it's below 10%, but above the 6% last year?
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yes.
Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Kvaal, Nomura Instinet. Please proceed with your question.
Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura Instinet: Thank you, gentlemen. I was hoping to dial a little bit in to the Service Provider side that you mentioned in the third quarter guidance. What are the dynamics that are going on there and, in the back of my mind, of course, Verizon seems like they're being a bit more aggressive on price, so that's more of a sustainable shift rather than a push-out by a quarter or so.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Jeff. Let me start and maybe Ken has some additional comments. I think, honestly, it's more of the same when it comes to the Service Provider space. We did see a good sequential recovery from a Q1 low, but generally speaking, the dynamics in the market are around telcos being prudent with their spend, consolidation, M&A activity, unlimited data plans, that are all putting pressure on their ability to invest. Now, we see the same CapEx reports that you saw coming out of the large Tier 1 telcos, which suggest that second half would be better than the first half. I do believe that will translate to better dynamics for Juniper, specifically. I'm optimistic from a new architecture and new solutions standpoint for telcos, but this is going to play out over the next several years. Examples would be, all telcos are looking at deploying some form of a telco cloud, from which they will deliver next-generation services to the Enterprise or for 5G, and Juniper is quickly developing a reputation of being a trusted advisor to the deployment of such telco cloud initiatives. And in fact, we just won another Tier 1 telco in Europe, which is rolling out this sort of telco cloud to offer next-generation services, and we're very proud of that. I think there could be other catalysts like 5G deployments in Metro, but quite frankly, this is not something that we're modeling into our assumptions over the next few quarters. It's something that we're hopeful will help over the next couple of years.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: The only thing I would add is while we do expect a modest decline sequentially in Q3, we do expect the second half in our Service Provider to be stronger than the first half. So, it's just kind of a timing game at this point. From a pricing perspective, we aren't seeing anything beyond normal when it comes to pricing pressure; it's always been a heightened pricing pressure environment, but we aren't seeing anything unusual at this point from a pricing perspective.
Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura Instinet: Thanks, Ken. And then would you mind reminding us where we are with the headwinds from memory pricing and maybe we'll start – if we might see the benefit of that as memory pricing starts to improve over the next few quarters?
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, so at this point, it's been stable all year. We expect it to remain stable throughout this year. We could see some favorable pricing beginning next year, but at this point we're seeing stable.
Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura Instinet: Thank you, both.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Silverstein, Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.
Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: I appreciate you taking the question. I heard the response to the last question, but Rami, Ken, I just want to make sure, with the new MX platform and with telcos having observed what the cloud hyperscale folks have been doing, you're not expecting any significant step-down in pricing, and the new MX platform doesn't, on a like-for-like basis, if we look at per-port pricing, clearly from your comments, there's not going to be that type of step-down or anything close to it.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thanks for the question, Paul, and I'm glad you asked. The answer is, yes, you're right, I do not anticipate anything remotely close to the kind of transition that we've seen from MX to PTX in the Cloud space; and it's primarily a matter of the kinds of services that telcos are typically delivering over the MX – and it's playing out as we expect. I mean, we monitor the MX to PTX ratio both in the Cloud as well as in other verticals, especially the telco vertical, and they just look very, very different. But beyond that, the MX itself will see a substantial amount of innovation that will enhance not only its programmability, but its performance as well as the economics on a per-bit basis in each line card. We just recently announced a new silicone generation, the Penta Silicon generation for the MX that will start to ship in the early part of next year that brings all of the tens of thousands of MX chasses that are deployed now around the world, an opportunity for an upgrade. And I think that just reduces the incentives for many of the telcos to move aggressively to another platform like the PTX. I'll just close by saying, every time we have introduced a next-generation of line cards for the MX that bring up the performance and reduce the cost per bid, we've seen a pretty substantial uptick as a result, again, of the wide deployed base, and we're anticipating the same sort of thing in the first part of next year.
Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: And, Rami, if we look further longer term for Service Provider routing, given the pressures in that market from a secular standpoint as well as the competitive dynamics, it seems like most of you folks accuse (00:27:10) yourself, others are all talking about share gain. What's your best guess as to what the longer-term outlook from a growth perspective? Are you hoping to run in place, hoping to grow the business? Or should we just expect modest decline?
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Well, I think the TAM for telco routing will be under pressure for the next couple of years, as I've mentioned, for the variety of reasons I just articulated. However, the way I look at the telco space and our opportunity in the telco space is in a couple of ways. First, we have to be very relevant to the next-generation solutions that they're deploying, especially around virtualization and SDN; and I think we are very quickly gaining a lot of momentum there. But beyond that, I think there is an opportunity to expand in more traditional routing by penetrating accounts that are mostly international where our footprint remains very low, and there are those accounts in Europe and especially in Asia Pacific. So, I think the combination of a go-to-market strategy that we are wrapping around that opportunity, an alliance and partnership strategy that we are putting in place to help us in expanding our reach internationally, as well as the new product portfolio that we are now introducing into the market around the PTX and the MX, I think we have a real opportunity to do that. So it's really around net new footprint, especially internationally, where we have much less penetration or market share all up is our opportunity.
Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Paul.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rod Hall, Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Rod Hall - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yeah, hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So, I guess, I wanted to come back to the telco architectures a little bit, Rami. Thanks for all the clarification on where you see that; I'm curious about the 5G fixed wireless trials and then commercial rollouts that are coming up. What do you think Juniper's participation in that is and how that architecture might be changing? Do you expect the MX to be used as much there as it is elsewhere? So, that's the first question, just kind of clarifying the telco stuff. And then, Ken, I wanted to come back to the power management parts commentary that you had and just ask – I think you referred to MLCCs (00:29:43) there; if you guys are able to source them, most people think prices are going up a lot and we don't really know how much content you guys have on average. So, I'm just curious what the margin impact of that is; is there one, or if you can source them, it's not as material for margins. Thanks.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Rod. Let me start with the question around 5G, which is a good question. First, 5G is going to be, in our view, very much a cloud-native architecture, which means that the infrastructure to support 5G services is going to be built on a distributed telco cloud. And in many ways, we're already participating in these next-generation telco cloud solutions and projects with our customers in preparation for 5G. I anticipate that will only accelerate as 5G deployments start to happen more fully and around the globe next year. Secondarily, we've always had a strong position in Security for telcos, and in particular, mobile security; and we've seen, as you saw from our results, pretty good momentum in Security now for the third quarter in a row. That has largely come from data center and Enterprise and actually, less so from telco yet, because we haven't yet refreshed our next-generation firewalls for the high-end, and in particular, for the mobile telco opportunity. That happened this quarter, and as a result of that, we anticipate we're going to be in a fantastic position to take advantage of Security projects, in particular, to get ready for, you know, advancements to 4G or 5G. And then, finally, it's just the transport opportunity. 5G is going to be around far more capacity that has to be transported in the Access, in the Metro, and in the Core; and we are starting to see more Metro projects that are out there that we are competing for, and our goal, again here, would be to take share. I mentioned just earlier, around our alliance and partnership strategy, we are working very closely with alliance partners with a goal of being well-prepared from a go-to-market standpoint to achieve or to compete for such opportunities as they come about.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yes. And from a supply-constraints perspective, Rod, as we talked about, we do believe we will be able to mitigate the risk, but there could be some timing risk as related to lead times, et cetera. On a margin perspective, they're a very small piece of our overall cost of goods sold, so we don't anticipate any impact to our cost of goods sold or margins due to this issue.
Rod Hall - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Okay. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Rod.
Operator: Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee, JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I just want to first ask about the cloud routing business. PTX has been around 80% of cloud routing for the last couple of quarters. So does it sort of stabilize here or is there a bit more to go in terms of the mix shift? And, additionally, with the cloud providers, I think you mentioned that there was a sequential slowdown in Security revenues. Is there any trend to that? Is there something particularly driving that? Or is it more of a one-off this quarter?
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thanks for the question, Samik. So, on the cloud routing side, yes, I mean, we're sort of hovering around 80% for the last couple of quarters. I do expect that when the bulk of the transition is behind us, it will actually be more than 80% that will move to PTX, but the fact that it's sort of hovering around 80% would at least suggest that we're starting to stabilize. And the second data point that I offered is just ASPs; ASPs themselves are no longer declining as rapidly as they were just a couple of quarters ago when the transition from MX to PTX was happening far more rapidly. We've always said this transition is going to happen over several quarters. That's exactly what's happening. I think by next year, the bulk of it will be behind us, and we should start to see year-over-year growth in that timeframe. And then your question about Security, I don't believe I said anything about Security specifically for Cloud. What I did say is, in Security, we're seeing really good momentum in the branch, in the midrange; we're seeing good Security for next-gen firewall for data center and campus. What we have not yet seen is good growth in Security is primarily because of the fact that our portfolio needs a refresh. It is due for a refresh; it's in the high end. Now, that high end for Security is primarily used for mobile applications in the telcos and some applications for large data centers, and that changes in the second half of this year as we introduce a new platform.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, in my commentary I did mention that the sequential strength in Security was Enterprise-led and it was offset partially by some Cloud from a sequential basis. It wasn't a material offset, but there was some offset. I wouldn't call it a trend; it was just timing of deployments from a Cloud Security perspective, not something that we perceive being a new trend going forward.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for that clarification. So our Security business for the cloud providers has always been very lumpy because it is so concentrated in – with a few number of customers.
Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC: All right. Got it. That's what I was referring to. Thanks for that clarification. Can I just ask, you mentioned some, sort of, pull-forward of revenues from Q3 to Q2 that's impacting the Q3 outlook here; is there any way of quantifying the pull-forward in terms of the strong close to the quarter that you had with Enterprise customers; sort of to give us a fair idea of what kind of impact on Q3 is from that?
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: So the way I've looked at it is, we exceeded our – the midpoint of our guidance by approximately $30 million, and most of that was related to some better Enterprise performance than we expected going in the quarter; and we think that will have a negative impact to the Q3 Enterprise result as it gets – the sequential pattern is going to be a little more Q2-focused and a little less Q3 on the Enterprise side. But that kind of describes the magnitude that we're talking about.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. Hey, Rami, Ken, how is it going?
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Hey, Vijay.
Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. I have a bigger-picture question on 400 gig – I mean, congratulations on the product launch. I want to get your understanding of when is the earliest revenue quarter and then also would 400 gig mostly be incremental to you or would it cannibalize or replace any of the other footprint you have, for example, 100 gig at any of the Cloud companies? Thank you.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Vijay. Good question. So, I am very excited about the 400 gig opportunity all up. I mean, Juniper has always been very strong when it comes to high-performance networking, and 400 gig, it represents the next big market opportunity for high-performance networking that's true for the wide area – it's certainly true for the data center. There's always some level of cannibalization, right? I mean, we've seen this in the transition to 10 gig to 100 gig and to 400 gig. As customers start to adopt 400 gig, the demand for 100 gig will start to subside, but this plays out over many years. And all up, I expect it to be much more of an opportunity than anything else for Juniper. And that is, in particular, as it relates to the cloud space, the cloud provider space and especially in the switching. So, we wanted to make sure that we introduce a holistic 400-gig strategy across our entire product portfolio. The two platforms – actually more than two, but the platforms that we introduced are just announced, that we'll introduce into the market before the end of the year, are quite honestly just teasers of what's to come that leverage next-generation merchant silicon, as well as next-generation Juniper silicon in both routing and in switching, that will provide for 400-gig readiness. As soon as the 400-gig optics are going to be available on the market, our customers will have an opportunity to deploy in use cases where that kind of capacity is required. The optics, we anticipate, will enter into the market in the Q1 timeframe, and then the build-outs will start to happen slowly throughout 2019.
Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, perfect. A quick follow-on for Ken on gross margins; Ken, what will get the margins to creep up? Is it just better unit volumes or are you going to apportion your COGS better? Is it – I don't know, any more offshore (00:39:00) portfolio in the mix? Just want to get your view of margins; how should we think of it heading into the second half?
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, so the most immediate uptick will be primarily volume-related. Beyond that, we have a lot of value engineering efforts underway, a lot of their software – so software continues to be a bigger piece of overall revenue. That will clearly be margin positive, and you know, pricing discipline and supply chain optimization and all of these efforts will be focused on as well. But I would say that the short-term margin growth should be mostly volume. Beyond that, it's going to be primarily product innovation led with some other discipline in the supply chain.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, let me just add to that, Vijay. So, we have said that one of the contributors to gross margin pressure had been mix shift, and in particular, the shift of routing to switching. We have also, very deliberately, learned a lot from our QFX switching deployments around the world, especially with the cloud providers, and all of those lessons have now fed their way into our product innovation pipeline, especially the silicon technology that we're developing or procuring from our – for our merchant silicon vendors, to capture the next wave of switching, especially data center opportunity. So that's what Ken means when he talks about innovation. You can't – that won't help immediately, but I'm confident that the lessons learned and the changes that we've made in our next-generation products will help quite a lot from a gross margin standpoint.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sami Badri, Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you for the question. I wanted to take a moment to just discuss Contrail and multi-cloud deployments. When customers use Contrail to deploy in to multiple clouds, are they also opting into your hardware products? And if so, like, what are they using? What I'm really trying to get at are, what are the hardware components of choice for this type of deployment?
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Okay. It's a great question. Let me start. First, the primary use cases for Contrail have thus far been for NFV-type deployments inside of telcos and really large enterprises that almost behave like service providers. And those deployments, they take quite a bit of time to get them stood up, to get the services up and running and so forth; and that has been the primary driver of our Contrail business to date. And we've seen great momentum, not necessarily from a revenue as a percentage of total Juniper revenue, but from the standpoint of mindshare with our customers from the standpoint of pull-through of hardware like switching, routing and security. And all the strategic conversations we're having with telcos around that, the distributed telco cloud opportunity starts with Contrail. So, what we have done recently is, we've announced a product that is based on Contrail that's called Contrail Enterprise Multicloud; just recently announced it and it actually gets shipped into the market within the next few weeks. And what that does is that it broadens the opportunity for Contrail substantially, and especially in the Enterprise space. Every CIO – or most CIOs I talk to on an ongoing basis, is in some way, shape, or form, thinking about how to move to a multi-cloud environment that includes some combination of private cloud and a variety of public cloud. But they're looking for solutions to do that with simplicity and with security. And we believe firmly that Contrail Enterprise Multicloud is the best solution for that problem. And yes, there's absolutely a pull-through opportunity there because once you have that strategic control point within the Enterprise, the conversation shifts to the switching infrastructure for the private cloud, security, both physical and virtual, in the private cloud and public cloud, as well as potentially even routing to connect private to public cloud. So that is the strategy that we're embarking on. I'm super-excited about the products we're going to be introducing into the market just very shortly. The initial interest and the proof of concepts we've been doing with our customers has been very encouraging.
Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it. Thank you for the color on that. And then maybe just to touch on the comment you just made regarding the security enablement side, when they go into public clouds or multiple public clouds is, should we expect the attach rate of your Security business to pick up in this transition versus like the legacy business? Or how could you – I'm just trying to quantify this or even think about how this would work from an attach rate perspective. Just, maybe if you give us like a point of reference.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Well, it is a very good question, and we certainly do think of it in that way. I look at Security on a couple of different horizons. There's the here-and-now around physical firewalls, and that's where we're mostly seeing the momentum we've seen over the last three quarters or so. And there's been a tremendous amount of work in making our product portfolio in the firewall space more competitive, as well as some real intense focus in go-to market that has led to that momentum. The second horizon of security is not so much about the physical perimeter, which essentially becomes less relevant over time. It really becomes around securing workloads, applications in a private and public cloud, and that now becomes a great opportunity for our virtual security products. Our virtual SRX, our containerized SRX, which work seamlessly with Contrail's Enterprise Multicloud to offer that multi-cloud solution. At some point, I think we can talk to you about quantifying the pull-through. We're not prepared to do that now. I think maybe we can do that at the Analyst Event that we'll host in the second half of this year.
Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it. Thank you so much for the color.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: My pleasure.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Notter, Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC: Hi, there. Thanks a lot, guys. Hey, I wanted to ask, going back to the mixture of PTX among Cloud Routing business, I think you said 80%, and it's been there a couple of quarters. You said it's going to continue to drift up above 80%. I guess, I'm wondering how you think about the timing for that. Do you say that because you have specific visibility into some cloud customers migrating off of MX and onto the PTX? Or is that more just a hunch you have? And I guess, I'm wondering what the timing of that would look like. Is that something that's baked into your guidance for the second half of the year in terms of revenue and margins? Thanks a lot.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yes. George, no, it's based on more than a hunch; I would say it is based on an understanding that the design wins that we have with some of our really large cloud providers include a combination of PTX and next-generation QFX switching, and we're still early innings. The new architectures are sort of – we are completing, as I mentioned, the certification process; we're ready for deployment. It really now comes down to when the deployments happen holistically, internationally, which is difficult to predict on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but I have high degree of confidence that we're on the receiving end of the build-out. And that's what leads me to believe that over time, the PTX percentage will drift up. It will never be 100% because even within the cloud space, there will be a variety of use cases where the MX is the only platform – or the platform that makes the most sense for those specific use cases, but I do anticipate it drifting up from 80% of it.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, and we think it will take you several more quarters. The transition will happen for a couple of years.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: It's a couple of years, but enough of the transition...
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Is behind us.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: ...will be behind us, we believe, by the end of this year; so that by the next year, year-over-year growth in Cloud becomes very possible.
George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC: All right. Super. Thank you very much.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from James Kisner, Loop Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
James Kisner - Loop Capital Markets LLC: Yeah, thank you for taking my questions. So, a little different tack here; so, obviously, the current situation, you know, with tariffs imposed by the U.S. and other countries is dynamic and changing, and recognizing you guys are fortunate enough not to be doing a lot of business in China, I'm just wondering, can you comment on any impact you've seen thus far on your supply chain, input costs, customer demand to the extent you've seen so far? How are you thinking about the risks or opportunities to your business going forward amidst the ongoing kind of the trade situation? Thanks.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, so at this point, the tariffs that have been implemented have had basically no impacts to our business. Clearly, we're monitoring the situation closely. If there are additional tariffs, they could be impactful. We are looking at ways to mitigate potential impacts of potential new tariffs, but at this point, there is nothing factored into our – obviously, our results or our Q3 guidance, because we don't expect there to be a material impact right now, but we will continue to monitor and adapt as necessary going forward.
James Kisner - Loop Capital Markets LLC: Okay. And just separately, you talked about a lot of innovation in your portfolio coming down the pike here; do you anticipate any potential wait-for effect or Osborne effect as they call it? Have you factored that at all into your business? Any thoughts there at all? Thanks.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: I'm not concerned about that because a lot of the innovations that we've announced have been really around 400-gig optimized platforms in routing and in switching. I think we intentionally wanted to capture that opportunity in the very early phases, but from a demand standpoint, it will happen over time. So, I'm not too concerned about cannibalization or Osborning.
James Kisner - Loop Capital Markets LLC: All right. Thank you.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from James Faucette, Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. I just had two quick questions; Ken, if you said it, I apologize and I missed it, but can you help us quantify a little bit the impact of ASC 606 on the Q3 margins and revenue, et cetera?
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: On Q2, I presume, you mean? Or on Q3?
James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: On Q3, going forward. Was it impacting your – the formulation of your guidance at all?
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, no. So the guidance was all based on new ASC 606 rules. To be perfectly honest with you, I'm not doing a forecast under the old rules. We have converted the company to the new rules and that's what the guidance is based off of. Any given quarter, there could be a small impact. Q2, the net impact was about $17 million. I would consider that a small impact. There's potential for that to go the other direction in Q3 or go to a similar direction. So we are really pivoting the business under new rules and that's what the guidance is based off of.
James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's great. And then, I guess, maybe a broader question, Rami, on Security. Obviously, the way that you've talked about it in terms of the changing dynamic and approach of Security, I'm just wondering, is that also changing your sales motion and are you having to engage with different people, or are the networking leaders becoming more involved in security decision-making yet in your sales process? Thanks.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, it's a good question. So, certainly, you can't see this kind of momentum with just product innovation alone. We have upped our focus in go-to market. We have built a specialist team that focuses entirely on Security and talks to the Security buyers within our customers. We've created incentives out in the field around Security and then, finally, I think the thing that's working really well for us is solution sales. As we go to our customers and talk about a next-generation cloud architecture, I think we have now learned to talk not just about the switching component of that cloud, but it's really around switching, it's around security, it's around orchestration, multi-cloud, routing, and I think that end-to-end solutions motion has really helped us. When we look at where we are selling security, we're actually – you'll see a high degree of correlation to accounts where we're also selling other products as well.
James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: My pleasure.
Operator: Our next question comes from James Fish, Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.
James E. Fish - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Most of my questions have been answered. The only thing that really hasn't come up today is just your general competition from essentially white box switching. Just curious on your view through the second quarter.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you, James. So I would say, not much has changed from our perspective. I think the real benefits for white box that our customers truly care about are flexibility, you know, having the access to different silicon choices, programmability through standards-based interfaces and telemetry, the ability to extract lots of information, and of course, economics; and I truly believe we are ahead of the market in all of these dimensions. We have a CTO, Bikash Koley, that comes from the cloud world that's infusing this kind of thinking throughout our entire company, especially our R&D organization. I think we're innovating on the right side of change for this opportunity right now for us, so more of the same.
James E. Fish - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great. Thanks. And then, Ken, maybe for you, on that 9% impact to Service from ASC 606, was that bookings or is that revenue?
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Those are revenues. So the Services numbers were all revenue-based. Bookings would have no impact from the ASC 606 to ASC 605 – ASC 605 to ASC 606 perspective.
James E. Fish - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. Great. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers, Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Joe Quatrochi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Great. This is Joe Quatrochi on for Aaron. I just had a quick question, a follow-up on your MX refresh next year. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the opportunity; how large of an opportunity do you see that? And then, how do you think about the timing from when that's launched to when we could start to see that impact the model?
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for the question, Joe. First, in terms of the refresh itself, it's pretty broad-based. It has a number of different dimensions. First and foremost, we're introducing the MX technology both on the hardware and software side to our universal chassis, which is a chassis that supports all different types of use cases and deployments across switching, routing and services delivery. And then we're going to follow that up pretty quickly, in the first part of next year, with new silicone advancements for all of our MX platforms, and there are many deployed out there and a lot of empty slots that we can go and leverage. The biggest opportunity is going to be within the telco space, right? And we have seen this time and time again. I think since the initial introduction of the MX, we probably released around three or four different major iterations of technology, and in each case, we've seen the uptake happen faster as a result of the broader deployed platform that is out there. We're equally optimistic about the opportunity here, specifically in the telco space. In terms of timing, if we introduce it in the first part of next year, typically the certification time will take six months to nine months, that sort of timeframe; some customers that will move faster, but on average, that's the kind of ballpark we'd look at for certification time.
Joe Quatrochi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Perfect. Thank you.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: My pleasure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dmitry Netis, William Blair. Please proceed with your question.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you, and thanks for squeezing me in here at the end of the call. I just sort of want to follow-up on this MX to PTX transition, and how this may potentially affect the telco segment. I understand there's an MX refresh coming, but your Cloud now is at, say, 80% transition to PTX. Is there a similar dynamic in telcos? And I know a bunch of your telcos are buying PTX. So, as you kind of look out the next three, five years, what percentage of telco customers do you expect to transition over to PTX versus MX? If there's number there, I would love to hear about that. And is there something in that transition that kind of sucks a lot of this intelligence into the Contrail SDN controller which allows you to – which allows your customers to potentially to use maybe a less of an intelligent box at the telco level; so in other words, using PTX rather than MX.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for the question, Dmitry. So first, I think it's useful to understand that in the cloud provider space, most of the routing applications are primarily around transport. It's not so much about service delivery, it's around connecting data centers together, it's around connecting to peering points in their network; and that's conducive to a real optimized transport product like the PTX. In the telco space, the use cases, there are certainly use cases that are around transport. I mean, Core is mostly around transport and for that reason, we have been selling PTXs there. But if you look over the last few quarters at the mix of MX to PTX within telco, it has not changed all that much. It's more or less stable at a number that's far less than the ratio that's in the cloud. Could the PTX inch up over time? Yes, I think it could, but it will happen at nowhere near the pace it is happening within the telco space. And it's primarily, again, because of the use cases and the services that are delivered. In the telco space, the delineation between transport, movement of packets and service delivery to enterprises or to consumers are – is usually very fuzzy, which makes it very, very conducive to sell a very flexible platform into that opportunity. It's why the MX has been so successful and why I think the refresh we're going to do for the MX is going to see a lot of success in the telco space. So, again, I do not believe that this transition is going to happen nearly as fast in the telco space over time. I think, maybe, again, at the analyst event, we can provide you some more color on our ratio expectations over time. I don't want to do that on this call right now.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. I was going to follow up with that. But thank you, I appreciate the detailed explanation. It's very helpful. Thank you very much.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Dmitry.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Jess Lubert for closing remarks.

Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. We performed well compared to our expectations during the March quarter. Total revenue of $1,083 million slightly exceeded the high end of our guidance as better than expected results in our cloud vertical along with continued success in our enterprise business more than offset weaker than expected service provider sales. Non-GAAP earnings per share also came in at the high end of our guidance at $0.28 due to the higher revenue and margin in line with our forecast. While our results were better than our guidance, we are far from satisfied and are working hard to not only return the business to growth, but drive profitability back toward normalized levels. We continue to believe we have the right products and strategy to win across our core vertical and we are continuing to innovate with the goal of disrupting our markets and gaining share. While we believe our greatest near-term opportunity remains in the cloud, we were also playing to win in our enterprise and service provider market. Based on our current product pipeline and recent customer conversation, I remain confident that Juniper controls its own destiny and its position to drive a return to growth and improve profitability by the end of the year. Now for a few highlights of the quarter. I'm pleased with the progress we are making in our cloud vertical where several of our largest customers are transitioning from our MX to our PTX platforms. While this process is creating ASP pressure in our cloud routing business that is likely to persist over the next few quarters, we believe we are making progress with this transition, which should become less of a headwind through the course of the year. As proof of our progress, I'd like to highlight that several of our cloud projects that were previously on hold have started to move forward and we expect these deployments to ramp through the remainder of this year and next. Our cloud routing business experienced sequential growth during the March quarter, a trend we anticipate will continue through the rest of the year. Our PTX products accounted for more than 80% of the cloud routing ports we shipped on a 10 gig equivalent basis during Q1 compared to less than 40% one year ago. Our cloud routing ASPs began to stabilize sequentially a trend we think is likely to continue as mix headwinds subside through the year. It's also worth mentioning that our cloud switching business exceeded our own expectations in the period. Based on our results and customer engagements, we remain confident that we are holding our cloud routing footprint and positioning the business to capitalize on this customer sets' rising network requirement. We will continue to innovate, challenge the status quo and deliver new levels of performance, programmability and telemetry to further strengthen our relevance to these important customers. The enterprise vertical was also a bright spot in the period with revenues growing 4% year-over-year due to strengthened financial services and healthy trends across all technologies. We believe we have a compelling portfolio of enterprise switching, security and orchestration solutions. We continue to strengthen our enterprise offering and view Contrail Enterprise Multicloud as a validation of these efforts, which should bring engineering simplicity to enterprise datacenter environments and establish Juniper as the leader in the field of intent based networking systems. Service provider revenue was soft in the quarter, declining 16% year-over-year due to seasonality and customer lumpiness. We expect service provider spending to remain sluggish in 2018, but expect to see improved spending levels beyond the March quarter. Despite a slow start to the year, we believe we continue to gain mindshare with our largest service provider customers who are recognizing the value of our nodes slicing feature, software disaggregation, and integrated optical capabilities to meet their core and edge networking requirements. We believe our efforts should position Juniper to gain share as service providers move forward with metro initiative and 5G build out which could present tailwinds for our business over the next few years. Now I would like to summarize our performance across routing, switching and security. In routing, our business declined sequentially and year-over-year. While this weakness was seen across product lines, new PTX footprint opportunities within the cloud and MX requirements in the telecom and cable verticals, where service creation remains mission critical, continues to give us confidence in the longer term trajectory for routing portfolio. In switching, our business declined 1% quarter-over-quarter and 5% year-over-year. The sequential decline was driven by seasonality across our key verticals. While our enterprise switching business grew year-over-year, this was offset by lower levels of spending at a few cloud customers, which we had expected. Based on our pipeline and customer feedback, we remain optimistic regarding the outlook for our QFX and EX product lines, which we believe remain highly competitive and well positioned to compete across industry verticals, including cloud and hyperscale accounts. In security, our business declined 17% quarter-over-quarter but grew 11% year-over-year, representing the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. We believe more customers are recognizing the value of leveraging the entire network for detection and enforcement against cyber threats. Our Software-Defined Secure Network solution is gaining traction and we've added many new customers in Q1 that are leveraging its benefits. Based on our current pipeline, we remain optimistic that our security business will see year-over-year growth for the full year 2018. We are making progress with our efforts to capture more software revenue, which has more than doubled over the last three years. We are seeing momentum with Contrail and had several new customer wins in the quarter, including a U.S. SaaS provider, and a global strategic enterprise account. We believe we are executing on an extremely compelling product roadmap for Contrail, as highlighted by the recent release of our enhanced enterprise multicloud capabilities, which bring end to end policy and control capabilities for any workload running in physical and virtual environments any cloud and across multi-vendor environments. These are capabilities that are truly unique in the industry. Additionally, AppFormix continues to gain traction across a widening set of customers with new wins in the service provider and enterprise verticals. We plan to introduce new software innovations to the portfolio through the course of the year that drive customer efficiencies, enhance the value of our existing hardware platforms and result in more recurring software revenue which should prove accretive to growth and margins. While the impact of ASC 606 caused our Services business to decline year-over-year, we saw strong renewal and attach rates of support contracts and an increase in demand for professional services. If not for ASC 606 accounting change, our Service business would have experienced growth year-over-year. We remain committed to all of our strategic verticals, especially the cloud and believe that we are more relevant than ever to our customers and the industry. We are innovating in ways that truly matter to all network builders and operators that are embracing cloud architecture to drive greater levels of operating efficiency and service agility. I'm very excited about the opportunity we have in front of us. In summary, while we continued to believe 2018 is likely to be a transition year for Juniper, we are confident that we have the right strategy and solution portfolio needed to win in the market and drive the return to growth by the end of the year. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for all of our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. The results for the first quarter were in line with our expectations and were above the midpoint of our guidance for revenue, non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP EPS. The change to the new accounting standard ASC 606 did not materially impact the overall first quarter financial results, and therefore the discussion of our first quarter results will reflect the adoption of ASC 606. Total first quarter revenue was $1,083 million, non-GAAP gross margin was 58.2% and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.28. As we expected, the architectural shifts in the cloud vertical continued, however, cloud revenues were up slightly sequentially and ahead of our expectations. The service provider vertical was challenged due to the timing of customer deployments, resulting in decreases both year-over-year and sequentially. Enterprise increased 4% year-over-year, due to strengths in all technologies. Routing and switching both declined year-over-year. However, we continue to see positive momentum in security where we saw a second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, four were cloud, four were service providers and two were enterprises. Of these customers, four were located outside of the United States. Product and service deferred revenue declined both year-over-year and sequentially, primarily due to the adoption of ASC 606. Without the impact of ASC 606, product deferred revenue would have been up approximately 19% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Service deferred revenue would have been up 4% year-over-year and sequentially. Non-GAAP gross margin was 58.2%. The result on a year-over-year and sequential basis was largely due to lower revenue, customer and product mix and higher service costs, partially offset by improvements in our cost structure. On a year-over-year basis, memory component costs were also a factor. Non GAAP operating expense was $497 million, a decrease of 2% year-over-year, but an increase of 4% sequentially. The sequential increase reflects the annual reset of variable compensation as well as targeted investments in R&D and sales and marketing, designed to strengthen products and market opportunities that we believe will drive differentiation and create future shareholder value. Our strong cash flow generation continued, with cash flow from operations of $271 million for the quarter. As we mentioned during our January call, during the first quarter, we initiated a $750 million accelerated share repurchase program and paid $62 million in dividends. Our total cash, cash equivalents and investment balance at the end of the March quarter was $3.4 billion and we repatriated $2.5 billion during the quarter. Before we move on to Q&A, I'd like to provide some color on our guidance, which you could find detailed in the CFO commentary available on our website. Our Q2 revenue outlook reflects a return to normal seasonality. While customer spending remains dynamic and difficult to predict, we continue to expect sequential growth through the remainder of the year, with a return to year-on-year growth in the fourth quarter. For the second quarter, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to improve sequentially due to increased volume and improvements in our cost structure. While we believe better volumes and cost structure efficiency should drive further non-GAAP gross margin improvement during the second half of the year, the pace of this improvement could be offset by mix and other factors. Based on our expected spending levels through the first half of the year, we now expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately flat for the full year 2018. In closing, I'd like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. Now, I'd like to open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question is from Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you very much. Before I ask my question, just a quick clarification. I did hear a comment that you expected security to grow for the year. I don't know if you made a similar comment on switching, so just wanted to clarify that. And let me ask the broader question is, we understand the transition to PTX replacing MX in the cloud vertical. I get a lot of questions about the same transition happening in service providers. And I know some operators like Verizon deployed PTX many years ago. But could you help us understand why we should or should not expect a similar product transition in your service provider vertical? Thank you.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Simon, thanks for the question. Let me start with the first one around our expectation for security and switching for the year. The indications that we're getting in terms of customer conversations, the strength of the technology, we just had a great RSA conference showing a few weeks ago. The pipeline is looking good, so I do expect security to be a growth driver for us in 2018 all up. Similar set of commentary around switching. Switching has a degree of customer concentration. And we have talked about the fact that this transition, the cloud does have an impact on switching. But I also mentioned in my opening commentary that we're progressing quite nicely in that transition. And as a result of that I do expect switching to be a growth engine for us in 2018 all up. So security and switching I think will be growth technologies for us in 2018. As far as the PTX transition, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we're making really good progress with now over 80% of the capacity that's being provided to the cloud vertical being PTX oriented. A much smaller number is in the service provider space and that's primarily because of the fact that the use cases and the applications in the service provider space are just not as conducive to a PTX type of architecture. The feature flexibility, the service delivery models and so forth are much more oriented towards the kind of flexibility that the MX provides. Additionally, we continue to invest in the MX. You can expect that there will be product refresh cycles happening in the MX that will improve the economics of the MX over time and provide telcos with the combination of flexibility, services capability that they need at more and more compelling price points. So for that reason there is going to be some shifting but nowhere near what it is for the cloud vertical in the next couple of years.
Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great, thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Steven Milunovich from UBS. Please go ahead.
Tejas Venkatesh - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks. This is Tejas on for Steve. Also on cloud, what was the reason cloud surprised? Is the transition happening faster than you previously expected?
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yes, it was a little bit faster than what we expected. I mean, we were at the high end of our range all up. So it's not like it was a huge surprise for us, but it's fair to say that we're pleased with the pace of that transition, right? The new architectures are well understood at this point. The certification for the products and the solution is well underway. In some cases, the new deployments have actually already started. And again as a proof points of that we provided the capacity mix between PTX and the MX. So I think we're just very pleased right now that we are making progress. And the more progress we make, the more confidence we have that we're going to get through this transition throughout the remainder of the year and get back to a year-over-year growth in cloud routing next year.
Operator: Our next question is from Tim Long from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you. Let me just move to the cloud switching part here. Rami, you did mention that it was down in the quarter but it did exceed your expectation. So if you can give us a little color on why cloud switching did a little bit better. Was it 100 gig? Was it new customers? And then the second part of that one, can you talk a little bit about the next transition to 400 gig? When do you see that happening? Do you see that as an opportunity, maybe an insertion point to get better in with the cloud? When could we hear more about that? Thank you.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Certainly Tim. So switching does have a fair degree of concentration especially in the hyperscale cloud providers where we still have a lot more room to grow over time. And I think the 400 gig transition is one that we're very excited about as an opportunity to go into capture share. We expect that to happen sometime next year. We're very much getting ready for it from the standpoint of the systems that are on our road map, the silicon technology that we have chosen, the optics components that will be required to achieve that 400 gig cycle. So all up, I actually am quite excited about 400 gig sometime next year as an opportunity for Juniper to take share. And as far as the switching trends in – that are happening in Q1 and in the next couple of quarters because of the fact that there is a fair degree of customer concentration in switching and because of the fact that this scale up to scale out transition that we've talked a lot about does have a switching element, we're seeing some cyclicality in the business. I do think that over the next few quarters we should see good solid growth in switching. And all up for 2018, I expect that switching will be up year-over-year. Very confident in the technology across software, silicon and optics that we have in the road map now for our switching product. So this is why I'm actually quite optimistic about switching in 2018.
Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Hi, guys. I'd like to dig into the gross margin, if I may, if you can quantify the impact, specifically of ASC 606 on gross margin versus other items number one. And number two, the word competition or price pressure isn't mentioned anywhere in the release or your prepared comments. Was that not a factor? Is the pricing environment relatively stable? And how do I think about the potential, what is steady state for you after you get back to volume on gross margins under ASC 606? I'm trying to understand what's the ceiling there.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Let me start actually with the second question around the pricing dynamics, and then I'll pass it on to Ken to talk about the gross margins and any impact with ASC 606. The biggest factor that has impacted pricing has actually been this cloud routing transition from MX to PTX. And as you all know, the PTX price per port is meaningfully lower than that of the MX. As we get through more and more of that transition then I expect there to be more normalization of the ASP compression on a year-over-year basis. I don't think from a competitive standpoint there's anything that's meaningfully different in Q1 versus what we saw last year. As this transition from MX to PTX plays out, I do expect that that headwind associated with price compression will start to alleviate. And now I'll pass it on to Ken to talk about gross margins.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Sure. So we are pleased with our gross margin result in Q1, slightly ahead of our midpoint of our guidance. That said, clearly it was down year-on-year and Q-on-Q as we expected it to be. The primary drivers for the decline sequentially would be lower revenue volume, which we talked about a lot last quarter as well as some of the mix issues, both technology mix, routing versus switching as an example, as well as just within routing as we go through this transition. We talked about the PTX product doesn't quite have the same margin level as MX, still a very good margin product above the Juniper average, but not as margin rich as MX. So those are the primary factors that caused this decline Q-on-Q. Going forward, we expect margin to increase with volume. You can see the Q2 guidance is 59%, so that's up sequentially off of Q1. I do expect it to increase throughout the rest of the year with volume. That said, the pace of the improvement could vary as mix will definitely be an impact going forward. So I don't expect the mix factor to normalize throughout the rest of the year. Just really the volume factor would be how I'd model that. From a ASC 606 perspective, there's really no change. I mean we had 58.2% in both ASC 605 and ASC 606. So the margin is the same in total. What is different is product versus service. So although revenue was largely unchanged there's just a $2 million difference between old rules and new rules, you did see approximately $29 million more product revenue and $27 million less service revenue. The cost of goods sold for products and cost of goods sold for service were largely the same. So that shift in revenues resulting in more margin for product, less margin for service, but overall not much of an impact.
Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Good luck guys.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Paul Silverstein from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
Paul Silverstein - Cowen and Company LLC: Thanks guys. A couple of clarifications and then a question. I'll start with a question. Rami, if I heard you correctly, I forget what you said whether you're expecting weak or a decline in your service provider revenue. I'm just wondering what are the underlying drivers of the disconnect between the calendar 2018 outlook versus service provider CapEx, especially wireline in your expectations. What's driving that? And then Ken, I was hoping for a clarification in terms of -- on the previous question. Is it too early to talk about what you could return to in terms of peak operating, peak gross margin once you get by -- once you get fully by this architectural transition issue? And finally, do you all still -- I think previously you all had indicated that you expect to win a hyperscale cloud customer related to switching by the end of calendar 2018. Is that still the expectation? Thanks guys.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Paul, thanks for the questions. So let me start with the service provider question. The factors that are affecting service provider have largely remained consistent over the last several quarters. Service providers are experiencing top line pressure. There is consolidation in this space. They are really thinking hard about how it is that they're going to move towards cloud-oriented architectures. And Q1 I think was especially challenging for Juniper because we had a couple of large telco customers, especially in North America, that just didn't spend as much as they have historically done. I do expect based on timing of projects, conversations we're having with them that we should see a recovery throughout this year. But it will remain a challenged environment I think for the next year or two. There are some potential catalysts that come our way for service providers. One of them is the conversations now especially on the heels of Mobile World Congress that took place earlier this year around 5G are really increasing. And that's going to require an investment in metro infrastructure to carry the increased capacity level that 5G will drive. It's also very much a cloud-native technology. So we are starting to see, and I would say, especially now in EMEA, an increased number of level of projects oriented around telco cloud that, I think, we are well set up to capture with our Contrail solutions. On the last question about hyperscale, I don't think we talked about any specific timing. In fact, we knew as we entered into the switching space that it would be easier for us to go after the Tier 2 cloud providers, the SaaS providers and the enterprise. And we've seen really solid momentum there that resulted in 25% year-over-year growth for the QFX last year. Hyperscalers are just going to take a little bit more time. We already have some presence in the hyperscalers switching use cases and opportunities, but there's a lot more for us to do. I do think 400-gig presents us with the next big opportunity that we're gearing up for.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. On the gross margin question, we continue to focus on innovation and value engineering as well as optimizing our supply chain, pricing discipline and increasing our software mix as well. So there's a lot of company initiatives to drive gross margin up. Quite honestly, at this point it is too early to call 2019. We are looking to have an Analyst Day or Investor Day later in the year where we'll provide more long term color and update, our long term model. But right now the focus on growing gross margin sequentially as volume grows throughout FY 2018. And to that point, I wouldn't – we're not going to provide full year guidance. But I would encourage you to maintain your revenue and EPS assumptions for the second half that you currently have in your models and that would apply to gross margin as well.
Paul Silverstein - Cowen and Company LLC: Hey, Rami, can I just clarify something? I'm not challenging your characterization of the carrier environment. But when you look at carriers' plans for spend this year, it actually is the best year in quite some time in the last eight or nine years, especially wireline. You're looking at a 5-plus-percent growth outlook. And I'm just wondering is there anything – in terms of the product market itself, I would think routing would do that much better. But is there anything going on? Are you just being appropriately conservative? Or is there something else underlying the disconnect in the guidance with that particular routing customers?
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Paul, we see the same CapEx reports that you see. And they don't – carriers, they're not always that clear about how they're going to be investing the CapEx dollars that they talk about as part of their plans. So, again, I would say, we're being cautious and prudent in terms of their spend levels, but we are very much viewing this as an extremely important vertical for us. And we're going to be ready to capture any routing opportunities or telco cloud opportunities with the innovations that we're putting into the market with our carriers. I will say, again, coming out of Mobile World Congress in Q1 of this year, I think, the relationships that we have with our major telco customers worldwide have never been stronger.
Operator: Our next question is from Tal Liani from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yes. Hi, guys. I want to go back to the question about carrier routing. Number one is, what do you make of AT&T use of 60,000 white box routers? How does that impact your position in the space? Why don't we see them taking more branded solutions versus white boxes? And is this something that we've seen on the switching side with Arista and they managed to play still in the white box market through software? How are you planning to participate? And is there a room for you to play and participate in the white box market? So that's number one. The second thing is about the hyperscale LAN opportunity not the WAN opportunity. So far you've been mostly presence – you had presence in the kind of WAN side. And the question is what about the LAN side? Any of your technical progress, any of your new products that address this opportunity better than before? Or what needs to happen for you to participate there? Thanks.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thanks for the questions. So on white box, I believe very strongly that we are innovating in ways that set us up to be very relevant to those that are moving towards white box type solutions. I do also believe that there aren't that many white box type opportunities, especially in the wide area. But to the extent that these become more of a factor, I do think that we are quite frankly leaders in this space. We were the first truly established network technology vendor that disaggregated our operating system. I think many of our customers whether they be telecom operators or cloud providers that are looking at white box are looking to achieve levels of flexibility, new levels of flexibility, programmability and telemetry. And in all of these areas we have disaggregated with a view on solving the specific requirements from our customers. So I don't want to comment about any one customer, but I will say that we're well equipped and well-positioned to participate in the disaggregation capabilities that some of our customers are currently seeking and asking from us. On hyperscale LAN and you're, I'm assuming you're talking about hyperscale datacenter, you're absolutely right that our market share in cloud routing is meaningfully ahead of our market share in cloud, and especially hyperscale cloud switching. We have already made some progress in switching opportunities inside of the hyperscale cloud providers but there is a lot more that we can do. We've learned a significant amount from the introduction of our QFX product line over the last year or two. And now have, yes, a product and solution and technology plan in place across routing, across silicon technology and across optics that I think only increase our ability to penetrate the hyperscale datacenter in the incoming years.
Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. Hey, good afternoon. Yeah, hi, Rami, Ken.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Hello.
Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Hi. My question, I was just reflecting on your prepared comments the – some of the service provider routing opportunities is kind of delayed by some timing. I'm just curious from a customer point of view, when you talk to some of your bigger telco, cable customers, for example, what's holding them back? What's the timing? Is it some architectural transition? Is it 5G? I want to better understand the timing comment on the prepared comments. Thanks.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for the question. I mean, it really is just a matter of projects typically go through their typical cycles where there is a period of time where they are doing the solution development and the design, the engineering, and then there is a period of time where they're deploying. And Q1 at least for a couple of our largest telco customers, ended up being a bit more of a pause for them. So I don't think there's anything sort of macro level beyond the factors that I've already talked about earlier, it's just really a matter of the timing of where they are with these projects. And it's specific to a few customers.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, I would just add. I mean, Q1 is seasonally a weak quarter for us, from a telco perspective. And what, as Rami mentioned, in this particular quarter, we did see some of our larger customers not deploy. And as you know, we have a fairly high customer concentration in the telco and we have a deployment based revenue model. So it does have impacts to our 90 day results more pronounced than other verticals, and that's what happened in this quarter. It's not something that's really macro related. It's really more Juniper specific.
Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Certainly, and a quick follow-up for you Ken is OpEx as a percentage of revenue, I mean obviously lots of things are happening here in the horizon 5G etcetera. How should we think about OpEx as a percentage of revenues in the next few quarters? Thanks.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. So we're going to remain prudent on OpEx. That said, we're also going to make sure we invest in right areas to grow long term revenue growth and expand profits. You can see the guide of OpEx for Q2 is the $490 million level, so down off of Q1 levels. I also mentioned in my commentary that I expect OpEx for the full year to be approximately flat. So we believe a flat OpEx for us would be enough for us to invest in the right areas to make sure we focus on long term growth and long term profit.
Operator: Our next question is from Jim Suva from Citi. Please go ahead. I am sorry, Jim, your line is live. Perhaps you could be on mute by accident. And we'll move on, our next is from Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Balaji Krishnamurthy - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. This is Balaji on behalf of Rod. Two questions, if I could. In the cloud routing opportunities that you're talking about right now, the ASPs are clearly coming down significantly. So what sort of growth are you targeting to be able to offset that? I recognize that it's expected to grow by the end of the year. But do you think that you can get revenues back into the neighborhood of where you were in the last couple of years? And then a follow-on question on service provider, if you could comment specifically on pricing within that vertical that would be helpful? Thank you.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thanks for the questions. So on the cloud transition, as I mentioned, we are on or ahead of where we expect to be right now on that transition. A lot of that transition is behind us. There's still more to go as we go through the rest of this year. The more of the transition is in the rearview mirror, with respect to MX and PTX, the more normalization we'll see in ASP compression, right, because the bulk of the ASP pressure comes from the transition from an MX with a certain price per port down to a PTX with a lower price per port. The math starts to work in our favor next year, assuming nothing is different next year for the kinds of port growth that cloud providers are seeing this year and have seen historically. As you know, many of the cloud providers have reported their numbers. They're not seeing any slowdown in their business. Their need to support their customers, from a service delivery experience, is it remains very important. So I truly do believe that this remains a very important and a growth vertical for us that we'll be very much focused on. Pricing in the service provider space, I don't think there's anything out of the normal. It's honestly business as usual. We talked about some of the macro factors around transition to cloud architectures and consolidation and the customer concentration. But from a pricing dynamics it's business as usual.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: It remains a challenging environment, but really no change from previous quarters.
Operator: Our next question is from Srini Pajjuri from Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. One clarification and one question. First, in your cloud segment, you said it's up 4% sequentially, mostly because of routing. But at the same time you're also saying that PTX is down sequentially. So I'm just trying to reconcile that. Is the growth still coming from MX? And if so, how sustainable that is? And then Rami, you talked a little bit about the enterprise and financial verticals being relatively healthy on the switching side. If you could give us a bit more color as to what's driving that? Is that an upgrade cycle, or is it just the environment being a little bit healthier? Thank you.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, let me start with your question around enterprise, and then I'll ask Ken to comment on your first question. What we saw in enterprise is strength in our federal vertical, financial services. Certain geos as well like Australia was actually a good market for us in the Q1 timeframe. I think we're leading with a software oriented cloud based solution. And that's leading to a good ability for us to position our switching, our routing, and our security. And the fact is, as you saw, the security actually was a good performer for us in the Q1 timeframe. We announced just a few weeks ago, a solution that helps enterprises solve the problem that is top of mind for most CIOs that I talk to, which is the ability to move to a multicloud environment with ease and with peace of mind on security, and that's exactly what Contrail Enterprise Multicloud seeks to solve for our customers. We've also complemented the solutions and the technology with a go to market motion where we are specifically targeting new logos and especially large enterprise logos. And I think all of this effort is coming to bear in some good results that we've seen now over the last couple of quarters. And I expect – I'm quite optimistic about enterprise for the rest of the year as a result.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, and on the first question, so the cloud vertical was up sequentially. PTX was up year-over-year but down sequentially. The difference is the PTX was up within the cloud but it was down with the service provider space. So if you look at PTX, we still sell a fair amount to both service provider and cloud. The cloud vertical was up for PTX sequentially and the service provider vertical was down sequentially for PTX.
Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. I just want to follow-up on the security question firstly. Can you talk a little bit – it seems like you're getting good combination of results of targeting new customers and with your new portfolio. Can you talk a little bit about what (00:42:39) most of those new customers, is it specifically the opportunity or abilities around multicloud, or just elaborate that a little bit? And then my second question is related to M&A. You've mentioned a couple of times that you're looking at places to invest, et cetera. How should we think about (00:43:00) may factor into your investment plans? Thank you very much.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: I appreciate the question. In security, what I liked about our results is that they were fairly broad based in nature across our technologies and our use cases. So we've now refreshed our mid range portfolio and started to see momentum there. We've refreshed our brands portfolio and seeing good momentum there. We also saw good high-end momentum, primarily as a result of cloud customers. We're seeing also a nice diversity of use case between data centers and next generation firewall. And the million dollar plus opportunities that we track are growing nicely. And the last thing, I'd say about security is we're seeing good software attach. The layer four to seven software attach, which we track closely, which is, I think, a good sign of the value that we're offering to our customers is growing now on a year-over-year basis. I do expect based on the pipeline that we're seeing that we should see full year growth for security. On the M&A side, we primarily look for an organic approach to our innovation but at the same time we have good healthy balance sheet. We're generating cash and we would look for opportunities to accelerate our strategy, especially around the cloud, around the enterprise cloud and so on. So there is an opportunity for value enhancing strategy accelerating M&A. We view that as fair game to consider.
Operator: Our next question is from James Fish from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
James E. Fish - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hi, guys. Thanks for the question and good quarter. Just curious as to what you're seeing related to SD-WAN today and how we should think about the impact throughout the year and kind of moving forward. And then secondly just kind of making sure we're dotting our i's and crossing our t's, was there any pull forward of the switching business this quarter?
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Let me address the first question about SD-WAN. So we view the SD-WAN opportunity as a fantastic opportunity. But we actually look at SD-WAN a little bit different than most of our peers out in the industry. We look at SD-WAN as a very important feature or element of a broader solution around cloud CPE, where we're offering not just an easy managed solution for connectivity but also one that offers security embedded and the ability to leverage third-party virtual network function. We are initially targeting our service provider customers as a way of enabling them to go after the SD-WAN market opportunity. That way we get to leverage the great relationships we have with our service providers. We also can leverage their go-to-market muscle that can complement our own in going after the enterprise end users. This year is really around wins and deployments. And we have, I believe, I mentioned in the last earnings call now three major telco wins. And we are in the process of deploying the solutions, so that we can take it to market by the end of the year and start seeing some revenue growth next year. I think it's early days in terms of SD-WAN. I know it gets a lot of press and attention, but it's still in the beginning stages of the total opportunity and we're excited about it. I think we start to see some revenue from it in a meaningful way next year.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. On your second question, we don't believe there's any pull into Q1 from a switching perspective. In fact, I do believe switching will grow sequentially from Q1 levels throughout the year and return to full year growth in the second half of FY 2018. And again it should be a full year growth FY 2018 over FY 2017. So we see the switching momentum only improving throughout the rest of the year.
James E. Fish - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great. Thanks guys.
Operator: Our next question is from Dmitry Netis from William Blair. Please go ahead. I'm sorry. Dmitry, your line is live. Perhaps, you could be muted.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah, I apologize for that. Can you hear me okay now?
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yes.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking this question, Rami and Ken, appreciate it. So a multipart question, if I may, here. First on the sales transition or the Head of Sales transition, can you give us an update where you are on that search and whether or not there's some key sales departures that you've been witnessing in the process or not? That would be sort of one topic I wanted to touch on. Secondly, you mentioned you repatriated $2.5 billion in cash out of the $3.4 billion. So how much cash is still sitting overseas, and whether there was any urgency in this repatriation as you kind of look into the M&A spectrum? Or is this you're just being opportunistic? And then lastly, if I may, kind of beating the dead horse again on price pressure. I know you noted there's no significant change from prior quarter. It's always been tough, et cetera, in the service provider market. But I wanted to ask the question specifically as it relates to CommScope, which reported earlier this morning, and had noted some commodity price increases and specific price pressure from North American carriers across mobility and connectivity businesses, and whether you could see anything incremental from that standpoint as it relates to your business? Thank you.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Hey, thanks Dmitry for the questions. First on your question around Head of Sales, I think we're in the middle of the process right now. There's not much I can really say about it other than the fact that we have a great set of sales executives, fantastic bench strength. Our existing Head of Sales, Vince Molinaro is seeing -- is making sure to see that there is an orderly transition. So I'm quite pleased with the progress that we're making and expect it to be a smooth transition to a new Head of Sales when we identify that individual. And as part of your second question around pricing pressure, stand by what we said already. There is nothing out of the ordinary from a service provider standpoint in terms of the pricing dynamics. In the cloud space, the biggest factor is just the mix as we go from MX to PTX. And that subsides as we go through the rest of the transition that we see ahead for us. But in the ASP space again no new news there.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yes, on the tax question, we did repatriate $2.5 billion in Q1. We still have 35% of our cash offshore, so roughly $1.2 billion is offshore. We expect to repatriate another $500 million or so late this year or early next. From an urgency perspective I wouldn't call it urgent. I think it's just good business practice to bring it back onshore. We did pay the full tax liability for all of our offshore cash in Q4 last year, so from a tax perspective that's behind us on the expense side. And just bringing it onshore just gives us more flexibility, but I wouldn't categorize it as urgent for any sort of pending M&A or anything. It's really just more good hygiene.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great, thank you.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thanks for all your questions. That concludes today's call. Excellent! Thank you.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you.

Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Juniper Networks' Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. An interactive question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jess Lubert. Thank you. You may begin.
Jess Lubert: Thank you, Operator. Good afternoon and welcome to our fourth quarter 2017 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risk factors, including those described in our most recent 10Q and 10-K, the press release and CFO commentary, furnished with our8-K filed day, and in other documents that we filed with the SEC from time to time. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information could be found in the Investor Relations section of our website under financial reports. Revenue guidance is provided using ASC 605. We will adopt ASC 606 for Q1 2018 and intend to provide a ASC 606 to 605 reconciliation when we report first quarter results. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, is included in the press release, furnished with our 8-K filed with the SEC today.  Please keep your questions to one per firm. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami.
Rami Rahim: Thank you, Jess. Good afternoon, everyone. We reported mixed results for the fourth quarter. While revenue and non-GAAP EPS were both above the midpoint of guidance, gross margins remained under pressure and we continued to experience weakness in both routing and in the cloud. This weakness is primarily being driven by the shift to a scale out from scale up architecture, most notably at several of our largest cloud customers, which appear likely to persist through at least the upcoming quarter. This shift is impacting our financial results by creating near term revenue headwind as new architectures take time to roll out and ramp. And margin pressures as we look to disrupt our own business with new lean core technologies that deliver both material efficiencies for our customers and price performance advantages versus competitive platforms. Despite this ongoing headwind in a small number of hyperscalers, we remain confident in our position within the cloud vertical, where we have built substantial footprint with many large cloud providers over the past few years. This has been the result of our innovative products and also our close support of our cloud customers as they’ve grown. As their growth continues, we believe it is clear that their network architectures need to evolve, and we're leading the charge to more automated, cost efficient, scalable networks. What's important is that we're confident in our belief that we continue to maintain our strong footprint as these shifts unfold and seeing solid demand for PT exports, which have already surpassed MX port shipments within the cloud vertical. We continue to challenge the status quo, and while that at times result in short term disruption, similar to what we're currently seeing, we believe this approach will make us more relevant with our most important customer. With network traffic at our cloud customers seeing rapid growth, and many of these customers having already made significant progress in their architectural transition, we believe the headwinds impacting our Q1 outlook, are likely to prove transitory and expect to see sequential growth through the remainder of the year, with a return to year over year growth likely by the end of the year.  We believe our optimism is supported by our deal pipeline, the opportunity our customers see with our new product innovation, and the momentum we're seeing with new accounts across various customer verticals. While much of my commentary has focused on the cloud vertical, it's important to highlight that we continue to gain relevance with our tier one telco and cable customers, and build momentum with strategic enterprise accounts, where we added nearly 3,500 new logos in 2017. Both of these remain important verticals that give me confidence in the long term opportunity and trajectory of the business. Now I'd like to summarize the performance across routing, switching and security in Q4. In routing, our business declined sequentially and year over year. While this weakness was seen across product lines, due in large part to continued deployment delays at our largest cloud customers, new PTS footprint opportunities within the cloud, and continued MX demand in telecom and cable verticals, where service creation remains mission critical, continue to give us confidence in the longer term trajectory of our routing portfolio. In switching, we saw double digit sequential growth in Q4, even though the business declined year over year. Normalized for lumpiness from our large hyperscale customers, our QFX product line continued to grow at double digit rates year over year. That growth is happening across public and private cloud segments, driven in part by 100 gig adoption. In addition, our innovative pipeline remains strong as evidenced by advancements in automation and telemetry, our leadership in network protocols like EVPN, as well as our fusion fabric solution that simplifies data center operations. We remain confident in the competitiveness of our QFX product line across all verticals, including cloud and hyperscalers.  In Security, our business saw both sequential and year over year growth, driven by momentum in financial services, government and telco sales. More customers are recognizing the value of leveraging the entire network for detection and enforcement against cyber threats. We believe our Software-Defined Secure Network solution is gaining traction, and we've added many new customers in Q4 that are leveraging its benefits. Our improvement in Security was broad based across products and geographies, and we continue to see an uptick in million dollar plus deals, which is providing confidence our security business is likely to see a return to growth in 2018. In the quarter, we continued to see momentum with Contrail and had several new customer wins, including tier one carriers in both Europe and Asia, as well as recurring revenues from the renewal of existing annual subscription. We are executing on an extremely compelling product roadmap for Contrail that we expect will result in an expansion of its use cases across a broader set of customers. We are also seeing success with our SD-WAN solution, which has already secured three tier one service provider wins, while the AppFormix customer base has steadily expanded across SaaS, enterprise and telecom operators. AppFormix and Contrail have been integrated for seamless operations management and advanced analytics of Juniper's hardware and software products in several customer use cases. In Services, we saw strong renewal and attach rates of support contracts, resulting in another quarter of year over year growth. We remain committed to all of our strategic verticals, especially the cloud and believe that we are more relevant than ever to our customers and the industry. We’re innovating in ways that truly mattered to all network builders and operators that are embracing cloud architectures to drive greater levels of operating efficiency and service agility. I'm very excited about the opportunity we have in front of us.  In summary, while we're not satisfied with our second half 2017 results, or our outlook for Q1 2018, we're confident that we have the right strategy and solution portfolio needed to win in the market, and drive a return to growth by the end of 2018. Based on this confidence, we have announced a new $2 billion buyback authorization with the intention of initiating a $750 million ASR and an increase in our quarterly dividend by 80% to $0.18 a share. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I specially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for all of our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ken who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail.
Ken Miller: Thank you, Rami and good afternoon everyone. I'd like to start by discussing our fourth quarter performance and results. Our fourth quarter revenue and non-GAAP EPS results were slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. Total fourth quarter revenue was $.239 billion, down 11% year over year and non-GAAP EPS was $0.53. We continue to see architectural shifts in the cloud vertical impact our routing and switching businesses, which both declined year over year. However, Security was up both sequentially and year over year. Our Services business continued to be solid, posting year over year and sequential growth, driven by strong renewal and attach rates. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, five were cloud, four were telecom or cable, and one was a strategic enterprise. Of these customers, two were located outside of the United States.  Product deferred revenue was $334 million, up $11 million or 3% both year over year and sequentially. Product gross margins were below our expectations, primarily due to product mix as we had less routing revenue as a percentage of total revenue for the quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses declined 6% year over year and 1% sequentially, reflecting a lower variable compensation, as well as our continued focus on managing expenses. As a percentage of revenue, fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were 38.6%. In the quarter, we had good cash flow from operations of $214 million. We repurchased $330 million worth of shares and paid $37 million in dividends. Moving on to the results for the full year. Fiscal 2017 saw modest revenue and non-GAAP EPS growth of 1%. Routing declined 7% due to ongoing architectural transitions in the cloud vertical. Our switching business had a record year, up 12% driven by QFX, which grew 25%. While Security declined 8% for the year, we did see sequential growth for the last three quarters and a return to year over year growth in the fourth quarter. Our Services business remained strong, growing 8% for the full year. Looking at revenue from a geographic perspective, the Americas declined 1% and AMEA declined 3% for the year. However, Asia-Pac grew 13% in 2017. For the full year, Strategic Enterprise posted growth of 4%, cloud declined 1% and telecom and cable was flat. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the year, four were cloud, five were telecom or cable, and one was a strategic enterprise. Of these customers, two were located outside of the United States.  Non-GAAP gross margin of 62% declined 120 basis points year over year, primarily due to lower volume, product mix and higher memory costs, partially offset by improvements in our cost structure and service margins. In 2017, we continue to focus on disciplined operating expense management, resulting in a non-GAAP operating expense decline of $17 million or 1%. Non-GAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue was 39.1%. For the year, we had strong cash flows from operations of $1.260 billion, up $153 million from the previous year. We repurchased $720 million worth of shares, and paid $150 million in dividends.  Before we move on to Q&A, I would like to provide some color on our guidance, which you can find detailed in the CFO commentary available on our website. Our Q1 revenue outlook reflects ongoing deployment delays as we expect our large cloud customers to continue the architectural transition. This is expected to result in below normal seasonality for the first quarter. As Rami discussed, this architectural transition is related to the evolution of these customers’ networks to be more automated, cost efficient and scalable. Despite this outlook, we remain confident in our competitive position and strong relationships with these strategic customers. While the timing of the architectural transitions we are experiencing is dynamic and somewhat uncertain, we expect revenue to grow on a sequential basis beyond the first quarter and a return to year on year growth by the end of the year. We expect gross margins for the quarter to remain under pressure due to lower volume and product mix, resulting from our customers architectural shifts. There are many factors that impact gross margins, and while it is a dynamic environment, we expect full year margins to improve directionally from Q1 levels. We are undertaking specific efforts to address the pressure on our gross margins. These efforts included value engineering, optimizing our supply chain, pricing management and increasing software and solutions sales. Despite the reset of variable compensation and typical seasonal increase of fringe costs, we expect to manage our operating expenses prudently and to increase operational efficiencies, both in the first quarter and throughout the year. For 2018, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate on worldwide earnings to be approximately 21%. The reduction in the projected tax rate is primarily driven by the change in US corporate income tax rate under the US Tax Cut and Jobs Act, partially offset by the net increase in the current tax of certain foreign earnings mandated by the act. Following the adoption of the US Tax Cut and Jobs Act, we plan to repatriate approximately $3 billion. We expect the new territory tax system to provide us lower cost access to nearly all of our global free cash flow on an ongoing basis. We intend to use the repatriated cash to invest in the business, support value enhancing M&A and fund our return of capital to shareholders. I'm pleased to report our board of directors have approved a new $2 billion buyback authorization, including our intent to enter into a $750 million accelerated share repurchase agreement. In addition, they declared an increase of our quarterly cash dividend to $0.18 per share, to be paid this quarter to stockholders of record. This reflects an increase of 80% compared to previous quarterly dividends. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper. Now I'd like to open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator instructions]. And our first question comes from Tal Liani from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Tal Liani:  Hi guys. Last quarter you had an issue also with some cloud customers. 0What I'm trying to understand this quarter is, when it comes to your guidance, can you distinguish between what could be perceived as share loss, maybe architectural decisions of customers that are not - at least not for now doesn't fit your portfolio and between just spending issues, because in your commentary you spoke mostly about spending rather than your own kind of situation within customers. Thanks. 
Rami Rahim: Hey Tal, it’s Rami. Let me start. So the message that we delivered in the last quarter's earnings call, which was very much around confidence that we're both in the starting and ending phase of this - our architectural transition that we're going to - that we're seeing with our cloud customers, remains absolutely consistent here and now. So we fundamentally believe, based on the customer conversations that we're having, the work that we're doing on certifying certain products, the software that we're developing that has certain capabilities and features that are very much desired by our cloud customers, including the largest hyperscale customers, all lead us to have confidence that we will benefit from the recovery.  So while it doesn't feel great to be right now in this situation where we're in the middle of this transition, I do firmly believe that we will benefit from the resumption in spending by cloud providers in a new architectural approach that is very different than the starting approach, one that is characterized with scale outs, one that leverages a new product, which is the PTX. Very fortunate and happy that we have technology like the PTX that can capture this transition and ensure that we maintain and even expand our footprint. So the net of it, Tal, is that I remain very confident that we will benefit from the resumption in spending and that this is not about a loss of share or footprint to the competition. 
Tal Liani: If I can ask one more question, just shifting gear to the MX. You speak about the PTX. In the past, the MX was very strong. Are you talking less about the MX now because of risk of competition with Arista? Or is it more about carrier spending, characteristics of carrier spending?
Rami Rahim: Yes. The MX is probably one of, if not the most successful routing platforms that’s ever seen in the market across cloud, enterprise, telecom operators. It’s just in a different phase of its life cycle than the PTX. The PTX is a newer product. I think many of our customers across verticals, but especially in the cloud vertical, see the benefits of having what we have described as a super core or a lean core architecture that enables them to deal with the incredible growth of traffic in their networks at a very cost optimized form factor and price point. And for that reason, we have seen a transition and will continue to see a transition with cloud providers from MX ports to PTX ports. That does have deflationary pressure on a pricing standpoint on per port basis. But the good news is, if you look at the cloud provider businesses that they have, if you look at the growth in the traffic that they are seeing, eventually I believe this pays off for us because we maintain the footprint and can capture that growth, albeit with a different product, which is the PTX.  The MX in other verticals, so take telcos and enterprises for that matter, I think that transition to a PTX Is it's not going to happen anytime soon. It’s going to be limited to a relatively small number of use cases, because typically where the MX is used in a telco scenario or an enterprise scenario, you're leveraging far more than IP packet transport. You’re looking using its service delivery capabilities that just don't lend themselves to a migration to lean core architecture as easily. So most of that transition is going to happen in the cloud space, and a lot of that transition, as I mentioned in my starting commentary, is behind us already. 
Tal Liani: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Please go ahead. 
Simon Leopold: Thank you very much. Just one quick clarification before I ask my question. You’ve guided the share count for March to 360 million shares. What assumption are you making in that number for the buyback? Is that the full $750 million accelerated that you're assuming? I just want to make sure I understand that.
Ken Miller: Yes. This is Ken. So there are really two factors. One is we did just come off of a Q4 where we did $330 million of share repurchases. So we were opportunistic in Q4. So we’re actually ending the year with less shares than we anticipated just 90 days ago. And second - the second factor is the one you mentioned is the ASR. So we're factoring in the impact to the ASR. You don't get full retirement immediately, but you get the majority of that impact in Q1.
Simon Leopold: So we should think about that even without assuming anything beyond that, the share count should be lower also in the June quarter than when you get the full impact, correct?
Ken Miller: Yes. Majority will happen in Q1. There’ll be a follow up impact in Q2 and it will stay throughout the rest of the year at those lower levels.
Simon Leopold: Great. Thanks. So the question I want to ask is I know a difficult one to answer, but it's pretty key for I think folks to be able understand this transition product cycle around PTX adoption versus MX. And so you have I guess some substitution in your cloud vertical. We’re often asked, what's the price difference between a PTX and an MX? And so we know the purport pricing is lower. You just mentioned that, Rami. Can you help explain this and how people should think about modeling when you've got this kind of product transition where there is ASP pressure, but probably some change in the number of ports that would be shipping in this transition. Thank you. 
Rami Rahim: Yes. I appreciate the question, Simon and it is a difficult one to answer. So I’m - honestly I'm not going to answer it. I will say the following, which is that there is a meaningful price difference between the PTX and the MX. And you have to think of this from the standpoint of, we've been talking about the fact that routing and switching are essentially kind of blending over time. And the PTX is a perfect example of that manifesting itself in a new product. So there is a meaningful price difference, but where it's used, typically it's used in areas where there is tremendous scale, and massive increase in traffic. And that's what we're seeing in the cloud provider space. So I can tell you that although overall revenue in the cloud providers is going to be under pressure as we go through the transition, we are going to be selling substantially more ports, albeit PTX ports, in some cases QFX ports, than we did with the MX product historically.
Simon Leopold: Great. Thank you very much. 
Operator: Our next question is from Jeff Kvaal from Instinet. Please go ahead. 
Jeffrey Kvaal: Yes, thank you very much and Jess, welcome to the battle. I guess two questions if I may. One, Ken for you. I think, could we delve into the gross margin issue a little bit? To sharpen the question a little bit. In the - in early 2016, you were delivering not that different revenue, $1.1 billion or so and yet the gross margins were going to be 600 basis points higher then than they look likely to be this year, two years later. So that's a big shift and I’m wondering if you could help us unpack that. And then for Rami, you mentioned M&A and obviously that was a little bit of a topic, both on what you may be interested in purchasing. And also of course there is a whole slew of Nokia discussions in December. So any comments that you have related to M&A would be helpful. Thank you. 
Ken Miller: Sure. So I’ll take the gross margin question first. So there are many factors that impact gross margin as you know. And as it relates to the guidance of 58% plus or minus one, the Q1 guidance, really I think the easiest way to explain it would be to kind of bridge it from the Q4 levels. So think to 63.5%, 62% kind of level. Really there are three primary drivers in the decline, all of which are putting pressure on the margin itself. The first one is lower volume. So the revenue guide is a couple of hundred million less than the Q4 level. So that does have an impact on gross margin when you do that bridge. It’s just a factor of fixed cost as a percentage of total revenue.  The second factor is really the continuing product technology mix. So we've been talking about technology mix for a while. Think routing to switching. As routing is actually taking a bigger burden of the revenue decline, as a percentage of our total revenue, routing is down and that's also having a headwind to margin. And last but not least would be actually product mix within routing. So we talked a lot about the architectural shifts and a lot of that is MX to PTX from a scale up to scale out architecture. While the PTX margins are very healthy and actually above the corporate average, they are below our MX margin. So I do think that's another contributing factor into our margin guide. As Rami mentioned, it’s important to note that some of that is behind us. 50% of our PTX exports are actually substantially more than 50% of our PTX ports that we shipped in ‘17 to the cloud vertical, or PTX ports I should say. So that's a good story. We do expect margin to directionally be up. We think the full year levels will be up off of these Q1 - of this Q1 guide.
Rami Rahim: Jeff, let me answer your first question or your second question around M&A. first, let me say that the fact that we've put in place what we view as a good capital allocation policy and strategy now, it should be a sign that we have confidence that some of the challenges that we're going through right now in terms of this architectural transition, are in fact transitory. Having said that, I think we have a healthy balance sheet, especially now with repatriation of foreign cash. And I have been consistent in saying that we will continue to look for value enhancing M&A, and it would be very much in areas that would accelerate our existing strategy.  I don't believe that we need a new strategy. We’ve developed a strategy that very much respects the major trend that's happening in our industry, which is around the cloud. This is not just about serving the cloud providers, but helping our telco customers and the enterprise customers in moving to a multi cloud environment, with easy management automation and security. So these are sort of the areas that we would look for to accelerate the - our execution with value enhancing M&A that we're already working on today. Thank you.
Jess Lubert: Next question?
Operator: Our next question is from Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer & Company. Please go ahead.
Ittai Kidron: Thanks. I wanted to dig in again into the gross margin. Maybe you can give us some color on the impact of volume on margins. How much of the fact that you missed the - that you're missing the cloud volume is impacting pricing of other products? Meaning, are you now at a point where volumes that you are purchasing from suppliers are below levels such that pricing of the components that you buy is rising?
Ken Miller: Yes. So I mean volume as it relates to our fixed cost versus variable cost, is a big factor. I listed as the first primary factor, but it's really not impacting our purchasing power and our contract manufacturers. We have longer term contracts with our contract manufacturer providers and it doesn't have a quarter to quarter impact based on volume. So when I mention volume here, I'm really alluding to our actual standard margin is higher than our average gross margin because of some of the fixed cost components that get included into the gross margin math.
Ittai Kidron: Okay. And then second, just follow up on the tax rate, the 21%. I would have hoped it would be lower. I guess I'm trying to understand why not just by blending your - the mix of your operating profits international versus US, you won’t get to a lower rate. Can it go lower from here or this is the level set following the tax rule?
Ken Miller: Yes. So this is a level we're going to - we expect given the new tax rule. The big difference with just simply the blended approach that you mentioned, is we’re actually going to have a US tax on international earnings of roughly 10% in the new tax reform rules. So I think that's probably the piece you’re missing. So that results in the 21% expectation for this year.
Ittai Kidron: Very good. Good luck.
Operator: Our next question is from Tim Long from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Tim Long: Thank you guys. Two questions if I could. Can we talk a little bit about the switching here and the transitions going on there? Maybe just give us a little color on the move to 100G and maybe a little update on how you’re doing on core as opposed to the edge market. And then separately, on the telco vertical, just the traditional telcos, it sounds like that was pretty decent in the quarter. Rami, could you just talk a little bit about what you're expecting from that vertical as operators start to set their budgets for 2018? Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Certainly, Tim. So I’ll start with switching. So our switching business first has two components to it. There’s the campus business and the data center business, the first being the EX product line, the second the QFX. We’ve said now that QFX have exceeded the EX. So data center dominates the use case that we are pursuing and where the business momentum is. We’re very pleased with our all up switching business growth last year, and in particular the QFX which grew 25% year over year.  And if you break apart the QFX business, it has a broad based component that feeds its way into large enterprises, telcos, data centers and smaller type cloud providers. That has consistently had solid momentum throughout last year, and I expect it to have that momentum through 2018 as well, growing at essentially double digit year over year growth on a consistent, quarterly basis. Then there is a much more concentrated hyperscaler component to our QFX business, and that's going to very much follow these transitions from 40 to 100 gig that we've talked about over the last couple of quarters. So there is going to be some cyclicality to the QFX data center business as we work through these transitions. And I do think that there is an opportunity for us to break into more hyperscale switching opportunities throughout the year. I mean that is a big area of focus for us.  On the telco side, it's really more of the same in terms of market dynamics. I think our telco customers continue to run their networks harder and are getting more comfortable with that. They themselves are moving towards cloud oriented service delivery models, and we leverage that with products like Contrail, our switching portfolio and our virtual network functions. There is - there are some headwinds due to M&A consolidation that's happening in the telco space. So we're not expecting any breakthrough growth from telco anytime in the near future at this point. Looking out a little bit further as you get into 5G, as you get into the build up necessary to support 5G traffic, especially in the metro, I do view that as an opportunity. But we have to sort of temper our expectations because I do think that this market is going to be somewhat challenging, at least for the foreseeable future. 
Tim Long: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Paul Silverstein from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
Paul Silverstein: Appreciate it. A couple of questions if I might. First off, if you said earlier, my apologies, but Rami, can any share losses whatsoever beyond your potential transition that you all cited?
Rami Rahim: Sorry. Are there any share losses whatsoever? Let me say this. I know this is sort of top of mind for all of you guys, but I was - I am very confident that where we have the major footprint across our large customers, especially in the cloud space, I feel like we have the right customers around the technology and understanding what's required to maintain that footprint, and to continue to grow in that footprint. And not only that, to actually expand into new opportunities. So it's not just a game of defense where we’re trying to hold on to what we have and leverage the growth in those areas, but we are very much playing offence and trying to steal footprint away from the competition. That’s the way I view the competitive landscape today. Since joining Juniper now over 20 years ago, I can tell you that the one constant element to that period of time has been it's a very competitive landscape across all of our vertical market segments. And we're comfortable operating in a very competitive landscape.
Paul Silverstein: Rami, appreciate that. Just to be clear, relative to the architectural transition that you're citing in terms of the near term weakness, you don't believe that you all had any meaningful share losses at those several hyperscale customers, the several cloud customers.
Rami Rahim: Yes. I agree with what you just said. We do not believe so.
Paul Silverstein: All right. Two quick questions if I might. You cited an increase, I believe you said on a normalized basis, excluding the cloud architectural transition for PTX. I’m just a little bit confused. I would think - it sounds like PTX, or at least I thought that PTX wasn't impacted, is actually going to benefit from the architectural transition, but on the comm as those folks displace MX with PTX. So why was PTX an issue in terms of you're citing it on a normalized basis, with the implication being that it's declined year over year not normalized in terms of full impact. And then Ken, a question for you in OpEx. I think I heard you say you’ll manage OpEx prudently or efficiently throughout the year. Can you translate that for us in terms of your expectations for the year? Do we expect OpEx to be flat, to be down, to be up modestly? Any insight you can provide will be appreciated. Appreciate it guys.
Rami Rahim: Paul, let me start with the PTX question and then Ken, you can jump in on the OpEx question. So I'm not concerned at all about the performance of the PTX in 2017 and going into 2018. There will be lumpiness to the PTX that are very much tied to large scale deployments in the cloud provider space especially. But all up, I mean Q3 was a record quarter for the PTX. Looking at the opportunities that we're working on with the large hyperscalers, as well as some telcos, there is an opportunity to see meaningful growth in the PTX this year relative to last year. So I'm much less concerned about what this is going to do on a quarter over quarter basis, and much more looking at the opportunities of where - that we've won already and the build outs that are already in progress. Ken?
Ken Miller: Yes. From an OpEx perspective, first of all, I want to note, we are pleased with our Q4 results. I mean, we did come in below the low end of our guidance range, primarily due to our headcount related costs, as well as some lower variable compensation. As we look ahead, we're not going to provide full year guidance. We did provide Q1 guidance of 45, plus or minus five, which is even with the fringe reset, as well as the variable comp reset. I think that shows you that we are very focused on OpEx discipline and will remain disciplined. We are - over the long term, we’re looking to expand operating margins. In a down revenue environment, I would say that we will also manage OpEx down. We’re not going to be able to perhaps match it one for one, but we are going to be very focused on OpEx as we move throughout the year and we see the revenue start to hit the quarters.
Operator: Our next question is from Steve Milunovic from UBS. Please go ahead. 
Steve Milunovic: Thanks. Rami, did the timing of this architectural shift change in the last quarter? I think last quarter you were talking about the switching side coming back relatively quickly, and you did see sequential growth. But I don't know if it's coming back as quickly as you expected, and similarly if the routing is now extending out weaker, deeper into the year than you previously thought. 
Rami Rahim: Yes, it's a good question, Steve. I don't think that it's playing out exactly as we had expected. I think that when you're trying to do forecasting in - on a set of products that have a very high degree of customer concentration, you only need to sort of get it wrong for a couple of customers to get the overall forecast wrong or the timing wrong. So generally speaking, based on our Q1 outlook, it's fair to say that the transition has taken a little bit longer than what we initially expected. Having said that, we're no longer sort of at the beginning of the transition, looking out and trying to predict it in that way. We’re sort of in the middle of it, and you can see that just from the port mix that we're now selling into the large cloud providers today, where the PTX has already exceeded pretty substantially the MX ports that we're selling into that market segment.
Ken Miller: Yes, I would just add, I mean I do think we expect switching to be a growth driver for us. We expect switching to return to growth in the second half and actually be full year growth for FY’18. We’re also very pleased with the momentum we’re seeing in security. We had our first year on year growth quarter in a while and we expect that FY’18 to be a year of security growth for us on a full year basis. But routing, given the transition and the difficulty in coming - understanding, when does it come back and when it’s going to come back in enough volume to offset some of the headwinds, I think it's reasonable to expect routing to be down on a full year basis in FY’18.
Steve Milunovic: The growth in Asia Pacific, was that new insertions and do you expect growth to continue?
Rami Rahim: I'm super proud of our APAC team for the momentum that they've demonstrated over the last couple of years in what is a very competitive landscape. And I do think that there are opportunities to continue the momentum into 2018, yes. We’ve been talking now for the last year about strategic insertions and particular in China. And our expectation is that those will start to pay off at some point this year.
Steve Milunovic: Thanks. 
Operator: Our next question is from Patrick Newton from Stifel. Please go ahead.
Patrick Newton: Good afternoon, Rami and Ken. I guess I'm trying to piece together your goal of returning year over year growth exiting the year and weighed against security growing year over year, switching growing year over year and then routing not growing. So is it right to think that return of end of year growth is really the 4Q timeframe and also the 3Q year over year growth are very small? And once this transitory architecture headwind is complete, it sounds like even with your routing outlook, that we should expect only tepid year over year growth in 4Q. Just want to make sure I'm kind of piecing together all the parts correctly.
Rami Rahim: Yes. No, I would look at it as when we talk about sequential growth and then returning to year on year growth by the end of the year, I would think Q4 is right timeframe and that's all up. That’s an all up comment, not necessarily particular to any technology. We do think the routing transition, although we're - I would phrase, we're in the middle of it, there's still a fair amount of disruption that's going to cause the FY’18 number from a routing perspective as we continue to finish up the transition and hopefully set us up for growth beyond this year. But I think this year routing, we expect to be down given this current visibility we have and our expectations of the timing of the transition.
Patrick Newton: All right. and then taking that answer and starting out with your 40, or 58% gross margin and margin marching up sequentially through the year, is it fair to assume that given the impact of greater PTX and switch mix, that gross margin in 4Q’18 would still likely be below your 4Q ‘17 levels?
Rami Rahim:  Yes. Again, not going to get that specific out for quarters. I'm really focused on making sure we get our more visible quarters predicted correctly. I will say this. I do think that we expect revenue to grow. Therefore, I think it's a reasonable assumption that we’re making that the margin should also grow directionally. I want to make sure that there is going to be deal mix and customer mix. It’s difficult to predict when you get out to any particular quarter, but we do believe margin should recover from the Q1 levels by the time we exit the year.
Patrick Newton: Thank you for taking my questions. Good luck.
Operator: Our next question is from Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Vijay Bhagavath: Yes, thanks. Good afternoon, Rami, Ken. My question is really around competition in routing as we head into 100 gig and perhaps 400 gig routing from suppliers such as Arista in particular. How do you compete in a situation where your competition would use high density 100 gig, 400 gig platforms with the competition being feature performance, perhaps pricing? So help us understand the competitive strategy in routing as new entrants come into that marketplace? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Yes. Thanks for the question. Again, I'll just reiterate that routing has always been an incredibly competitive market. And we recognized several years ago that in order to continue to compete effectively in the routing space, we're going to need to have a new breed of routing platform. And that's when we conceived of this idea of a lean core architecture, which is defined by this product that we call the PTX. It's a good thing we did that because I think our situation today would be very different if we did not have that product and the ability to transition what is the most demanding customer, our cloud customers toward these new lean core architectures. That said, so I think that the concept was right. The execution was right on.  Now, all we need to do is to ensure that we maintain the competitive differentiation on an ongoing basis. And we will do that with the roadmap that we have in terms of software technologies that give our customers the ability to obtain telemetry and information from these systems, which is extremely important to the cloud in particular, to enable logical scale that is best in class across the industry today. And our goal is to ensure that that is - it stays that way in the future and increasingly with optics. I think that the investments that we're making in the optical space is essentially a way for us to compete on the economics of networking beyond just the IP based routing, but the integrated optical technology that I think is becoming more and more important to our customers. So all this is to say that I'm very confident that we have the right investments in place and the innovation to deal with a very competitive environment in routing.
Operator: Our next question from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Two real quick ones if I can. Just going back to the guidance and the ability to kind of grow - return to growth exiting the calendar year, aside from kind of port shipment transitions or inflections within your large cloud customers, I'm curious, are you assuming in that scenario that some of your cloud customers reach the inflection from a revenue standpoint in terms of the MX to PTX router transition? And then I have a quick follow up. 
Ken Miller: Yes. So I just want to clarify. The sequential growth that we are expecting and the return to year on year growth is not a particular customer set or a particular technology. It’s really more of a Juniper overall revenue. We do have a broadening base in our switching business that Rami mentioned where we're seeing a lot of very consistent growth, double digit growth. In fact, if you normalize for the hyperscalers within the QFX, we believe security can continue to grow consistently going forward. We’re still in a bit of a turnaround there, but we're seeing signs of growth there and expect growth throughout FY’18. So the comment I'm making is not particular to this transition. It’s more broader - it's broader than that.
Aaron Rakers: Okay, fair enough. And then just on the gross margin line again, looking at the guidance of 58% plus or minus in the quarter, it looks like you're guiding more or less product gross margin to be in that mid 50% range. First of all, am I correct in that assumption? And second to that, do you believe that as you kind of transition that gross margin on a product side, can they get back to a 60% plus level? Thank you. 
Ken Miller: Yes. So we don't all break it out for you, but I will say that it's - the service business does carry a fair amount of people costs and the reset of variable cost and fringe will have an impact on our service margin as well. Again, not going to give you the specifics, but I do think there's going to be a bit of a decline in both for Q1 off of Q4 levels. Back to the longer term margin, there's a lot of factors. I think we talked a little bit about what we're doing internally. There’s a big focus internally on innovation and making sure we do the value engineering work. We need to be cost competitive.  Optimizing the supply chain is something we continue to focus on. Pricing discipline is - I know the field is growing at a new pricing discipline and I think it’s going to pay off for us in the long run, as well as just increasing our software and solutions sales. There’s a lot of efforts underway to return the margin to growth. I also think probably the biggest single factor is going to be getting through this transition. Although the margin impact is largely being felt as now and this quarter and perhaps over the short term here, as we get through this transition, I think that will give us the opportunity to grow margin beyond these current levels.
Operator: Our next question is from Jim Suva from Citi. Please go ahead. Jim, you're on. Perhaps you’ll be on mute by accident. And we’ll move on to the next question from Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Mitch Steves: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. I know you guys can't provide the exact number, but just to get our handle around kind of full year revenue. So for the entire company, routing is going to be down just given the material miss for the first quarter. Is it fair to assume the entire company revenue should be down on a year over year basis for ’18?
Ken Miller: Yes. I think our expectation is to grow sequentially and return to growth late in the year. I believe it's reasonable to model that it could be a down year in full year revenue basis, based on what we see now, predominantly because of the routing shortfall.
Operator: Our next question is from Mark Moskowitz from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Mark Moskowitz: Thanks. Good afternoon. A question and then a clarification. On the clarification, when you talk about the return to year over year revenue growth ending ’18, is that predicated more on new logo penetration versus a recovery in your existing logos? And then Rami for you, on the cloud re-architecting here, that transition, when the transition is over, is there any risk that you could actually see less content sold into each environment or provider because of their efficiencies that they're trying to achieve?
Ken Miller: Okay. So let me answer the second one first, on the cloud transition. This kind of pricing inflection point that is happening from the MX to the PTX, is not one that I expect to happen again anytime in sort of the foreseeable future in a cloud or anywhere else. I do think that what we're seeing now is somewhat unique just by virtue of the fact that there is truly this architectural shift that's enabled by a new breed of routing platform that blends the line with switching, and that just doesn't happen all that often. So I think once we get through it, assuming that the cloud providers, especially the large hyperscalers, will need to continue to deal with growth in their businesses, which I would bet is the case for years to come, then we will benefit for that exiting 2018.
Rami Rahim: Yes. From a customer perspective, I mean the answer is both. I mean we focus on growing our current customers, both as they grow, as well as getting new footprint into existing customers. And clearly we have a big focus on new logos as well, expanding our customer base, particularly in the enterprise, in some of those verticals where we have opportunity to expand further. 
Operator: Our next question is from Jim Suva from Citi. please go ahead.
Jim Suva: Thanks very much. Hopefully this is better. I believe back in 2017 in the early part of the year, the cloud was a big beneficiary to you if my memory is correct. And then the second half unfolded and became a bigger headwind, preannouncements lowering, and now you're talking about visibility as people transition through this architecture. So I want to kind of take a look back and see, did you see this second half headwind coming? And if so, not so great. If not, just let us know. But also, what type of confidence do you have that this transition will come to pass where you're going to come out of this okay? Because it seems like the second half of the year was much worse than expected. 
Ken Miller: Yes. Hi Jim. It’s a good question. I think that it's true. We have been benefiting from Cloud growth now for several years, right not just in the first part of 2017, but even for a few years behind that. As a result of that strength, we saw our market share in core routing, and particular North America, start to grow meaningfully over that time period. What we're doing now, I know it sort of feels painful and it's not the most fun thing to do from a quarterly results standpoint, but it is absolutely the right thing to do. We’re essentially making sure that we disrupt ourselves and maintain the footprint that we have built to date so that we can benefit from the next wave of spending by the cloud providers. I mean that's what it really comes down to.  As far as our ability to see it, we certainly saw it at a macro level because we build products for it, right? But did we predict the timing and the magnitude of the disruption in the transition? I’d say no, I don't think we predicted either of those things as well as I would have liked. But I think the most important thing is, I have the confidence that we will benefit from maintaining the footprint that we have as we get back into growth. And there is absolutely this goal that I mentioned earlier to expand into new opportunities and new footprints among the cloud providers, in particular in the data center.
Rami Rahim: Operator, we’ll take two more questions.
Operator: And our next question is James Kisner from Loop Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
James Kisner: Thank you. So just digging into one of your customer segments, strategic enterprise, I mean obviously that's pretty strong result here and acceleration. Were there any large deals that helped there? I’m just kind of wondering if that - we should expect that elevated growth rate in that segment to continue? Thanks>
Rami Rahim: Yes. So I'm actually very pleased with the momentum that we've built in the enterprise space. In Q4, we saw in double digit year over year growth and sequential growth. There’s been a concerted effort to really go after new logos. We added 3,500 new enterprise logo in the 2017 timeframe, and I believe that will continue. It’s not - there is a little bit of customer concentration, but for the most part, it's broad based. And we're definitely innovating in a way that makes us more relevant to the enterprise, with the goal of diversifying our business more in the enterprise space.  And just to give you an example of that. Contrail, which has been the SDN controller that we've developed initially primarily for large cloud and telco customers, is now essentially being repackaged in a way that solves some very meaningful enterprise problems, in particular multi cloud management and multi cloud security. The feedback that we've gotten thus far on this product direction has been phenomenal and we see some real opportunities to maintain, if not increase the momentum in the enterprise space with these technologies. 
Operator: And our final question comes from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. 
James Faucette: Great. Thanks. I just had a couple of questions. First, Ken, I recognize the difficulty in trying to forecast margins a year out, but can you help us think about like what the puts and takes would be that would allow you, not only to return to revenue growth year over year by the fourth quarter, but potentially even be flat or maybe up a little bit from an earnings perspective? And then maybe more broadly for you both Rami and Ken is that, you talk about that you want to be seen as, and you feel like you want to be aggressive in new opportunities, but right now you're continuing to manage OpEx and it’s continuing to decline as your revenues are pressured. But all of your competitors around you are increasing their R&D to attack a lot of the same opportunities you're eyeing. So at what point, either from a time perspective or a revenue recovery perspective, should we expect you to start to match some of your competitors in terms of increasing your investment in R&D, et cetera? Thanks a lot. 
Rami Rahim: Hey James. Let me start with the question around investments, and then Ken, I’ll let you address the first question. I'm an R&D guy. So I spent many years here developing the technologies, many of which are in the market today. So I have a good feel for this and I think that we have the right investments in the right areas. The key is focus. The key is ensuring that we remain incredibly focused, in particular on the cloud opportunity. And we're developing the technologies that make us even more relevant toward that opportunity across all of our key market segments. R&D investment as a percentage of revenue for us is actually quite healthy, if you compare us to our peers. So the net of it is I'm not concerned about our ability to invest in the areas in a very focused manner to maintain our competitive differentiation across all of our technologies/
Ken Miller: Yes. And from an earnings perspective, clearly our goal is to grow earnings over the long term. Given the kind of color that we provided on both revenue and gross margin, as well as OpEx for the year, I think it is reasonable to presume that EPS will be down on a full year basis, unless we see a stronger recovery of the revenue than we currently are projecting our models. From a - does it get to positive in Q4? I think that's clearly - it's too early to call at this point. Clearly our goal is to get to earnings growth sooner rather than later.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the question and answer session. I’d like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing comments.
Rami Rahim: Thank you, everyone for your questions. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you again. Have a nice day.

Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Juniper Networks' Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. An interactive question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Kathleen Nemeth. Thank you. You may begin.
Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Operator. Good afternoon and welcome to our third quarter 2017 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call contains certain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning Juniper's business, economic and market outlook, strategy, future financial results, capital return program and overall future prospects. Actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information that could cause the actual results to materially differ are listed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release and CFO Commentary furnished with our 8-K filed today, and in other documents that we file with the SEC from time to time. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update information presented on this call if facts or circumstances change after the date of the call. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website under Financial Reports. Commentary on why we consider non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results is included in the press release furnished with our 8-K filed with the SEC today. Please keep your questions to one per firm. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Kathleen. Good afternoon, everyone. The results we announced today were not the results we set out to achieve for the second half of this year, so let me address that first and foremost. Juniper has always excelled at building the largest, most demanding network in the world. This is both the result of our deliberate strategy and a reflection of where our strength lies. Over the last several years, some of the most mission-critical networks in the world have been built by Cloud providers. I'm very proud of how we have successfully pivoted our strategy to capture that tremendous opportunity and execute it against our innovation road map to grow our relevance and our business in the Cloud vertical. At the same time, having such large and agile customers can lead to significant lumpiness in our business, which we saw in Q3 and expect to continue into Q4. Let me provide some insight on our current work with these large Cloud providers. First, as you know, we have built substantial footprint with these companies over the past few years. This has been the result of our innovative products and also our close surround and support of these customers as they've grown. As their growth continues, it is clear that their architectures need to evolve, and we are leading the charge to more modern, cost-efficient, scalable networks. In Q3 and Q4, we are seeing a spending delay as our largest customers prepare to go through this architectural shift. This is not uncommon in our industry, and Juniper has benefited before in leading architectural shift such as with the Converged Supercore and data center fabrics. What's most important is that we are maintaining our strong footprint as these shifts unfold. We continue to challenge the status quo, and that approach is only making us more relevant with our most important customers, even if it sometimes has a short-term disruptive impact. While we're disappointed with our revenue and earnings performance in Q3, we're confident that we've made significant progress in establishing a strong footprint developing the right products and executing on an innovative product pipeline. Now I'd like to summarize the performance across Switching, Routing and Security. In Switching, we're disappointed with our overall revenue decline in Q3. Normalized for lumpiness from our large hyper-scale customers due to the spending delay I mentioned, our QFX product line continued to grow at double-digit rates, both sequentially and year-over-year. It continues to grow across public and private Cloud segments driven by 100-gig adoption, our innovation and automation in telemetry, our leadership in network protocols like EVPN, as well as our Fusion fabric solution that simplifies data center operation. We remain confident in the competitiveness of our QFX product line across all verticals, including Cloud and hyper-scalers. In Routing, our business grew sequentially and declined year-over-year in a dynamic environment. Our PTX product line continued to gain traction, and in fact, achieved a record revenue quarter in Q3 as our customers have embraced its unique attributes for core build-out. The success of the PTX product line is evident in the most recent IHS Markit share report that for the first time ever showed Juniper in first place position in North America core Routing market share over the last 12 months. Additionally, we saw Routing growth in APAC, both sequentially and year over year. In Security, our business grew sequentially driven by momentum in the data center, service provider and next-gen firewall sales. We believe more customers are recognizing the value of leveraging the entire network for detection and enforcement against cyber threats. Our Software-Defined Secure Network solution is gaining traction, and we've added many new customers in Q3 that are leveraging its benefits. During the quarter, we also closed the acquisition of Cyphort, a leader in automated malware analysis and detection. In the quarter, we continued to see momentum with Contrail and had several new customer wins, including Strategic Enterprise customers in APAC and a Canadian service provider, as well as recurring revenues from renewal of existing annual subscription. We also unveiled Contrail Security, an important addition to Juniper's Security portfolio. We believe we are executing on an extremely compelling product road map for Contrail that should result in an expansion of its used cases across a broader set of customers. Additionally, AppFormix's customer base has steadily expanded across SaaS, enterprises, and telecom operators. AppFormix and Contrail have been integrated for seamless operations management and advanced analytics of Juniper's hardware and software products in several customer use cases. In Services, we saw strong renewal and attach rates of support contracts and an increase in demand for professional services resulting in year-over-year growth. We remain committed to all of our strategic verticals, especially the Cloud and believe that we are more relevant than ever to our customers and the industry. We are innovating in ways that truly matter to all network builders and operators that are embracing Cloud architectures to drive greater levels of operating efficiency and service agility. I'm also delighted to have on board our new CTO, Bikash Koley, who has firsthand knowledge and experience in building and operating large-scale Cloud networks and is now helping us further refine our strategy and sharpen our execution across our entire innovation pipeline. I'm very excited about the opportunity we have in front of us. In summary, while we're not satisfied with our second half expected performance, we are confident that we have the right strategy and the right products and solutions portfolio. I'd like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which is essential to creating value for all of our stakeholders. I will now turn over the call to Ken, who will discuss quarterly financial results in more detail.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. The financial results for the September quarter were disappointing, with revenue and non-GAAP EPS falling below our expectations. The lower than expected revenue result was primarily due to the timing of certain large switching deployments within the Cloud vertical related to architectural shifts. Total revenue for the third quarter was $1.258 billion, down 4% sequentially and 2% year-over-year. Our technologies posted mixed results for the quarter. Routing grew sequentially, but declined year-over-year due to Telecom and Cable deployments. Switching declined both year-over-year and sequentially, primarily due to the delay of certain large Cloud customer deployments. And Security grew sequentially for the second consecutive quarter. Service revenue continued to be solid, growing 9% year-over-year. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, five were Cloud, four were Telecom or Cable, and one was a Strategic Enterprise. Of these customers, one was located outside of the United States. Product deferred revenue was $324 million, up $26 million or 9% year-over-year and sequentially. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62% for the quarter, in line with our expectations. Non-GAAP operating expenses declined 2% year-over-year and sequentially and were 38.5% of revenue. This reflects our continued focus on managing expenses through increased efficiencies and a focus on operational excellence. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.55, down $0.02 quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to the lower revenue, partially offset by lower operating and other expenses. Cash flow from operations were $202 million for the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to slightly more than $1 billion. We continued to return capital to shareholders. And during the third quarter, we repurchased $140 million of shares and paid $38 million in dividends. Before we move on to Q&A, I would like to provide some color on our guidance, which you can find detailed in the CFO Commentary available on our website. As we have discussed in the past, elements of our addressable market are dynamic; and particularly within the Cloud vertical, change can occur rapidly. Our Q4 revenue outlook reflects continued large deployment delays. As we expect, our largest Cloud customers will continue their architectural transition. Despite this outlook, we remain confident in our competitive position and strong relationships with these strategic customers. Gross margins are expected to remain at current levels. We expect to continue managing operating expenses prudently and to drive increased operational efficiencies. Today, we initiated a realignment of our workforce as we continue to prioritize our investments in the most critical areas of our business. We are committed to returning approximately 50% of our free cash flow and expect to be opportunistic with our share repurchases. Despite the disappointing full year outlook, we are confident in our strategy and remain committed to our long-term financial principles of driving revenue growth, earnings expansion, and an optimized capital structure. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper. Now I'd like to open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. And our first question is from Brian White from Drexel. Please go ahead.
Brian J. White - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Yeah, Rami, how do we know this is an architectural shift here at customers rather than increased competition, number one? And if this is some type of delay, do you expect to get this revenue back in 2018? Thank you.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Brian. Well, how you know, I mean, what I'm seeing through the discussions, the engagements that I'm having through our customers, I'll tell you that – especially our Cloud customers is all around a transition that's happening in switching from 10 and 40-gig to 100-gig. And in wide area networking from what has traditionally been scale-up architectures to scale-out architectures or something that we have called lean core architectures. We're very close to our customer base, especially our Cloud customer base. We've developed many of the products that are in the market today, in particular, the PTX product line with a keen understanding of what – how these architectural evolutions are going to happen. And honestly, I think the competitiveness of that product is very strong, as you've seen from the results in Q3 with a record revenue quarter for the PTX. I also mentioned in my prepared remarks the fact that we've gained now number one market share in core Routing in North America, and that's primarily because it's been helped by the Cloud provider customers. So I firmly believe that this is a transition where we will emerge on the other side of it. We, in fact, have been leading the charge with the transition. And I think from a competitive standpoint, there's no doubt this is a competitive industry. But because of the products we have and the tight relationships we have with this customer base, I'm very confident. As far as timing, I think that the Switching transition, especially with hyper-scalers, is one that will play out through the rest of this year. And the first part of next year, we should start to see a resumption of more normal spending patterns, especially for the new 100-gig base switching architectures. In Routing, I think it's going to be a bit of a multi-quarter type of transition that's going to happen towards the PTX, towards scale-out architectures. And I think that's all up for next year, Routing is probably going to be a flattish type of business for us. I think that, considering the dynamics that are happening in the market would be a pretty decent result.
Brian J. White - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you for taking my question. I want to see if, first of all, you could clarify whether or not the customer that slowed down is the same customer that was a 10% customer in the June quarter, and if this could simply be an issue where there was too much inventory built up in June and it takes some time to absorb it. Is that a possible scenario for what's played out here?
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. So we believe that it's a positive for the transition as Rami mentioned. From a customer perspective, I mean, we are pretty heavily engaged with the Telco vertical as well as the Cloud vertical. And there is a pretty high level of concentration in both of those verticals. For us to have these types of results, I think it's pretty evident that it's going to be one of our larger customers and a pretty large deployment that was impacted, and I'll leave it at that.
Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then just in terms of the trending, your Cloud, if I did the math correctly, was still 27% of overall sales, so it's still significant. If we want to look past the lumpiness and just think about how you see your business evolving, let's say, over roughly a two-year window, where do you see these vertical mixes coming in terms of maybe – roughly a two-year outlook? Would you expect that that Cloud vertical turns into a third of revenue, 35% to 40%? What's realistic for how you expect your mix evolve? Thank you.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. So the Cloud vertical has been clearly our growth vertical for the last couple of years, and it's very evident that we believe we're on the right side of change as it relates to that vertical, and we've seen the strong results because of that. Through this transition period, I think we're going to see a little bit of lumpiness as we transition. But as we come out the other side, as Rami mentioned, it's important to note that we believe we are on both sides of this transition. So the pause in the middle is really the most troubling part from a financial perspective. As they start to ramp up with the new architectures, we believe we will be able to grow in the Cloud vertical going forward.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Let me just double-click a little bit on that, and I'll do it from the standpoint of Routing and Switching. In Routing, we've always enjoyed pretty substantial market share in the Cloud vertical. And I fully expect based on the competitiveness of our products, based on the full understanding that the transitions that are happening right now are going towards architectures that we are enabling ourselves. So to the extent that our – the Cloud customers themselves are successful and continues to see traffic growth in their wide area network, I think we'll benefit from that. On the Switching side, where we have seen really good traction in Switching has been in Tier 2, Tier 3 Cloud providers. This has been a deliberate part of our strategy. We knew that this would be sort of the lower hanging fruit for us as we introduce the full extent of our Switching portfolio into the marketplace. And then Tier 1 Cloud providers, we do have some meaningful deployments there, but it largely remains an opportunity for us. This is where I believe the opportunity for us over the next couple of years is really going to be strong.
Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question is from Tim Long from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you. Just two if I could. First, just, Ken, if you could talk a little bit about the gross margins in the quarter. I think you said it was as expected, but my sense is that might have been before the shortfall. We had Switching weakness and Cloud weakness. So why was it only flat? And then secondly, a lot of talk about the Cloud vertical weakness, it looks like the Strategic Enterprise was down pretty meaningful as well. Is that the Cloud portion of the Strategic Enterprise, or maybe if you could just talk to us a little bit about what's going on in the Enterprise business, which also seemed pretty weak?
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. So from a gross margin perspective, I did mention that we came in in line with our expectations at 62%. And you're right, from a mix perspective that provided us a bit of an advantage because we did see some softness in Switching, which is our lower margin product, but that was offset by the volume. The revenue being down traditionally has an impact to gross margin in a negative way, so we effectively offset the lower revenue volume with a better product mix. From a customer perspective, as we've mentioned in the past, we don't see a significant impact to margin based on vertical. But the more important impact is customer mix within vertical or customer mix overall. So again, to summarize, this quarter was in line. However, we got there a little differently. It was lower revenue, which hurts margin, but higher product mix, because Switching was the revenue miss.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: And on the Enterprise side, so we saw some sequential declines but year-over-year slight increase. I think if you break it apart in the broad enterprise market was where the weakness was from a sequential standpoint, but for Strategic Enterprises, for example, banking would be in that sector or government, we actually saw a bit of a recovery. I think the catalyst for Enterprise going forward is going to be around our ability to leverage new architectural approaches, take for example, SD-WAN deployment. The strength that we have and the relationships we have with our Telco customers to reach our broader Enterprise, we have a few wins now that we have established this year that I'm hopeful will start to contribute to Enterprise revenue throughout next year.
Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Mark Moskowitz from Barclays. Please go ahead. I'm sorry, Mark, your line is live. Might be on mute by accident.
Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Let's go to the next question, and then we'll come back to Mark.
Operator: Okay. We'll go to next question. It's from Pierre Ferragu from AllianceBernstein. Please go ahead.
Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you for taking my question. Rami, thanks a lot for your clarification around this architectural shift at your large Cloud clients. I had a further question with – on that – between Switching and Routing, do you see some kind of changes in architecture as well where in places at the higher level of aggregation, for instance, where we had a lot of Routing or in data center interconnect, do you see a shift of that market toward Switching as well? And is that part of the architectural discussions and debate and changes that are happening at your clients?
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yes, Pierre. So it's a great question, in fact. And yes, there is a shift that is happening. It's one that we have predicted and developed products and solutions around. And really, I have been talking about this blurring of the lines that is happening between Routing and Switching. If you look at what's happening to data centers, Cloud data centers in particular, they're getting more distributed. And the interconnect between them is essentially becoming an extension of the fabric that's in the data center. So, we actually saw this happening and understood that there is an opportunity for us to go and capture with a product like the PTX. The PTX, as you think about it is sort of this perfect cocktail of Routing capability from a control plane standpoint, but Switching capability from a data plane and cost efficiency of IP transport. And that has now been adopted by the Cloud providers, and I think will continue to be adopted by the Cloud providers at a pace that quite honestly exceeded our expectation. And this at least partly explains what we're seeing in terms of the Q4 guidance that we're providing. It's that transition from what I described as scale-up to more of a scale-out approach, which speaks to this blurring of switching and routing across Cloud architectures.
Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great. And then maybe a very quick follow-up. So what we definitely learned these days is that your Cloud segment is made of very large clients, and it's a lumpy business like your Telecom service provider business. Now if I take a step back, your Telecom and Cable business is down 4% this quarter. Does that mean that growth – we should expect growth to come mostly from your Cloud division, and we need to see growth coming back from there, or do you still see growth trend and like the business coming back at some point, so many, many quarter of weak business in the Telecom segment as well?
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Well, I do think that there is a good opportunity to see growth in Cloud all up as we emerged to the other end of this transitions that we are talking about. Telco remains a challenged market environment, right, where we're seeing more of the same in terms of them running their networks hotter, Cloud transformations that are happening in their own networks, consolidation, M&A are all headwinds that we're facing in the Telco space. The catalyst, I believe, for Telco spending will be around preparation for 5G, Metro build-outs that I think are going to start to happen over the next couple of years, new approaches to delivering value to the Enterprise that are more virtualized and software nature like SD-WAN. And we've really architected our SD-WAN strategy around enabling the telcos to go after that opportunity. So for the foreseeable future, we're not counting on any sort of meaningful rebound in Telco, but I think a little bit more longer term, there are going to be some catalysts that I think will help us.
Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question is from Jim Suva from Citi. Please go ahead.
Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. It's Jim Suva from Citi. You both mentioned Security grew quarter-over-quarter for the second quarter in a row, which is good. But looking back, it looks like that's the normal trend. So my question to you is, are you trying to signal or let us know that you expect this trend to continue quarter-over-quarter, because year-over-year, the results look quite challenged?
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yes. Thanks, Jim. So yes, I do expect that the sequential momentum is going to increase. And there are a few things around the Security business that give me some confidence right now. And we're not out of the woods. We're still working very hard to turn this part of our business around, but there is a sequential performance that we've seen through this year. There is the feedback and the wins that we have from our customers. And we're starting to see some pretty meaningful wins that are building some bookings performance that are encouraging. There is a diversity of use cases that we're now satisfying. So we've traditionally been strong in the service provider space. The portfolio for the service provider space has quite frankly suffered over the last year or so. It's now coming back to a much more competitive state, but we also are starting to see traction with next-gen firewall and data center. And then last but not least, I think there is the software attach, the license attached to Security is actually starting to pick up, and that is a pretty good sign. So we remain optimistic around the fact that we can make this sort of the worst year, and we can recover from here going forward.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, just to clarify that, I mean, our definition of success is sustained year-on-year growth. We have not yet achieved that. We're not yet trying to signal that we're happy with sequential growth, and that's all you could expect. We are absolutely turning this business around and expect to get to year-on-year Security growth here in the near future.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah.
Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Sounds great. Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question is from Tal Liani from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, guys. I have two questions. The first one is on Switching. I'm trying to understand how much of this is also – maybe there's an aspect of competitiveness. Did you notice, with the same customer, maybe another vendor gaining share at the same time? Is the challenges you're talking about architecture? Does it cause – does it drive someone else to gain share in the interim? Or were things put on hold? Also, does it have anything to do with your product readiness for what the customer is trying to do? Is there anything on your side you need to do to make things work? Or is it simply just the customer? And the second question I have is, in general, why don't you grow your margins more than where you are? The industry is challenging. Routing is under pressure for many years. Security, you do have some issues, but you're working on it. In times like that of challenges, why don't you work on reducing your expenses to deliver higher margins to investors and maybe compensate for the lower growth rate? Thanks.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Okay, so let me start with the question on Switching. There is no doubt that the Switching environment is a very competitive environment. Having said that, where we have footprint, I believe, we're well entrenched. We're very close to our customers. We understand their requirements very well, and there are barriers to entry. And this is in no means trying to project overconfidence because I sort of subscribe to the notion that only the paranoid survive. But I will say that I'm very confident that we're going to maintain our Switching footprint in our large franchises, and we will be on the other side of this transition as they move towards (30:18) architectures. From a product standpoint, we know what's required. We know what performance levels are needed, the telemetry capabilities that are required, the features that are needed. And I'm bullish about our Switching business all up in the future. On operating margins, I will let Ken jump in here, but I will say the following. I mean, we have streamlined our organization. We're running far more efficiently than we have in the past. We're enabling a greater level of leveraging of products across different product lines: Routing, and Switching, Routing and Security as an example of that. We're taking out unnecessary costs when we see that there is an opportunity to do so. So in fact, this is part of the reason why we missed in Q3, but still managed to achieve the low end of our earnings range. And we'll continue to operate in that way. I think this is an important part of delivering shareholder value. Ken?
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. So we actually are quite pleased with our Q3 OpEx results that came in at the low end of our range, actually below our range. We continue to be laser focused. I think you've seen that in the last few quarters, laser-focused on cost discipline and making sure we look to optimize our structure in our operations. Today, we initiated a realignment of our workforce, and we're making sure that we're doing that prudently; make sure that we still focus in the right investment areas to drive longer term growth. And you can count on us continuing to focus on earnings, right? We have a stated commitment that we're going to drive earnings faster than revenue. We're going to grow OpEx lower than revenue. I believe we're going to accomplish the OpEx goal of slower than revenue this year despite the fact that the revenue headwinds hit us harder than we expected, we're still being very prudent with OpEx. And for the full year, we will actually be down in OpEx at the midpoint of our guidance. So I do think we are managing the bottom line quite effectively, and we'll continue to do so going forward.
Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Meta A. Marshall - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. This is Meta standing in for James. A couple of questions; first, you mentioned a kind of Switching disruption for the next couple of quarters. Would you expect kind of a Routing disruption on the back of that with certain Cloud customers as they change architecture? Or should we not kind of expect any tail to that beyond Switching? And then the second question is just if you could give a sense of – in your Cloud vertical, what is kind of the general split between Tier 1 and maybe the rest of Tier 2, Tier 3? Thanks.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Okay. So first, the Routing and Switching transitions that are happening are somewhat related. And it speaks to the color I just provided, I think, to Pierre's question that he asked earlier around sort of the blurring of lines in these architectures. And in Q4, in fact, our guidance that we provided really has sort of a balance of both transitions that are happening, Switching moving to 100-gig, Routing moving to lean core scale-out type architectures, they in some sense do go hand in hand. As far as providing any additional color on Tier 1s and Tier 2 Cloud providers...
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Sure. Yeah. So, we don't break out customer detail other than a couple of facts that you do have out there. One is five of our top 10 customers are Cloud. So that's an important number. And in addition to that, if you were just to look at the Cloud customers' size and breadth in the world, you will see it's very concentrated on the top 5, 7, 10, whatever you want to categorize it. Our revenues are going to be largely in line with what you would expect, given kind of CapEx spends around the globe. But I don't want to over-rotate on just the hyper-scalers. I mean, obviously, that's where the majority of the spend is, and that's where you could anticipate much of our customer concentration. There is a longer tail in the industry. It's not just about the infrastructure service providers, there's also the SaaS community that we're also very focused on and a broader set of customers around the globe.
Meta A. Marshall - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: Our next question is from Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So I'm actually going to focus a bit on the Security side, because you guys mentioned you're investing or buying some kind of security malware functionalities as well. So if I think about your balance sheet now, is that kind of the direction you guys are going to go in, if you go down the M&A front to kind of get differentiated growth outside kind of QFX?
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thanks for the question. So I do think that we've got a healthy balance sheet. And I do view that leveraging that balance sheet in order to buy technology businesses that are very complementary to our strategy very much around Cloud, Cloud Security is an option for us and something that I continue to seriously consider.
Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. And then just one small one. When should the 100-gig number start to show up? Is that a 2018 story, or is that going to show up at the back half of Q4?
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: No, I – so a lot of the work to get ready for the transition, the certifications, the architectural work, the qualification work with our customers is happening right now. So I do believe in the first part of next year, we'll start to get to more normal Switching spending patterns with our largest Cloud providers.
Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. Thank you very much.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: You're welcome.
Operator: Our next question is from Jeff Kvaal from Instinet. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Instinet LLC: Yes. I would like to delve into the margin structure a bit, if we could. Could you update us on a couple of the other variables on gross margin that we might see some improvement over the next few quarters? And particularly, Ken, you've talked about memory pricing. And then, of course, you've talked a lot about some APAC wins as well.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. So the dynamics overall in margin haven't really changed much. I mean, we still see the primary drivers to be kind of customer mix. We've talked about insertion opportunities. In Q3, we had some follow-up from the activity that we talked about in the first half, but we didn't have any new large insertion deals that were actually margin negative in Q3. It was just really completing some of the deals that we entered into in the first half. So there wasn't a big factor in Q3. The memory pricing is still a headwind. It's an industry phenomenon. It's impacting us, and that's something that's in line with our expectations. As far as when does it come back, I don't see it coming back in Q4. We're not providing guidance on FY 2018, but I would think it's reasonable to assume sometime in 2018, we'll start to see a little bit of relief on the memory price. And then the product mix is also the dynamic that we experienced a lot. And as Switching continues to be a growth driver for us that will result in a natural kind of headwind to margin. That being said, we're very focused internally on some value engineering efforts. But we think we have a lot of opportunity within our cost and supply chain to really design our products in a way that really provides the most customer value at the right price point and at the right cost structure. So I believe we have some of that within our control, and we'll continue to manage margins, despite some natural headwinds with product mix.
Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Instinet LLC: You talked a little bit about insertion point, and I'm just – and we hear from others that 100G is indeed an insertion point for their products in existing – or in new accounts. It seems though you are talking about 100-gig as a pause rather than a potential insertion point. And so I'm a little surprised by the disparity there. I would have thought that that was an opportunity for a customer to start with a new set of vendors.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: So, this is Jeff, I believe, right?
Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Instinet LLC: Yes.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: So let me say this. There are certainly accounts – large Cloud accounts that we're in that where the game we're playing or the approach we're taking is one of making sure that we stay ahead of their requirements with a goal of keeping the competition out. And I think we're doing a really good job at that. We also believe that especially for the Cloud Switching space, we can play and are playing a more offensive strategy to try to insert ourselves. Now we're not going to always be successful, but thus far, if you look at the performance of our Switching business, and you modulate out the lumpiness due to the large hyper-scaler deployments, we're still seeing double-digit growth in overall Switching. Some of that comes because of our strength in high-performance in 100-gig, in telemetry, in automation, et cetera. So there is a bit of a defensive game you have to play when you're an incumbent. But I also want you to understand, we're playing a very offensive game, especially in Switching, where I think there's still a huge amount of room for us to expand.
Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Instinet LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Steve Milunovich from UBS. Please go ahead.
Steven Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC: Yes, thank you. I just want to be absolutely clear regarding your comments about footprint. In none of these large situations where you're seeing a lumpy business, a deferral in business, are you being displaced by competitors or by white box? I just want to confirm that. And then given this shortfall on product revenue, should we expect to see a deceleration in services growth somewhere down the line or not?
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: So let me start. The answer to your first question is yes. It's not a displacement by competition. It is – if anything, we're displacing ourselves with new architectural approaches, and we're doing this ahead of our customer's requirements to avoid being disrupted or displaced by the competition. And I think in the long term, this approach, playing a challenger type of approach where you – in some cases need to challenge yourself even if it results in short-term business disruption pays off because it makes us more relevant. And I believe it ultimately helps us to grow our footprint.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, from a services perspective, I mean, we expect it to continue to remain very healthy. We've had a very good run in services the last couple of years. We've done a good job with attach and renewals. And we're also starting to do more in the way of professional services and really the solution sale. That said, I do think it's reasonable to assume the growth rates that we've been having, which have been largely double digits, 9%, 10% just start to come down a bit. I still think that growth rates will be ahead of the product growth rates, so high single digits, if you will. But it's something that we continue to be strong for us going forward.
Operator: Our next question is from Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. Yeah, good afternoon. Yeah. I'd like to get your thoughts, Rami, on the pricing dynamics you're seeing out there. And how I mean by this is management teams often do not talk about port pricing ASPs on earnings calls. It would be helpful for us, you do have a legacy routing portfolio. You have the new stuff with 100-gig, a very similar setup in Switching. So help us understand how is pricing trending both on the lower speed legacy side and also on 100-gig both in Routing and in Switching? Thanks.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Yeah. So it's a great question. And obviously, it's a tremendous area of focus for us. For any given platform, take an MX, a PTX, a QFX or just broader routing, switching, et cetera, you're going to see continuous price erosion for a given port speed. This is nothing new. This is something that we're very used to and has been a fact of life that we've had to deal within this industry since the very first product that we introduced into the market. Now as architecture has evolved and our customers have the ability to move to different architectures that can leverage a different platform, so if you have – it traditionally builds a scale-up architecture with an MX, and now you're going to go to a scale-out that uses a PTX as an example, there is a price differential between those two platforms that one has to factor. And we are seeing some of that right now for some of the few deployments with our largest Cloud provider to have the ability to transition their architectures in that way. Ultimately, I do believe that it pays off, because you have to assume that these large Cloud providers are going to continue to see growth in their business, are going to continue to see a lot of demand on their services. And therefore, they're going to need to buy way more ports. That's what we're counting on. That's what I believe is going to happen.
Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, perfect. A quick follow-on would be, any thoughts on exiting slower or underperforming product areas, such as campus switching, for example? Thanks.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Sure. Well, I mean, as far as thoughts of exiting, we are applying a lot of very ruthless analyses to all new products, businesses, technologies where we're going to be investing in, with the goal of making sure that these investments actually do pay off. Campus, I have said this now over the last year or so, even longer than that, I believe, we're going to be focusing on our campus efforts in the large enterprises where we believe that we have some level of differentiation. And also, there is a high degree of leveraging of our development with data center switching, right? We understand, we don't have a WiFi portfolio. So there's no point in us in going after opportunities where WiFi is tightly integrated with campus. So, yes, we are in campus, but we are really laser-focused on campus opportunities, where we believe that we really have some differentiation. And actually the way I describe this to our teams and our customers is for those enterprises that view their campus as on-ramps to the Cloud where they need high-performance network in order to access Cloud workloads and data sets.
Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Perfect. Thanks, Rami.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: You bet.
Operator: Our next question is from Alex Kurtz from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Alex Kurtz - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Just some clarification on these Cloud customers over the last couple of quarters which – Rami, was this a communication issue, or was there sort of a last-minute change and how they viewed architecture over the next big 6- to 12-month deployments internally there? I'm just trying to figure out if we go back to spring timeframe when you were executing this vertical to now, just sort of how that played out with these accounts, as much as you can describe?
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Look, it's a great question. And we're obviously disappointed in the fact that we weren't able to predict this. We're very close to our Cloud customers. We engage and talk to them on a very regular basis. We're obviously a very part of their network. What has happened here is an acceleration of plans ahead of what we had expected. So as much as we try very, very hard to predict some of these inflection points, sometimes our own customers' plans can change, which makes it obviously difficult, if not impossible for us to predict these sorts of changes. That's really what it is. I don't think it was a communication problem.
Alex Kurtz - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from Dmitry Netis from William Blair. Please go ahead.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC: All right. Thank you. A couple of questions for me. On the Cloud vertical, what is the rough split between Switching and Routing? And I know you guys have said Routing probably vast majority, but can you give us a split there?
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. So what we've said is Routing is still the majority, but it's not the vast majority within the Cloud vertical. In fact, in the first half of this year, you saw Switching get really close to Routing. Routing was still the majority, call that greater than 50%, but it wasn't the vast majority like you would see in Telco, for example. Clearly, these Q3 results, the miss being predominantly Cloud Switching, that mix has gone back to more Routing heavy. But we are expecting over time, the Switching component in Cloud to actually outpace Routing. And eventually, we think that will be the dominant technology within that vertical.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Thanks. The next question is on the – just the impact this quarter. Did this come from just the single customer, or you really saw – I know – I get the architectural changes that are happening and how it may impact more than just one customer. But specific to Q3, was this coming from just one large customer, or were there several ones involved here on the Switching side?
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: I mean, all we can say is there is a fairly high degree of concentration with hyper-scalers, especially as it pertains to switching in Juniper's business.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, and I would say, I mean, it's not one customer, but it's also not several. I mean, you asked if it's one of those two, it's neither of those.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, all right. And then lastly, my follow-up. If you guys are guiding Routing to be flat next year, given the transition you're seeing, given also the Switching that you said may get to the normal pattern, but there's still kind of a poor visibility on that I suppose at this stage. And then Security is sort of going through the ebbs and flows, it doesn't seem like you will hit your 3% to 6% CAGR target as you've outlined in the past. So shouldn't you be maybe thinking around the flat growth next year? I know you're not providing guidance, but should investor be thinking this is how 2018 is going to shake out, right, given whatever you just said?
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. No, so good question. So, let me just talk about Switching for a second. We do expect Switching to grow next year. I think that's important. We've talked about the Tier 2, Tier 3 traction we're getting, which is double-digit growth. QFX all up grew year-on-year even this quarter, with these results with this large spending delay. So we expect Switching to be a growth driver for us. As it relates to kind of FY 2018 as you mentioned, I'm not giving specific guidance. But I will say this, we are going to be very focused on growing. We think there's an opportunity to grow. That said, we're equally, if not more so, focused on earnings expansion. And that's something that we've – I believe, we've shown some steps in the last several quarters. And I think we'll continue to show steps in that regard, making sure we focused on operating excellence and taking costs out where we can, but making sure we focus the costs, the investments that we are making in the right areas to enable long-term growth. We also have a very strong cash flow. As you know, our balance sheet is strong. We have a very sustained capital return program. So I do think we are very focused on bottom line, and we'll continue to be next year.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC: All right. Thanks, guys.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Jayson Noland from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. Rami, you've mentioned SD-WAN a couple of times, I believe. It's a hot category. And Juniper's name doesn't come up that often, crowded market to be fair, I guess. Do you have what you need from a portfolio perspective here? And then how would SD-WAN impact your traditional router market, assuming some success?
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Jayson. So I'm actually not surprised by your comment that our name doesn't come up all that often, and that's pretty much because we've taken a very deliberate strategy where at least initially, we're focusing our SD-WAN solution on scalable, multitenant, very versatile like extensible architectures with security built in, that are very appealing to our service provider customers. Service providers all want an SD-WAN strategy and recognize that they need some help with it, and this is essentially what we're doing. We've developed a solution ideally suited for their plans. And we're seeing traction there. As far as impact to the rest of the Routing business, I know there were all sorts of predictions that this is going to have a deflationary effect on MPLS and so forth. But I have to say that thus far based on conversations with many of our Telco customers where, of course, we enjoy very strong relationships, it hasn't had that effect. I just don't expect it to have any sort of meaningful effect on the need for IP routing or MPLS capabilities in the wide area and in the foreseeable future.
Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Paul Silverstein from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. I'm sorry, Paul, your line is live.
Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Paul, are you there?
Operator: Well, I think he just disconnected. We'll move on to the next question.
Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Okay. We'll go on to the next.
Operator: Yeah, from Michael Genovese from MKM Partners. Please go ahead.
Michael E. Genovese - MKM Partners LLC: Great. Thanks a lot. Just in terms of the guidance for the fourth quarter, doesn't seem to envision any type of normal seasonality in the traditional service provider market, certainly no budget flush or normal increase of given seasonality. So can you just talk about that a little bit more, and why you don't expect to see fourth quarter increase in the telco market?
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. So I think, I mean, we're actually almost at a new normal with Telco. I mean, the last few years, we've seen kind of a challenged market there. And we haven't had big Telco flushes of recent times. We used to have those back in the growth days in the Telco space. But at this point, we expect Telco to remain challenged. I mean that's – as we all know, a particularly lumpy business. So it's hard to predict with certainty. But I don't expect flushes at this point. In our outlook, we have not assumed an increase in Telco spend in the Q4 because that's just not what we see given the environment that they're in.
Michael E. Genovese - MKM Partners LLC: Okay. Thanks for the question.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Sure.
Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: And our next question is from Paul Silverstein from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
Paul J. Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: Rami, can you hear me?
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yes.
Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yes. We can hear you, Paul. Go ahead.
Paul J. Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: Appreciate it.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Go ahead, Paul. (53:15)
Paul J. Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: I apologize returning to the question yet again. But I just want to make sure I understand, and perhaps I'm misinterpreting some stuff you said previously. But when you say that you're disrupting yourself and that drove the issue, and then this is across a number of different, at least more than one player, more than one of the Cloud customers, I'm confused why you didn't – if you drove yourself, why wouldn't you see the issue, as opposed to the Cloud operators changing their architecture, then advising you to change and it catches you unaware. What's the reconciliation? And then for Ken...
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, Paul... (53:57)
Paul J. Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: On the gross margin, can you remind us – I think you said in the past that your Cloud customers have the same gross margin (54:07) or corporate average, can you just remind us of that? Thanks, guys.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Paul, to your question about why we could not have predicted this, yes, we did, in fact, develop these products and the solution with an eye that the architectures are going to evolve. What we did not predict and could not have predicted because the plans change for our customers themselves is timing and the pace at which they have moved. And honestly, I mean, it's impressive despite their size and just how nimble they can be in embracing and deploying new architectural approaches. And again, keep in mind that in the Cloud vertical and where we're seeing the bulk of the sort of the transition that's happening, it's the large Cloud vertical – the large customers is why it doesn't take all that many to make a meaningful change to our overall business.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, and I just want to clarify, what we're seeing is the pause in between – in this transition, right? So we're seeing the previous architectures, if you will, the spend slowed down there dramatically as they get ready for the new architecture ramps into the future. On a gross margin perspective, what we've said and continue to say is the Cloud vertical by itself doesn't have a margin difference. What does drive margin more than customer vertical is technology. So because the Cloud vertical historically has had a higher switching mix than the Telco vertical as an example has a larger – has a lower margin profile, but it's really due to product not customer at this point.
Paul J. Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: I appreciate it. Thank you.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Sure.
Operator: Our next question is from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Aaron Christopher Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Kind of on the competitive landscape, again, I'm just curious as we look at some of the competitors launching and pushing their Jericho II or Jericho Plus based platforms into the market, how we should think about your guys as competitive positioning as it relates to kind of product cycle cadence, particularly on the router side of the business?
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Certainly. So we are keenly aware of the competitive dynamics that are happening all around us, especially in the Cloud space where – and Routing, which is I think where you really wanted to focus, in the Cloud space where we enjoyed some good footprint. We developed the PTX from a silicon and software standpoint, as what I believe again to be this perfect blend of Routing and Switching capabilities that can evolve with our customer's architectures. The roadmap for the PTX, I mean, we get encouraged now by the momentum of the product, and we make sure that we're going to be continuing to invest in ways that keep us ahead of our customer's requirements, and also the competition. And what I believe to be the case here is that the PTX will remain very competitive with the Cloud customer's, in particular, and we'll actually start to gain more traction in other verticals like large enterprise space and telcos over time.
Aaron Christopher Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities: Okay. And as a real quick follow-up. I'm curious on the realignment efforts, do you have any targeted kind of operating expense reductions? Is this truly just a reinvestment or realignment of investments, or are you expecting to take costs out of the company?
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, so we have been taking head count and costs out as we continue to optimize kind of our operations. I would say that it's largely in line with our revenue expectations. We're going to manage OpEx largely in line with revenue. And as we see challenges to the revenue top side and gross margins for that matter, we are going to look to take costs out and protect the bottom line. Going forward at the same – the challenge and what we're really focused on is doing that in a way that doesn't hurt the long-term growth of the business, making sure we are investing in the right area, so that's where it goes down to operational excellence ideas. We've done a lot in the past on consolidating and collapsing management, et cetera, and really focused on areas that do save money, but also don't come at the expense of output. So that's really what we're focused on going forward.
Aaron Christopher Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities: Thank you.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing comments.
Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, Operator. And thank you, everyone, for joining us and your great questions. As always, we'll speak with you next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Juniper Networks Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Kathleen Nemeth, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to our second quarter 2017 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call contains forward-looking statements, including statements concerning Juniper's business, economic and market outlook, strategy, future financial results, capital return program and overall future prospects. Actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in these forward-looking statements are listed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release furnished with our 8-K filed today, and in other documents that we file with the SEC from time to time. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances change after the date of the call. Our discussion of the financial results today will include non-GAAP results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website under Financial Reports. For important commentary on why our management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult the press release furnished with our 8-K filed with the SEC today. Please keep your questions to one per firm. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Kathleen. Good afternoon, everyone. We delivered good year-over-year revenue and earnings growth in the June quarter. Total revenue was $1.309 billion at the high end of our guidance range, with growth driven by record revenue in Switching and continued strength in the Cloud vertical. We delivered strong profitability metrics, with year-over-year growth in operating margin, operating income and diluted earnings per share. I'm pleased with our overall performance as we continued to benefit from our diversification strategy. We're executing on our strategy to lead the transformation to the cloud, and I'm happy with the continued strength in our cloud-oriented solution across our key focus verticals. Enterprises continued towards digital transformation by adopting hybrid cloud and SaaS models. Top of mind for many of our customers are security and visibility of data and workloads in a multi-cloud environment. Telcos are going through a significant transformation as trends such as SD-WAN, 5G, IoT, and overall broadband growth are driving the need to evaluate Cloud-grade architectural shift in order to increase automation, reduce costs and enable greater service speed and agility. In the quarter, we unveiled Cloud-Grade Networking to accelerate agility and innovation in the cloud era. Cloud-Grade Networking builds on carrier-grade reach and reliability and enterprise-grade control and usability, bringing cloud-level agility and operational scale to networks everywhere. This announcement includes two new foundational products: Junos Node Slicing and Universal Chassis, which reduce operational overhead and create an environment for operational agility to thrive. Junos Node Slicing is a critical technology in the transition to Cloud-Grade Networking and in particular, the movement to disaggregated networking at the edge. By enabling the ability to run multiple isolated services at the edge, combined with a powerful and efficient data plane, service providers and enterprises can optimize their infrastructure while offering differentiated services with enhanced operational and administrative isolation within a single chassis. This is enabled by converging multiple concurrent services on the same physical routing infrastructure. This differentiated technology has already enabled a Tier 1 service provider network win for us, and we expect that we'll have broader impact as our customers learn about its powerful benefits. Universal Chassis is a breakthrough system allowing customers to standardize on a hardware platform across their data center, core and network edge. It is designed to provide customers with the ability to adapt to ever changing business requirements with a common hardware platform that supports a continuum of optimized switching and routing use cases across their network. Universal Chassis can create significant value for our customers by enhancing their ROI through reduced qualification and logistics cost along with greater investment protection. Now, I would like to summarize the highlights across Switching, Routing and Security. In Switching, we saw continued momentum with year-over-year and sequential revenue growth across all verticals. Two effects continued to see strong year-over-year growth in cloud data center, driven by the industry's migration towards 100-gigabit infrastructure and as our customers adopt end-to-end solutions with Juniper's ToR and spine portfolio. We also saw year-over-year and sequential growth in our EX products. In Routing, the MX had good year-over-year and sequential growth. And we also saw strength in our PTX products within our cloud customers and new insertions in telecom in the second quarter. In Security, we announced enhancements to our Software-Defined Secure Networks platform and expanded our public cloud offering with the introduction of virtual SRX 4.0. Our SDSN enhancements deliver pervasive security across multivendor environments, public clouds and private cloud. Juniper's SDSN platform and its ecosystem help organizations unify security for their networks, giving customers a streamlined way to integrate products and manage their security operation regardless of the vendors they choose. In addition, we continue to add new logos to our Sky ATP customer portfolio. In the quarter, we continued to see momentum with Contrail and had several new customer wins, including a large Strategic Enterprise customer in APAC and a large telecom customer in EMEA. AppFormix and Contrail have been integrated for seamless operations management of Juniper's hardware and software. This allows us to bring the powerful machine-learning capabilities of AppFormix to our entire portfolio of products, and we are now applying this capability in various customer use cases. We had another strong quarter in our services business, where we saw strong renewal and attach rates of support contracts and an increase in demand for professional services. To summarize, I'm pleased with our execution and the continued momentum we are seeing in our Cloud vertical and our Switching business. I am proud of the strength in our product and services portfolio and excited about the opportunity we have in front of us. We saw good momentum in the first half of the year, and we anticipate delivering revenue and non-GAAP earnings growth for the full year. I would like to extend my thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I also wanted to thank our employees for their continued hard work and dedication to successfully execute on our strategy and create value for all of our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. The results for the second quarter of 2017 reflect good sequential and year-over-year revenue growth, continued expansion of earnings and healthy cash flows. The industry shift towards cloud networking continued to play to our strengths. The Cloud vertical grew 32% year-over-year, and from a product perspective, we had a record revenue quarter in Switching led by the QFX product family. In addition, our Services business remained solid, posting 9% year-over-year growth, driven by continued strong renewal and attach rates. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, four were Cloud, five were Telecom or Cable, and one was a Strategic Enterprise. Of these customers, two were located outside of the United States. These revenue results reflect the focus and dedication we have made toward diversification of our revenue across technologies, markets and geographies. Moving on to non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP product gross margin was down year-over-year primarily due to three factors. First, customer mix as we continued to expand our footprint with certain strategic customers, particularly with cloud and telecom customers in Asia Pac. Second, product mix, primarily related to the strong performance of Switching. And finally, as expected, the higher cost for certain memory components. We continue to see year-over-year strength in non-GAAP service gross margin due to higher service revenue and continued improvements in our customer support model. For the quarter, non-GAAP operating expenses were $496 million, reflecting our continued discipline around operating expenses. Non-GAAP earnings per share increased $0.07 year-over-year, driven by higher revenue, partially offset by lower gross margin. I am pleased with the healthy cash flow from operations in the quarter of $299 million, which brings our first half cash flow from operations to $844 million. DSO was 52 days, reflecting a return to normalized invoicing linearity. We continue to return capital to shareholders, and during the second quarter, we repurchased $125 million of shares and paid $38 million in dividends. Before we move on to Q&A, I would like to provide some color on our guidance, which you can find detailed in the CFO commentary available on our website. We remain committed to the financial principles we outlined at the beginning of the year, which are: we expect revenue growth for the year, we are focused on earnings expansion with long-term consistency, and intend to maintain an optimized capital structure. In addition, we remain committed to delivering strong operating cash flow. We continue to expect revenue growth for 2017 to be near the midpoint of our long-term model range of 3% to 6%. As I shared with you last quarter, some elements of our addressable markets are challenged, and timing of customer deployments may vary. We are pleased with our product portfolio and expect to see continued strength from the Cloud vertical. For the remainder of 2017, we expect similar gross margin dynamics as seen in the first half of the year. We are focused on driving non-GAAP earnings expansion for the full year through revenue growth, operating expense discipline and strong execution. As we stated last quarter, we are driving to our long-term model of 39% of non-GAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue for the full year. We intend to return approximately 50% of annual free cash flow to our shareholders inclusive of share repurchases and dividends. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. Now, I'd like to open the call for questions.
Operator: At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and answer session. Our first question comes from Tim Long of BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you. Ken, if I could just on the Switching strength in gross margins, just talk a little bit about what it would take to get those a little bit more towards the corporate gross margin levels. There are some switch companies that are at these levels for their product gross margins. So is it scale? Is there something else that needs to happen? Do we need to see more software features? If you could just talk a little bit about how we can see Switching maybe over time become less of a drag to the corporate gross margin. Thank you.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Sure. So, yeah, as we mentioned the product mix to Switching has had a drag on the overall gross margin. Clearly Switching continues to outpace our long-term model expectations. And while the over-performance is having a positive effect on gross profit and overall earnings, it does have a minor impact in our margin. As far as getting the margins up, it's like all of our products, continuing to innovate, continuing to sell that innovation, continuing to focus on cost, is what – designing for cost, designing for value initiatives, as well as just making sure that we focus on what matters to our customers from a product differentiation perspective. I do think there will be more and more service – sorry, software attach within all of our product lines including Switching. So that should also provide some tailwinds for the Switching business going forward. Last but not least, I would say even with these kind of margin (15:05) dynamic that we're seeing, we're very focused on overall growth, profit expansion and earnings expansion. I'm very pleased that we're able to deliver that in the first half and Q2.
Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rod Hall of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah, hi, guys, thanks for the question. I just had I guess a couple of questions for you. One is on the growth rate that you're suggesting for the full year and then Q3. Just looking at the Cloud, Telecom and Enterprise verticals and thinking about the trajectory of growth in all of those, it seems like you're implying a pretty material slowdown on a year-over-year basis in one or a couple of those. So I just wonder if you could give us a little bit of color on what you're thinking in terms of growth for those sub-segments that you've been starting to report. And then the second question I had was on gross margin. Can you just give us maybe, Ken, a little bit of an understanding of those three elements that you listed out on what their impact was quantitatively? Particularly, interested in memory price impacts on gross margin. Thanks.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Sure. Good.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Actually, Rod, let me start. And then Ken, why don't you weigh in? So on the first question around growth, goes without saying we're pleased with what we've seen in the first half of the year. We're off to a strong start for 2017. It certainly gives us confidence that we can meet our objective of achieving revenue growth and earnings growth in 2017 all up. Having said that, with respect to the specific verticals, remain optimistic about Cloud vertical. A lot of focus inside the company at maintaining the momentum in the Cloud. However, we've always said that the Cloud vertical is going to have some lumpiness. There's going to be a timing of deployment factor that we need to weigh into our overall outlook on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Telco, it's going to be more of the same. I think nothing really changes all that much either in the positive or the negative direction. The engagement level with our telco customers is very high. And it's all very much around new architectures, new ways of driving service revenues, et cetera. But the new mode of operation, the new build-out that drive these new modes of service delivery are just going to take some time. So we're not expecting anything materially different in the short term. Enterprise, there actually in Q2, we saw some good momentum with the exception of the federal government. And there, we have to see how the federal government spending plays out for the rest of the year. But generally speaking, we've done a good job in compensating for weakness in federal government with the broader enterprise. So all up, we remain optimistic about the year, and we're off to a solid start in achieving both revenue and margin growth for the full year. Go ahead, Ken.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: I'll touch on gross margin, but before I do, I just want to talk about federal government for a second. It was up sequentially. We did see year-on-year decline in federal government. So Rami's comments about the broad enterprise really carrying the day from a year-on-year perspective is spot on. But we did see some sequential growth in the federal government space in Q2. On a gross margin perspective, the three factors that we outlined last quarter are the same three factors this quarter. It really is customer mix, as we expand our footprint with certain strategic customers, particularly in telco, cloud in Asia Pac region. The second one being product mix, as I already talked about the Switching being a very profitable business for us. Obviously, we're very pleased with the performance of that technology. It does come with a slight drag to the margin percentage. And last but not least was the DRAM memory pricing, you mentioned, Rod. We don't break out the exact specifics, but I can say that all three were relatively proportionate and they're kind of factors as headwinds to margin. The one that was probably a bigger headwind than we anticipated when we set the midpoint of the guidance, the one that's the reason why we're on the low end of the guidance, if you will, would be the customer mix. We definitely saw some opportunity to take down some deals, expand our footprint in certain parts of the world that we think are going to be in the long term best interests of the company. And given that we're able to deliver the revenue and earnings expansion that we were focused on, we went ahead and did that in Q2.
Operator: Our next question comes from Simon Leopold of Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to get one quick clarification and then more of a general thematic question. In terms of my – the thing I want to clarify is it appears you've given us implied Q4 guidance, since we have Q3 and a full year bogey at sort of the midpoint at 3% to 6% range. And that would imply that Q4, we would see perhaps a slight year-over-year decline in revenue of 1% or 2%. I just want to make sure I'm doing my math correctly. And if so, it would really help us get an understanding of why you see that kind of year-over-year deceleration. In terms of a more thematic question, I want to delve a little bit into the longer-term trends of Routing. This quarter was relatively flat year-over-year. And it does appear that within your mix, that 2017 Routing is probably going to decline overall and was a little flat – or roughly flat in 2016. When do you expect the routing market for you and for your headers to turn more sustainably positive and begin to grow again, because we believe traffic continues to grow? Could you help us understand that longer term trend in Routing as well? Thank you.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Sure, Simon. I'll start with the question about Routing. And then we'll address the first question or the point of clarification you're asking about. The routing market is largely driven by the Telco vertical and the Cloud vertical. And those are a little bit of a tale of two cities right now where the Cloud is really spending quite a bit on their wide area networks, making sure that their customers for their Cloud services continue to get the optimal experience. And that involves investments in their wide area network. That's somewhat offset by weakness in the Telco vertical, all up, which is obviously significant factor in Routing. So yes, traffic is growing. But there are sort of other factors at play that results in Routing from a revenue standpoint or total addressable market standpoint not growing all that well. Having said that, I think that there are some things that are going to be happening at some point in the future around metro buildouts, around new modes of delivering services to enterprises that leverage things like new Cloud-managed solutions to connectivity and security that we are very much engaging with our customers on today, difficult to tell exactly when that will result in actual revenue growth for us. But that said, we're doing everything we can right now to participate in those new modes of spend when they become a reality in the market. The last thing I would say about Routing is there is a big geographic component to this. China is a country that's still investing quite heavily in routing today. They're driving a lot of the world's sort of wide area traffic growth. And in order for us to participate effectively in that market beyond the level that we are today, we need partnerships. And there is a, as you know, quite a bit of focus right now by the company on creating partnerships such as the one that we have with Lenovo today, that will enable us to tap into that market as effectively as possible.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yes, from a second half revenue perspective, as you know, our revenue is largely deployment based, and therefore, it tends to be pretty lumpy. We did provide specific guidance for Q3 at $1.320 billion, which is up approximately 3% year-on-year. We did not provide Q4 guidance as you mentioned, but we did reiterate that we expect to be within our range, and in fact, near the midpoint of that range. I will say Q4, we expect clearly to be sequentially up. We did have a strong first half this year and we had a pretty strong second half last year. So the year-on-year growth rates, I would expect to decelerate in the second half as compared to second half of 2016. But I do still expect sequential growth and to be comfortably within our target of 3% to 6% kind of near that midpoint area.
Operator: Our next question comes from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Yes. I just wanted to follow-up on that last point. So as you mentioned, Ken, you did reiterate the full year guidance at the midpoint, which implies Q4 revenue down 1.5%. And given that just the growth in services alone is going to get you a couple of points of growth for the company as a whole, it does imply a more significant year-over-year decline in products revenue in Q4. So I guess the question is, is that just conservatism sitting here today in July? Or do you have specific visibility into that quarter? And then the quick other question I had is, as far as your 10% customer, if you can tell us what vertical that customer was in? Thank you.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yes, I wouldn't characterize it as conservatism, I would characterize it as appropriate. There's a lot of factors to go into our guidance, clearly deal visibility, backlog, deferred revenue, et cetera. And I would also reiterate that we said near the midpoint, so between 3% to 6% is our long-term target. We expect to be near the midpoint. And I still think that will hold true going into Q3 and Q4 when we get to the full year of near midpoint.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: And just to add some color on the first question, Simona, I appreciate the question. Juniper has always been a company that has derived much of its success by focusing on those that operate the world's largest, most scalable networks. And that's certainly true for our service provider on our Cloud vertical. So, in some sense, due to reasons of strategy where we're focusing as a company, where our strengths lie, and the concentration of where spend is happening in our industry, concentration in our business is not new. I think the timing of deployments just so happened that resulted in a little bit more concentration than usual in the Q3 timeframe. I'm not prepared at this point to provide any additional details just for reasons of confidentiality about the specific customer though however.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tal Liani of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Can you hear me? My question is kind of around the question that we had before. How much of the conservatism in 3Q and 4Q, or maybe 4Q, is related to lower visibility with the big trends that you had in the past few quarters? If I look at the past few quarters, I can generally characterize it by quarters of strong Security – sorry, strong Switching, sorry, strong Switching and strong Cloud vertical. If you're guiding for Q2 to be down, or implicit guidance, does it mean that you have less confidence with these two big drivers? And can you elaborate on the sustainability of growth trends within these two drivers? Thanks.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: So, Tal, I appreciate the question. We're just off to a really solid start this year. I think, as you saw in the Q2 timeframe, we sort of hit the high end of our revenue range. Part of that had to do with sort of just timing of deployments of big projects that we have been working on. There is no change to our confidence in terms of our strategy, our ability to execute, our products that we have in the market today and the products that we're working on that we know that will be out in the market in the future. And also our vertical focus, so the Cloud vertical continues to be a really important vertical for us. I don't think that there's going to be any material slowdown in terms of their need to invest in their networks to keep ahead of the traffic that they are seeing on a yearly basis. But we just have to factor into all of this the timing of those deployments and the timing of the projects. And I think you also mentioned Switching. Obviously very happy with the Switching performance that we have demonstrated well ahead of our long-term model. I think we've said in the past, and I'll say it again just now, that expecting that level of ongoing outperformance at Switching is probably unrealistic only because the numbers start to get big. But that said, the new products are doing really well. Our customer adoption is excellent. The feedback that we're getting from our customers and our partners is also very, very encouraging and there is a lot more room for us to grow and take market share in the Switching business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Rami, I was hoping you could help us understand the breadth of the strength you're seeing with the QFX and particularly, the spine portfolio, and perhaps how you're feeling about the sustainability of the trends we've seen the last few quarters. And would you expect Switching to grow sequentially through the year? And then for Ken, I was hoping you could maybe comment to what degree your cost structure changes as the cloud becomes a bigger piece of your mix. And perhaps, what gives you confidence you can continue to grow the business over time while only marginally increasing the pace of investment? And to the extent you do need to spend a little bit more, where do you see the greatest priorities?
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Sure, Jeff. Let me start. On the question around Switching, we have expected and we have seen that Switching is in fact the main growth driver for the business. I expect that to continue with the comment I just mentioned around the fact that expecting these levels of outperformance relative to our long-term model in Switching to – at some point they're going to moderate. But that said, that's not a comment at all that I think you should take that would demonstrate a lack of confidence in the product, the technology and the market focus. All of that I would say is working really, really well for us right now. And on the point around spine switches, the main intent of our spine switching products has been to enable us to participate in and compete for net new Switching business, especially in the data center. And that's exactly what they're doing. So even in opportunities where we're coming in with the spine switches and, of course, our top of racks, the bulk of the revenue that we'd see could be in other areas of our portfolio like in the top-of-rack switching but we would not have an ability to compete or to win without the breadth of that portfolio. So it's as expected and we're very pleased with the momentum thus far. And I think it will continue in terms of being a growth driver for us for the rest of the year and for the foreseeable future.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. And as it relates to the cost structure, as the shift to the cloud momentum continues, I would say, I mean, the first thing I'll note is we have a highly leveraged R&D organization. So Routing, Switching and Security is highly leveraged across most of our engineers and what they bring to market in those areas. We'll continue that leverage and the cloud is really – as we deliver products to the cloud, it should be right in our sweet spot of Routing, Switching and Security. So there's a tremendous amount of leverage there. From a go-to-market perspective, we already have, as you can see from the results, a very successful strategy in winning with the cloud providers and the go-to-market coverage model there is actually quite efficient as compared to, let's say, a broad channel coverage model as an example. So that's something that we'll continue to see going forward. From a, would will we invest more, I mean, there's a lot of areas, a lot of emerging technology areas that we're continuing to invest in now. And I could see that investment step up over the years as we continue to evolve into new architectures, new kind of software areas of focus that we've been talking about for quite some time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers of Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about product cycle. I know that in late June you launched your Cloud-Grade Networking platforms. I'm just curious of how we should think about the cadence of that product cycle? And when do you believe and how material do you believe that product cycle should be maybe looking out over the next couple of quarters?
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, Aaron. Let me address that. So Cloud-Grade Networking includes a number of different sub-products. One of them is really around this concept of a Universal Chassis. Ken just talked about how we as a company are operating and executing with far more efficiency. It's true in our engineering group, it's true in other parts of our organization as well. Well, one of the ways in which we're achieving that is by developing fewer products that address a broader market opportunity. This concept of a Universal Chassis has the ability to address a number of routing or switching use cases. And it adds tremendous value for our customers because it gives them an ability to evolve their deployments, their investment protection to address a variety of different use cases as their business requires it. The Universal Chassis, the first iteration of it is in the market today. It's a product that supports both routing and switching, and eventually will also support edge routing capabilities as opposed to just core routing capabilities. And while it's still early, typically these things take a couple of quarters, maybe nine months to get to revenue, I do expect revenue for this first iteration of Universal Chassis in the second half of this year. And of course, the innovation engine continues to crank. So across Routing, Switching and Security, you can expect that there's going to be a number of new products that will continue this ongoing cycle of refreshes, and of course that will help us in maintaining the momentum that we've seen thus far over the last couple of years.
Operator: Our next question comes from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. I have a couple a (34:49-34:56)...
Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Hey, James, you're cutting in and out. We can barely hear you.
James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Is that better?
Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yes, much. Thank you.
James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I just had a couple of higher-level strategic questions. First, with the appointment of Bikash Koley as CTO, clearly it seems to be enhancing Juniper's Cloud and hyperscale chops, if you will. So I'm just wondering what you hope that Mr. Koley and his leadership will bring to improve like the product portfolio for your traditional Telecom and Enterprise customers. And I guess along the same lines of long-term view, you've talked recently about how you're modifying your Security portfolio. But we've started to see a lot of the private security assets that are in the market snapped up, and with your capital return coming in, I was just wondering if you expect to have to be able to do everything internally or if you still think there's room to acquire new technologies and teams as you continue to develop your security capabilities. Thanks.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thanks, James, both good questions. First on the appointment of Bikash Koley as CTO, very, very happy with this hire. Just as a reminder, Bikash hasn't actually joined us yet, but we anticipate that he will in the next month. What he brings to the table are a number of different things, but I'll just sort of summarize it in a couple of different ways. First and foremost, you know that we have over the last couple of years, really honed in our strategy on what we believe is the biggest trend that is impacting our industry. And that is the Cloud. It's by no means saying that this means that it's just around the hyperscalers or the cloud operators. Cloud is in fact an architectural evolution that's becoming a way of life across every vertical that we participate in today. And all of our customers in these verticals, whether they be Telco, Cable, Enterprises, government and of course the hyperscalers are looking for real leadership from a product direction, from a services direction that helps them to make this transition to a cloud architecture that helps them become far more agile and to save money, just as the hyperscale providers have demonstrated can be possible. And of course, Bikash has been a part of that at his current employer, Google. Secondarily, I believe and I've always believed that having real technical knowledge, not just in the products themselves, but in the operation of products and the operations of networks, allow you to develop better solutions for your customers. And Bikash has that as well. I mean, he has now spent a number of years running what is a large network. And that knowhow helps us in developing better solutions, I think, for all of our customer base. Moving on to the question around Security, so yes, we would look to both organic or inorganic. But quite frankly, the focus right now on Security has been on achieving stability and returning to growth. And that means a lot of organic work execution that's necessary to turn around this part of our business. We continue to enhance our product offering with recent emphasis on the enterprise and the mid-range where we actually start – have started to see some momentum. We are getting positive data points from customers, from partners. We're seeing some geo specific momentum so, whereas, EMEA was a bit of a challenge for us in the Q2 timeframe. Actually there was momentum in Security in EMEA, which gives us some confidence that we're innovating in the right way. And very importantly, Security has become a critical element of some of these future modes of engagements with our customers. So as we talk to our customers around SD-WAN, for example, one of the really differentiating attributes of our SD-WAN solution is that it has Security embedded. So while we're starting to win opportunities in the SD-WAN space, we haven't yet seen the revenue that will help the Security number, which I anticipate we will start to see in the future. Once we get the stability, I think, yeah, there is certainly a possibility for us to start to look at inorganic approaches to accelerate the momentum in our business. But we're taking a deliberate, methodical approach right now to this part of our business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mitch Steves of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. I did want to return back a little bit to the strategic angle, because I think this is the first time in a while when the net cash balance has gone up three times in a row. So it seems like you have quite a lot of flexibility to go after a new asset. So I'm obviously not looking for names here, but can you maybe talk about what type of technology you guys would be interested in at this point?
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Well, so if you look at – what we've done just historically, we've made a couple of acquisitions in the optical space. We believe there is an architectural inflection point where customers can achieve vast levels of cost efficiency by managing and operating their networks across packet and optical. And then the last one was a company called AppFormix, which is around automation, in particular, in the cloud data center, but has much broader applicability than that. And that would be sort of indicative of what you might expect in the future as well. I just mentioned Security. Even in the domain of Security, I think any sort of inorganic activity that we would contemplate or explore would be more around the new modes of security, not so much of around sort of the physical perimeter firewall which is current mode. New mode is around enabling customers to migrate to public clouds or to hybrid cloud offerings without compromising their data, their users, their workloads. I think, there's quite a bit of innovation right now in the industry in that domain and that would be an area that we would consider as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Moskowitz of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to build off of the Cloud theme throughout the earlier questions, in terms of understanding dual sourcing. Do you think that Juniper is benefiting from just the general tide rising? Or are you seeing clouds now articulate their dual sourcing or even triple sourcing of certain product? And then, kind of the offshoot of that question is, is your Security portfolio as it stands today, kind of, building off of James's question, is it inhibiting any sort of further penetration at certain cloud accounts because of holes in the portfolio? Thank you.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Mark, first, I want to understand a little bit more about your first question. When you say dual sourcing, are you talking about the intent of cloud providers to dual source their...
Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Two vendors.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: To have, yeah...
Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: The dual vendors, dual – two vendors.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yes. I mean, the Cloud vertical for us is not a new vertical. I mean, we have been in this vertical now for as long as I can remember. And we have been, sort of, intimately tied down at the engineering level with our cloud customers now for a number of years. And it's always been a very competitive environment. So, by no means do I ever feel like there – that we don't need to be on our toes. We're always having to demonstrate to them how we're innovating in ways that are very, very specific to the kinds of network that they're building out, the operational models that they want to deploy, the telemetry capabilities that they want, et cetera, et cetera. And yeah, some of them do have sort of an internal strategy to go to dual vendor – dual vendors to procure that technology. But even in those circumstances, our goal is to always get the lion's share by demonstrating that we can perform better or innovate in a more appropriate way for their business. On Security, and I think, the question was around whether we're driving Security products in the Cloud vertical. And that certainly is the case, but I will say that different cloud providers have very different security requirements and security models that they deploy inside of their networks. In some cases, they believe in the big iron that sits at the edge of their data centers, for example, and secures traffic going in and out of those data centers. For that, we have a fantastic product, our high-end SRX. But that business will be very lumpy from quarter-to-quarter depending on where the deployments are. In other cases, it's really more around securing through micro segmentation inside of the cloud network. And that's really more around a software approach to security, and that's more of an emerging opportunity for us at Juniper.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. I just want to clarify what's the thinking on gross margins. What's the confidence that for the corporate levels that we're at a floor for the long term here (45:02)? Apart from software rising in the mix, the product mix that's going on, what other factors should we think about? I think 62% (45:09) do you think, or are there other factors to think about over the next 12 months? Thanks.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. So we did, obviously, guidance for Q3 at 62.0%, plus or minus 0.5 point. For the full year, I still expect the gross margin to be in that 62% to 63% range that we talked about on the last call. That's really the line what we expect, and we still continue to focus on earnings expansion. And I expect earnings to expand actually at a faster rate than revenue for FY 2017. So that's something we're very focused on for this year, kind of, despite some of the gross margin headwinds that we're seeing. From a longer term, I'm not going to provide guidance beyond this year, but I will say that there's a tremendous amount of focus internally on gross margin. Clearly, it all starts with the right product and innovation and product differentiation. And that's something that Juniper really has historically been our strong suit and that will continue to be our strong suit going forward. So making sure we provide the right products at the right price point is something we'll continue to drive. There's opportunity within our cost structure, we've been working on it for the last couple of years, but I still think there's some opportunity to get our cost structure down particularly in the area of designing for value, making sure that we're spending some of our technical resource on not just features and performance, but also some of the cost drivers that matter to our customers today. And last but not least is the software business, which we mentioned on multiple times. In addition to all this focus on gross margin, we're going to continue to be very focused on OpEx management and overall profitability and that's really what's driving a lot of our business decisions today.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Maybe, Kulbinder, it's worthwhile just summarizing the areas of focus that we currently have with respect to gross margins. First, there is opportunity when it comes to value engineering. And there is a concerted effort right now in the company to optimize our products for cost of goods sold in a way that will help gross margins. Secondarily, I mean, Ken has mentioned how we've gone after strategic customer insertions in particular in APAC, and we need those to pay off over time. Third, there's innovation. And one of the questions I was just asked around where are you contemplating inorganic moves, one area I did not mention is the area of silicon photonics. The primary reason is because we believe that there is an opportunity there through innovation to achieve better cost of goods sold from an optical standpoint. And last but not least, it's around business models and it's around software. It's around selling the value through Contrail, virtual security, SD-WAN. All of these emerging opportunities I think have the ability to not just help top line, but to also help gross margins. But they're largely going to be gated by how fast the industry moves. Now, we're out there sort of really selling the value to our customers. We're encouraged by the wins that we're getting, but it's sort of the timing of the benefit is not 100% clear at this point.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Suva of Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much. I know gross margins has been a key topic, and I think that's because investors are so focused on the year-over-year declines, yet the revenues increases. So revenue's going up which is great. Margin's coming down and is a concern for investors. So I have two questions, one on that and then one just on the Security side. So on the gross margins, are we at a level now where gross margins are going to stop going lower or is it more mix-dependent and they potentially could go lower strategically as you look forward to the future? And I do understand the three things you laid out, but I'm just kind of thinking about this bigger picture. Then my second question is on Security, it was down 12% year-over-year. You laid out some (49:17). How should we think about security going forward? Should we kind of expect that to decline going forward until those holes are plugged? Or why are revenues growing yet your Security is declining? Thank you.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Jim, let me start with the Security question first. So, I outlined the main areas of focus. I also provided some of the data points that we are now picking up on that give us some confidence that the work that we are putting in is going to pay off for us. I believe the second half and in particular Q4 would be sort of a quarter that I would expect to start seeing some year-over-year growth in the security market. So that's how I view the opportunity right now in Security and how we are expecting the rest of year to pan out. And Ken, do you want to talk a little bit more about gross margins?
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Sure. So as you mentioned, Jim, there's a balance that we're trying to achieve here. So clearly, revenue growth is one of our highlights for the first half. We were up 9% for the first half, 7% for Q2, 11% for Q1. That did come at a gross margin decrement, but overall, we're growing gross profits. And gross profits really lead to earnings expansion, and that's really where we're focusing as a company. We had very strong earnings expansion in the first half, and I continue to see earnings expansion for the full year. From a where is margin headed, we did talk about 62% for Q3 guidance, because we expect similar dynamics that we saw in Q2 to persist in Q3. And since the revenue levels are similar, we'd expect the margin levels to also be kind of similar in that range. Beyond that, we've already mentioned all the initiatives to work on gross profit going forward and gross margin going forward, but we aren't providing any guidance beyond the FY 2017 kind of color that we've already provided. It's hard to say – given the dynamic nature, it's really difficult to have visibility into gross margins beyond kind of the next couple of quarters at this point.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Silverstein of Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.
Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks. At the risk of never being allowed back in the queue, I've got a couple of questions for you. One, I appreciate all the questions with gross margin, but I've got a very simple question. What is the rate of price erosion year-over-year all in? Secondly, within the Cloud, and I appreciate the mix you've been giving on customers, but within the Cloud segment, can you talk about the mix between Tier 1 cloud titans versus the bulk of the cloud, and also the product mix within Cloud? And finally, the exact 2H, where 2H falls out for the year in terms of revenue, how much of that second half dollars is (52:09) influenced by that 10% customer or I assume somewhat lumpy nature of cloud projects in general? I appreciate it. Thank you.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Okay. Paul, let me start with the second one, the Tier 1 versus broader Cloud. We don't break it out, first of all, but I will say the following. Our penetration in the Tier 1s from a Routing standpoint is one that has been in place now for a number of years. So we've certainly had way more runway and way more of an ability to achieve the kinds of penetration across our Tier 1 Cloud customers in the Routing space more so than we've had on the Switching side of things. In Switching, we view it as more of an opportunity. We certainly have a strong Tier 1 presence in Switching, but we have less market share and penetration than we do in Routing. And, therefore, that's certainly a potential growth area for us. In the meantime, I think what I have said on this call in the past is that there is a broader opportunity in the cloud space, not necessarily with the hyperscalers, but the broader cloud market when you look at SaaS providers, regional cloud providers, telco cloud that's here now that we are benefiting from. I mean, a lot of our business momentum in fact is from that tier of cloud provider. And I think that's a very healthy thing. Price erosion, again, is not something that is easy to describe without a whiteboard and some slides. We can certainly do something like that maybe at our next Analyst Day. But it's the nature of this business that we're in. Every time a new port speed is introduced into the market, as it achieves mass adoption, you will expect, as we would do, that pricing will start to go down and it offsets the benefit that you would get from the traffic growth alone in the market. So all up, the Routing space is roughly a sort of a flattish type of total addressable market from a growth standpoint, but traffic is growing at 40% plus year-over-year. So that would give you an idea of the price erosion that we're seeing in that market space. In the data center switching side, there of course, there is price erosion just as there is everywhere. However, I think that market is growing at a faster clip than in the data center and that's why we are so focused on data center switching as part of our strategy.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, and I think you also asked about within the Cloud vertical, the product mix dynamics. And while we don't break out specific products within customer vertical, we have mentioned in the past that the Cloud vertical does have a higher proportion of Switching than say the Telco vertical. That said, it still is predominantly majority of the Cloud vertical is Routing, as most of our revenue is coming from Routing and that applies to the Cloud vertical as well, but we are seeing Switching become a bigger and bigger piece of that overall vertical historically and I think that will continue going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Milunovich of UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Steven Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you. Cisco had some pretty big announcements recently, which I'm assuming you guys looked at and I realize a lot of them are on the campus side, which doesn't affect you. But they did talk about going much more after some of the hyperscalers and having some initial success. They talked about intent-based networking and encryption. I just wondered, kind of, what your analysis is of their products in terms of how perhaps they affect you, both on the positive and the negative side.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Steve. First from the standpoint of hyperscalers, I think we acknowledge that this is a competitive market and especially as we demonstrate the momentum and the success, we can expect that the competitive levels to only intensify. Having said that, I think it really is just a matter of execution for us, execution from the standpoint of how we engage with them, execution from the standpoint of our innovations and on all fronts, I feel good about where we are and where we're going relative to the hyperscaler opportunity, in addition to the broad Cloud opportunity that is before us. And as far as Cisco's announcement, I have been now for two or three years talking about automation as being the next big thing in networking. There's a very important reason for that. If you think about what our customers across every vertical want more than anything else, it is the ability to move fast, to innovate quickly and to do so with a certain level of cost efficiency. You achieve that by first, providing them with innovative Routing, Switching, and Security products that outpace Moore's Law from an economics of traffic movement standpoint. But importantly, considering that most of our customers invest far more in the cost of operations than they do in CapEx, the only way to address that problem is through automation. And for that reason, we've always had a lot of automation capabilities across our platforms, whether it be the automation capabilities of our systems themselves, the API driven nature of those systems, Contrail has a way of automating Cloud operation, AppFormix has an ability to provide machine learning capabilities to create visibility inside of a Cloud data center, our NorthStar Controller is essentially an automation platform for our wide area. So I think it's good to see our peers in the industry recognize the importance of this trend, and it has been and will continue to be a huge area of focus for us.
Operator: Our final question comes from Jeff Kvaal of Nomura Instinet. Please proceed with your question.
Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you very much. I was hoping to stick with Switching a little bit. I think in the past, you have given us some QFX growth rates as a standalone product family. So I'm wondering if that's feasible and then if you could talk around the dynamics if that's shifting at all and what we should expect going forward. Then the second piece is, EX does end up in some campus environments and that has been up. So, please, help us understand if you think that's sustainable, and that's particularly in light of Cisco's Refresh. Is that likely to impact what you all have going on? Thank you.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. I appreciate the question. In Switching, this is pretty consistent with what we've done historically. We don't necessarily break out the performance of all of our specific product lines. And we didn't do that for QFX in Q2. However, I think it's safe to say that we would not be able to post this type of overall Switching momentum without strong QFX performance. So we're very happy with the performance of our QFX product line in the Q2 timeframe. It's a result of a deliberate strategy and some really solid execution by the team, which I am very proud of. EX is more of a campus-focus product, although it does see some data center and combined campus data center type of converged build-outs. And we saw good momentum there in the Q2 timeframe as well. Our primary strategy is on the data center, the Cloud, and these larger enterprises that are building out their campuses as on ramps to the Cloud. And for that, you need a high degree of performance, operational simplicity and automation and I think the EX from all three of those dimensions is an extremely competitive product.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.
Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Karen. Thank you all for your great questions. As always I want to thank you for those of you who kept your questions to one per firm. For those who didn't, maybe Paul Silverstein, we will talk with you next quarter. Thanks, bye.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Juniper Networks First Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to, Ms. Kathleen Nemeth, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Nemeth. You may now begin.
Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to our first quarter 2017 conference call. Joining me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Miller, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call contains forward-looking statements, including statements concerning Juniper's business, economic and market outlook, strategy, future financial results, capital return program and overall future prospects. Actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in these forward-looking statements are listed in our most recent 10-K, the press release furnished with our 8-K filed today, and in other documents that we file with the SEC from time to time. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances change after the date of the call. Beginning in the first quarter of 2017, we are now providing revenue commentary for our key customer vertical: Cloud, Telecom and Cable, and Strategic Enterprise and we no longer intend to provide revenue commentary on the Service Provider and Enterprise market. For historical revenue information by vertical, please see our CFO Commentary, which is furnished with the 8-K filed today. Our discussion of the financial results today will include non-GAAP results. Reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website under Financial Reports. For important commentary on why our management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult the press release furnished with our 8-K filed with the SEC today. Please keep your questions to one per firm. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Kathleen. Good afternoon, everyone. We were off to a positive start in 2017 and delivered strong year-over-year revenue and earnings growth in the March quarter. Total revenue was $1.221 billion at the high end of our guidance range and we saw year-over-year growth across all customer verticals. We delivered strong profitability metrics with year-over-year growth in non-GAAP operating margin, operating income and diluted earnings per share. We believe we are benefiting from our diversification strategy and I'm pleased with our overall performance. We believe the biggest trend that is driving our industry and our strategy as a company today is the cloud. As the industry evolves, cloud architectures are no longer the exclusive domain of the cloud providers. Customers across all verticals are developing strategies for moving to cloud service delivery models and this aligns with our strategy to power the cloud transformation. I'm pleased with our year-over-year revenue growth of 25% in the Cloud vertical and would point out that our cloud solutions are addressing the cloud transformation across all of our key verticals. In the quarter, we continued to deliver on our innovation roadmap and announced two new solutions for the data center. In January, we announced Juniper Networks Unite Cloud, a transformative data center solution that gives enterprises a simplified way to create and manage hybrid multi-cloud environments. This solution delivers a secure and agile platform and is designed to reduce the total cost of ownership while increasing long-term return on our investments for our customers. At the OFC conference in March, we introduced our data center interconnect solution, Open Cloud Interconnect. This comprehensive DCI solution brings together our strength across packet and optical domains to enable a diverse range of network operators to accelerate cloud service delivery, while simplifying network operations. Earlier this year, we were delighted and honored to receive Vodafone Group's most prestigious award for Supplier of the Year. Juniper is a strategic provider of IP routing and security technology for Vodafone, specifically for next-generation data centers, IP/MPLS (sic) [IP/MLPS] (05:06) backbone and mobile backhaul domains. We believe that our continued strategy to lead in network innovation in key areas such as automation, software-defined networks, and network function virtualization will continue to enable our Telco customers to build new and innovative business models going forward. Now, I'd like to summarize highlights across switching, routing and security. In switching, we saw continued data center strength with our QFX products family, which once again grew over 50% year-over-year and continues to increase as a percentage of our overall switching portfolio mix. We are seeing continued traction in our QFX portfolio as customers across all verticals move to 100-gig, where we have industry-leading products. Our routing business grew year-over-year, driven by another strong quarter of PTX revenue growth as well as modest growth in MX. We continued to see healthy demand for our newest generation of MX line cards, which had a record shipping quarter in Q1. Tremendous work has gone into the security product portfolio that we are very proud of. Juniper's differentiated SDSN strategy has been received very well by industry analysts and customers for its ability to detect and stop threats in a highly automated way. The innovative approach of viewing security as an open platform allows customers to leverage all existing security investments as well as their entire network infrastructure. At RSA, we announced new technology alliance partnerships with leading security providers that simplify deployment of Juniper's security solutions across several customer use cases. Our focus this year in security is on building confidence and momentum with our partners and customers. We believe we are making good progress as evidenced by new logo wins with our newest security products. Several global trials are also underway with managed service providers using Juniper's secure cloud managed enterprise solutions. We saw year-over-year growth in Contrail, and added several new customers in Q1, including a tier 1 operator in Europe. There was a continued expansion of orders within our existing customer base as they increased their deployment footprint. We saw continued strength in our overall services business, which grew 14% year-over-year. I am particularly pleased with the momentum we are seeing in our professional services business, where we had a strategic win at a tier 1 service provider in EMEA. To summarize, we are executing well in a competitive environment and are proud of the strength in our product and services portfolio. The cloud is a massive paradigm shift that is reshaping all industries, and I'm excited about the opportunity we have in front of us. Looking at the remainder of 2017, we expect overall demand to be seasonal and believe our customer diversification is positioning us for growth as we navigate through volatile markets. I want to thank our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. I also want to extend a very big thank you to our employees for their commitment and hard work, which plays a significant role in successfully executing to our strategy and creating value for all of our stakeholders. With that said, I will turn the call over to Ken, who will review our quarterly financial results in more detail.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. The results for the March quarter reflects strong year-over-year revenue and earnings per share growth. From a revenue perspective, all verticals increased year-over-year led by Cloud, which increased 25%. We continued to see strong growth in our QFX product family, which grew over 50% year-over-year. We continued to see strength from our Services business, which grew 14% year-over-year driven by strong renewal and attach rates, as well as the recognition of previously deferred revenue from a telecom customer in Asia Pacific. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, four were Cloud, five were Telecom or Cable and one was a Strategic Enterprise. Of these customers, two were located outside of the United States. Non-GAAP gross margin was within our guided range for the quarter. While non-GAAP service gross margin was strong year-over-year, non-GAAP product gross margin declined 2.2 percentage points. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to customer mix as we expand our footprint with certain strategic APAC telecom and cloud customers as well as the product mix sold into our Cloud vertical. The decrease was partially offset by improvements in our cost structure and higher revenue volume. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $509 million, below our guided range for the quarter, reflecting our ongoing disciplined operating expense management. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to head count costs related to acquisitions completed in fiscal 2016 and higher variable compensation. Non-GAAP earnings per share increased $0.09 year-over-year, primarily driven by higher revenue. We had particularly strong cash flows from operations of $545 million, up $373 million year-over-year. The increase was driven by strong collections in the quarter, partially related to invoicing that occurred late last quarter. As expected, DSO rebounded and was 49 days. The reduction was primarily due to improved invoicing linearity this quarter. We continued to return capital to our shareholders, repurchasing $125 million of shares and paying $38 million in dividends during the first quarter. Now, I'd like to provide some color on our guidance, which you could find detailed in the CFO Commentary available on our website. We remain committed to the financial principles we outlined last quarter. As a reminder, those principles are: we expect revenue growth for 2017; we are focused on earnings expansion with long-term consistency; and finally, we intend to maintain a healthy balance sheet and an optimized capital structure. Although elements of our markets are challenged, we expect to grow revenue this year. We are pleased with our product portfolio and expect to see continued strength from our Cloud vertical. For the remainder of the fiscal year, we anticipate gross margin levels similar to Q1 as we expect the customer and product mix dynamics to continue. Increased pricing for certain memory components could also present an additional headwind. We intend to drive earnings expansion this year through focused execution and operating expense discipline. We also intend to drive to our long-term model of 39% non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenue this year, which is earlier than previously committed. We intend to return approximately 50% of annual free cash flow to our shareholders inclusive of share repurchases and dividends. In closing, I'd like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. Now, I'd like to open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. And now the first question is from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. First for Ken – sorry, for Rami, the switching business was strong. I was hoping you could help us understand the pipeline of opportunities you're seeing with the QFX buying offerings and given these products only became available over the last few quarters, is it reasonable to think, the business here could further strengthen as these opportunities mature? And then for Ken, I was hoping you could touch on the gross margin outlook. You previously talked about being comfortable with 63%. It looks like we'll be trending below that level for the year. Just wanted to understand if there's been a change in the competitive environment, what gives you confidence margins won't continue to deteriorate? And longer term, do you think we can get back to 63%, 64%?
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Hi, Jess, it's Rami. Let me start, and then I'll hand it over to Ken. On the switching side, certainly, we're very pleased with the performance we saw in Q1. A big driver of that performance is in the data center and has a lot to do with the deliberate focused strategy that we've had on the data center, which certainly applies to the large cloud providers, but also other verticals as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. Pretty much every one of our customer verticals now has a set of customers that's moving towards cloud architecture. The heart of that is the data center. We've always been in this space. We've always had a solution, but I would say that we've never had a solution that is this strong and that has the breadth of capabilities, both from a software standpoint, but also from an entire portfolio standpoint, the spine switches with the QFX10000 as well as the top-of-racks with the 5100, 5200s, et cetera. Do I believe that there will be continued momentum? Yes, we have, in our long-term model for this company's growth, been counting on and have provided you with color on where we see our switching business to come in. And that is going to continue to be a big growth driver for the company in the year and longer term. I will also point out that there's another element of our switching business, which is the EX product line and that is in the campus. And although the focus has been on the data center, we're really not taking our eye off the ball in the campus side. And in fact, we have this ability to leverage technologies that we have developed primarily for the data center. Think of our fabric technologies in innovative ways for the campus, and that is actually starting to help us provide some differentiation to our customers for larger campus environments. And for that reason, we actually saw some pretty good momentum in the EX business, which helped overall switching in the Q1 timeframe. With that, Ken, you want to talk a little bit about gross margins?
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Sure, sure. So the gross margin landscape is very dynamic, as you know, Jess, and there are many factors that impact our gross margin. Clearly, you mentioned pricing. I would say the pricing environment is always challenging. We have not seen a broad-based change in that pricing environment. Really what's impacting us in Q1 and for our outlook is really product mix and customer mix. From a customer mix perspective, we are seeing some opportunity to grow with some strategic customers in telecom and cloud, both domestically and abroad, we're taking advantage of that opportunity. That does put some modest pressure on some of our gross margins. In addition to that from a product mix perspective, the strength that we are seeing in switching, which is ahead of our expectations, switching within the Cloud vertical in particular, does have some modest pressure on our margins as well. Last but not least, as it relates to our outlook, we are seeing some pricing pressure on memory. There are some memory components that are under pressure, and we expect that to be a factor for the rest of the year. From a long-term perspective, we remain focused on driving margin improvements. We continue to focus on our cost structure. As the software business picks up, we expect that to be a tailwind for our margins going forward. And obviously our biggest driver is continuing to deliver product innovation to market and monetize that innovation. The last thing I would say is while we are doing our best to maximize margin, we remain very focused on OpEx management and overall profitability. Our goal is to make sure that we have earnings expansion with long-term consistency, and that's what we're really focused on.
Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Thank you. I had a follow-up on each of the questions that was just asked. So first for Rami, thank you for disclosing the Cloud vertical. I did notice that there was a sequential decrease in your routing revenues in the Cloud vertical, and routing missed expectations. So curious if that's because some of those customers are transitioning to QFX when they would have previously used routers? And do you expect your routing business overall to grow with the Cloud vertical? And then for Ken on the gross margin question, you had cited price pressure in the last two quarters, and this quarter, that does not seem to have been a factor. So just wanted to see if that has in fact subsided. But on the flip side, when you're highlighting the cost supplier issue and DRAM prices, is that something you can quantify for us, just so we understand the incremental impact?
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Hi, Simona. I will start with the follow up on routing and switching. And then I'll pass it over to Ken. So our routing businesses always depended on large deals, large customers across the Telco vertical and the Cloud vertical, and for that reason, it's always been lumpy and I think we're seeing some of that dynamic more broadly. Routing, as we all know now, as we have been talking about, we've sort of been predicting, is essentially a flattish type of overall market opportunity for Juniper and for our peers in this industry. We think that we can compete in that environment by taking some modest market share with really competitive products. That's true for Telco, for the Enterprise, for Cloud, for Cable and all of our strategic verticals. That's what's happening really in the cloud space as well, where a lot of the growth is coming in from in the cloud providers, is in switching today. And we're clearly taking more than our fair share there. I think the question underlying the question that you're asking is, is there some sort of a transition that's happening where architectures are moving from routing to switching and so on. The way I view it is that each of our key product sets, whether it be the MX for programmable routing, the PTX for really lean, core transport-oriented routing and the QFX for switching opportunities, they have a sweet spot. One is really targeted for the edge. One is for wide area. One is more for the data center. But even there, what happens is that the line starts to blur, and there will be some shifting, if you will, on the sort of the edges of the use cases between each of these products. But those sweet spots continue to be very important and something that our customers largely respect. There will always be some level of cannibalization, but for the most part, I think the opportunity, in aggregate, with these three technologies under our belt is a growing opportunity.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: From a pricing perspective, Simona, the pricing environment is always a challenging environment, it has been for many, many years in this space. What I mentioned is we didn't see any specific broad-based deterioration beyond what we expected. We always expect pricing pressure, and it largely came in as we expected this quarter. But what we did see though were some strategic selling insertion opportunities. I mentioned customer mix. We are definitely getting strategic in some of the international customers in particular in the telecom and cloud space and these are customers that we are very deliberate with in regard to these deals and we do expect margin to improve over time as our footprint expands. So that does have a pricing impact, but again, it's at a very specific customer level. On the cost of memory side, it is a factor – really the three factors I've mentioned, the customer mix, the product mix and the cost of memory, all relatively weighted pretty evenly as far as our margin guidance of 62.5%, which I believe is still a pretty healthy margin guidance for the year.
Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Tal Liani of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi guys. I have a question on security and question on dividends. Starting with the dividends, you grow faster than Cisco. You take share in key markets. You generate very healthy cash flow. But your dividend yield is half that of Cisco and the price discount -- the stock is trading at 20% discount to Cisco because of that. What's your philosophy, what's your strategy about dividend and an increase in the dividend yield? That's the first question. The second question is about security. You have products and new dynamics, but the revenues were down 10% for the year – year-over-year, can you discuss the outlook for 2017? What are the ups and downs? What are the puts and takes in security growth? And when do you see the inflection point of turning from declines to growth? Thanks.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Tal. Let me start and I'll start with the security question. And then I'll pass it on to Ken to talk a little bit about dividends and the dividend strategy. Well the first, there has been, and there continues to be a tremendous amount of work that's happening inside of Juniper to increase the competitiveness of our products overall, the solutions and security, the feature releases and the new code drops that we're making now are coming out on a very regular basis. And the things that gives me the confidence in our ability to stabilize and then recover and then grow this part of our business is the fact that when I look at key metrics, like the performance of new products with the newer capabilities that we have introduced into the market over the last, let's say, six to nine months, there's growth there. There is in fact momentum. The feedback from our partners, our customers is positive. And there is in fact sales achievement and revenue growth that we are seeing in that part of the business. It's just not fast enough to offset the decline in some of the older products. So eventually, I think the math starts to work in our favor. We need a little bit of patience and a lot more of the very hard work that I know that is going across the entire company right now to get this back to stability and then to growth. And I expect in the second half of the year that we can get to growth. I will just point out that the big part of the focused effort right now is on rebuilding confidence, rebuilding the channel and of course, one win at a time, including new logos that we have just gotten in the Q1 timeframe. I think we can get this back on track.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. And as we previously committed to, the 50% of free cash flow is what we're comfortable with for this year. That would be inclusive of both share repurchases and dividends. And we'll look to be opportunistic with our share buyback programs throughout the year. That said, we're always looking to optimize our capital structure, and we will reevaluate things as things change. For example, our financial performance, our cash needs, as well as our valuation will all be factors into some reevaluation of our capital return program. In addition, we've obviously paid attention to what's going on with the new administration with tax repatriation and/or tax changes. So those could be other factors that we'll have to consider when and if they come to fruition.
Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. Just one question will be on (25:51) this year. For the verticals you are talking about; the Cloud, the Telco and Cable, and Enterprise, can you speak about any trends we should be aware of? For example, could the cloud business start facing difficult compares and start to decelerate? Is that something we should think about at some point as we start exiting maybe 2017? And then on the Telco side, I think it was better than we thought. Can you just give us some details behind what drove that in Q1? Thanks.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Hi, Kulbinder, it's Rami. So let me start. First of all, I think the most important thing here is diversification. It's not just about Cloud, it's not just about Telco. It's really about broadening and making sure that we are diversified really along three dimensions: first is in the technologies, so it's Routing, Switching, Security; second is in the Telcos and – sorry, the verticals; Telcos and Cloud and so forth; and then also it's about geo. So, for example, we're starting to see good momentum or early momentum with the cloud providers in Europe. We're starting to see also early momentum with the cloud providers in Asia Pacific. So that diversification strategy has paid off well for us in the last couple of years and I expect it to continue to pay off well for us. Any one of these verticals is going to be lumpy. Right? I just mentioned, for example, Routing has always been somewhat lumpy as it pertains to the Cloud vertical or the Telco vertical, and I would expect that to remain the same going forward. Anything you want to add, Ken, to that? Okay. Thanks for the question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Kvaal of Instinet. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Instinet LLC: Yes. Thanks very much. A question and a clarification. I think in the past you all have talked about 3% to 6% revenue growth as a CAGR. I'm wondering if that sort of applies to this year? And if so, what are the puts and takes to the low and high-end of that range? And then secondly, Ken, at one point, you had sort of passed on a chance to endorse 63% as a longer-term model, but then you said you think some of the new contracts that you've won in Asia and in cloud will grow the margins over time. So I'm wondering if we can pin you down a little bit on that long-term model. Thanks.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: The gross margin?
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yes.
Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.: First, yeah, the revenue...
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: So let's talk about revenue first, and I'll talk about the numbers and then, Rami, maybe you could talk about what would put us on the high-end, low-end of that range. So at this point, based on what we see today, we are comfortable with the 3% to 6%, which is our long-term model. In fact, I would say we're comfortable with kind of the midpoint of that range for this year. So that's really the numbers we're looking at for this year.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: As far as overachievement or underachievement, clearly we're seeing a lot of strength in the cloud space as well as in the switching business. Telco and routing remains a challenging market, and we think that it will be relatively flattish for us and maybe some modest growth in that sector and those technologies.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: From a gross margin, again, I mean it's dynamic. Five-tenths of a margin point is difficult to get right every quarter. I do think that we have some lumpiness in revenue as well as margins ahead. Customer mix and product mix will be up and down. The Q1 result was very much in line with our expectations and the guidance we put out there. I do think the 63% for the year is not out of the question. However, I think it's prudent for us to plan the P&L and focus on earnings growth even with margin headwinds continuing. So that's really what we're basing a lot of our guidance on now.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: I want to just add to that. I completely agree with everything Ken just said. When you're operating in an environment where your customer mix is changing, the technology mix is changing, we're seeing a geo mix change as well, and in certain strategic initiatives like penetration to the cloud we're even ahead of where we expect it to be right now. Predicting gross margins can be somewhat tricky. With that said, there are a number of activities across the company right now all focused on improving gross margins. And we're running the business, as Ken just mentioned, with the assumptions that current levels are going to be here for a while, just in case. So that's I think the way that you should think about how we're running the business and the dynamics of the industry that we operate in right now and our strategy as it pertains to those dynamics.
Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Instinet LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Rod Hall of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Nicholas Rodney Hall - JPMorgan Securities Plc: Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I wanted to just check on cloud revenue. You guys had said I think your target was 24% of company revenue by 2019, and obviously you've blown through that, assuming it's the same basis that we're talking about. So is it the same basis, I guess? And then if it is, what sort of longer-term target do you have for a proportion of the company revenue given the trajectory? And then along the same lines, could you talk about that cloud revenue this year? The disclosure shows it sequentially increasing every quarter last year. Is that likely to be the case again this year? Can you just kind of help us understand what you expect from the trajectory there? Thanks.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yes, Rod, let me start, and I'll start with the second question, and then Ken can talk a little bit about the baseline. I know because we've now just re-categorized how we're reporting our numbers, so a little bit of expectation will probably be helpful. Will there be consistent, sequential growth throughout the year in any vertical? Honestly, it's very difficult to predict that because all of our verticals, Cloud included, is going to be lumpy. The fact that we are now in both Routing and Switching in any one vertical, Security to a lesser extent, but Routing and Switching, helps to offset some of that lumpiness. But I expect that the lumpiness will exist and will remain in effect. The good news is I still feel very good about our ability to compete in the Cloud vertical. How close we are to our customers in the Cloud vertical, our ability to understand their requirements, their architecture, and the kinds of innovation that we need to put in place to participate in the Cloud vertical, and on all those counts I feel very good.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: And as it relates to our baseline, you have the numbers right. So we disclosed 19%, moving to 24% of our revenue. That would be a growth rate of 10% to 13%. We did recast the verticals, and the Cloud vertical actually is now up a couple points. So actually the 19% turns to 21% of our business in 2015 with cloud. So the target would move up a couple points as well to 26% of our business. Growth rate targets remain the same. However, we are seeing higher pickup in the cloud than we expected, so we're clearly outpacing those growth rates at this point in the model.
Nicholas Rodney Hall - JPMorgan Securities Plc: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Aaron Rakers of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions. And I hate to follow-up on another cloud question. But as we're now focused on that vertical, and we can see the dynamics separately in your results, I'm curious if you could help us understand the concentration or the diversification rather of your customer base within that vertical and how you would characterize your visibility in that vertical relative to your traditional service provider or Enterprise vertical?
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. We can talk about the cloud all day long, because it really is such an important vertical for us, and it's a very deliberate part of our strategy, so no problem at all, Aaron. First, when you think about the cloud opportunity, I want to emphasize again that it really touches every vertical that I'm talking about the cloud opportunity all up. There are certainly those that were born in the cloud, the large cloud providers. There are those that have aspiration to become cloud providers. Think of the telcos and the cable operators that are now re-architecting their networks to deliver cloud services. And then there are those enterprises that see the value in moving workloads and applications to the cloud. All of these are an element of our cloud strategy. The way in which we approach each can vary a little bit. So, for example, our large cloud provider customers have an ability to do a lot of the software developments on their own, but then we developed really innovative technologies like Contrail, our SDN controller, to essentially help automate and secure cloud for the enterprise and for the telco and cable space. That's just to say that all of these verticals really apply. Now if the question is specifically around, sort of, our ability to predict the performance, our performance in the cloud provider vertical itself, I think any one quarter, a quarter here and there you're going to see lumpiness, you're going to see variations in the performance just based on their appetite to spend and where they are in certain projects and certain deployments. But generally speaking, when we talk to them, when we see industry reports, when we understand their own plans, and when we see their own performance, I mean, you see how they are performing in their respective markets, we feel good about the fact that they will continue to rely on networks as a foundation of their business, and we also feel good about our ability to satisfy their networking requirements. It's a very competitive environment, but I feel very confident in our technology.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Jim Suva of Citi. Please go ahead.
Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much. The majority of the Q&A has been focused on the products and the new segments, which is fair. Now that we're getting towards the end of the conference call, could you touch briefly on Security? I don't think I heard it mentioned how should we view the Security segment within Juniper and kind of the trajectory, it's been kind of a rough last year in Security division when we look about year-over-year growth. Thank you.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Sure, Jim. So, I did mention earlier the fact that Security right now, there's quite a lot of effort that has gone into improving our products, making them competitive, differentiating in the solutions that we offer to our customers. And I think we're seeing very good momentum specifically in the newer technologies and solutions we've introduced into the market. I mentioned the fact that there is a concerted effort right now in terms of go-to-market, marketing, rebuilding our channels, and rebuilding confidence in our customers and our partners' mind where we have quite frankly lost some of that confidence. That's where the effort is. The only additional thing I will say is that there are really strong synergies between Security and the rest of our portfolio. So synergies are on the cost side where we tend to leverage a lot of the software development as well as the silicon technology across Routing and Switching into Security, and increasingly we're seeing actually very solid revenue synergies. If you think about what our SDSN, software-defined secure network, strategy is all about, it's about enabling our customers to use their network infrastructure in an intelligent way to provide a secure fabric, a very secure fabric to prevent essentially their infrastructure, their data, their workloads from being compromised. That is essentially enabling us to sell Security along with Routing and Switching in the data center or in the campus. So I mean that's the other really important element of how we're approaching Security that I think is important for you to understand.
Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And my follow-up, the turnaround for the sustainable revenue growth, you mentioned a lot of effort into it. When shall we see the fruit of those efforts start to bear?
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. So I think that we're in the process of stabilizing right now. The newer products are growing. The older products are declining. The math is not working for overall growth. This year I think is going to be a critical year for us as we get back to stability and growth probably in the latter half of the year.
Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much for the details. Greatly appreciated.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: You're welcome. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. Yeah. Hi, Rami, Ken.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Hello.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Hi, Vijay.
Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, hi. I have a bigger-picture question, Rami, which is Juniper and Arista are comparable in market cap now. I mean my view is how would you benchmark productivity per employee versus your peers such as Arista who have significantly lower head count versus Juniper. And then also any thoughts on exiting underperforming areas such as Security to just improve overall fundamentals, better allocate resources to the more productive product portfolio? Thanks.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Well, Vijay, I mean I'll just say that we understand that we operate in a competitive environment. We have competitors that are larger. We have competitors that are smaller than us. The key to our success is to focus, and if you look at what we have done over the last couple of years, there has been an incredible amount of effort put into streamlining our business, pruning our product portfolio to areas where we know that we can invest to compete effectively, and I think we're demonstrating our ability to do just that. The new products that we have now delivered into the market space, especially in the domain of the PTX routing, in our QFX switching, in the new MX line-cards that we have introduced are all essentially doing as we expected. They're growing nicely across our key verticals, and that's what you can expect more from us in the future. I think there was a second part of the question that I've now forgotten.
Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. The second part of the question was, any thoughts on exiting underperforming areas such as Security and then pouring the resource into product portfolios that are selling in the market?
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. I appreciate that question. Of course, I have to always, as CEO of this company evaluate the performance of any one of our products, technology areas, and businesses. I would just say that as it pertains to Security, which is I think what your question is about, the focus at this period of time is on turning around this business. The data points that we're getting from our customers, our partners are all very positive at this point, and the synergies are really good. The cost synergies and our ability to leverage technology actually enabled us to achieve: A, differentiation; and very solid efficiency in how we develop the technology that's underlying Security. And then there is the revenue synergies on top of that. So that's how I'm thinking about it right now.
Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Tim Long of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you. Maybe we could touch on the services business for a minute and talk a little bit. It sounds like renewal and attach rates have been pretty strong for last few quarters here. Understanding it was a catch-up in the quarter. But could you just talk a little bit about sustainability of the success there? Can we expect this to keep kind of outgrowing products? And then also related to that, how we should think about gross margin leverage as that business continues to grow? Thank you.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yes. Thanks for the question. So the service business continues to be a highlight for us. It's a very healthy business for us. On the revenue side, the key is what you mentioned, the attach rates, the renewal rates, and the focus there over the past several quarters is really starting to pay off as we're seeing the revenue growth consistently do well. As you mentioned, we did benefit this quarter from approximately $15 million of revenue that came off of the balance sheet. So you have to factor that in as you start thinking about the rest of the year. But I do expect Security after you normalize – I'm sorry, services, after you normalize for that $15 million, to be up quarter-on-quarter kind of back to our sequential patterns that we normally see in this business. From a longevity perspective, I would expect services to outpace product but not to the same degree that it has over the last several quarters. It will eventually start to normalize closer together on the growth rate perspective. Gross margin wise, numbers we've been posting lately, the 63% to 64% is really what we're focused on going forward.
Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Next question, please.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Jayson Noland of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. Ken, just a housekeeping, book-to-bill if you haven't given it. And then a broader question on Security. Rami, if you could – press release cites some weakness in high-end SRX. If you could talk about that a little bit and then the opportunity in virtual SRX it looks like you put some marketing dollars behind that recently.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Jayson. Let me start with that and then I'll pass it on to you, Ken. The high-end SRX it addresses a market opportunity that's primarily geared towards telecom providers, especially in the mobile space. And that part of the business is just going to be lumpy. It's going to have fluctuation depending on build outs for typically Tier 1 service providers. The other thing is we have not yet refreshed that part of our portfolio for some time, but we're working on a roadmap to do so that I think will eventually contribute to that business. The virtual SRX, I mean that's a that's an example of how we think about our strategy on a couple of different time horizons. There is the here and now and how our customers are typically building out their security posture today. And then there is what we expect in the future. Clearly, as the perimeter around the enterprise disappears, as workloads and applications moves to the cloud, the security architectures evolve and virtual security offerings become far more important. And we actually have a really differentiated virtual security solution – the virtual SRX that is in the market, that is gaining good traction, but it's still a small market opportunity for this period of time. It's an example of innovation that, we believe, will help us in the second horizon of our strategy in the sort of two, three, four, five year timeframe.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. On the book-to-bill question as our business continues to evolve, and preferred revenue (45:33) grows over time, we believe the commentary around preferred revenue (45:34) is a more meaningful demand metric. So we decided not to disclose book-to-bill any more on a quarterly basis. We will be disclosing backlog on an annual basis going forward in addition to the deferred revenue details.
Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks guys.
Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.: And as we said, Jayson, that's in line with our peers in terms of that book-to-bill metric, disclosing that metric.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great, thank you. Couple of things I want to ask. One is, in the release, you talk about, I guess, some problems you had with a particular product and some COGS reversals. Could you elaborate a little bit on what happened there, and whether or not that affected any revenue, whether it caused any delays, and how you're remediating that in terms of timing? And then the thing I was trying to understand and back to the cloud, I'm wondering if your cloud vertical has a similar mix, or how the mix compares relative to your overall in terms of percent of revenue coming from Routing, Switching and Security? How does that mix look for the cloud vertical in particular? Thank you.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Well, let me start with the second one, and Ken, you might need to help me with this one. Switching versus Routing mix in the cloud. Now we know that, like I have mentioned I think a couple of times on this call, the business is going to be lumpy. And it's going to be lumpy both in Switching and in Routing. A lot of the growth in the Q1 timeframe for example in the cloud vertical came in Switching. But in the past, there were quarters were it has actually come in more in the Routing. In terms of mix, I don't know if we provided that detail.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. So historically, what we talked about is the cloud vertical mix was largely in line with the Juniper overall mix. So Routing, Switching, Security as Juniper goes, the cloud vertical is largely moving that. As we're seeing more success in Switching, we are seeing some of that mix shift towards Switching faster in that vertical than some of the other verticals.
Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: I believe that you are referring to...
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: I'm sorry, on the cost, the cost COGS, cost of goods sold information, sorry, on the GAAP results, I think you're talking about a supplier component remediation cost that we had, and it actually started in Q4. We are working with our customers and a third-party supplier. There are certain products we have a clock signal component defect. This is kind of an industry-wide fairly well known situation. We did take a charge in Q4 and we trued up that charge this quarter. We do believe we're handling it very effectively with our customer base and managing through this situation.
Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And has that affected your revenue at all? Have you pushed out any sales because of that? That was what I was trying to get at?
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: No, no. It did not have an impact on revenue. It's really more about a proactive approach we're taking to make sure it doesn't have an impact on customers from a quality perspective. We have not seen any actual quality issues to date, but we want to make sure we avoid those going forward and it has not had any impact on revenue.
Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thanks for the clarification.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Sure.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: You're welcome. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was just kind of wondering on kind of the QFX family, I know it was up 50% this quarter year-over-year. How do we think about the refresh cycle there? And how long should this kind of outsized growth last?
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, thanks for the question, Mitch. It's honestly very difficult to answer the question, just because the volume of customers that we now have that are buying QFXs from us across all verticals is very large. And I don't know if you can really put any patterns to it. The one pattern sort of out there is just the 100-gig option. Where there are large data center deployments that require 100-gig connectivity, that's where Juniper just differentiates even more. This is where the density of our products, our Routing stack, the logical scale of our QFX technology starts to really stand out. And for that reason, if you look at our Switching growth, especially as it pertains to the data center over the last few years, it has been quite good. Now if you narrow your analysis and you look specifically on market share in the over 10-gig connectivity space, there we're taking market share even faster. And that's just again because of the fact that where there are high-performance networking problems to be solved, we tend to just stand out among our peers in the industry.
Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Moskowitz of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Thanks, good afternoon. I just had a quick clarification here, did you guys comment on the cloud with respect to, is it accretive to the model from a gross margin or operating margin perspective? Just kind of curious if gross margin is lower, but maybe on the operating margin side is better? And then my actual question is, Rami, I want to get a sense here just given the greater transparency around the cloud business and the better momentum, is this why back in early March, you announced the expanded organizational focus related to R&D with Kevin and Andy? Does this really mean you need to have a little more focus in terms of servicing your legacy customers, but also your cloud customers from a technology roadmap perspective longer term?
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, sure. Let me start on the organizational piece. I don't think I would view this from the standpoint of it being specific to any one vertical. I just reached the conclusion that having a flatter organization will result in an ability to execute with more consistency, to move faster with fewer layers in the organization to address what is a very dynamic market opportunity. As it pertains to the cloud providers themselves, we have sort of understood the recipe for how to succeed there for quite a long period of time, where it really has to be an engagement model that is at the engineer-to-engineer level. We are connected with them on a first name basis down throughout the entire organization. And that's really what's required to achieve the necessary understanding of the direction of their architecture and what has enabled us to be successful.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. And from a cloud vertical margin perspective, I would just state that from a gross margin perspective the primary driver within the cloud vertical will be product mix, not the cloud vertical itself. So as it shifts more towards Switching which is what we're seeing now and what we kind of expect to see for the rest of the year that would have a detriment to the telco vertical as an example which is predominantly Routing. But it's not because of the customer itself, it's really more the product mix going into that vertical. From an operating margin perspective, we really don't take the operating margin down to vertical. Most of our cost, most of our OpEx is really shared across all our verticals, we don't segregate it between vertical. So you would see the same – if you were to allocate it out, you would see a similar profile in the op margin as you would on the gross margin, because everything else would be relatively equally and revenue proportionate. I would say, although it is, as the shifts to Switching, you're seeing some margin pressure there, it's very healthy margins. We're very comfortable with the cloud vertical and the mix within the cloud vertical, and in fact that we are ahead of schedule in some of our transitions into the high performance Switching into that vertical, and that's really a good thing overall.
Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Okay. Next question?
Operator: Thank you. Our final question comes from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you for taking my question. What (53:56) answer couple of longer term strategic questions. First, how do you think about – back to a question Simona asked earlier on the call about the ability to choose between Switching and Routing. How do you think about the opportunity for things like virtual routing et cetera and how does that impact your business strategy (54:17). And then second thing is, in terms use of capital, where does your acquisition strategy stand today, or how does that fit within your use of capital. And then my last question, just on operating expenses, obviously, you continue to control those very well. How should we think about the development of OpEx going forward? Thank you very much.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thanks James. Your voice was kind of choppy, so I hope that I got the questions all correctly. You can tell me if I didn't. First in the virtual routing, and I'll extend that to include virtual routing, virtual security. There is certainly an element of the networking industry all up that can be addressed with virtual technologies as opposed to just hardware. Typically, these are going to be more service oriented. They're going to be at the edge of the network. It's very difficult to solve a large core opportunity or a data center spine opportunity with just software or just virtual products. And that obviously is where Juniper has excelled historically. It's where our differentiation mostly has existed in the past. Having said that, as the world moves towards cloud architectures and our customers have the ability to deliver services using a cloud service delivery model that presents an opportunity for us to start to offer virtual versions of our products, like virtual security being an example of that. It's typically going to be for more scale out type of applications, think of the CPE space where the physical CPE business has generally been a small revenue generator for Juniper. Now as the industry transitions to a virtual equivalent model to the CPE space, we view this in fact as a great opportunity for us to go and to participate in. And from an M&A standpoint, no new news there other than we continue to look at M&A strategically as a way of accelerating the strategies that we have talked to you about in the past and we're executing on today. So we're not looking at this to get into adjacent markets. We want to look at this from the standpoint of really accelerating a strategy that we are operating in today. And then last, but not least, is on the operational expenditures, Ken, I'll let you close on that.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. So we're very pleased with our Q1 OpEx results which came in below the guidance despite the annual reset of variable compensation and kind of typical seasonal patterns in fringe costs. We're very, very happy with our performance. We are targeting 39% of OpEx as a percentage of revenue for the year, which is in line with our long-term target, but actually ahead of schedule. So we're also very pleased with that OpEx discipline going forward. We're always looking to drive efficiencies, but it's beyond efficiencies. We're also looking to make sure we align our workforce to our long-term strategy and make sure that we're able to deliver growth going forward as well. So we believe we could accomplish all of those objectives of keeping expansion in mind throughout the way.
James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: You guys got them all. Sorry about the bad connection.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: No problem. Thank you.
Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, James. And unfortunately, that is all the time we have today. We'd like to thank each of you for your participation, and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.

Rami Rahim: Thank you Kathleen and good afternoon everyone. Reflecting back on 2016, I'm pleased with how we've executed, gained momentum throughout the year and delivered on our objective to grow revenue for the full year. Revenue of $4.990 billion increased approximately 3% from 2015. Our innovation engine at Juniper has resulted in the introduction of several new products addressed the sweet spot of where the biggest market opportunities in networking lie today. We entered 2017 with an outstanding product portfolio and a determination to enable our customers to fuel their cloud businesses or to successfully migrate to cloud architectures. We've delivered on our innovation pipeline while maintaining a sharp focus on disciplined expense management and investing prudently in our longer term growth opportunities. As a result, we expanded full year non-GAAP earnings in 2016 and we expect to see earnings expansion again in 2017 as we look to 2017 we are energized by the opportunities we see from the shift toward the cloud and network automation. The cloud transformation is our primary area of strategic focus and we believe our history and innovation leader and our deep understanding of high performance networking technology position us extremely well to capitalize on this industry transition. Now I would like to summarize the highlights across switching, routing and security. We are very pleased with our strong performance in switching where we saw strong growth in the data center and with cloud and content providers. Our focus on the cloud opportunity has resulted in a fast growing data center switching portfolio. Our QFX family of products saw strong demand with revenue increasing approximately 90% year over year in Q4 and over 50% for fiscal year 2016. Our routing business continues to perform well with both sequential and year-over-year growth in Q4. We have been particularly pleased to see the healthy growth of the routing business in our cloud vertical and view that as proof of our differentiation across both the MX and PTX product families. PTX had another record revenue quarter while MX revenue also increased sequentially as new line card demand continues to grow. In addition, we saw a healthy demand for new MX chassis, a healthy signal for continued interest in our MX portfolio. Our Contrail business continues to show good growth sequentially and year over year, and it diversified across geographies and across various cloud customer segments such as telecom service providers, SaaS, large enterprises and cable MSOs. In Q4, we had a number of marquee customer wins across these sectors and geographies while continuing to get subscription renewals and capacity expansion revenues from existing customer wins. These customer wins enable us to expand our hardware footprint as we help them operationalize next generation services using cloud architectures and high performance networks. In Q4, we acquired AppFormix to complement the analytics and machine learning capabilities of Contrail and to help customers enhance their cloud operations. Various independent research surveys have concluded that Contrail is one of the most widely adopted commercial cloud networking solutions in the market. And we are pleased to see that Contrail is proving to be our customers preferred choice for cloud networking. 2015 was a challenging year for our security business. Having said that, I'm confident that we're taking all the right steps to turn around this part of our business. We have significantly refreshed our product portfolio with new price competitive and feature rich firewall appliances, vastly improve security management with Junos Space Security Director and advanced deception techniques and machine learning to catch zero days threat with Sky ATP. We believe we are gaining mind share from customers, partners and analysts with our refreshed portfolio in the enterprise and expect growth from security in 2017. I want to thank our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in Juniper. Finally, I want to extend the very big thank you to our employees around the globe who each play an important role in successfully executing to our strategy and creating value for all of our stakeholders. With that I will turn the call over to Ken who will review our quarterly and full-year financial results in more detail.
Ken Miller: Thank you Rami and good afternoon everyone. The results for the December quarter reflect record revenue as well as non-GAAP earnings per share growth. Both telecom and cloud providers were up sequentially and cloud providers grew more than 50% year over year. We also saw significant year over year growth from our PTX family of products and QFX product line continued to be strong in the data center with growth of approximately 90% year over year. Our services business remained strong with solid year over year and sequential growth. This growth was partially due to the recognition of approximately 15 million from a professional services project associate with a telecom cloud deployment of Contrail. In reviewing our top ten customers for the quarter, five were cloud providers, three were telecoms and two were enterprises. Of these customers one was located outside of the United States. Looking at our demand metrics, product book to bill was greater than one. Ending product backlog was 441 million, down 76 million year over year while product deferred revenue was 323 million, up 83 million year over year. Our non-GAAP gross margin was within our guided range for the quarter. Non-GAAP product gross margin was up sequentially, driven by higher revenue and improved product mix. The non-GAAP service gross margin was down sequentially due to increased support costs related to the ramp of new products and higher delivery costs related to professional service projects. While we continue to expect the pricing environment to be challenging, we remain focused on delivering innovation and continued improvements to our cost structure. Non-GAAP operating expenses were also within our guided range for the quarter, up $16 million quarter over quarter and essentially flat year over year. Sequentially the increase was primarily related to a variable compensation related to sales. As a percentage of revenue non-GAAP operating expenses were 36.8%, an improvement of 1.6 points quarter over quarter and 1.7 points year over year. We are pleased with our non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.66, which reflects an increase of 14% sequentially and 5% year over year. We saw elevated DSO during the fourth quarter, primarily due to significant increases in services invoicing which occurred late in the quarter resulting in higher deferred services revenue. We also saw an impact from the timing of product voicing. We believe the quality of our receivables is strong with the majority expected to be received early this quarter. Going forward, we expect DSOs to be in the range of 50 to 60 days, an increase of five days compared to our previous target range as our average customer payment terms have increased slightly and our deferred revenue balance continues to grow. In the quarter, we had strong cash flows from operations of 334 million, up $88 million sequentially. We paid $38 million in dividends and did not repurchase shares in the quarter. I am pleased that we have completed our commitment to return $4.1 billion to shareholders by the end of 2016. Moving on to the results for the full year. As expected, fiscal 2016 saw modest growth in both revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share. Revenue growth was driven by cloud providers which increased more than 25% year over year. While routing was approximately flat, our PTX family of products had significant year-over-year growth. Switching grew 12% driven by continued data center strength led by QFX family of products which increased more than 50% year over year. Security remains challenged but we are confident in our new products and our strategy. Our services business continue to be strong with another year of solid year over year growth. In revealing our top ten customers for the year, four were cloud providers, four were telecoms and two were enterprises. Of these customers, two were located outside of the United States. Non-GAAP gross margin was down 1 point from last year due to elevated pricing pressure and product mix, partly offset by an improvement in our services margin and our cost structure. For the year, non-GAAP operating expenses increased due to acquisitions, partially offset by savings in variable compensation. As a percentage of revenue, non-GAAP operating expenses were 39.8%, an improvement of nearly 0.5 point year every year reflecting our continued focus on operational discipline and executing to our long-term model of 39%. Non-GAAP earnings per share increased $0.06 year-over-year primarily driven by lower share count and higher revenue partially offset by lower gross margin. For the year we had strong cash flow from operations of $1.106 billion, up $213 million primarily driven by timing differences of working capital. We repurchased $313 million of shares and paid $153 million in dividends. Now let's review our expectations and financial principles for 2017. We continue to operate in a competitive market and expect timing of our customer's deployment patterns to vary from quarter to quarter. We intend to manage the business in 2017 with those considerations in mind and we'll continue to focus on driving shareholder value with the following three financial principles as a guide. First, we expect revenue growth for 2017. We are pursuing opportunities with our differentiated product portfolio within our target markets and will focus on growth from emerging technologies as the market landscape continues to evolve. Second, we remain focused on earnings expansion with long term consistency. We will remain diligent in managing our operating expenses while balancing investments for short term and long term. We intend to expand non-GAAP operating margins and non-GAAP earnings per share for fiscal year 2017. Finally, we intend to maintain a healthy balance sheet and an optimized capital structure by balancing internal investments and the potential for balancing of M&A. We expect continued strong cash flow generation and intend to return approximately 50% of free cash flow to shareholders. Moving on to our outlook for Q1 which you can find detailed in our CFO commentary available on our website. Our first quarter outlook assumes that the exchange rate of the US dollar to other currencies will remain relatively stable at current levels. We are focused on executing to our strategy and capitalizing on the momentum of our new products within the target markets we serve. The gross margin guidance for the quarter reflects typical seasonal patterns, primarily due to the sequential lower revenue volume. While we expect to continue to see pricing pressure and product mix fluctuations, we remain focused on disciplined cost management. As a reminder, the operating expense guidance for the quarter includes the annual reset available compensation and the typical seasonal increase in fringe costs. I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper success. Now I'd like to open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Mr. Rod Hall with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Rod Hall: Yeah guys thanks for taking my questions. I guess I wanted to start with switching that number was considerably better than we expected and we had pretty positive views of your switching business. I just wonder if you could talk a little bit about what sort of RFP activity you've seen from the cloud providers. If you give it any kind of numbers on you know how many people are evaluating you as the first or second source in the spine particularly would be interesting I think just any other color you can give us on what's happening particularly with the cloud service providers and switching. And then I also want to ask about the deferred revenue. The services deferred revenue in particular it was up significantly more than what we saw last year the same time, I wonder could you talk about the timing of recognition about revenue, is it likely to be a little quicker than you would see with a typical product deferred revenue increase or should we expect it over the next two or three quarters, any idea of how that plays out would be great. Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Rod, let me start and then I'll pass on the question on the deferred revenue to Ken. On switching, yes, obviously we're very pleased with the results both sequentially and year over year as you know and as we've been talking to you about for quite some time now the cloud vertical and the cloud transition across all of our customers is the biggest driver of our strategy and one of the ways in which we want to capture that transition is with a very robust switching portfolio. The strength that we're seeing is mostly in the QFX product line which is targeted at the cloud and at the data center. Although I should say that EX product line also grew sequentially which is an encouraging sign. And the new QFX spine switches, which is the 10000 are now in the market the last of which would be 10016 that was just shipped in a Q4 time frame are doing well. And in terms of our P activity, we would not see this level of performance in our switching portfolio all up without the strength of our spine switches. It really comes - it plays out in two ways, first is that they contribute to the top line, they're now contributing in a meaningful way to the top line even though they're still relatively early in their life cycle. The second way is there were opportunities as I've been saying that we were really shut out from historically because we only had a portion of the overall data center switching opportunity. We now have an ability to position an end-to-end play that includes the spine, the aggregation, the access and the top of rack. And also I should mention in many cases we can bundle routing, we can bundle security and our Contrail orchestration system as well. So we're very pleased with our switching results. Ken?
Ken Miller: On the deferred revenue front, on the services side, the majority of our service revenue is maintenance and support and typically we sell those at one-year renewals. However, some customers do buy multi-year renewals, two, three or four year renewals and on a balance sheet you actually we break out the long term portion of deferred revenue and if it's due within 12 months typically radically over 12 months it will be in the short-term deferred, if it's beyond 12 months, it shall be long-term deferred. Another growing piece of our services business is professional services side and that's something that's obviously very strategic to us and oftentimes does get deferred initially until we deliver the services we mentioned in Q4 we recognized 15 million of professional services related to a telecom cloud build out with Contrail. So that's - the minority of our services deferred revenue but that is a growing piece as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Kulbinder Garcha: Just a couple of questions firstly. On long term model, Rami, it looks like in terms of revenue growth you guys have talked about 3% to 6% you weren't quite there last year. Should we expect acceleration in growth to be able to hit those numbers and those targets still hold. On the gross margin point is any of the sequential drop in gross margin that we're seeing pricing related there were some issues I think a couple of course ago if you could comment on that your visibility in gross margin and the puts and takes around it that would be helpful as well.
Rami Rahim: Thanks. Let me start. So we are going to stick to our 3% to 6% growth guidance or outlook that we have provided. Having said that clearly the mix that we have provided won't play out exactly as we had predicted, security in 2016 did worse than we expected and that's because of the fact that we missed time to transition. As I mentioned I'm confident in the steps that we’re taken and the momentum that we're seeing in the new products associated with security. Having said that I don't think that in a three year period security will grow as fast as we had anticipated because of the weaker start. That said I think switching is doing extremely well we're confident in our revenue portfolio. And all up, we can maintain that 3% to 6% overall revenue range.
Ken Miller: From a gross margin perspective, I mean, obviously there's many factors that impact gross margin, there is microenvironment, competitive landscape, product mix, customer mix et cerebra. We did hit slightly higher than the mid-point of our range in Q4 of 63.2% of gross margin and I do expect 63% to be kind of the expectation for the near term. I mentioned that on the last 90 days ago on the previous call. I do think 63% is a reasonable near term assumption on gross margin. For Q1 though, we did guided 62.5% and that is very much due to the volume of revenue and we do have seasonal pattern revenue from Q4 to Q1 and we also have a seasonal pattern of gross margin just due to volume mix.
Operator: Now our next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Simona Jankowski: Hi Thank you very much wanted to clarify something. First I think you said that your cloud customers were up 25% for the year and if I recall they were 19% back in 2015 as a percent of revenue. So the math would suggest there are about 23% of your revenue in 2016. So just wanted to confirm that. And then for my question just wanted to hear your views on carrier CapEx going forward. We started to hear some slightly more constructive commentary this week in particular in the context of the potential reversal of net neutrality. So I’d love to hear any opinions you may have on that.
Ken Miller: Yes Simona, so you got the numbers right so we were 19%, the cloud vertical was 19% of our revenue in 2015 and it did grow actually slightly greater than 25% from a full year basis this year and I'm sure you've done the math correctly after that.
Rami Rahim: Yeah, look Simona, thanks for the question. As far as carrier outlook, I think first in Q4 we saw a good sequential increase in revenue in the carrier space, we had predicted this primarily because we expected some year-end spending by the carriers. The outlook I think remains somewhat you know that the outlook is still somewhat challenged and that there is a bit of a new normal in the carrier space that we've been talking about for a while we see the same reports that you see in terms of CapEx spending and that tells us that they that carry spending is essentially stabilized i.e. the declines that we had seen historically are pretty much behind us at this period of time. We're not expecting in our full-year outlook any sort of major recovery in carrier spending. I think where the spending is going to remain robust is going to be in the cloud space where we have been really focusing and seeing really good growth been throughout last year and I think that continues this year.
Operator: Now next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Please go ahead sir.
Aaron Rakers: I wanted to ask on the QFX series product and the growth that you're seeing at the high end on the spine side. To what extent has that materialized what inning do you think we're in terms of that product cycle and with that how would you characterize your net new customer base expansion within the switch business with regard to the QFX product.
Rami Rahim: So the QFX product line as you know there are the top of rack component within their new spine switches that we've introduced over the last year. They're still early in their product life cycle in many cases we are competing in opportunities where they're still in the evaluation phase. They're being tested our customers are gaining more confidence in the operations of the product and so on. In some cases they are net new customers like I said we never really had an opportunity to break into without having these products but in other cases we have been relying on the relationships or taken advantage of the relationship that we have with our existing customers where they might already be routing or security customers that now have an ability to take advantage of a switching product line that has the same operating system, the same operational model. So it's a nice balance at this period of time of the types of customers and the opportunities that we are engaged in right now. And like I said it's still early days in terms of where we are in the product lifecycle. We just introduced the 10016 in the Q4 time, so just a few weeks ago. And we are absolutely continuing to invest in the product line so you can expect to see an increase in software capabilities, new line cards that leverage, new silicon chip sets and so on in the future.
Operator: Now our next question comes from line of Jeff Kvaal with Nomura. Please go ahead.
Jeff Kvaal: My question let me start on the revenue side obviously switching is great and better than we would have hoped. Can you talk about the routing out look a little AT&T in particular seems to be thinking that they are able to get a lot of feedings on what they call the big iron at the core of the network? And they were referring to NFE et cetera et cetera. I'm wondering to what extent we should think about that as a factor for you when considering 2017 view?
Rami Rahim: So we're pleased with our routing performance in Q4 we saw 5% sequential growth and you know modest year of year growth as well as. Most of the strength however in 2016 in routing and in and in Q4 in particular from the cloud vertical and that's a result of the fact that the demand for cloud services is growing very rapidly and cloud customers typically really value high performance highly efficient power efficient infrastructure that is exactly of the type that Juniper has and continues to develop. So I'm optimistic about the strength of that particular vertical as I mentioned I think in terms of the telco space there is a there is a new normal as the telco customer the ball there architectures to cloud architecture they're going to delay investments in traditional routing infrastructure and what we need to do here is to make sure that we engage with them in a way that allows us to benefit from the new architectures when they start to take shape and this is where Contrail and virtual routing and virtual security and other such types of technologies that we're developing really come into play today. We're not expecting any dramatic increase in telco spending any time in the near future and that's built into our outlook overall.
Jeff Kvaal: Ken, on a clarification you talked about operating margin expansion through the year. It doesn't seem as though the first quarter is starting off with material operating margin expansion. Could you talk a little bit about how things will improve through the year?
Ken Miller: So we’ll continue to manage OpEx prudently, I think we've done a pretty good job of it over the last few quarters and we’ll continue that going into next year. We are looking to grow - to expand that margin on a full-year basis and that's where we're focused on making sure that we manage OpEx to create that earnings growth as well as to invest in what we invest in. So it really comes down to optimizing our structure, making sure we’re efficient as possible and improving our productivity as we move forward.
Jeff Kvaal: So gross margin comes back a little bit and then you hold the line on OpEx after the first quarter, after a little artificially high first quarter.
Ken Miller: Yeah. And the revenue growth obviously will be more seasonal and sequential and OpEx will not have a similar ramp is traditionally is the case and [indiscernible] throughout the year.
Operator: Now our next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
Paul Silverstein: Two related questions if I might. First with respective pricing is the pressure you been citing this quarter previously is that the defense of offensive nature, I know you said is pricing pressure but ultimately stated, is this pressure from other companies that you're responding to or is this Juniper electing to use price in order to gain footprint which would be understandable especially [indiscernible]. And the related question is with respect to the operating margin commentary on a 25% goal. When you look at the data over the past 15 years dating back to the bursting of the bubble. It seems you're holding 25% is proving to be a Sisyphean task. You haven't done it and here's my question given the relatively recent issue of incremental pricing pressure over the past year, why is that going to be unsuitable in future?
Rami Rahim: Let me start Paul and I’ll pass it over to Ken. To your first question around what we're seeing in terms of pricing pressure, there is no sort of deliberate strategy that Juniper is executing on where we are going to start to use pricing as more of a tool to go after market opportunities. It's more of a reaction to what we're seeing in certain vertical certain geographies we've talked about EMEA in particular where competition is getting a bit more aggressive and so we are always going after opportunities where high performance networking where the quality of the products where the performance and the scale and the automation capabilities matters but we're seeing that in order to be competitive. Even with those attributes and those differentiator we're having to be a little bit more aggressive on pricing so that's really what it comes down to not a specific and deliberate strategy by Juniper at this point.
Ken Miller: And from an operating margin target perspective we've been in the 23.5% to 24% last couple years. So we're within a point or two of our long term model we're going to continue to focus on do that. I do think we have some efficiencies left in the business where we could optimize our cost structure and still grow revenues. So really revenue growth is the focus and maintaining a prudent cost structure as we get there is how we get to 25%.
Rami Rahim: I think the other thing just to mention one with respect to our cost of goods sold in gross margins of with the introduction of new products always after you get through sort of the beginning period of ramping up the product they tend to be favorable to gross margin because you're leveraging more as well you’re leveraging newer technology and so on. And we are seeing that the new products as they ramp are contributing, they are a tailwind when to gross margin so as they take or represent a larger fraction of overall revenue it helps us in achieving our longer term model.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Tal Liani: I have two questions one. What's baked and I apologize I joined the call it is a bit late, maybe you addressed in your remarks. What's baked into your EPS guidance for next quarter what kind of assumption? Do you factor in continued weakness in international markets and strength in North America or do you see different trends for next quarter? And the second question about your security portfolio. You haven't refreshed the high end service provider appliance yet and the question is how do you see the market or your growth evolving in the next year or two. Is it based on certain products that you still don't have in the market and you still need to bring to the market or is it more based on efforts that you have to on sales fronts et cetera. I'm trying to understand what brings beyond the seasonal weakness we see this quarter. What brings recovery and security for the next few quarters?
Rami Rahim: I will start with the security question and then Ken can you can address the EPS question. You’re right Tal in that the primary focus over the last year or so in security has been on refreshing the low end of our security products and the midrange so we've introduced the SRX1500, 4,100, 4,200 in their class across low and mid-range they are best in class in terms of price performance. We have plans to refresh entire portfolio of security products because one of the things that we were struggling from has been that the all of our security products the hardware was older and it was not price competitive. We've already addressed a big fraction of our products made in far more price competitive. As we move forward into 2017 what we're doing is aggressively adding more and more features and capabilities to the newer hardware product better in the market. I can tell you that the feedback that we're getting from our partners our customers analysts has all been very positive and very encouraging and this is why we're actually seeing some momentum in your product the issue is just that the older products have been declining very rapidly and part of that has been because of a very aggressive end of life strategy and part of that was due to the European Rojas requirements that you know we were dealing with last year. So much of that is behind us and that's why I believe that we're in a much better position in 2017 than we were in ‘15. There is a focus in ‘17 now on go to market and on marketing just make sure that we complement what we believe is that is strength in our product with the necessary engine to sell.
Ken Miller: Yeah. And from an EPS perspective on the guidance, it really starts when EPS falls out from the P&L, let me briefly touch on revenue gross margin OpEx. So from a revenue guidance perspective as you all know Q1 is typically seasonally down quarter for us sequentially as customers who complete their CapEx spending in Q4 and in certain cases take time to finalize their new spending plans for the new year and we're seeing that now. As a reminder of revenue we did realize the benefit of $15 million of professional service related to Contrail developed rollout on Telco cloud and that's something that tends to be lumpy in Q4 benefited from that that's also we get baked out into your sequentials but there are many factors to go into revenue guidance such as dual visibility, backlog levels, differed revenue balances and based on the factors I believe that in Q1 revenue guidance is appropriate at this time as we look to manage the business from Q1 and beyond. From a gross margin perspective, I still feel that 63% is the right near term target to be putting in your models but for Q1 due to the revenue volume declines sequentially we do typically see a gross margin impact about 510s so that's what baked out into our gross margin guidance. And then from an OpEx perspective the operating guidance does include the annual reset of variable compensation as well as from seasonal increases in fringe costs which is typical for us as we go from Q4 to Q1. So really those are the factors that generate the EPS guidance that we put out there.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead with your question.
Jess Lubert: First I wanted to follow up on can read remarks just there and on the revenue outlook is that the book to bill was greater than one product deferred accelerated it sounds like you're seeing strength across product categories that you're guiding for sequential decline below what we've seen in four of the last five years. So I was hoping to understand to what extent that reflects conservatism or perhaps some of the other factors that are embedded in the numbers that are causing you to guide for what on a historical basis would be below seasonal revenue results. And then Rami, a question on the cloud routing opportunity was hoping to understand to what extent. You're seeing the availability of merchant base solution, changed the nature of the conversation you're having and to what extent would you expect to see pricing in that vertical materially change as the availability of these merchant platforms become more available through the course of the year.
Rami Rahim: Just let me start with the cloud question and then Ken you can talk about the seasonality of revenue. So just on the cloud discussions we're having certainly there is a lot of sort of interesting discussion in the industry around margin but honestly when we're talking about our routing portfolio, our switching portfolio with our cloud customers, the conversation is mostly around things like price performance, total performance, manageability, automation all of these things depend not just on the silicon choices but also on the software stack that’s on top of the silicon. And as I have said I believe that we have no religion when it comes to choosing certain technology elements other than choosing the best element that will result in the best product all up and thus far we have made all the right decisions and some cases we've chosen merchant in other cases we have chosen cost and silicon will continue to make the right decisions going forward. In terms of impact on pricing, I would say that pricing compression is a fact of life for our industry and have been so for many years to come whether it's based on custom silicon or merchant silicon especially with the introduction of new port speeds, what the expectation is in the at least early stages of that introduction the price compression is going to be fairly rapid. And where we see that trend and we're comfortable with it and will continue to focus on the cost of our products that allow us to compete competitively while preserving our overall profitability.
Ken Miller: On the Q1 revenue guidance, we did put an outlook out there that we expect growth in 2017. There's a lot that goes into the guidance as you know, dual visibility, backlog levels and deferred revenue and we factored all those factors, we think the guidance is appropriate. I wouldn’t call it cautious, I would call it appropriate guidance given the factors that we have, the indication we have as well the fact as I mentioned we are looking to manage the business beyond one quarter at a time and make sure that we manage appropriately going forward.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of [indiscernible].
Unidentified Analyst: Just a quick question on your mix today and how you see that playing out in 2017. So if I look at your revenues back by region you are like an all-time highs in squad in the U.S. and actually in the rest of the word if anything looks like a much more challenging environment and then if you look at it from a client perspective as you say you cloud business grew and grew massively So when you're talking about growth next year. Where is that coming from. So do you expect cloud to keep growing very fast like that. How do you think. Other types of clients are getting to two relays a growth player that you had this year and then some question in terms of friction do you bacon to your what you face for 2017 a recovery outside those U.S. owes us going from one recall to another one.
Rami Rahim: Thank you. Pierre let me comment on the regional split so clearly I think you for the strength. It was primarily in the Americas and you know it's primarily in the cloud vertical You know the thing that the Americas has going for it is the fact that you know this country has the largest cloud provider customers in the world. So our diversification strategy plays out much easier here in the U.S. then it would in India as we have seen as we have been saying is more challenging competitively and our opportunity to diversify is there across which in but not to the extent that it exists here in the Americas again because of the absence of large hyperscale or cloud providers in that region and Asia Pacific. As you know we've had actually really good momentum over the last several quarters some decline in Q4 a lot of that has to do with a difficult compare quite honestly relative to Q4 of last year with a large telco that had to spend in end of two thousand and fifteen timeframe but I think a fact our penetration in many accounts is so small that we have a really good opportunity to increase our share and continue that momentum going forward. So most I'm most bush but the Americas because of the opportunity for us to diversify and the opportunity for us to tap into the cloud vertical I said I remain bullish on APAC in our property need to take share and to leverage partnerships like the one we have with Lenovo to gain some momentum. And EMEA know I'm big cautious on quite frankly just based on the comment that we've already made around the competitiveness of that theater.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Moskowitz: Yes thanks Good afternoon. I wanted to follow up a moment the schedule around margin and pricing. What should we read into in terms of the guidance around the five days increase in DSO to that's due to exchange of customer payment terms that are reflection of trying to offset from these pricing pressures or Pratt provide to mitigate or is a reflection of incremental revenue now is coming from customers. Maybe a little more stretched maybe a little more credit quality trying to understand that dynamic. And then more big picture, Rami I wanted you to weigh in on 2017 as far as the growth profile how much of that is dependent on 100-gig E adoption accelerating versus other.
Rami Rahim: Thanks Marc let me start with the second question. Where Juniper does best is typically in high performance networking opportunities that is true in the white area that is true inside of the data center where our customers truly value our capabilities that they're around you know robust high quality and ultra-scalable networks and hundred gig plays very much into that where I think if you were to take a look at our market share reports in switching for example where we're growing the fastest and taking the greatest market share is in the forty gig and hundred gig inflection point that's happening in the data center and in other switching opportunities so it's a big factor.
Ken Miller: From a DSO perspective we did increase the range of the target range by five days when we looked at our payment term structure today and our customer class and the mix of our customers. It was a few days you know less than five in a few days on average on a payment term clearly depending on when you ship we have customers but there is a payment terms forty five sixty exciter or so really it comes with a mix of timing as well as payment terms which has an impact of DSO and based on our analysis we feel fifty to sixty is a better range going forward and it really has nothing to do with our credit quality we have not changed our quota quality we have not gotten more aggressive on the way we find credit to customers. It's really just the next issue and a timing issue.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Justin on for Jim. I was just wondering if you could comment a little bit further. Do you size as you're seeing in the QFX family of products because you know that experience of this close quarter as well as maybe any sort of commentary that you're able to provide in terms of the pipeline going forward.
Rami Rahim: Thanks. Yes thanks Justin. I think in it's a pretty broad spectrum to be honest there are larger customers that are now spending that always in fact spends more on very large cloud billouts that have been true for the QFX top of rack that had been in the market for quite some time. I think that will remain true for the 10-Ks as well. And then we do have a commercial motion to where our partners are positioning are switching products across the broader spectrum of smaller you know opportunities telco cloud is another area that's still relatively early and smaller in size in terms of total opportunity but it is in fact a growing opportunity that we're capturing especially with our relevance that we created with contrail but we're seeing a contrail is resulting in a nice pull in hardware and in particular edge routing and switching like the QFX products.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Vijay Bhagavath: I like to hear your thoughts and you know how we should think of products and services revenue good interesting dynamic last year we saw you know delicately because they know they look really strong services and services pretty much sponsored you know line number. Could be anticipate any new product or for a second. And you know anywhere still in this product or services that new group tragic this year.
Rami Rahim: Let me start and I'm sure can and will have something to add it is true all up for the year of the product picture. It shows sort of flattish or slightly down revenue but I think it's worthwhile looking at Q4 in particular at least the second half of 2016 with a new product of really kicked in. Because they're I think the product of the sort of picture start to change especially as you look at routing in and switching in routing then you products that we've introduced the PX product line the new next line cards are growing very nicely in switching back chassis view effect line cards are growing very nicely so this isn't you know the second half of one we said the new products will start to contribute and where they are contributing good news going to 2017 is we are going to start the year with a very competitive very robust portfolio. Ken you want to comment?
Ken Miller: I would just say I mean we do you expect to grow into the 2017 we put that in or how that for 2017 and we are not going to breakout product versus service but I would we expect to grow in both product and service in 2017 for many reasons to reasons that Rami just outlined.
Operator: And our next question comes from George Notter with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
George Notter: So this is sort of an oddball question, I realize if I look back I think you guys have reported eight straight quarters of product book to bill greater than one, yet if I look at your product sales in two thousand and sixteen. It was actually down 1% year on year I guess I'm hoping you guys can help me reconcile those two comments and use it a case where product to build this isn't that meaningful for you guys or is it a case where the orders get canceled hopefully I guess I'm trying to understand those two things.
Rami Rahim: The primary difference would be I think you might be missing would be the deferred revenue balance. So, product book to bill is an important, we do track it internally. However, on the revenue side clearly, the deferred revenue growth would impact our ability to recognize revenue. So you have to factor that into the equation. So the deferred revenue growth would be the primary difference. There are other kind of accounting adjustments and reserves that have a minor impact to the book to bill ratio, but for the most part, it’s deferred revenue that causes I believe the disconnect that you're talking about.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Simon Leopold: Great. Thank you for taking my question here. First, I just wanted to clarify the operating expense guidance for Q1. It seems to me at least my impression is that it's probably erring on the conservative side, in other words, maybe a little bit higher than what you think you can do and the reason I'm drawing this conclusion is that you talk about the commission that’s driving up the sales and marketing expense in the fourth quarter. So we've got a sequential sales decline. So I assume that sales and marketing would be down sequentially. So I just want to make sure I'm not missing maybe some one-time items or increased items that affect G&A or R&D in that March guidance.
Ken Miller: Yes. So sales related variable comp should come down sequentially quarter on quarter. However, the two items that offset that and actually have us grown by $1 million in our guidance which I believe is appropriate guidance is really the fringe reset. So we do have a declining fringe rate throughout the year and things like FICA tax, et cetera, decline over the year. So we have a reset in Q1 every year on fringe and we also have the other variable cost components of the corporate programs that reset at 100%. So we did see some stableness in last year’s OpEx because variable comp was less than target due to our financial performance. That has to reset to 100% in Q1. So those are the two reasons why 515 plus or minus 5 is our OpEx forecast for Q1.
Simon Leopold: Okay. Thanks for that. And then in terms of the 100-gig opportunities, you talked earlier about Juniper typically excel as a kind of high performance, wondering whether you're seeing any constraints in terms of the supply chain, whether it's in the optical transceivers or the semiconductors necessary for those 100-gig performing products.
Rami Rahim: Yes. The thing that we're keeping a very close eye on as all of our peers are in the optics space, the 100-gig optic space. There are certain parts of 100-gig optics that are constrained. Right now, we don't expect that to cause any challenge, unless something changes, but let's just say that we're managing it very closely and we're working very closely with our optical vendors to make sure that we have the supply necessary to satisfy our expected demand for next year.
Simon Leopold: And one last one if I might, in terms of your thought for the routing business into the cloud customers, where you've had some great strength. What is your thought on the changing dynamic of competition and I'm alluding to a switching vendor that just had strong cloud business in is trying to move into routing as well as a more traditional service provider competitor who would like to sell into the cloud, both setting their sights on the customers that you've been successful with. How do you think this plays out in 2017 and 2018?
Rami Rahim: Yeah. So there's no doubt that there is a lot of interest by many of our peers, our competitors in this industry to see success in routing and switching with the large hyperscaler customers. But that said, we have been working extremely closely, engineer-to-engineer type of relationship level with all of the cloud provider customers and have a deep and intense understanding of what it is that they require, that they need, many of the products that are seeing great success today like our PTX product line where built with a keen understanding of their requirements. So while, yes, the landscape is competitive and it'll probably get even more competitive, I would say that I have confidence in our ability to compete from a technology standpoint and in just sheer understanding of what these guys actually need going forward. The last thing I want to mention is, we enjoy a really great position in this space. So yeah, we have to play a bit of a defensive game to prevent others from encroaching into our space, but we're also playing a very offensive game when it comes to the data center opportunity. And based on the results that you saw in Q4, I think you can conclude that we’re actually starting to become very successful there.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thanks, Simon. Operator, we have time for one more question.
Operator: Sure. And our final question comes from the line of Mitch Steves with RBC. Please go ahead.
Mitch Steves: Hi, guys. I just had a quick question just in terms of that modeling. Thanks for the overall annual revenue, but if I think about the sequential now for calendar year ‘17, is it safe to assume that the signal look a little bit more like ‘16 because it doesn't look like it's in line with what’s historically done on a Q-over-Q basis?
Rami Rahim: From a sequential going forward in ‘17, is that the question.
Mitch Steves: Right. Yeah. I’m just trying to get an idea of a little more like ‘16 or what you guys have seen historically?
Rami Rahim: I think actually the FY16 quarterly sequentials were pretty good benchmark for us going forward. I think, you’ll see sequential growth throughout the year in revenue and operating margin as we go throughout the year.
Mitch Steves: Okay. And then quickly from a product perspective, it's roughly the same as well?
Rami Rahim: From a growth rate sequential basis, I’m not going to comment specifically on the mix of revenue, but I do expect sequential revenue growth.
Kathleen Nemeth: Okay. Thank you, operator. Thank you everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your participation and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter.
Operator: Thank you again, ladies and gentlemen. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful rest of the day. We thank you for your time and participation.

Please keep your questions to one per firm. With that, I will now hand the call over to Rami.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thanks Kathleen, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered another solid quarter with total revenue at $1.285 billion, stronger than the outlook we provided, and up sequentially across all technologies and geographies. We again delivered strong profitability metrics sequentially, including strong operating income, operating margin and earnings per share. I'm pleased with our overall performance, particularly with our focus on execution, and we continue to take steps necessary to position the company for continued growth. I've said before that I believe we have a great strategy in place to be a pure-play innovator in IP networking that is going to transform the economics of networking with leading scale, performance and automation. As the world moves rapidly to the cloud, we believe that the market is shifting in our favor and will actually help us accelerate our strategy to power this cloud transformation. The investments we've made over the last few years have culminated in the strongest and most highly differentiated product portfolio in the history of this company. We now have a set of new products across key technology areas that we expect will help us achieve our revenue potential for the second half of this year and beyond. If you look at the products we've recently introduced in the market, they were developed with a keen understanding of what cloud providers want and need. In many cases, they were developed in partnership with our customers. One of the most important things that we must do as a company is to ensure that we help our customers succeed as they transition to the cloud. Now I'd like to summarize some highlights this quarter across Routing, Switching and Security. We are pleased to see our Routing business continue to grow sequentially and year-over-year. While we are particularly pleased with growth in the cloud vertical, we saw our diversification strategy play out across telco and cable verticals in our product mix and across geographies. Our PTX line had another record revenue quarter and along with our MX platform, they are proving be our customers' preferred choices for their core and Edge as they move faster to deployment with increasing confidence and appreciation of our technology differentiation. I'm very pleased with our strong performance in Switching, where we saw continued growth in the data center and with cloud and content providers. We've seen a lot of interest for our new QFX products from cloud providers as well as from large telcos, cable providers, large enterprises and federal governments who are demanding high capacity, high speed networking. For the Q3 period, total revenue for our QFX switch line grew at 50% year-over-year. Our deliberate focus on the cloud opportunity has resulted in a fast-growing data center switching portfolio over the past three years, and I believe we now have a complete portfolio that is going to help us continue to grow our Switching business in the future. Security continues to be a business that is in transition for us. We've made progress in certain areas, introducing new management software and enhancing the overall efficacy of our flagship SRX platform, which in fact has recently received third-party validation for excellent security efficacy in next-gen firewall testing. Earlier this month, at our Annual Customer Event NXTWORK 2016, we announced critical enhancements to our Security portfolio, extending our software-defined secured network vision with advanced automated enforcement throughout the network. These additions include Junos Space Security Director's Policy Enforcer, which delivered deeper network threat prevention down to the switch level. We also announced new mid-range firewalls, the SRX4100 and the SRX4200 that are optimized for hybrid clouds environment. Looking ahead, our priority remains on innovation, execution and on improving our performance and operating efficiencies. At Investor Day earlier this year we stated we are constructive on 2016 growth for the full year. We remain constructive in the second half of 2016 and are pleased with the traction our new products are seeing with customers. The market trends taking place in the industry play to our core competencies and provide growth opportunities for a challenger like Juniper. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on them. I want to thank our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued confidence and support. Finally, I want to extend a very big thank you to our employees, who each play a role in helping shape a stronger Juniper. With that said, I'll turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss results of the quarter in more detail.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. The results of the September quarter reflect solid sequential revenue and earnings growth. Our sequential revenue growth was balanced across all technologies, markets and geographies. And we are pleased with the momentum of our new products. We saw continued data center strength, particularly with our QFX family of products, which grew 50% year-over-year. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, four were cloud or cable providers, four were telecoms and two were enterprises. Of these customers, two were located outside of the United States. Our underlying demand metrics were healthy this quarter with product book-to-build greater than one and an increase in product deferred revenue up 24% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. In the quarter, we had cash flow from operations of $245 million, down $109 million sequentially primarily due to payments for incentive compensation. During the quarter, we repurchased $112 million of shares and paid $38 million in dividends. As many of you know, we initiated a capital return program in early 2014. Since the first quarter of 2014, inclusive of share repurchases and dividends, we have returned approximately $4.60 billion of capital to shareholders against our commitment to return $4.1 billion. And we reiterate our commitment to return approximately 50% of annual free cash flow inclusive of share repurchases and dividends beginning in 2017. Non-GAAP gross margin was within our guided range for the quarter. Year-over-year, the decrease in product gross margin on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis was due to product mix and elevated pricing pressure, partially offset by improvements in our cost structure. While the pricing environment is challenging, we remain focused on delivering innovation and continued improvements to our cost structure. In the quarter, non-GAAP operating expenses were $494 million, which was slightly below the low end of our guidance range. This is a result of our continued focus on prudent cost discipline. Now moving onto Q4 outlook, which is detailed in our CFO commentary available on our website. We are focused on executing to our strategy and capitalizing on the momentum of our new products and expect continued strength with cloud providers and enterprise customers. While we continue to see pricing pressure and product mix fluctuations, we remain focused on cost improvements. We expect gross margins to remain approximately at their Q3 levels in the near-term. On a full year basis at the midpoint of our guidance, we expect revenue growth, which is consistent with our outlook from previous quarters, as well as earnings per share growth. We are focused on growth and continued earnings expansion and are confident in our strategy and long-term model. I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. And with that, I'd like to open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo Securities.
Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on a nice quarter. I want to squeeze two in. First, for Rami, it sounds like you saw really good traction for the QFX lineup. I was hoping you could help us understand which of these models have been driving the strength, if there were any large deals here, or if it was more broad-based? And perhaps to what degree do you see this lineup competing for routing opportunities versus Jericho-based alternatives, and what are the implications of success in that application on your core routing business? How should we think about that? And then for Ken, I was hoping you could provide some additional color on the pricing environment. Last quarter, you suggested we'd likely to see some gross margin improvement. As volumes picked up in Q4, we could potentially get back to the 64% levels over time. Now it sounds like you don't expect to see any improvement in Q4. So perhaps you can touch upon what's changed. Is pricing pressure still concentrated in Europe? Is it more broad-based? To what extent we should be thinking about 63% as the new normal, or do you still think we can see some improvement next year? Thanks.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Okay. Jess, thanks for the question. Let me start with the switching question, and then I'll pass it over to Ken to talk about gross margins. So first, very pleased with the performance of our switching business in the Q3 timeframe. In particular, what you're seeing is that the focus that we have on the data center and the cloud opportunity is really starting to pay off for us. And you can see that in the strength of the QFX portfolio all up. As you know, the new products that we've introduced, the QFX10002, the QFX10008 and the upcoming QFX10016 are all intended to round out an end-to-end switching portfolio that make us competitive in far more switching opportunities than we've ever been historically. And that's exactly what we're seeing. So what we're – we're now participating in proof of concepts, in RFPs, et cetera, that we quite frankly just never had access to historically. So the new products that we've introduced are they themselves starting to ramp as we expected in the second half. But more importantly, they round out a portfolio in a way that gives us more competitiveness overall. And now add to that our Contrail Orchestration System, routing at the edge of the data center and security, and we really have a very compelling end-to-end cloud data center portfolio that we're I think leveraging very effectively. On your question around Jericho and silicon, obviously a question that we get quite a lot. Every new product we develop, we do it with a keen eye on making sure that we choose the very best silicon for that product. We're not religious about what silicon that we choose, but I will say this. Every decision we've made thus far in all products across routing and switching that we have developed has been absolutely the right one. And that means in certain cases, we're going to use custom, in certain cases, we're going to use merchant, and that might change over time as we look out and we develop sort of the roadmaps across switching and routing in the future. But for now, rest assured, I feel very good about the decisions that we've made thus far in our silicon choices. I think you had one more thing which is around routing. The data center problem is in fact a high performance networking problem that requires a robust routing stack. And that is one of the key differentiators of our QFX product line. Ken?
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Great. So on the gross margin question, Jess, yeah, the Q2 results were in line with our expectations for the quarter. From a pricing perspective, we did talk about elevated pricing pressure that we experienced in Q2. For Q3, we saw that normalize a bit, so we didn't see the continuation of the elevated pressure. We saw a little more normalization across quarter-on-quarter. Still a very competitive market though. I would definitely keep that in mind. A lot of factors go into our guidance for gross margin. Clearly, the macro environment, the competitive landscape, customer mix, product mix, and there's a fair amount of uncertainty in some of those dimensions. So I think the prudent thing at this point, which is what we set into our guidance, is to assume 63% not only for Q4 but in the near term as we continue to work through the macro uncertainties and some of the other fluctuations in our gross margin. We're very focused on continuing to deliver innovation and continuing to improve our cost structure, and we are driving towards our 64% long-term gross margin. But again, I think the prudent thing to do for the time being Q4 and the near term would be to assume 64%. I'm sorry, 63%.
Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thanks guys.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Next.
Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Okay, and thank you. Before we continue with the Q&A, let's try to keep it to one question you guys, as much as you can. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu.
Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, everybody. Thank you for take the question. I had like a very long list of questions. Now, I'll have to pick one. I'm sorry for that. Maybe I'll pick a fairly specific one, that's on your QFX product line. So my assumption is that (16:03) is a lot of your success with your cloud clients at the moment. And my other assumption is that what you've been able to bring to the market in terms telemetry and the quality of your telemetry features have weighted a lot in your commercial success. And if I'm not mistaken, Arista, who is probably one of your main competitors in that segment, brought up new product line with improved telemetry offerings. And so my question would be do you think the competitive landscape could evolve a bit in the coming two or three quarters with a competitor getting closer to you, at least on that dimension? And could that inflect a bit your commercial success there?
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Pierre, for the question. First, I think that the success that we've seen in the QFX all up is more broad based than just the large cloud providers. I think there are – it includes success in certain cloud providers, in the enterprise, in federal government and also in fact, in some teleco opportunities as well. When I think about the competitiveness of our product portfolio in Switching, there are very different aspects of it. First is scale. And typically when people hear the word scale they think of the number of ports on a box. But it's actually more complicated than that. It's also around the number of routes, number of hosts, number of IP addresses, what we call logical scale. And we've really pushed the envelope on the logical scale of our product that give us an edge compared to anything that's out there today. Then there's the robust routing capabilities. We have full Junos IP stack on this thing, which makes it very suitable for high performance, high scale data center opportunities. Telemetry, you're absolutely right. The team has done a fantastic job of innovating in terms of new modern telemetry capabilities. Do I expect that the competitive landscape will evolve? Absolutely. We innovate all the time with the assumption that our competitors are aggressive and they're moving fast, and that's why we just have to move faster. And I think we're doing that. I think the most important thing you need to understand as you look at the switching and the cloud opportunity, is that we're playing an offensive game. We are out to take share in switching, in data center with a new end-to-end portfolio that is very competitive.
Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks for that.
Operator: Our next question comings from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs.
Balaji Krishnamurthy - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. This is Balaji on behalf of Simona. I was wondering if you could touch on the geographical trends, especially with Europe? You had a few quarters of declines there on a one-on-one basis. Where do you see a turn in that market? Thanks.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah, sure. Thanks for the question. Let me start, and maybe Ken has some more color to add. First, I think we saw good momentum up year-over-year, 5% in the Americas. We also saw sequential growth in the Americas as well. That was driven largely by cloud providers, by cable operators and also by large enterprises. So we're very pleased with the performance there. EMEA sequentially was actually quite healthy, and it's driven – our business in EMEA is driven mostly by large telcos. Now, there's certainly some factors in EMEA that we're keeping a very close eye on. Economic stability, Brexit, foreign exchange and so on, that give us some room or some cause to be a little bit concerned about it going forward. But so far, I would say just judging by the performance we've seen in Q3, things are looking pretty good. Last but not least, APAC continues to be a good growth engine for us. I think the team there is executing really well with 18% year-over-year growth driven by a number of different verticals, cloud in particular. And we're even seeing good sequential growth in China with the partnerships that we've announced there and with our product portfolio that's actually working quite well for us over there. Anything you want to add, Ken?
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: No, I mean, I'd just reiterate. EMEA was the one geography that was down year-on-year, as you noted. I think it is a challenging marketplace there. There's a lot going on. We're clearly staying as close to the market situation as we can. And I would say because of the macro uncertainties, it has a propensity to be a little more choppy than normal, right? We are pretty concentrated on telco, as Rami mentioned, so as the telcos go, as some of the big deployments happen, you might see revenue fluctuate a little more in that geography going forward as some of the others.
Balaji Krishnamurthy - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tal Liani of Bank of America.
Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, guys. I want to compare the opportunity in telcos versus cloud, and take a more maybe of a long-term view. So if the pending in telcos, if it continues to decline, is your participation in the cloud opportunity big enough or large enough to offset this? And maybe you can talk about your participation among cloud providers, what kind of products and projects – conceptually, what kind of projects and products you're working on? Thanks.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Sure. Thanks for the question. I think that the cloud opportunity remains robust for the foreseeable future. I mean, at the end of this year and I think into next year, large cloud providers and as well as the second tier cloud providers that are what we call Born in the Cloud, their business models evolved around the cloud opportunity, are essentially recognizing that their wide area networks and their data center networks are essential to delivering the kinds of experience that their customers demand. And for that reason, I think spending there will be robust. Telco is a little bit of a different story, and I've been consistent in how I've talked about the telco opportunity over the last few quarters. First, I think just judging by the conversations we have with our telco customers as well as their CapEx reports for the year and how much they've spent thus far, we do expect there to be some spending by telcos in the Q4 period. Longer-term in telcos, all service providers – or many service providers are going through an architectural transformation. They're really thinking about how to leverage their networks as essentially a distributed cloud network. And we are very pleased with how we're working very closely with our telco customers, who we obviously enjoy a very close working relationship with, to help them with that transformation. And that speaks to our broad portfolio of switching, routing, security and very much around our cloud software, Contrail being a very powerful tool that we have today to engage very strategically with these architectural transformations that are happening at our telco customers. Summing that all up, I think that for – because of this transformation that's happening, telcos we can expect will divert their focus to that transition and less on just building out their core or their Edge networks in the way that they have done in the past. The most important thing is that we remain very engaged, very close with them in the transformation so that we can benefit from the new types of buildouts that they will be deploying. And I think that will start in the 2017 timeframe. So they're going through this shift, and we just have to make sure that we stay very close and we capitalize on the solutions we're offering them to help them with the shift itself.
Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James.
Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. A genuine clarification first, and then the question. You were kind enough to give us some detail on the Top 10 customers showing some good balance. I wasn't quite sure where the cloud providers, the Googles, Amazons, Facebooks, whether you consider those service providers or enterprises in your discussion of customers. So just a clarification on that. And then in terms of the trend, you've talked about the web scale cloud providers being a high teens percent of revenue in the last couple of quarters. Just wondering where you stand today with that group? And how you see that group as a percent of sales longer term as you look out into 2017? Thank you.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. So the clarification, so those customers you mentioned would be part of our cloud vertical, which roll up into the service provider market if you will. So just to clarify that. That's where they stand.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: From a vertical perspective, we talked a bit about – Rami just talked about the cloud vertical and its robustness going forward. And just to remind folks what we talked about at Investor Day. We expect that to be double-digit growth over the next three-year period, 10% to 13% CAGR. Right now, last year FY 2015, the cloud vertical represented about 19% of our total revenue. Clearly it's going be our fastest growing vertical over the next few years. So it will continue to take more percentage of our total revenue. And we expect it to get to approximately 24% by 2019. So it will be a bigger piece of our revenue going forward.
Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you very much.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dmitry Netis of William Blair.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you very much for taking my question. I actually had kind of a follow-up to a previous question. And that is if I look at the commentary, you guys had mentioned QFX had done real well. Data center cloud had done real well. But if I look at the relative stress and width quarter-over-quarter where the revenue came from, it came mostly from the routing side. And I think from the commentary where the cloud guys sit, they sit in the service provider I think what you said. That vertical was actually down by about $35 million versus Enterprise that was up $58 million quarter-over-quarter. So I'm just trying to reconcile the strength there, whether that's really the PTX or is something else? Can you help us reconcile the difference?
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. I'm not sure I'm following your math precisely, so I apologize for that. We could follow-up. But I would say that from a year-on-year perspective, Switching led by QFX was our strongest growing technology. Switching was up 10%. Routing was up 3%. In absolute dollars, Routing continues to be our largest technology. So in absolute dollars, they're more similar in growth year-on-year. The sequential growth was predominantly routing in absolute dollars but again, pretty broad based and consistent across technologies. Routing was up 8%. Switching was up 6%, and Security was up 9%. So I'm not sure I answered your question, but I'd be glad to follow up with you with more details.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah. Thank you. I was referring on the sequential basis, strictly where the relative strength came from. And it seems it had come from routing. That's – and then the enterprise was also pretty strong relatively speaking from quarter-over-quarter. So that's why I was just trying to reconcile those two.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. No, so, you're right. Routing was up 8% quarter-on-quarter. Switching was up 6%. We did have a pretty strong switching quarter in Q2. And we have seen strength in Enterprise on a sequential basis since the Q1 lows, right? So we had a pretty strong Q2 sequentially and Q3 sequentially. However, Enterprise is still down slightly year-on-year. So the macro and some of the transition impacts that really affected us in Q1 are starting to subside, and we're starting to return to growth on the Enterprise segment.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC: Can I just follow-up on one thing, the PTX side of things. Can you give us a little – can you qualify what the revenue percent of total? Or percent of routing? Or what the growth in that segment was as you did for QFX, just so that we can calibrate around it?
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. I'm not going to break it out, but I will give you a qualitative view. The PTX did very well. It had a record quarter. When we developed and released the PTX into the market, we had a thesis around how telcos and cloud providers are going be thinking about the evolution of their wide area networks, the data center interconnect networks. And while it has taken us some time to convince our customers and to help them in making the architectural transition towards those lean core networks or the super-core networks that we called them, what we're seeing right now is exactly what we had expected and hoped for, which is a real acceptance, and in fact, enthusiasm for these sorts of super core, lean-core architecture that are driving the PTX business. So very pleased with the PTX growth thus far. We have a highly differentiated core product in the PTX after the introduction of the new line cards for that platform in the first half of this year. And I am bullish about the growth of the PTX going forward as well.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mark Moskowitz of Barclays.
Daniel Gaide - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. This is Dan Gaide on for Mark. Thanks for taking my question. We know that Juniper's having success with next-gen solutions like Contrail and with virtual routing and CPE deployments at both AT&T and Verizon, and that the goal you guys announced is for 45% of revenue to come from software and services in 2019. Are you still tracking with these plans? And how have deployments changed versus when you – what you may have expected when you originally announced those plans?
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yes. So you're absolutely right in that Contrail continues to see more and more interest, more and more adoption, especially with the open stack, but not exclusively the open stack community. And more and more, for example, customers are jumping on to the Kubernetes container-type of solutions, for which Contrail is also highly suited. When we think about our software strategy, there are several different elements to it. There is the controller element, the software-defined-networking element, to which Contrail certainly belongs, but also other products like our NorthStar Wide Area SDN controller. There is the virtual network function and the solutions around them. So the success that we've seen with the Cloud CPE Solution at AT&T, Verizon as well as other Tier 1 telcos is indicative of the kinds of investments that we're making today that we believe are going to pay off in the future, I think starting next year. And then last but not least, the third leg of the stool is around our disaggregation strategy. Over time, we do believe that the way in which we sell the value of our switching, our security, and routing to an extent is going to be more commensurate with how we invest in these products, where the bulk of our investment is in fact in the software. And for that reason, over time, I think this is going be gradual. It's not going to happen overnight, which is why we've given ourselves a few years get to our target. What you're e going to see, I think, our customers are going to buy the value in terms of software SKUs that are essentially decoupled from the hardware. It's still early days. There is an entire industry that needs to sort of transform around that change in business model. But we're working towards that goal. We're working very aggressively towards it.
Daniel Gaide - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley.
James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much for taking my question. Rami, kind of a follow-up question to that is as carriers undertake this network transformation you're talking, how are you navigating change in partnerships, et cetera, to provide those carrier customers with the technology knowhow and ability to – or helping them with their transition from a services perspective? And I guess tied into that, just an OpEx question. You've been running OpEx a little bit lower than your target, at least as a percent of revenue. Do you see room for further cuts in OpEx going forward? Thank you very much.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Let me touch on the partnership question. I'm sure Ken would want to weigh in on the OpEx piece. So we see this in a number of different ways. Partners are extremely important for us in going after broader teleco opportunities. And yes, when it comes to some of these new cloud architectures that telcos are adopting, there are elements of the solution that we count on partners for, in particular, for example, around the OSS/BSS, the integration into their existing OSS/BSS systems and so forth. And here we've got fantastic partnerships with companies like NEC, IBM and Amdocs that essentially enables us to provide those end-to-end solutions. Having said that, however, in every one of these large teleco transformations, we have a very direct interface to the customer, and in some cases we find that the way in which we need to grow our business, our relevance, is by taking the customer from an indirect relationship, fulfillment relationship to a direct one. And we've done that gradually around the world on an as-needed basis. The bottom line is I feel very good about our ability today to take the innovation that we produce in-house and to combine it with that of partners and to reach our customers around the globe through the go-to market capabilities of our partners. On OpEx, I'll let Ken.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Sure. Sure. So I'm particularly proud of our OpEx results this quarter, $494 million. We came in below the low point of our guidance range. And that is with an Aurrion, which was an acquisition we closed during the quarter that wasn't factored into our guidance. So we did a great job controlling our costs this quarter. And you can count on us to continuing to do that going forward, particularly in light of some of the macro challenges we're experiencing in the gross margin line as an example. We're doing everything we can to make sure we maximize shareholder returns and shareholder value and really managing OpEx tightly, making sure we grow and expand our earnings as we move forward in these marketing conditions. So it's something you can count on us continuing to do as we move forward.
James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Suva of Citi.
Justin Wainwright - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yes. Hi. This is Justin on for Jim. Thank you for taking the question. I was just wondering if you could comment on any update wins you had for Contrail? And also, if you could just maybe comment in terms of the demand and what the pipeline looks like? Thank you.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Sure. Let me start with the Contrail question. I think it's fair to say that the adoption rate of Contrail is tracking really well. We have at least a half a dozen new logos that we scored just in this last quarter. And these are meaningful, large either cloud providers or service providers, telcos. We're seeing especially good strength with the telcos as they undertake this cloud transformation within their own networks. And I expect there to be more success going forward. A really important element of the Contrail success that we're seeing is in each and every one of the – I'd say most of the deployments that we've had thus far, it has led to pull-through opportunities, where we can now bundle a portfolio of switching, routing, security into the Contrail solution that we're offering to our customers.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. The only thing I would add, Rami, is it also typically comes with some professional services engagement as well, which is very – becoming more and more strategic to our overall solution sale. And last but not least the Contrail revenue will be slower and gradual as it comes to the subscription nature of the revenue. So, some of our deferred revenue growth is Contrail and some of our other software products.
Justin Wainwright - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Milunovich of UBS.
Tejas B. Venkatesh - UBS Securities LLC: Hi. This is Tejas on for Steve. When I look at sequential routing growth in 4Q over the last few years, it's been up in certain years and down in certain years. But as we look into 4Q this year, is it fair to assume that it will grow similar to last year, given the CapEx trends you talked about earlier?
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. I would expect both in Q2 and Q3 of this year we saw sequential growth across all technologies. I believe we're going to have a similar result in Q4. I do think we'll see some growth across many of the new products and all three of the technologies, routing, switching and security.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. The only thing I'd add to that is the product lineup that we have in routing today across the MX and the PTX with new line cards, new software that we've introduced on both those platforms in the first half of the year have set us up for a very, very competitive overall product portfolio that is going help us to grow going forward. So I just feel very good about the overall technology situation and our competitiveness of the company in routing.
Operator: Our next question...
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thanks for the question.
Operator: ...comes from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank.
Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. Hi, Rami. I'd like to get your big picture views Rami, on how Juniper plans to drive new growth in optical and in security? For example, would you look to exit any current underperforming products and focus on new growth opportunities in security opticals such as data center optical interconnect, cloud based security as we saw, Akamai (38:57) seeing strength? I'd like to get your thoughts. Thanks, Rami.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Hi, Vijay. Thanks for the question. So both key areas of focus for us, I think that the work that Juniper did a year-and-a-half, two years ago, in streamlining and refocusing the company is really paying off for us today. So I do think that we are focused on the right areas or the right opportunities. And the growth potential in each of the areas that we're focusing on is definitely there. You touch on two of them. Optical is a really important part of our overall solution. We're not thinking about optical as a standalone business. I think there are enough standalone optical players in this world. We think about optical as an element of a end-to-end solution with key emphasis on the metro and the data center interconnect markets. These are the opportunities that I think are ripe for disruption with a converged packet optical solution that's managed through really highly automated software. And I think that's the key behind the acquisition that we made of BTI. We now have the technology. We have the capability. We have the talent to enable us to integrate and develop these solutions for the data center interconnect and the metro market. And then in security, we've said it in the opening remarks. It's a business in transition. We continue to see the sequential momentum that we need to see in the business. We have undertaken at the beginning of this year some very large somewhat tricky product transitions where we're replacing older security products with newer ones. And we're seeing good ramp-up in growth in the newer technologies that we've introduced in the market. So as I think about security, the opportunity is there. I think our vision of a software defined secure network is the right one. And we're hearing very good positive comments from our customers, our partners, as well as industry analysts. Our software efficacy is only getting better every quarter. And it really comes down to that last critical piece of refreshing the older portfolio with a newer portfolio that gives us the ability to compete from an economic standpoint, a cost per bit per second of security. The QFX4100 and QFX4200 products we just announced at our Annual Customer Event a few weeks ago and they will be making their way into the market very shortly, and that's an example of that refresh cycle that I'm talking about. And you talked about cloud-based security. I do think that that is a direction of travel for security in the future. And this is why we're also investing in our virtual security products like the virtual SRX where we're seeing actually good momentum now offered off of the Amazon Web Services marketplace and as well as our ATP, our Advanced Threat Prevention, Sky ATP Service that's offered from the cloud. So these are indicative of investments today that we think will pay off in the second horizon of security which is all around the cloud.
Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Perfect. Hey, thanks, Rami.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Vijay.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jayson Noland of Robert W. Baird.
Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask on SD-WAN you're highlighting it on your website. And Rami, is this – is it fair to say that this could impact MPLS router business to the negative but you have an opportunity with CPE in the branch? Or how should we frame SD-WAN as it relates to Juniper? Thank you.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. So we do view SD-WAN as a really important opportunity for us. But to be clear, we actually think of the SD-WAN opportunity maybe a little bit differently than our peers in the industry. We think of SD-WAN as just one point solution of a broad set of solutions that are – that enterprise customers will want and desire from telcos in the future. And so, when you look at our solution, it really is around an open platform that – the foundation of which is Contrail as an orchestration system and the NFX250 is essentially an open platform that sits at the customer prem. It can run a multitude of services, SD-WAN being one of them, security being a second one of them. Load balancing capabilities being a third one, et cetera, et cetera. And we actually sort of define this vision a couple of years ago. And what we're seeing now from our customers is, a keen acceptance of this as being the true future that they want to go and to achieve. I think of this as highly complementary to our overall opportunity at Juniper. Our existing physical box centric sort of CPE business is relatively small unlike many of our competitors and so we can play a much more disruptive game there. And then to your question around does this have an impact on the MPLS-WAN space, if you will? I think a lot of these solutions will depend on a hybrid model where they will leverage the Internet for certain types of traffic as well as manage the MPLS for other types of traffic. All up, I think if you integrate the whole opportunity, I think it's a net add for us.
Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mitch Steves of RBC Capital Markets.
Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. So most of them have been asked, but I kind of wanted to return real quick to the gross margin piece. If I recall correctly, I believe last quarter, the June quarter, the routing segment was part of the reason why the gross margins were actually better, or a little bit better. But now we're seeing a gross margin beat again. Or sorry, a routing beat again but the margins are going down. So is it fair to say that maybe the QFX (45:13) lower margin than 63% to 64% range?
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: No. I wouldn't jump to that conclusion. I would say gross margin there are many, many inputs into gross margin from obviously pricing being a large one and I already mentioned pricing was actually relatively stable. We didn't see much change quarter-on-quarter as it relates to pricing. But product mix, and it's really at the level below just routing, switching, and security. It gets down to the product lines and even within the product lines whether it's chassis and line cards and a percentage of other commodity products within our solutions. So it's a volatile – it's a volatile product mix equation that does have propensity to go up or down a few tenths in any given quarter. We're pleased with our results in Q3. Very in line with what we expected to land, and that's really the update on gross margins.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. The only thing I'd add it, typically with the introduction of new technologies, new products, the – they introduce a tailwind to gross margin. So the new QFX products relative to our overall switching business is in fact a positive thing, the exact same thing with routing, because what you're doing is you're leveraging Moore's Law, you're leveraging more modern silicon technology, et cetera, that tends to better optimize the cost per bit per second of your solution. So as you think about the types of things that we're looking at to achieve our long-term gross margin goals, there's supply chain managements and costs there. There's the innovation that goes with the introduction of new technologies that are tailwinds to gross margins. Then there's just innovation. Take, for example, some of the work that we're doing in the optical space. In particular, the recent acquisition in silicon photonics, which will have not an immediate but a long-term, I think, positive effect on gross margin. And last but not least is business model transformation. As you think about the evolution towards more software-based business models, all of these things are factors that we believe will have a positive impact long-term on gross margins.
Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Erik Suppiger with JMP Securities.
Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC: Yeah. Good afternoon. On the QFX, can you discuss what success you're having with the cloud providers? And then how much of the QFX is shipping with 100-Gig and high-density ports?
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Sure, Erik. Well, the success we're seeing with the QFX is broader-based than just cloud. And it's broader-based than just the top cloud providers. I think that the opportunity is large and it spans across cloud providers, cable operators, telcos and large enterprises. And we're leveraging all of our existing relationships with our customers but also of course going after net new opportunities with the QFX product line, which again I said, I believe is extremely competitive. And in particular, where you see Juniper taking the most share is in fact in the high speed opportunities, which is over 10-Gig, 100-Gig being a perfect sweet spot for us. So if you know Juniper, you know that where we do exceptionally well is where scale and performance matters. And where data centers require 100-Gig interfaces, typically the kinds of scale and performance they require for these data center buildouts are such that we're going to be very competitive. And that is a key area of differentiation for us today.
Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Notter of Jefferies.
George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC: Hi. Thanks very much, guys. I just wanted to go back to the gross margin question. You said earlier that Juniper is out to take share in switching and cloud. And I think you were referencing more the QFX initiative in that statement. I guess I'm just wondering if I can connect to the gross margin erosion we've seen over the last handful of quarters to that initiative to take share? And then also I think last quarter you talked about some of the margin pressures really being focused in Europe. Is that still the case? Thanks.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Let me start. And I'd like Ken to weigh in. The answer to the question is no, it's not just about the QFX. Our ability to take share certainly has an element of pricing to it. But it's much more than that. Technology matters. The broader portfolio solution matters. Things like Professional Services and our ability to go and to help our customers in evolving their networks from a legacy network to a cloud, highly automated data center with solutions like Contrail. All of these are factors. I'm not saying pricing is not a factor, but it's much more complicated than just pricing discussion. It's not just tied to switching, and it's not only tied to Europe. I think it's broader based than that. Right, Ken?
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Absolutely. From a pricing perspective, specifically discounting, we did see some stabilization there this quarter as compared to last. You're right. In Q2 we did call out some elevated pricing pressure specifically in EMEA. So we're not calling out something similar this quarter. It's more broad based but also more stable than we saw last quarter from a pricing perspective.
George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC: Got it. Great. That helps. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rohit Chopra of Buckingham Research.
Rohit Chopra - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thank you. Thanks for taking the question. Guys, I just wanted you to address Government if you could? In the commentary, it appears that it was down sequentially in Routing, Switching and Security? So I was just wondering, is that a Government issue? Or is that a Juniper issue? Thanks.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. So from a Government perspective, I'll let you talk about it a little bit, Rami, as well. But from a numbers perspective, we do see some lumpiness in the Government vertical. It's an important vertical for us, but it's not one of our largest couple of verticals, though it does have the propensity to be up or down on a certain deployment as they happen around the world. I would make sure folks understand that Government is an international vertical for us. So we do a fair amount of business internationally in Government sector as well. And what you saw in Q2 was actually a very strong Government number. And so sequentially we saw a little bit of a retraction but it's – we're still very focused on that vertical going forward. It's really more deployment based than anything else.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. The only thing I'll add is that it remains a key vertical for us. We're highly focused on it. The deals in the Government space tend to be larger and therefore lumpier. And we did see some push out of opportunity, I think in particular around E-Rate and other types of government opportunities. So I'm not too concerned about the Q3 performance. I think we will see good success in that vertical going forward.
Rohit Chopra - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thanks, Rami.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Last thing I would add is we are actually up year-to-date, full year in that sector. So we're very comfortable with that sector just a quarter-to-quarter timing phenomenon.
Rohit Chopra - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Yeah. The only reason I asked, is it is the final – was the end of the government fiscal year. So I was thinking maybe the U.S. Fed may have seen some growth and we just didn't see it. That's what I was pointing out. Thanks.
Ken Miller - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Yeah. Yep. Appreciate the question. Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.
Kathleen Nemeth - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Okay. Well, we'd like to thank everyone for your questions and really appreciate you restricting them to one question per firm. That was great. Thanks again. And looks like we are two hours away from the World Series kicking off, so excited about that. And we'll talk to you next quarter. Thanks. Bye-bye.
Rami Rahim - Juniper Networks, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Kathleen, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered a solid financial performance for the second quarter of 2016, as we navigated through a challenging macro environment. Total revenue was $1.221 billion, stronger than the outlook we provided, and up sequentially across all geographies, technologies and sectors. Services revenue was again solid, up 11% year over year, and 4% sequentially. We also delivered strong profitability metrics sequentially, with operating income up 37%, operating margin up 3 points, and diluted EPS up 57% on a GAAP basis. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income was up 30%, operating margin was up 3 points and diluted EPS was up 35%. I'm proud of the disciplined execution from our team, and as we look ahead, I remain confident that our strategy and differentiated portfolio will enable us to achieve our long-term targets. I'll talk a bit about the progress we are making with our highly focused strategy to be the worldwide leader of network innovation. From a technology perspective, our agenda is focused on two important dimensions. The first is scale and performance, and the second is automation through software innovations. On the dimension of automation, we believe it is the key attribute required for our customers to achieve vast new levels of agility and efficiency in delivering services over their networks. Automation is fundamental not just to Juniper but to the health of our entire industry, and it is the most important attribute of our newly announced cloud-enabled brand solution, which we believe will allow enterprises and managed service providers alike to deliver on-demand cloud services seamlessly. A critical technology element of our cloud-enabled brand solution is Contrail, a powerful tool for network virtualization and automation that is enabling our customers' IT and business evolution to the cloud. In both the Enterprise and Service Provider sectors, we already have multiple multi-million dollar Contrail deployment. We see many unique opportunities and growth drivers for Contrail. One of the most interesting and forward-looking use cases pertains to the Internet of Things, enabling virtualized and secure connectivity to vast numbers of connected devices. For example, a Tier 1 telco has deployed Contrail for its energy (4:52) platform that not only virtualizes many of its networking applications, but also enables at-scale deployment of connected car services, such as real time mapping, traffic, news and music streaming. Similarly, we have also been in production for over a year now with a large industrial conglomerate whose industrial Internet allows it and its partners to perform data mining and data collection from various machines like wind turbines, jet engines, elevators and MRI scanners. We are also seeing increased momentum with managed service providers, leveraging our open platforms for SDN and NFV. We believe we are in a unique position to help them achieve new levels of agility and cost optimization, and offer their enterprise customers best of breed technology choices without the complexity that typically comes from managing multi-vendor solutions. Some great examples of our momentum include Verizon, which selected our cloud CPE solution as the foundational platform for its virtual network services; Orange Business Services, which is now using our Contrail SDN controller for its easy go network as a service offering; and AT&T, which is offering Juniper's virtual routing function as an option for its enterprise customers looking for on-demand virtualized network services. The scale and performance of Routing, Switching and Security continue to be of fundamental importance to our customers who are constantly trying to stay ahead of network traffic growth, and trying to do so economically. Innovating in this dimension has been our hallmark since the inception of this company, with the breakthrough products like the M40, the MX and the PTX that over the years have redefined the economics of networking. As bandwidth intensive applications continue to soar, and the world moves rapidly to the cloud, we believe that the need to continue to innovate in the dimension of scale and performance is only increasing in time. And we also believe there is still plenty of room for that innovation both in systems and in intelligent software that enables more efficient use of network capacity. To that end, we are encouraged by the traction we are seeing with our NorthStar controller, that optimizes across both packet and optical domains dynamically and in real time, unlocking new levels of capacity in our customers' networks. Technology is only part of the challenge in any network transformation. Having the right skills is as big if not a bigger challenge. That's why we've recently announced the expansion of our successful open lab program with six new locations across North America, Europe and Asia, which will provide customers and partners with a range of resources to build and learn about emerging virtualization and automation technologies. Now, moving on, I'd like to comment on our Routing, Switching, and Security business this quarter. In Routing, we are very pleased with the diversification across geographies, verticals, and product mix. Many customers are enthusiastically embracing our newest MX and PTX products. Our PTX line grew sequentially and year over year to reach record revenue with core network deployments across our cloud, telco, and cable customers. As our customers migrate from 10 gig to 100 gig connections, we believe our technology leadership in both the core and Edge Network layers gives us a clear, competitive advantage to gain market share. In Switching, we saw strength in the data center across telco, cable, cloud provider, hosting, and enterprise customers. Our QFX 10,000 family of spine switches is ramping well, and we see a solid pipeline in the second half of the year. In Security, we did experience another difficult quarter as we continue to work hard to turn around this component of our business. As I've said before, our strategy and product transitions are going to take time to play out, and will result in some lumpiness in the business. We remain committed to developing and delivering to our customers complete and differentiated domain-level solutions for the cloud, SB mobile, and enterprise networks that include elements of Routing, Switching, and Security all working tightly together. We are operating in a difficult macro environment that has been affected by recent economic and geopolitical volatility. However, we remain focused on what we can control, and believe that solid execution, coupled with a strong portfolio of solutions, will position us to navigate through effects on spending patterns in the future. We are continuing to make balanced decisions between growth and profitability, while making investments that best position us to address our customers' most critical networking needs. We remain focused on driving long-term sustainable growth, while generating strong cash flow. And we continue to focus on managing our business prudently, while strengthening our investments in scale, performance and automation through software innovation. I want to thank our customers, partners, and employees for their continuing dedication as we move along our journey. Finally, I would like to thank our shareholders for their continuing support and investment. Now, I'll turn it over to Ken for his comments.
Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. Our June quarter results reflect strong sequential revenue and earnings growth. Sequentially, revenue grew across all technologies, geographies and markets. Enterprise growth of 23% quarter-over-quarter was driven by improved spending patterns following a cautious Q1. Service Provider revenue grew 6% sequentially, primarily driven by telecom deployments and an increase in revenue from cloud providers. Our services business continued to be strong, with solid growth both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, five were telecoms, four were cloud or cable providers, and one was in Enterprise. Of these customers, two were located outside of the United States. Our underlying demand metrics were healthy this quarter with product book-to-bill greater than 1.0, and a strong increase in product deferred revenue year-over-year and sequentially. In the quarter, we had cash flow from operations of $354 million, up $91 million year-over-year, and up $182 million sequentially. We repurchased $126 million of shares, and paid $38 million in dividends. Since the first quarter of 2014, inclusive of share repurchases and dividends, we have returned approximately $3.91 billion of capital to shareholders against our commitment to return $4.1 billion by the end of 2016. While I'm pleased with the overall results, the macro environment in Q2 was more challenging than we originally anticipated, and gross margins came in below our guidance. Non-GAAP gross margins were 63%, down 0.7% sequentially. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was driven by elevated pricing pressure, primarily in EMEA, as well as product mix. This was partially offset by improvements in our cost structure. While the pricing environment is challenging, we remain focused on delivering innovation and continued improvements to our cost structure. In the quarter, non-GAAP operating expenses were $494 million, which was slightly below the low end of our guidance range. This is a result of our continued focus on prudent cost discipline. Now moving on to Q3 guidance, which is detailed in our CFO commentary available on our website. We remain constructive on revenue for 2016 and expect modest growth despite the current macro environment. We will continue to prudently manage our operating expenses. However, we expect gross margins to remain approximately at their Q2 levels in the near term. As a result, we expect operating margins for the full year 2016 to decline slightly, relative to the full year of 2015. We are confident in our long-term model and remain focused on growth and operating margin expansion. The outlook assumes that the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to other currencies will remain relatively stable at current levels. I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. And now with that, I'd like to open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. . And our first question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu from Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.
Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, good evening, and thank you for taking my question. I'd like to focus, of course, on the gross margin surprise which we saw in the quarter and what you're planning for coming quarters. So, you mentioned mix and pricing pressure. On the latter, I'd like to know where the pricing pressure is coming from. Are you suffering from currency? Are you forced to give discounts to secure business with clients to – who are having a harder time defending their budgets? Or are you actually facing competitors with more aggressive pricing? And then on the former, on the mix shift, if you could give us a bit of color on what kind of mix, what are like the higher margin products that are less in the mix today and what are the lower margin products that are more in the mix today? That would be great. Thank you very much.
Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, thanks, Pierre. I'll start and then I'll pass it on to Ken to provide some additional details. With respect to gross margins, it's more of the latter thing that you discussed, okay? This is more around the macro concerns in Europe in particular, and that is primarily a result of foreign exchange. So, something we had been thinking about and monitoring closely in order to offset the dollar exchange, weaker Euro, additional discounting was something that we had thought was necessary, and we're seeing it play out. And then there is, yes, this secondary component, which is product mix. I just want to say two additional things before I pass it on to Ken. First is, I think we demonstrated in Q2 that despite the fact that we saw weaker than expected gross margins, we were able to tightly control our operating expenses to protect our operating margin. So, I'm proud of the discipline that we saw in terms of execution from the team and you can expect more of that going forward. And the second thing is as we look at the innovation of our products across all of our portfolio of products, and that includes the new products that we're introducing into the market now, one of the things that we've always focused on and we will continue to focus on is the innovation that goes into reduction of the COGS, the cost of goods sold per bit per second – of Routing, Switching, and Security. And I view that as something that would be helpful certainly as a tailwind in the future as we see those products ramp up. Ken?
Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Great, yeah. Rami, I think you covered the elevated pricing pressure in EMEA pretty well. I'll touch on the product mix. So, an example of that that we saw in Q2 was the BTI acquisition. Although we expect the acquisition to result in neutral earnings for the year, it did have a slight negative impact to both gross margin and operating margin in the second quarter. The – an example – the product mix that hit us in Q2. In addition to that, there's a lot of different product mix contributors whether it be chassis versus line cards, our percentage of software. So, product mix could result in either headwinds or tailwinds. At this point I think it's – we're definitely not giving up on our long-term model of 64%. We're focused on delivering innovation and continuing our cost structure improvements and we'll go forward from here.
Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Now our next question comes from the line of Jess Lubert from Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi, guys. I was hoping you could help us understand how much the improvement in the Switching business was driven by the uptake of the new QFX 10K platforms and which verticals you're seeing the greatest demand for these products. And then, to what degree you'd expect to see uptake of the 10K drive further sequential improvement as we move to the second half of the year? And then I have a follow-up.
Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay, thanks, Jess, for the question. So, needless to say, we're really pleased with the performance of our Switching business all up in Q2. We saw double-digit growth both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. I think what we're seeing here is this strategy of focusing very deliberately on data centers and cloud buildouts pay off for us. In terms of verticals, strength in telcos, in cloud, and especially Q2 we saw a strong government sector as well, play out for us nicely. We have said consistently that the new products – the spine switches, the 10K switches – are mostly going to contribute to revenue in the second half, and that remains the case. There's certainly some orders and early revenue that came in in Q2 timeframe, but right now, I would characterize the situation we're in as we're competing aggressively for net new wins, new opportunities. And the nice thing that I'm observing now is that we are able to compete in opportunities that we were never able to compete in historically because of the lack of having this important part of the end-to-end Switching portfolio. Last thing I'll just say is there are some transitions that are happening in the data center space, as our customers go from 10gig and 40gig to 25gig and 100gig. I think that plays out nicely because at the end of the day, these data centers are essentially becoming high performance networking problems that are Layer 3 in nature. That's exactly the kind of really high performance problems that I think Juniper loves to solve.
Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: And then Rami, I was hoping you could touch on the potential impact from Jericho-based Routing products, particularly in the cloud vertical and perhaps to what extent you view more advanced Layer 3 switches is a threat to your Edge Routing business, and should we expect you guys to more directly address this market later this year or next?
Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, certainly it's a question that has come up. I think at the end of the day, the thing that matters the most to our customers, across all verticals, including the cloud vertical, are the capabilities of the products and the solutions themselves – from the standpoint of flexibility, Layer 3 stack capabilities, the density in performance, the price per port, et cetera. And I will just say that I am very comfortable with where we are today based on the technology decision that we have made historically that includes silicon decisions. And if you recall what I had mentioned in our last analyst event, I sort of categorized the market in three distinct buckets. There are those that care about very flexible Routing with a lot of features and a lot of flexibility and programmability; those that care more about WAN transport – wide area network transport efficiency; and those that care about cost efficiency as it pertains to Switching. And I don't think that we have ever been this strong across all three of those domains today with our product portfolio. Now, going forward, we will constantly be evaluating what we do internally in terms of developing our own silicon technology, and what we can get from merchant silicon vendors, and making the right decisions based on the capabilities that we can get externally versus that what we can do internally, and that's exactly what we're doing right now. So, net-net this is a competitive industry; we've never lost sight of that. But I'm comfortable with where we are from a technology standpoint and our ability to compete.
Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thanks, guys.
Kathleen Nemeth - Vice President of Investor Relations: Thanks, Jess.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Kesireddy with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Ashwin X. Kesireddy - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah, hi, thanks for taking my question. Rami, I just want to go back to the discussion around pricing pressure. I was just wondering if this pricing pressure is more concentrated on sell-in customers, and whether we could expect a recovery there any time soon. And also, just going back to your 2016 full year revenue outlook, I think on the last conference call, you said you were constructive on revenue growth, and now it looks like – it sounded to me like you are turning down a little bit. I was just wondering what has changed in the last three months. Exiting Q1, I thought things were getting better and now, clearly there's a change in tone. Any more color you can give there would be really helpful.
Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, let me start and I'll see if Ken wants to weigh in on this. With respect to the comments about pricing, there are no clear patterns in terms of specific customers with the exception of just saying that it's mostly focused in the EMEA region and it's mostly a result of things like foreign exchange. We're not calling this a new normal in terms of gross margins. I think there are a number of things that we can do to improve things going forward; but in the meantime, we're going to be very prudent in how we manage the business, control operating expenses, and so on. And then from a revenue standpoint, actually, what we said is that we remain constructive on the full year from a revenue standpoint, 2016 versus 2015. Where we're being a bit more cautious is on our operating margins and that's primarily as a result of the gross margin impact that we're seeing in Q2 – that we saw in Q2. But we'll continue to manage the business very prudently to protect operating margins to the extent that we can.
Ashwin X. Kesireddy - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question ma'am.
Balaji Krishnamurthy - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. This is Balaji Krishnamurthy calling on her behalf. I have two questions. The first one on the Routing business, you mentioned that you saw a (24:38) decline in that business in the U.S. cloud providers segment. What drove the weakness there? And then on the Security business, maybe just to back up a little bit. So, since you refreshed SRX last year, you saw some strong growth through the remaining part of 2015, but it's now again fallen off in the first two quarters. So what kind of visibility do you have in terms of recovery for that vertical, and is it through the existing portfolio, or would you be adding more products into the portfolio? Thanks.
Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure, thanks Balaji for the questions. On the Routing, I think that we actually are encouraged by what we've seen in Routing in terms of the sequential improvement from the Q1 standpoint. And we really saw this across all geos, so that's actually something that we are happy about. I think that if you look at the Routing opportunity – oh, the last thing – the second thing I would say about Routing is just from a demand metrics standpoint, our bookings were strong. A lot of the deferred revenue that we saw in Q2 was also connected to Routing. So, that gives us confidence in the second half of the year as it pertains to Routing. Certainly, there is a cloud, there's a telco, there's a cable component to our Routing business. I feel good about the cloud component. I think that the new products are going to have a big role in the cloud provider networks. And I think that should start in the second half of the year. Telco is a bit more of a mixed message. I think if I look at the global opportunity, there are certainly good opportunities, especially in international for our Routing products. That includes the MX and the new PTX products. I think visibility for Tier 1 telcos in particular for the second half remain somewhat challenging. I think on the Enterprise side, we saw good, very good in fact, sequential recovery in Q2. That was across Switching and Routing, and I feel pretty good about that in the second half as well. So, I think there's actually quite a lot of good things happening from a Routing standpoint if you factor in the opportunities, as the refresh cycle that we're undertaking right now. Oh, and thank you for reminding me, Ken, there was a secondary question about Security. So, Security sequentially up over Q1, but certainly nowhere near what it would need to be for us to be happy or content with the performance of this business. We're disappointed in the results. I think this is the business that is right now in transition. And I expect it to be in transition for the remainder of this year. As I've always said that, it's – this transition is going to be somewhat lumpy in terms of how the business is going to perform. Last year, I'd say that the performance was better than my expectations, and it was largely driven by some large telco and cloud deployments that this year haven't really played out yet to offset some of the transitions that we are executing on in the Enterprise side. And that's where the focus is. I think we have a very compelling and competitive service provider solution for high bandwidth Security applications. That's true also for the cloud. The part of the business that requires more attention and focus, and the one that we're actually giving the attention focus to today is on the Enterprise side. The feedback that we're getting from our partners, our customers, on the roadmap, on the products that we have introduced thus far, is very encouraging, but there is still a ton of execution for us to work through, through the rest of this year, and I expect the growth to happen next year.
Balaji Krishnamurthy - Goldman Sachs & Co.: All right. All the best. Thank you.
Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz from Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Daniel Gaide - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys, this is Dan Gaide on for Mark. Thanks for taking my question. In the past we've talked about RFP activity increasing, particularly in Switching and Security, and it looks like we're starting to see that pay off for Switching. But can you just talk about what it's going to take to get to that next level in Security and just getting you through that transition period that you just mentioned?
Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, thanks for the question, Dan. What it's going to take is more execution on our part, and a bit of time, to be honest. The Security space is a very competitive space. The thing that I think Juniper can leverage to our advantage is the fact that we're really thinking about it from a solutions standpoint. So as we go to our customers and help them build out a private cloud data center or a hybrid cloud data center, or things like on-premises cloud CPE solutions, there is a Security element to each and every one of those solutions. So, we are thinking about this from an overall architectural standpoint, how the technologies tie together, and, of course, then positioning Security along with the Routing and Switching. So, I think that's playing out already quite nicely in the cloud side. From an Enterprise standpoint, Enterprise campus, and so on, there is still some more features to develop, new hardware to release into the market, to get the cost per bit or the price per bit more competitive in the Security space. And I think next year is the year where we'll have enough critical mass to start seeing a recovery in the business.
Daniel Gaide - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks a lot. Just a quick follow-up on the Security – sorry, sort of three in a row – but how much this year do you think is being complicated, or trying to get the Security business right-footed and prepared to return to growth, is being complicated by some of the publicity around vulnerabilities in previous Juniper generations, et cetera? Is that having much of an impact? And I guess my second part of the question is in terms of future business development. How should we think about changes or how you address the changes in relationships with Nokia and Ericsson? Is that part of the competitive pressure that you're feeling in EMEA? Thanks a lot.
Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay, thanks for the question, James. On the Security side, the vulnerability that you discussed is at this point largely behind us. We took the matter very seriously. We did a very thorough internal review to make sure that the vulnerability was very specific to our old legacy screen OS Security products, and made sure that there is no such effect on the – and we in fact, invited a third-party company to come in to help us with this assessment, that there is no vulnerability on the Juno side. We were open with our customers, and I think we got a lot of kudos from our customers in how we handled the situation. I'm not saying that it has had no effect, but I think that the team did a good job of minimizing any effect. Right now, I think the main issue with Security is, there is a critical mass of new products, new features, new technologies we need to get into the market to be able to go after the largest market opportunities that exist. Right now, we're competitive, but in specific areas and use cases, and we need to be competitive in a broader set of use cases in Security. That's what we're absolutely maniacally focused on. In Security, the thing you should notice, as I mentioned, there is a strong revenue synergy associated with Switching and Routing, but there's also an equally strong cost synergy because much of the innovation that we put into Switching and Routing also contributes to our Security product portfolio. On your question related to our partners, Nokia and Ericsson, there's no real new news there. I think, with both of these customers – or these partners – we have talked about how the volume of business it's still relatively a small percentage of our overall revenue as a company. It has been on the decline well before some of the acquisitions and partnerships that have been announced and that's primarily because Juniper has been taking its destiny into its own hands. So in Europe, for example, the theater that you mentioned, we have over the years been taking more and more of the Tier 1 telecom operators to a direct engagement model, and that has played out well for us in terms of the business and the strategic nature of the relationships with those customers. Net-net, I think between the deliberate strategy that we're taking to go direct with certain customers that we need to go direct, especially those that have volume of business that's large enough, as well as the partnerships that we have available today, whether it be with NEC or with Ericsson or with IBM or with Amdocs, I'm not concerned at all about our ability to reach our customers in EMEA or elsewhere in the world.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dmitry Netis from William Blair. Please proceed.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, thank you for taking my question. I want to go back to the sort of the top line. And I know several questions have been asked, but I want to sort of get a sense of how you guys are thinking in the back half of the year. And could Security, given clearly, being a headwind here, could that potentially be down 25% – 20%, 25% – this year? And if that is the case, and you are planning for top line to be up slightly – so, let's assume it's up maybe 1% – that gives you a bit of a tough ramp in the Q4 timeframe of modeling somewhere in the 5.5%, 6%, maybe 6.5% range. So, what are sort of the ebbs and flows – given that Security is down – do you expect the Switching to kind of contribute, the Routing to contribute? And is Security really going to be down that much in that 20%, 25% range decline?
Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, yeah.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC: Can you give us a little bit of how to think about Q4?
Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I got the question and I appreciate it. I think, look to the example of Q2. Security, year-over-year, was down pretty significantly, but despite that we came in at the high end of our range for revenue. I think when we provide the constructive view of 2016 all-up, we're certainly factoring in what we expect from Switching, Routing and Security. Security is going to be a headwind. Keep in mind that the new products that are in the market now at standard lead times, where we're competing for opportunities worldwide, are mostly in the area of Routing and in Switching. And I think this is where we have the confidence that that part of the business is going to perform sufficiently to offset weakness and headwinds in Security. Anything else, Ken?
Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, just to talk a little bit about the numbers. So to your point, the first half results was about 1% up year-on-year, half-on-half. Q3 at the midpoint of guidance is flat year-on-year at the midpoint. We're not giving Q4 guidance, but I do think we're constructive on our Q4 ability to grow sequentially, primarily because of the strength in new products and some of the other factors that Rami's mentioned. That gets us to our modest growth for the year.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, and then my follow-up, if I look at the sort of geo splits, it sounds – most of the upside, I mean, you've seen it across all regions, that's fair – but most of the upside seems to have come from the APAC side of the equation. So, can you just fill in and talk about that and what's driving that? Is the partnerships with NEC or Lenovo or anybody else out there that you're seeing the uptick in revenue from?
Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, it's actually a great question. I am extremely proud of how our team in Asia-Pacific is executing right now. Around a year, year and a half ago or so, we made some changes in that region from a leadership standpoint. From a structural standpoint, we've refocused on parts of the APAC market that we believe are first growing, second, we are best equipped to support. We have activated partnerships that are helping us in Japan. We are in the process of activating a partnership with Lenovo, as we have announced historically, that will help us in worldwide but especially in APAC and especially in China. And looking out, I think the opportunity there for further momentum and growth are there. It's still a fairly challenging market for a variety of reasons, but with solid execution, we've now have had several quarters of performance, and again, very proud of the team.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then maybe a quick one to Ken on the BTI. What was the revenue in the quarter from BTI? Just a housekeeping question there.
Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, so we're not going to break it out specifically, but we did guide to $10 million to $15 million for the quarter, and it came in in line with our expectations.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. Good luck, guys.
Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.
Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Justin Wainwright - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi, this is Justin on for Jim Suva. Thank you for taking my question. I was wondering if you could comment on the progression of the ERP system and when the impact you believe is going to start to produce a productivity improvement and efficiencies moving forward.
Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I'll take that question. So, it's a good question. So, the way I describe it, clearly Q1 was the period of ramp; Q2 was largely the period of stability. We've made a lot of progress in Q2 on our processes and streamlining those processes. We still have a little – a few areas to still improvement upon – but for the most part the ERP stability is there. I would say, you didn't ask about DSO but some of those stability factors in invoicing did cause a few days of DSO to be higher than expected so DSO came in at 55. If you were to normalize for ERP activity, I think we'd be closer to the 50 range. But from a going forward, you're absolutely right, the focus for the second half and for next year is on value creation and optimization, leveraging the new system we have in place, and really streamlining our operation. So that is absolutely yet to come and something we're very focused on.
Justin Wainwright - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tejas Venkatesh from UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Tejas B. Venkatesh - UBS Securities LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking my question, I'm calling on behalf of Steve. I was hoping to get an update on the campus Switching business. Was it down year-over-year and do you foresee the new EX series helping the business return to growth? And I was also curious if you're seeing increased competitive pressures from most of your competitors having a wireless LAN business. Thanks.
Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, let me take that. Just net-net, I'd say the business was probably more flattish if you look at campus Switching specifically. But let me just qualify this a bit. We have been executing at Juniper on a very deliberate strategy of focusing on where the growth is, and where we can differentiate the most in the Switching area. And that is in Enterprise IT data centers, in private cloud, in public cloud. And that's why we've seen our Switching business perform really well. We do go after campus opportunities, but we mostly limit ourselves and our focus on the largest campuses that are typically very mission-critical and on-ramps to the cloud. And we also, of course, focus on customers that are able and willing to pick best-of-breed decisions between wired and wireless, right, so we can work effectively with our wireless partners in going after that opportunity. So, I think that if you consider all that, a flattish Switching performance for campus is something that I'm actually okay with. Overall, I think the Switching business is growing, and that's a result of the deliberate strategy and the focus that we've had as a company and I think that's a very good thing.
Tejas B. Venkatesh - UBS Securities LLC: And as a follow-up, can I get an update on the Lenovo partnership?
Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Certainly, yeah. So this is – it's still right now in the early stages in terms of putting in place the mechanics of how we're going to go after our customers worldwide, the partners and the channels that we need to work through and agree on, and also the technology integration that we are going to execute on to make sure that we provide compelling solutions to our customers. So, I think we've said historically that we don't anticipate meaningful contribution this year, and that remains the case. I think where this is going to start to benefit both Juniper and Lenovo is next year. I remain optimistic and excited about the opportunity in working with Lenovo. As you know, there's a large part of the market that is interested in converged stack architectures and having really compelling servers, storage, and networking working tightly together is something that I think is going to be helpful to our business.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great, thank you for taking my question. I wanted to kind of walk through three time periods to understand gross margin issues. So first of all, in the near term, you talked about challenges in the EMEA region, but it doesn't look to me that we've seen all that much movement during the June quarter of the Euro-to-dollar exchange rate, pre- the Brexit vote. So I'm just wondering whether this was an issue where it had been building up for some time and a competitor who sells in euros, basically you concluded you had to respond that things wouldn't move back in your favor. And then when we look out to 2017, I think most of us expect you'll face a new competitor in Routing, particularly in the data center. And we're wondering how that competitive dynamic could play out with a new entrant that sounds like they will be somewhat aggressive on pricing. And then looking out even further, the last part of this gross margin trend, is when does the software business, the Contrail and NorthStar products, when do they become material enough to be a tailwind to gross margin? Thank you.
Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay, great set of questions. Let me start, and maybe I'll start with more of the 2017 competitive question that you have. First, I would say that this is not – that competitive issue around new entrants into the market introducing the sort of Routing capabilities and so forth – that's not the issue that we're seeing in the Q3 and the Q2 timeframe. Are we anticipating that this industry is going to be – continue to be competitive? Absolutely, which is why it is so important for us to continue to focus on cost of goods sold improvements in our products to innovate in the area of ensuring that we can compete very effectively in those three different use cases that I mentioned just previously, around rich Routing, lean Routing and Switching, and also to preserve our long-term targets for gross margins. And based on everything that I know, the innovations and the technology that we're developing in the company, the plans that we have going forward, I feel comfortable that that can be done. I think from a software standpoint, we had provided guidance that by the 2019 timeframe, we will see that around 45% of our overall revenue is going to come from software and services. A lot of that is going to be in the area of recurring revenue in software, and I think that certainly helps us from a gross margin standpoint. I'll let Ken talk some more to that.
Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, I'll touch on the first and the third one. From a U.S. dollar strengthening, you're absolutely right, this really isn't related to a Q2 specific change in foreign currencies. It's more of the buildup over the last few quarters over the strengthening dollar, and the fact it's starting to have an impact on our customer budgets and their ability to purchase our equipment. So it's really more of the long-term buildup of the FX concerns, or strengthening of the U.S. dollar, I should say. From a software – Rami's right – the 45% was our long-term model of services and software. Just to level set those, we're at about 3% of our business was software last year, and I would expect it to grow gradually between that, and call it 15% to 20% if you presume services remains relatively stable, software stand alone would be 3% today, to 15% to 20% by 2019 and it should progress pretty gradually between now and then. We are seeing some benefit today. We talk about product mix. There are headwinds; there are tailwinds. Albeit, it's a relatively small percentage of our revenue, it's a growing percentage and every incremental dollar in software does help us on the gross margin line.
Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great, that's really very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. So, in terms of the gross margin getting back to that 64% metric, I would think that the opticals business that you guys purchased with BTI would see sequential growth throughout the year. And then in addition, if we assume there's no change in the FX dynamic, are you going to be able to get to 64% margin if you're doing $1.3 billion in revenue?
Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, so our current visibility from Q3 is reflected in the guidance we gave, which is 63%. So again, in line with Q2, primarily because some of the factors that developed in Q2, we see in Q3 as well. For the longer term, we're not giving Q4 guidance, but I think it's safe to expect some sequential improvement in both gross margin and operating margin in Q4. That's really our historic pattern and I would expect to drive to that in Q4 as well. We're clearly not giving up on the 64% operating model. We're working on cost innovation, cost improvements, cost structure, as well as product innovation, I should say, and making sure we sell the value of that. From a BTI perspective, I do expect BTI to ramp, and it does have a slight impact to gross margin percentage. However, I would state that the first quarter of ramp we did have some startup costs, et cetera, that as BTI scales, it will become more margin favorable than it is today as we go forward.
Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Let me – an additional thing I'd like to add on the optical side as a reminder – is that we're not after building a stand-alone optical business. I think the world has enough optical technology providers. What we're out to do is to really capture an inflection point in the market around packet optical solutions that include the packet layers, the optical layers, and also very importantly, the software layers that tie all of these together. So, we're playing much more of a disruptive game in the optical space as it pertains to packet integration. You might have seen the news around Juniper joining the Telecom Infra Project with Facebook and Microsoft and others. The whole idea is to develop open, interoperable solutions in the networking domain around packet optical that I think will benefit us in the long term.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein from Cowen & Co. Please proceed with your question.
Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks, a quick housekeeping question, and then a real question. Can you remind me what percentage of total revenue was cloud providers? And I hate to ask about gross margins yet again – I recognize this is the fourth time on this call – but going through the math, I'm still confused with the simple question being how much of this is secular versus how much is transitory. EMEA was down as a percentage of total revenue in both 1Q and 2Q versus last year, and that was about 1.5 to 4 percentage points. I recognize some of that is the lower pricing impacting revenues. But your product gross margin was down almost one percentage point sequentially following 100 basis point to over 200 basis point decline in the first quarter from calendar 2015 levels, and the quarter represents an all-time low. And I'm not trying to give you a hard time, I'm just trying to understand, how much of this is secular? How much of it is transitory? The FX was an issue throughout last year as well, for that matter.
Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, so we really did not experience much in the way of FX-related pricing pressure last year. We started to experience a little bit of it in Q4 of last year, but quite honestly the elevated pricing pressure that we experienced in Q2 was new to us, right? It hit us stronger than it has in the past. It's always been a very competitive environment, and we've been able to deal with that, and we expect to be able to deal with that going forward, but the Q2 pricing pressure, particularly in EMEA, was acute this quarter and that is new. The other impact, we talked about pricing pressure as well as margin. We're not breaking out exact math, but they had both roughly an equal impact to the call it traditional 64%, or our long-term model of 64% versus the 63% result. Product mix really has the ability to go either way. In this particular quarter, it cost us a couple tenths and hurt us, but we do have chassis sales out there, we can fill with line cards (51:25). We're transforming the company to more of a software stream (51:43), so we're very focused on recouping the margins that we lost in Q2, and are not coming off our long-term model.
Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: On the pricing pressure, and if you said I apologize, but was that across the board in EMEA? Was it certain product markets more prevalent, certain customer markets? Can you give us any insight? And again, if you can share with us the percentage of revenue from cloud providers.
Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, so the cloud providers, I'll touch on that because I forgot last time. Sorry about that. In FY 2015 we talked about it being – 2016 – being 19% of the total revenue and obviously our fastest growing vertical, it gets us to nearer 25% by 2019. So that's a reminder of the cloud vertical. From a pricing and where it happened, it was really more geographic and customer-specific, I would say, than just a broad base. We did see pressure globally. I think the macro environment as it relates to this geopolitical issues, et cetera, are kind of being different in every geo, but we are seeing a bit of global pressure but really specific to EMEA and specific to certain geographies in EMEA.
Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: Is it Enterprise, Service Provider, both?
Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: It's both. I would not say it's a customer vertical specific situation.
Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC: I appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jayson Noland from Baird. Please proceed.
Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, great, thank you. Rami, I wanted to follow up on your prepared remarks around CEB, the cloud-enabled brand solution, and maybe to start your broader perspective on SD-WAN, the pace of adoption as you see it in the market, and you outlined some opportunities. Is this also a revenue headwind for the category as corporates shift away from expensive MPOS interconnects?
Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, thanks for the question, Jason. I think actually, the cloud-enabled branch solutions that we're developing are in fact a potential tailwind for us. So, as I have mentioned with respect to the telco space, and them moving, changing their architectures and moving to much more of an agile scale-out service delivery model, we want to make sure that we are in the middle of this architectural transformation that's happening. So that once they start to prove out the model and to make revenue – and to start growing their virtualized solution business, that we benefit from that. And I would say that although the revenue contribution to Juniper is still very small, the opportunity is very large in the future. And I think we are in many cases in pole position in working and developing these solutions for our customers. I know SD-WAN is sort of a very big topic these days. I think our best and most immediate opportunity is to support and help our service provider and telco customers, in developing very effective, agile, cost-competitive solutions that will help them in competing effectively with the stand-alone point player SD-WAN players that are out there. That's what we're doing, and I think that's our best strategy considering the relationships we have with our telcos and also the technology that we've developed for them.
Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): And Rami, pace of adoption, SDN's been somewhat slow. Is this going to happen more quickly?
Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: SDN is such a broad term. If you look at SDN as it pertains to the cloud virtualization, cloud orchestration, there I'm pleased with the pace of adoption, the win rate, even if revenue is still relatively small compared to our overall revenue of the company for Contrail. What I like about it is it's a very strategic part of every sale, every engagement. It's almost entirely subscription-based recurring revenue and it's setting ourselves up for selling virtualized Security, virtualized Routing, et cetera, in the future. I think that part is moving according to plan. As far as these new cloud-enabled brand solutions, a lot of it was going to depend on the success of the telcos in making those services successful to their end customers, in particular the enterprise customers. So, we're helping them do that because we recognize that if we help them do that, and they grow that business, we will be able to grow a brand new revenue stream for the company, and that's something that I'm very excited about. I don't think it's going to happen meaningfully this year, but I'm hopeful that it'll start to contribute in a meaningful way next year.
Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you.
Kathleen Nemeth - Vice President of Investor Relations: Thank you. And we have time for one more question.
Operator: Okay, our final question comes from the line of Erik Suppiger from JMP Securities. Please proceed.
Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC: Yeah, thanks for taking the question. Just a quick question on the pricing. Can you comment about pricing in the Security sector in particular? You had a competitor this morning also note some pricing pressure in that sector.
Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, so we saw pricing pressure really in all technologies. However, Security – definitely not immune from that – so we did see some pricing pressure in Security. But again, our strongest correlation was more geographic really than it was product related.
Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC: Very good. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen...
Kathleen Nemeth - Vice President of Investor Relations: Okay, well, that ends...
Operator: I'm sorry. Go ahead, Kathleen.
Kathleen Nemeth - Vice President of Investor Relations: No, no, no go ahead, Chris. I was going to say the same thing. Unfortunately, this is all the time we have today. And I just wanted to thank everyone for your great questions as always and look forward to talking with you soon.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our teleconference for today and we thank you for your time and participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful rest of the day.

Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks Kathleen, and welcome everyone. Despite a challenging start to the year, we delivered both revenue and earnings per share growth on a year-on-year basis. The macro volatility we saw in the beginning of the year resulted in customers taking a cautious approach in the enterprise. In addition, we experienced unanticipated delays in certain service provider deployments which impacted revenue in the quarter. As we enter the June quarter, we are encouraged by improved visibility with respect to the timing of these deployments as well as some early and important design wins with our new products. We remain constructive on the full-year 2016 and intend to continue to make progress towards our long-term financial model. Let's turn now to some highlights of the business. We continued to execute our strategy with significant advancements in performance and automation across a number of key solution areas. First, with the introduction of our QFX10008 spine switch, which became generally available last quarter, customers can now enjoy the most complete and compelling solution for the cloud we've ever had. Our cloud solution now includes best-in-class switching products across all layers of the data center, the most flexible data center edge routing product, our industry-leading MX Universal Edge Router, the industry's highest performance data center perimeter security solution, our high-end SRX, and increasingly essential network orchestration software, our Contrail SDN Controller, which once again was just voted by the OpenStack community as the most widely-used commercially-available controller in the world for the third consecutive time. Second, our solutions for wide-area IP transport across data center interconnect, metro, and core is now unparalleled, with the introduction of our newest PTX line card coupled with our multilayer optimization controller, NorthStar, which we expect to soon combine with optical technology and talent from BTI Systems. We are innovating across layers of IP and optical, much of it via software, and in so doing, we expect to create new levels of network efficiency and operational simplicity for our customers. This is our strength, and leverages our heritage in a way that is highly aligned with how we believe networks will evolve over time. We also introduced Juniper's Software-Defined Secure Network that leverages our recently (4:44) shipping security products like Sky Advanced Threat Prevention, an innovative cloud-based day zero anti-malware ATP solution, and our refreshed, branch focused, and mid-range SRX platform. Unlike the current status quo, it is a unique approach in the industry that embraces the principles of SDN and leverages the full capabilities of the entire network for threat detection and enforcement. To complement our solutions portfolio, we also solidified several new partnerships, including a global strategic partnership with Lenovo to build next-generation converged data center solutions for enterprise and web-scale customers. We also expanded our global alliances with NEC and Amdocs to deliver NFV-based solutions that allow service providers and enterprises to gain greater service agility through automation. We look forward to sharing more about our important partnerships and go-to-market strategy with you at our upcoming Investor Day in New York. Now, let me touch on the performance for the first quarter of each of the three elements of our business – security, routing, and switching. In security, we had a tough quarter. In addition to general weakness in enterprise and telecom, we are also now in the midst of several product transitions that affected demand of some of our older SRX security products. In Q1, we delivered several new security solutions including enhanced SRX products targeting the distributed enterprise, a vastly enhanced version of our Security Director management software, and Sky Advanced Threat Prevention. I have said before that as we grow this area of our business, we expect it to take time and be a bit bumpy along the way. But I feel good about the long-term roadmap we're executing on and the confidence that we are building with our customers and partners. Security remains an important part of the solutions we sell to our customers, who depend on Juniper to make the successful transition to the cloud. In routing, we saw solid growth from our cloud customers as they continue to build out their networks to cope with significant IP traffic growth. Our PTX ExpressPlus products, which began shipping late last quarter, are already seeing strong interest from a number of customers, including several going through beta cycles as well as several important design wins. I'm pleased with our performance in switching, where we saw year-over-year revenue growth driven by the cloud data center use case, which continues to be a key focus area for us. We believe that we have a good pipeline for the QFX10000 switches, including the newest QFX10008 spine switch, which has already achieved design wins with a number of telecom and cloud provider customers. There is no shortage of change occurring in this competitive landscape that we're in. While industry trends will continue to evolve, we believe our strategy will guide us in successfully navigating challenges and doing what is right for our customers. I remain very excited by all the new opportunities our investments in technology innovations are making possible. As I look ahead in 2016 and beyond, I believe that Juniper is well positioned to create value for our shareholders on a consistent and sustained basis. I want to sincerely thank our shareholders for their confidence, our customers for their trust and loyalty, and our employees for their dedication and continuous improvement efforts. Now, I'll turn it over to Ken.
Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. It's great to be here today with all of you. I look forward to meeting with many of you in the upcoming days and weeks. The March quarter was challenging from a revenue perspective. Enterprise revenues were impacted by cautious customer buying patterns due to macroeconomic factors, and to a lesser extent, greater than anticipated weakness due to product transitions in the campus and branch security. Service provider revenues were impacted by the timing of deployments related to certain U.S. and EMEA Tier-1 telecoms. Despite some of the challenges this quarter, we delivered year-over-year revenue growth, led by increases in the Americas, primarily driven by cloud and cable providers as well as growth in our government vertical across all geographies. Our revenue growth and effective management of our cost structure resulted in expanded non-GAAP operating margin and a $0.05 increase to diluted earnings per share on a year-over-year basis. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, five were telecoms, four were cloud or cable providers, and one was an enterprise. Of these customers, three were located outside of the United States. This reflects our continued focus on diversifying our customer base. Our underlying demand metrics were healthy this quarter, with a product book-to-bill greater than 1 and a modest increase in product deferred revenue year-over-year and sequentially. As we disclosed in the Q4 2015 CFO commentary, we went live with our ERP system on January 18. Overall, we believe the implementation has gone well. However, order processing and shipment linearity were affected in the quarter as we ramped up on the new system. This system change resulted in invoicing occurring later in the quarter than customary, which increased DSO by approximately 15 days. We anticipate DSO to return to our target range of 45 days to 55 days in Q2 2016. As is typical with ERP implementations of this magnitude, the stabilization of the new processes and system will take several months. We are confident that the system implementation will result in productivity improvements and efficiencies as we move forward. In the quarter we had cash flow from operations of $172 million, down $47 million year-over-year and up $55 million sequentially. We repurchased $75 million worth of shares and paid $38 million in dividends. Since the first quarter of 2014, inclusive of the share repurchases and dividends, we have returned approximately $3.75 billion of capital to shareholders against our commitment to return $4.1 billion by the end of 2016. Now, moving on to our Q2 guidance, which is detailed in our CFO commentary available on our website. Our guidance includes the contribution from our acquisition of BTI Systems which closed April 1, 2016. We expect BTI to contribute approximately $10 million to $15 million of revenue and approximately $10 million of operating expenses in the second quarter. For the year, we expect the operations of BTI to be neutral to the non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. We plan to integrate BTI into our business and do not intend to breakout financial details going forward. From a demand perspective, we expect an improvement in deployments from certain U.S. and EMEA Tier-1 telecoms. We also expect enterprise demand to improve modestly versus Q1 levels. The outlook factors in that the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to other currencies will remain relatively stable at current levels. For the full year, we are focused on driving long-term shareholder value and remain constructive on revenue growth for 2016. We will continue to prudently manage operating expenses and expect to expand operating margins in 2016. I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. From a personal perspective, I'm very excited to work with Rami and the team as Juniper's CFO. I can tell you that I'm personally committed to the 2016 operating principles we outlined last quarter, of driving revenue growth in our target markets, diligently managing operating expenses and expanding operating margins, and maintaining a healthy balance sheet and an optimized capital structure. I look forward to further discussing our long-term financial strategy and outlook with you at our upcoming Investor Day. And now, with that, I'd like to open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. The first question is from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Thank you very much. I wanted to first ask about operating margins. You're guiding them down to about 22% in the June quarter, but then up for the full year relative to last year which would imply a pretty significant improvement in the second half. So if you can just address that. And then secondarily, I wanted to clarify the revenue outlook for the year. When you say you're constructive, does that mean that you're guiding for a revenue increase? And also that seems a little bit more a positive language versus that in the pre-announcement. So just curious if some of the recent design wins you were referencing has contributed to that improved optimism.
Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Thanks, Simona. Let me start, and then I'll hand it over to Ken for additional commentary. A couple of factors that are at play here. As we get into the second quarter, our visibility and our confidence is certainly better now than it was just a few weeks ago in the Q1, just in terms of the timing of some of the deployments that we referred to that we expected to hit in the Q1 timeframe to have it now move to Q2 from a telco standpoint. And also, just confidence levels associated with the enterprise business is all up. It was a slow start to the year. We started to see a recovery throughout Q1, but it really hit near the very end of the quarter. So that gives us a bit more confidence going into the Q2 timeframe. And, yes, we are looking at and expecting revenue increasing for the full-year 2016. That of course means that we should have a good second half of the year, and we based that just based on the discussions we're having with our customers, timing of projects. And then importantly, we're anticipating, as we've said in the past, that our new products which are now in the market are going through proof of concepts, we're competing in certain opportunities around the world, are going to start to ramp in the second half of the year. And I'll let Ken comment more on the OpEx side in particular.
Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, so from an OpEx perspective, the guidance of $500 million, plus or minus $5 million, is essentially flat to this quarter with the exception of adding $10 million for the BTI acquisition, so we're really maintaining a flat OpEx Q-on-Q, whereas the revenue was up 8% or over 8% at the midpoint, which is why the operating margins expand in Q-on-Q. From a year-on-year perspective it is slightly down at the midpoint compared to last year, however last year's seasonality was a bit atypical. This year, we expect the seasonality to be more in line with historical seasonality patterns and we expect our margin to grow as revenue grows throughout the year.
Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you.
Kathleen Nemeth - Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations: Thanks, Simona. Next question, please?
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi, guys. I just wanted to first follow up on Simona's question and just hopefully understand as we look out towards the second half of the year, to what extent operating margin will be driven by better growth or should we expect some additional cost savings there as we get beyond Q2. And then I was hoping perhaps for Rami, you could update us on the timing of the QFX10016, provide some additional details regarding the pipeline you're seeing develop for the QFX10008 and what's giving you confidence these platforms are likely to win against some of the competitive platforms in the market and why customers are picking the QFX over the alternatives. Thanks.
Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure, Jess. Let me start with the second question first, and then certainly Ken and I can address the first one. The QFX product line, we introduced the first version last year, the second version, which is the 2008 (sic) [QFX10008], just this last – this quarter. And we're in the process now of essentially competing for various different opportunities. The one thing that I can say is the opportunities that we are now competing in are opportunities that we never were able to compete with or even engage with our competitors on for various customers around the world. So the first positive thing is we're expanding our opportunity, and that's very evidenced and is very clear. Second certainly our customers have had these products in their labs now for several months, even before they started becoming generally available. And we've been getting feedback through betas and we're integrating that feedback in making sure that the product is ready for general deployability. And then last, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there are some wins to speak of here that would give us confidence. So I think the products, even if you compare them to what is a changing competitive landscape, are very competitive both from the standpoint of scale and performance but also just in terms of the full capability of Layer 2 and Layer 3 that we've integrated into those switches. Your question around the timing of the QFX10016, it's in the second half of this year, is when we anticipate it. So we're already bidding it in certain RFPs that require that sort of density. And certainly the effort and the work that we've put into the QFX10008 will go towards the work that's remaining in the QFX10016. So I feel good about the product all up. And then your question around our operating margin and how much it depends on revenue, I'll just let Ken address that.
Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, so our constructive view on operating margin expansion, it does start with our view on the revenue for the full year. So that's clearly a key attribute to our operating margin expansion, and Rami mentioned some of the reasons why we have that constructive view. In addition to that, we're still seeing the benefit from some of the restructurings we've been going through for the last couple of years. We're going to continue to manage OpEx very prudently, particularly when revenue is under pressure. So you could count on us to continuing to do that. I also should note that over the past couple of years, we have increased the proportion of variable costs as a component to our operating expenses, so that's also an additional lever that we have to help us manage operating margins as we go forward. We will continue to drive towards our long-term model of 39% of OpEx as a percentage of revenue.
Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Should we be thinking about OpEx flattish in the second half versus the first half? Thanks.
Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I think our commitment is to be prudently managing OpEx, and also to grow operating margins, so that's what we're going to be focused on in the second half.
Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Rod Hall of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah, thanks for the question. I just wanted to clarify the situation on the ERP, and then I had a bigger picture question. So you guys said that invoicing was delayed. Was it – can you just confirm it was all caught up at the end of Q1, or did some of those invoices push into Q2? And then Ken, I think you said 15 days of DSOs, so we've got about $180 million or so of excess in the accounts receivable – just to confirm that. And then I guess I'll ask my follow-up after you guys answer that one.
Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, I'll start with the second part. Yeah, I can confirm that is about right from a DSO perspective, so that would be additional accounts receivable as compared to what we would expect with our normal DSO targets of 45 days to 55 days. So those numbers sound right. From an ERP implementation, we're actually proud of the fact that we went live with the new system, and it actually went quite well. We don't believe it had a meaningful impact to revenue. That said, it did have an impact to the timing of orders and shipments. So that's really why it really made the quarter back-end loaded. Q1 is typically a pretty back-end loaded quarter anyway, but with the system implementation, it became more so. And it's primarily because we were effectively down for the first two weeks or three weeks in the quarter. And as we went live with the new system on January 18, it did take some ramp-up time, not only from a system perspective, but just from a procedure and process perspective, so the growing pains and learning curve associated with that resulted in a delay as far as the timing of the orders.
Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then – thanks for that, Ken. And then my follow-up, the big Tier-1s that have reported so far, their CapEx has been weaker than we would have anticipated in Q1. Some telecom analysts are reducing their CapEx expectations, as seems to always happen at the beginning of the year here. I'm just curious what you guys think is happening in the U.S. from a broader point of view on those carrier budgets. Do you think they're stable? Do you think it's just a push-out of budgets further into the year as we've all gotten used to, or do you think they're actually reducing spending expectations?
Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Rod, this is Rami. So certainly I think it's fair to say that the telecom operators, U.S., maybe elsewhere around the world as well, are off to a fairly slow start this year in terms of their CapEx expenditures. There are a number of factors at play here, whether it's M&A or spectrum or just re-evaluating their overall network architectures and making sure that they're developing their networks to meet the future demands from an agility, from an operational simplicity standpoint, and from an ability to deliver next-generation capabilities to their end-users. I think the most important thing for Juniper now is to make sure that we are working and engaging with telecom operators very effectively in ensuring that we remain relevant in the new architecture that they're deploying. This is where our – the combination of our switching, our routing, and our orchestration software – and namely this is Contrail – is really helping us tremendously. So I feel good that we're engaging in a way that is going to enable us to benefit from the spend that they will end up putting into these next-generation architectures. Until then, I think they're going continue to run their networks hotter and essentially free up the capacity and the management cycles within their organizations to develop those next-gen architectures. The other things that we must do is to continue to diversify our portfolio. We saw real strength in Q4 in the cable operators; in Q1, cloud operators. And I can tell you that the products that we're developing and we've introduced into the markets have broad applicability and have been developed with a very keen eye on the requirements of each of those strategic verticals: cable, cloud, strategic enterprises and telcos, but I think the telco space is just a little bit more complicated right now as they evolve their architectures.
Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. Yeah, hi, Rami, Ken. A quick question and a follow-on. Your enterprise business seems to be going through large swings in revenues quarter-on-quarter. Help us understand what causes the volatility? Is it purchasing patterns? A certain segment of the enterprise market? Is it campus and brands? Data center switching? Thank you.
Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure, Vijay. So you're absolutely right that enterprise is off to a weak start in 2016. I think there are a number of factors. First and foremost, there was a slow start from a macro standpoint. And as we said, it did improve, but improved only near the end of the Q1 timeframe. It's not the only factor. I think there were product transitions that affected us as well, affected us, quite frankly, more than what we had expected. The areas where those product transitions, I think, hurt us in the Q1 timeframe were mostly in cloud where we had some transitions in our – sorry, it's not cloud. I should say campus, where we had transitions in our switching product lines, in particular, the EX. And also in security where – as you know in security, we have for the last year been executing on a new strategy. We have been delivering new products to our customers, and I feel very good about those products. But we've also taken a bit of an aggressive stance towards end-of-life-ing some of our older SRX products with the goal of ensuring that we have maximal capacity – engineering and go-to-market – to think about the newer products, the next-generation products, things like the virtual products, the cloud-based security products. And I do think that that had more of an impact than we initially expected in the Q1 timeframe.
Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Perfect, and a quick follow-on, Rami, if I may, on edge routing. Your MX product is obviously a flagship here in edge routing. So we have seen early order strength from CommScope this morning, they've beaten res (26:49) numbers, macrocell densification, AWS-3 spectrum auction build-outs. Would it be reasonable to assume that edge routing would kind of naturally follow some of the wireless capacity upgrades, because traffic has to be aggregated? Thanks.
Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I don't know if it's just edge routing, I would say it's routing all up. Certainly as you put more capacity into spectrum and to the air, that will ultimately see its way into fiber and will require that your routing keep pace. Now, on the routing side, we're actually seeing now very good momentum in our PTX product line, right? We saw both year-over-year as well as sequential growth in the PTX product line. And keep in mind that both the PTX and the MX are not yet fully benefiting from the enhancements that we have announced that will start to see their way into the performance of those products in a meaningful way in the second half of this year. So when I think about capacity requirements in routing, whether it's driven by cloud providers or in the telco space, or aggregation of mobile sites, or in high enterprise, I think competitively, we are very good right now. I feel very good about our competitive positioning.
Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Sanjiv Wadhwani of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Sanjiv Wadhwani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Rami, just any further color on the timing of these Tier-1 U.S. and EMEA push-outs? Is it related to sort of the weaker CapEx that we saw in Q1? Or were there some other issues going on over there? And then, quick follow up to that, MX was down sequentially. Was it all related to all these projects that got pushed out, or was there some other stuff going on with the MX?
Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure, Sanjiv. As far as timing is concerned for these telcos, I can tell you that where we are right now just in Q2, and based on our visibility of the deployments that we had anticipated in the Q1 timeframe, we were much more confident about the fact that those deployments are going happen in the Q2 and beyond sort of timeframe. And yes, I mean, the MX was essentially flat year-over-year, down sequentially, which is not atypical just based on seasonality. And the PTX, however, as I mentioned, is seeing some great momentum both year-over-year and sequentially. As far as the MX business is concerned, yeah, I would say that part of that is related to the timing of the telco spend that we had anticipated in Q1 now moving to Q2 and beyond.
Sanjiv Wadhwani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Trevor Bacon of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Trevor Bacon - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, guys, thanks for taking the question. My question revolves around the security business. So 2015 was supposed to be the year of stabilization, and I understand there are puts and takes, but there has been a limited recovery in what is otherwise a generally attractive growth market. So what gives you the confidence that your strategy is the right one? And at what point would you consider alternatives for the business, given that it seems it will be difficult to grow this year given where we've set the bar in the first quarter? Thanks.
Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, thanks, Trevor. So in thinking about security, it's probably useful to reflect back on 2015. We started with a refocused strategy, and we executed on new products first focusing on the service provider space, the high end of the security market where we actually saw some good momentum last year, and we certainly saw a lot of great enhancements in the product set itself. The thing about the service provider element of our security business is that it's lumpy. And there are a couple of things that impacted us in the Q1 timeframe. First is we've got hit with a downwards part of the lump, if you will, on the SP side, where there weren't any large orders from the service provider or cloud space for those high-end customers. Again, it's a part of the business that's just difficult to predict that's going to be somewhat lumpy. And then there were the transitions that we have to deal with in the Q1 timeframe. We have recently introduced a new set of security products for the enterprise: the SRX1500, the SRX300, and cloud-based ATP solution, an enhanced cloud management systems that I know are all hitting the mark with our customers because we're getting that feedback, but it's going to take some time to get all of the transitions worked out. You're right in stating that last year was supposedly the year of stability – we ended up actually exceeding our expectations in that timeframe. I think where I might have gotten wrong – or what I might have gotten wrong is the timing. I think we expected some of those transition issues to happen last year. It looks like they're happening more in the first part of this year. And I feel good about the strategy all up. I feel good about the execution right now. We just have to work through these transition issues throughout this year. We're off to a slow start. So I'm not confused about the fact that there is a deficit to work through on the security side to get back to growth, but I think we were reasonably conservative enough in our long-term outlook, three-year outlook of 1% to 3% ending in the 2017 timeframe, that that is still very much achievable.
Trevor Bacon - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. I wanted to I guess touch on BTI and I know it may be a little bit early, but how conversations have been going there and in that for the data center interconnect opportunity, generally. It seems like this is an important opportunity for Juniper, but also a lot of other players are trying to come into this segment, so I wanted to get your feeling for your development of the confidence there and some of the things that we should be looking for to gauge success of Juniper? Thanks.
Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, certainly, James. So the optical opportunity is one that we have been looking at and executing towards now for a number of years. So this certainly did not start with the BTI acquisition. And we're looking at this from the standpoint of capturing inflection points in the market around the convergence of packet and optical. We're also looking at this in terms of achieving the architectures that are necessary in a way that truly simplify the overall operations to management of multilayer networks. And we're certainly focusing on the data center interconnect market and the metro market. What BTI does is that it helps us to accelerate the strategy that we're already executing on towards being able to achieve those architectures. And I feel very good about the opportunity. I also feel good about how we're thoughtfully integrating the BTI assets into our overall portfolio. It is a growing market. It's certainly a competitive market. But I think we have a good stronghold in certain parts of the market today with our MX and PTX product that help us to very naturally capture this inflection point that's happening today.
James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. And then I guess just back on the pacing of enterprise and your confidence for the second half of the year, you talked about that there was improvement towards the end of the quarter. Can you just give a little more color as to what types of data points or behaviors that you're looking at to increase the optimism around enterprise after the tough first quarter?
Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Ken, why don't you go ahead?
Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure, this is Ken. Yeah, you got it right. We did see improvement later in the quarter from a demand perspective. From our perspective, the volatility in the market has improved since the beginning of the year. We're still being cautious with the market. It's still a market that has some uncertainty, but it is less uncertain than it was in the beginning of the year. And we did see that in our demand profile. That said, being cautious, we are still modestly – expecting it to grow modestly from Q1 levels into Q2. So we are expecting an improvement quarter-on-quarter in the enterprise space.
James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks.
Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Pierre Ferragu of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. So on these projects in the U.S., that's quite delayed, so I was wondering if you could give us a bit more color about what happened? So is that just like one project, or is that several projects? And what was the cause of the delays? I hope it wasn't because like the Juniper technology wasn't fit for purpose? So is that, like, just logistics or did you have, like, a real technological issue? And if we think about, like, a real issue, do you have better visibility now because you now know the situation is completely cleared up and it's just a question of getting the project to deliver? Or is there still a bit of an uncertainty in terms of resolving reloading issues? And then you sound very confident about these projects coming back into as early as Q2, and I'm actually a bit surprised because when I look at your quarter-on-quarter guidance, it doesn't especially adjust for BTI. It doesn't seem to be much higher than normal seasonality between the Q1 and the Q2 actually in line with normal seasonality. So does that mean you've been prudent in your guide in other areas of the business, or is there another moving part I'm missing? Thanks.
Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Pierre, let me start. I think the answer is fairly simple. First it's not just in the U.S., it's a number of telcos, Tier-1 in particular in the U.S. and EMEA. It is not a Juniper-specific thing in any way, and it certainly has nothing to do with fit for purpose as you mentioned in your question. And what gives us more confidence now is that we have better visibility. And certainly, that comes from talking to our customers, understanding what the deployment time frames are going to be. And as I mentioned, just based on where we are right now in the Q2 timeframe, that visibility has improved somewhat from the last few weeks. So that's why we are more confident today.
Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, and I would just add that the service provider business, particularly telecom, has always been lumpy and deployment based. And it is difficult to predict the precise timing of when those large deployments are going to happen.
Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And maybe on this question about the Q2 guide, so does that mean you had a very prudent approach, or?
Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: We feel – we stand behind our Q2 guide. It is up over 8% at the midpoint, which is a bit beyond historical patterns. We do expect some of that telecom deployment to start to catch up into Q2 and beyond. We don't expect it to shift all just in one quarter. It will shift into Q2 and beyond Q2. We also expect a modest increase in the enterprise within that guidance increase.
Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Excellent. Thanks for that.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Steve Milunovich of UBS. Please go ahead.
Tejas B. Venkatesh - UBS Securities LLC: Hey guys, this is Tejas for Steve. Thanks for taking my question. I had a follow-up on Web 2.0 companies who were 16% of sales in 2014. Have they trended up or down since then? And then your competitors seem to be targeting the DCI routing market within hyperscalers with Jericho-based products. I was curious how should we think about the impact of those on your hyperscaler revenues? The concern of course is that you'd compress TAM even if you maintain share. Thanks.
Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. So the cloud providers continue to be a very important and very strategic vertical for us. And I think if you look at their CapEx guidance for the full year, it looks encouraging. We remain very relevant not just in the DCI space, but in many different parts of our web-scale customers' networks. Not confused about the fact that we are going to see or we're seeing competition in this area. I mean, it's a very attractive market, and so competition is to be expected. And I would think about it from a couple of different ways. There're sort of different use cases that we go after at Juniper. There are use cases that require quite a lot of flexibility, software sophistication and so on that we capture with products like VMX. And the MX has an incredible amount of flexibility and features that are very sticky in our customer networks. And for that reason, the barriers to entry are just going to be somewhat higher. Then there are more streamlined routing use cases and opportunities that we go after with more efficient products for pure routing or transport, like the PTX. Nothing new. This is something that we almost invented just a few years ago with the introduction of the PTX product line. And now we're enhancing the PTX product line to go out after those streamlined opportunities even more aggressively. And last but not least, there is the introduction of our spine switches that actually opens up a brand new opportunity for us to compete in the cloud provider space. And that's exactly what we're doing. I think if you aggregate all of these opportunities together and you include the competitive pressures that will exist in the market, the opportunity for us is something that we are very excited about and we are competing effectively for.
Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, and from a numbers perspective, I will say the last time we broke it out, it was 16% back in 2014. We're not prepared to break that out for you now, but I will tell you that it has been our fastest-growing vertical since then. So it is fair to say that it has been trending up as a percentage of our total revenue.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Kvaal of Nomura. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Yes. Excuse me. Thank you very much. I am hoping, Rami, that you can help us on the routing side or the service provider side of things. It sounds at one level like you are expecting super seasonal revenue growth through the balance of the year as these projects that got pushed out of the first quarter return over the balance of the year. But at another level, it does sound as though you are a little nervous about the overall demand picture from service providers, with your commentary about the networks running a little hotter as the telcos evaluate their architectures. How do we balance those two?
Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, thanks Jeff. I don't think actually that we would be expecting something completely out of the normal in terms of telecom spend for second half versus first half. So let me just sort of clarify that. And then, just keep in mind that as we think about the service provider opportunity, that includes telcos, it includes the cloud space, it also includes the cable space. And as I think about that opportunity all up across all of those verticals, and then weave into that our competitiveness with the introduction of new products across the MX and the PTX product lines, that is what essentially gives us the ability to be constructive on the full year.
Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. All right, so it's broader – it's broadening your product line – or broadening your customer base and your new products that are going to do the trick for us here.
Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's right. I'm not counting on anything that's out of the ordinary in terms of telco seasonality. It's certainly broader across verticals and it includes the new products with our early visibility that we have and the acceptance levels of the new products, the early design wins that we have with the new products that give us that confidence.
Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then Ken, I have a bit of a question for you that might not be totally fair, because it harks back to the last call. But on this call it sounds as though things were kind of bad at the beginning of the quarter and that things picked up over the course of it, partially because of ERP, but also partially because of the end-market. As I recall from the last call, it sounded as though – at the time of the last call in late-January, you hadn't actually seen stuff or your customers erode their order patterns yet, but you were taking your guidance down a little bit just to be prudent. So that would suggest that things would have gotten worse over the course of the quarter. So could you help us square that away?
Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, so Q1 is typically a pretty back-end loaded quarter to begin with. So at the time of the call, our visibility into actual results for the Q1 were relatively low, as we'd expect them to be given that point in the quarter and the seasonality or the linearity within the quarter, I should say. That compounded with our ERP transition that we mentioned did really nothing to help our visibility. In fact, we were system down for a few weeks in January. So it was largely as we expected early, but down. But it never came back as quickly as we thought it would. We really thought the pick up from a linearity perspective would happen mid-quarter. It really happened late-quarter. And that's really our traditional pattern, is we start slow and start picking up in the middle, and in this particular quarter, it didn't pick up quite as quickly as we thought it would.
Jeffrey Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. So all right, that's helpful. Thank you very much, Ken. And congratulations.
Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Jeff.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Brian White of Drexel. Please go ahead
Brian J. White - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Yeah, Rami, I'm wondering if you'd talk a little bit about Lenovo and this partnership. It sounds very interesting. It gives you access to a huge market over there. I know Lenovo is excited about it. Maybe just highlight what you think it means for Juniper, and when can it actually impact the top-line? And second question would be around OpenStack. Obviously there is a big OpenStack summit occurring this week out in Austin, and maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing at OpenStack and how you participate in this conference. Thanks.
Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, thanks for the question, Brian. Lenovo, we, too, are excited about the potential for this partnership. It's still early days in terms of doing the things that are necessary from a go-to-market and an R&D standpoint to go after the broad opportunity. It really hinges on the convergence of compute storage and networking. And as you probably know, there is a class of customer that wants a packaged solution that includes all of these elements plus the orchestration software. So a key part of our strategy with Lenovo is to develop solutions that are essentially turnkey in nature that will help our customers get to an automated data center far quicker. It is a global partnership, but certainly we expect it to help us in China, where Lenovo enjoys particular strength. And in terms of the timing, I think this is going to take several quarters for us to do what's necessary, both in terms of the technology integration as well as the go-to-market enablement and training that needs to happen to tap into the full opportunity. And again, I am quite excited about the potential for this opportunity. OpenStack, you're right. The conference just took place a short while ago. Juniper just as we have in the past was there in full force with a number of key speaking slots. We're very proud of the fact that our SDN Controller got voted for the third time in a row as the number one deployed SDN Controller worldwide. And we see this firsthand in terms of the telco as well as the large-scale enterprises that we're engaging in with on next-generation automated data center architectures. And we have just a fantastic team, a great product that I'm just very excited about. And in terms of OpenStack itself, and the deployments and the acceptance of OpenStack in the market, we're seeing some increasing interest in customers that want to go down the OpenStack path as opposed to other offerings that are out there.
Brian J. White - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Mitch Steves of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. So I'm going to focus on the OpEx side of the equation here. As we get to the back half of the year, is there potential to see operating margins exceed the numbers you put up last year?
Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes. So for us to expand operating margin, which we're committed to doing, and given what we've guided to Q2, yes, you can expect operating margin to exceed on the second half to get to the annualized increase. We will absolutely be managing our OpEx at a lower rate than revenue from a growth perspective. And we're going to be prudent with all levers within OpEx, from headcounts, not head count, et cetera.
Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Right, so then if I were to think about the expense line, are you essentially guiding to decrease in the S&M expense, because I would think that R&D would probably remain stable at the high-teens?
Ken Miller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: No, I'm not guiding to decrease OpEx in any particular line. The op margin expansion is very, very correlated to our constructive view on revenue growth for 2016 and will be prudent with OpEx. And that will result in op margin expansion for the full year.
Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it, thanks. And then just one last one on the security side. I know that it was a little bit of a tough quarter in March, but when do you guys expect to see an inflection point in that business as we work through the year?
Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, so on the security side, we're off to a slow start, as I mentioned primarily because I think there was a macro impact, but there was also the product transition impact. I think the product transitions will work their way out throughout the rest of this year. And I think that our long-term projection for security of 1% to 3% by the end of 2017 remains intact.
Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Simon Leopold of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Victor W. Chiu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hi, guys. This is Victor Chiu in for Simon Leopold. I just wanted to ask if you could give us color around the international landscape and what you're hearing about, I guess, growth from European operators. For example, it seems to be, you know, a bit weaker (51:12).
Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure, Victor. So from an international standpoint, in EMEA, the main issue in Q1 was the timing of orders – or timing of deployments, I should say, in the Q1 timeframe that has moved into Q2 and beyond. There – we still have visibility into opportunities in the telco space, but also in the large enterprise and government space that I think gives us confidence for the full year in EMEA. And in Asia Pacific, a number of things that are going on there: I think we continue to see good growth outside of China. China remains to be a more challenging environment, but sequentially over the last few quarters, I think China is starting to look more and more encouraging. We have made a number of changes to our go-to-market model, toward leadership in Asia Pacific that's starting to pay off for us. And certainly new partnerships like the one we just discussed with Lenovo are going to help us, I think, in EMEA and Asia Pacific but in particular in Asia Pacific I think we're going to see the benefit there first.
Victor W. Chiu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: When you mentioned that your visibility had improved recently, does that include the European operations? Is your visibility comment, you know, reflective of all the geographies, or was that more for the U.S., or – because it seems that – go ahead, I'm sorry.
Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, I understand the question. And my comments about visibility were specific to the timing of revenue that we had expected in the Q1 timeframe for Tier-1 telcos. And yes, the answer is absolutely, the visibility has now improved for Q2 and beyond for that revenue we had expected in the Q1 timeframe.
Victor W. Chiu - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Erik Suppiger of JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC: Yeah, thank you for taking my question. One of your competitors introduced a solution that's going to combine data center switching and routing based on some of the new chip sets coming out. I'm just curious, is that something that you're looking out with the new QFX, and maybe combining some of that with the MX technologies?
Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, it's a great question. And certainly the competitive dynamics in our space are evolving and very interesting. However, that said, this idea of routing and switching being combined into a common system is not a particularly new one. The MX, although we have called it a universal edge router for a very long time, has actually enjoyed many switching capabilities for many years. Our PTX product line runs the same operating system as the MX product line, and it, too, combines routing and switching in a very streamlined transport type of manner. And our QFX product line, both the top of rack as well as the new QFX10000 that we're introducing into the market are going to enjoy not just a great switching capability, but all of the benefits of fantastic routing that comes from the fact that we have a common operating system. Our one operating system strategy in the company is really going to shine as we start to deploy cloud solutions that include switching, routing, security, and the orchestration software, where the combination of switching and routing is going to help us compete very effectively in this use case.
Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC: So is that going to be part of the strategy, consolidating those two layers within the data center?
Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, it depends because it very much is going to depend on the type of solution that the customer wants. In certain cases, one can think of an architecture where the edge of the data center will do nothing more than provide a transport function that connects to another data center – very simple use case. In that case, we've already been going after that opportunity with our PTX product line, and we certainly have the ability to go after that opportunity with the QFX10000 switches. But there are, not to be underestimated, many customers that require a lot of complex encapsulations and decapsulations, complex routing functions that require a great deal of flexibility right down to the hardware, that can only be captured with a class of product like the MX. The key points here for us is we have the most complete portfolio of tools at our disposal right now between the MX, the PTX and the QFX to compete very effectively, irrespective of what the architectural approach that our customers have in mind. And that holds true for any of our competitors in the market.
Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC: Okay, and second question, did you see any change on the competitive landscape? I understand timing – specifically I'm thinking of security. Some of the other vendors that have reported had relatively good high-end sales in the quarter. I'm just wondering did you see any emerging players or anything change on the competitive landscape in the market?
Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: In the high end of our security space, I think we have a very competitive product geared towards the large cloud providers that need a lot of performance at the edge of a data center as well as in the service provider space for mobile connectivity in particular, what we call the Gi-LAN firewall. I don't think that things got more competitive in the Q1 timeframe. I think the issue that we faced in Q1 timeframe were mostly the combination of macro factors (57:25) resulted in a slow start, the product transitions and the lumpiness in our large service provider business.
Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC: Very good. Thank you.
Kathleen Nemeth - Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations: Thanks, Erik.
Rami Rahim - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.

Now, I’ll hand the call over to Rami.
Rami Rahim: Thanks, Kathleen and welcome everyone. January is a time to review our key accomplishments of the prior year and set expectations for the year ahead. 2015 was an inflection point year for the industry and for Juniper as well. Traditional networking boundaries are changing and as a challenger in this industry, we here to shape it and lead it. Throughout last year, I committed to focusing on innovation, operational excellence, cost discipline and our targeted growth initiatives. I am pleased to report that in 2015 our total revenue grew 7% year-over-year excluding Junos Pulse driven by growth across all verticals, geographies and technologies. Product and service revenue were up across routing, switching and security. Service provider and enterprise revenue was up by 7% and 8% respectively. We improved our operating margin and delivered our third consecutive year of double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth. So I'm proud of what we've achieved but there is still more to do to continue on our path of operational excellence, innovation and growth. We are leaving in disruptive times and we are witnessing some megatrends unfold. The competitive landscape is evolving; new architectural approaches like SDN are becoming real. Business models are changing with software desegregation and white box switching. The future of security is evolving and everything is shifting to the cloud. What does this all mean for Juniper? We intend to be the most trusted technology provider helping our customers to solve their most pressing networking problems. We see incredible opportunities ahead and we intend to capture it. Today, there are about 700 million broadband users worldwide and an estimated 940 million by the end of 2018. This is driving an insatiable need for network capacity. To illustrate this point, Netflix recently announced it is now serving a 192 countries up from 60 plus. Imagine satisfying this increasing worldwide demand for rapid low latency and high volume communication of information. They will require new high performance highly automated networking solutions and cutting edge technologies. In 2016, we planned to continue to capture inflection points in the industry that will help to accelerate our existing strategy. We planned to do so through continued execution and product innovation as well as partnerships and tuck-in acquisitions when appropriate that complement our organic R&D strategy. For example, we see new growth opportunities in the data center interconnect and metro Ethernet markets. Traffic growth in the networks that form this market is forcing our customers to consider new architectural approaches to keeping up with traffic demand cost effectively. Yesterday, we announced our intent to acquire optical equipment provider BTI Systems. By combining Juniper's data center switching and IP routing platforms with BTI's cloud and metro networking systems and software, we expect to transform packet optical networking and provide our customers with open software driven solutions that are automated highly programmable cost efficient and offer tremendous service agility. It is now more evident than ever that everything is shifting to the cloud. Enterprise IT is moving apps and data to public and hybrid cloud. Service providers are building out a distributed telco cloud to drive down operational cost increase agility and better serve their customer. Cloud is often required new and network infrastructure build and upgrade across wide area networks, datacenters and branch offices. And our customers recognize the value of Juniper's networking innovations to help in their transition to cloud architectures. Our intent is to lead in the area of software solutions that simplify the operations of network and to allow our customers across our key vertical to deliver real valuable over those networks. We anticipate that our increased focus on software business models will result in an increase in software revenue as a percentage of total revenue overtime. I remain optimistic about our entire product line and across routing, switching, security and automation software has spent five solution domain, datacenter, core, EDGE, Campus and branch and access and navigation. We shipped several new products last quarter including the ATX-500 hardened access switch, the GFX 5200 top-of-rack data center switch, the SRX 1500 security platform for the campus and branch domain and the newest generation of MX Line Card, the MPC7. These and other new products are getting good early reception from customers and we expect them to ramp in revenue this year. Now I know cyber security is top of buying for organizations of all sizes. Investing in security is an imperative for our customers and Juniper strategy. We believe the future of security is intimately tied to the network and we are investing and innovating in our domain solutions with that direction in mind. We are also committed to maintaining the integrity, security and insurance of all of our products at Juniper. Again this backdrop that I've laid out and given our assumptions that the global economy will be volatile and customer investments maybe lumpy, my team and I had set out the following three operating principles for managing the business in 2016. First, we intend to take a prudent stand while going after revenue growth opportunities that we see within our target markets. Second, we will remain diligent in managing our operating expenses and intend to expand non-GAAP operating margins for fiscal year 2016, we reiterate our long-term target of operating margins of 25% on a sustainable annualized basis. Third, we intend to maintain a healthy balance sheet and continue working towards an optimized capital structure. We will seek to fulfill our commitments to continuous process improvement in execution and I look forward to share and yet more accomplishments that provide value to our customers and return for our shareholders. I want to thank our employees for their continuous pursuit of excellence and their sincere commitment to helping our customers every day. Before I conclude I would like to say a few words on the leadership transition that we announced earlier today, Robyn joined Juniper as our CFO over 8.5 years ago and has since led the finance and operations organization through a period of extensive change and frankly significant accomplishments. I’ve always been impressed with Robyn’s willingness to put customers first and bring her great energy and enthusiasm to some of the most challenging times our company has faced. Robyn has developed in outstanding finance IT and operations organization and has still a strong operational and financial discipline in the company complementing and strengthening our heritage of innovation. Robyn I thank you for being a great business partner, not only with me but the entire Juniper senior leadership team and the board over the last 8.5 years. And thank you for stepping down in the thoughtful way you have with the great CFO successor to take over after filing the 10-K in late February and staying on until the summer to ensure a smooth transition. And you have been in Juniper since before the IPO and I know you have been in all parts of the company over the 16 plus years and know the company inside and out. In your current role as the SVP of finance, you have worked closely with Robyn and me in helping to instill the financial discipline that has resulted in our strong performance in 2015. I also know that you appreciate where this company has been but more importantly are mindful that there is still more work to do to really achieve our full potential. We are confident that with your leadership we will continue in this new path of operational excellence and diligent and prudent financial management. Continuing to strengthen these attributes of our culture are essential to our future successes. Robyn thank you and Ken we look forward to your new role. And with that I will turn the call over to Robyn for review of our full year and quarterly financial results.
Robyn Denholm: Thank you Rami and good afternoon everyone. I'm very pleased with our record fourth quarter 2015 results. They reflect strong year-over-year and sequential revenue and earnings growth. We saw year-over-year and sequential revenue growth in both Americas and APAC as well as solid growth with service providers across all technologies. Specifically, telecom, cable and cloud providers each grew revenue more than 20% year-over-year. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, seven were telcos and three were cloud or cable providers, of these customers five were located outside of the U.S. reflecting our continued strategy to diversify our revenue across multiple vertical and geographies. Our underlined demand metrics continued to be healthy this quarter with a products book-to-bill greater than one and ending product backlog at $517 million up 16% year-over-year. Sequentially productive differed revenue was flat and up 7% year-over-year. I'm especially pleased that for the quarter we delivered strong year-over-year and sequential non-GAAP operating margin, an earnings per share expansion. This reflects our continued good execution focused on revenue growth and effective management of our cost structure. In the quarter we had cash flow from operations of $117 million lower than the previous quarter primarily due to working capital requirements. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $55 million. We repurchased $93 million of shares and paid $38 million in dividends. Since the first quarter of 2014 inclusive of share repurchases and dividends we've returned approximately $3.6 billion of capital to shareholders against our commitment to return $4.1 billion by the end of 2016. Now, I'd like to discuss our annual results. Our fiscal 2015 results were strong with year-over-year revenue increases across all vertical geographies and technologies. As anticipated in the second half of 2015 U.S. tier 1 telcos showed an improvement compared to the first half of 2015 as well as the second half of 2014. In reviewing our top 10 customers for the year 5 were Telco, 3 of which were outside of the U.S. and 5 were cloud or cable providers. For the year we expanded operating margins significantly by 3 points and grew diluted earnings per share by 40% on a non GAAP basis which reflects our followed execution focused on revenue growth, effective management of our cost structure and significant reduction in share counts. We are pleased that we were making good progress through our annualized long-term model of 39% non-GAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue. And towards our non-GAAP operating margin target of 25%. For the year we had strong cash flows from operations of $893 million primarily due to higher revenue and improved operating margins. Capital expenditures for the year were $210 million as we focus on investments to draw a long-term productivity and support continued innovation and development of new products. We repurchased $1.143 billion of shares and paid $156 million in dividends. Now let’s take a look at some of the underlying assumptions behind our Q1 outlook. Although we have good visibility into the first quarter. The mid-term macroeconomic uncertainty and the potential customer investment lumpiness closed very conservative outlook. We also anticipate the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to other currencies to remain strong which we impacted into our outlook. You can find the data and outlooks to Q1 in the CFO commentary available on our website. Now, I'll provide an update on our capital return program. Given that we have substantially through our $4.1 billion capital return commitment. We wanted to give you some color on how we look at our capital return policy beyond the 2016 timeframe. Going forward we intend to target a capital return policy of approximately 50% of annual free cash flow inclusive of share repurchases and dividend. As a reminder in March of 2016 we have $300 million of debt maturing that we currently intend to refinance subject to market and other business conditions. Also yesterday, we announced our intent to acquire BTI Systems. Please note that we expect the transaction to close in Q2 and we will provide more information on the financial data of the combined operations after the transaction closed. At this point, we don't expect the transaction to have material impact throughout 2016 earnings. To summarize, I'm very pleased with what we've accomplished in this year which is reflected in our results. We are executing well against our long-term model and as we begin the year we remain focused on execution and delivering on our strategic commitments. For the past 8 and half years I have been privilege to be the CFO of Juniper. We have accomplished a lot over this time and I feel really good about where the company is positioned and the financial and operational disciplined that is in play. I also believe that the company is in great hand with Rami and with Ken as we move forward. And I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitments to Juniper's success. And now with that, I'd like to open the call to questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Mark Moskowitz: Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. A couple of quick questions here, one just in your comments about trying to inject more conservatives and more prudence around the outlook. Can you talk about relative to what you're seeing in terms of the macro? Have you seen anything what's in your customer base that is you found to be somewhat incremental or calls per calls in terms of one customer vertical staying the narrow at one product segments and that as part of the certain see a major change in the sales most of that relative to sort of prior few months. And then I have a follow up.
Rami Rahim: Yeah sure, Mark. Thanks for the question. I'll start and then I'll just pass it on to Robyn if she wishes to want to add anything else. First and foremost, I have to say that I feel good about the fundamentals of the business and of course the need for networking technology across all of our market verticals. The fact of the matter is there are some very important problems to be solved in the area of networking keeping up with capacity and delivering services over those networks and so forth. Also feel great about our execution, the engagement that we have with our customers across all of our key market verticals. I think it really comes down to the fact that 2016 has started with a lot of market volatility. And we have to see how that plays out in terms of its effects on spending patterns and deployments with our customers really across all of our key verticals. I think it's really important that we managed the business and we invest with that assumption in mind and that's exactly what we're doing.
Robyn Denholm: Yeah, and just to add to that. I mean we did really have a great Q4 and we got good visibility. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that the backlog was $517 million up significantly year-over-year and so as deferred revenue. Having said that as Rami mentioned, there is a lot of market volatility out the and in our experience that has from time-to-time caused some lumpiness in our deployments or order patterns. And so it's more a buyback cautiousness in terms of what could unfold as we move forward here. But we've been cautious with our guided for the first quarter.
Mark Moskowitz: Okay. And then the second question is more longer term in nature thinking about the second half of '16 and into 2017, Juniper and your leadership have done a nice job in terms of refocusing on both security and switching and we're hearing that a lot of big customers are starting to really keep it tie and bring Juniper for in for some other piece with this. Kind a curious if you talk about the cadence there the sales motion and are you having to hire more people one. And then two, is this more of a 2017 potential or it could be a second half of '16 in terms of meet again a boost of on those initiatives in both security and switching thank you.
Rami Rahim: Yeah thanks. Sure Mark. Thank you. If you look at 2015, we said that it's really important for us to diversify our business across geos across technology areas, across market verticals. You're touching on the diversity and technology areas. And that is very much a matter of our strategy and I'm very happy with how the team executed to that effect in the last year. Routing all up grew 6%, switching 7%, security grew 5%. And that I think is a reflection of just the execution by the engineering team the go-to-market team our marketing team. And I feel that the opportunities there for us to continue that growth across all of the technology areas, in security in particular since you highlighted it, this was an area that required an extra level of focus from us. Because as you know we started with a bit of deficit just a year ago we refocused our strategy, we enhanced our product set, we definitely did a lot of training and marketing to win the hearts and minds of our partners and our customers. And while I'm not yet ready at this point to say that we are completely done because there are still a lot more execution for us to do in the area of security. I definitely feel much better about the opportunity that we have with that business and the way that we are executing in that business than I did a year ago.
Mark Moskowitz: Thank you.
Kathleen Nemeth: Okay, thanks Mark. Next question please?
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Vijay Bhagavath: Yeah. Hey, good afternoon hi Rami, Robyn. Quick question from me around you mentioned your guidance was conservative primarily on the uncertainty you're noting in macro order lumpiness. You also noted weakness in US enterprise. So my question for us is if you could give us any color on the lumpiness comments which product segment are customer set of customer that's coming from very helpful.
Rami Rahim: Let me start Vijay. I don't think it's any it's specific to anyone technology area or customer vertical. As I mentioned I actually feel good about the way that we're executing and about the fundamentals of the business the need for the kind of technologies, how our products that we're developing and innovating in are going to addressing those requirements in 2016 all up. I just believe that as we start 2016 and you see the incredible amount of volatility in the market across really all markets and all geos, it's a good idea for us to plan and manage the business with the assumption that there could be some lumpiness. And I don't think if they say specific to anyone particular vertical.
Robyn Denholm: Yeah, and just amplify what Rami said, and just to remind you our enterprise business typically is down in the first quarter from the fourth quarter. That's a normal phase and no pattern that we've see. So obviously we expected it to be up year-on-year but quarter-on-quarter we do expect that to be down and Rami addressed that in his prepared remarks. In terms of the Telco sector just globally we had a very strong Telco quarter in the fourth quarter as we mentioned in our prepared remarks. And typically it does take a little bit of time to those deployments to be digested and move forward. So we're constructive on the year I think in terms of how reviewing the FY16 year for our business. But we're been cautious in the near term just give the volatility as Rami mentioned.
Vijay Bhagavath: A quick follow up is on the BTI announcement. I mean we personally think it's a strategic positive for the company getting into data center vertical in particular. So the question for you is around how do you manage margins because optical margins as you all know more in the high mid-to-high 40s your margins at in the mid-60s. So help us understand the margin put and takes that optical getting into your portfolio. Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Yeah sure Vijay. Well first I'm happy to hear that you think it' a good idea and I agree with you completely. I wanted just to make sure everybody understands. The goal of this acquisition is not to build a large optical business inside of the Juniper. The goal is to capture what we believe are very important market inflection points that have to do with the convergence of packet and optical. And this is not a new strategy, this is actually strategy that I've talked to you and our customers and our partners about over several years. We have already been developing optical interfaces, colored interfaces on our routers. And we think that there are certain market segments data center interconnect in particular metro that are going to need to move to this architectural approach sooner rather than later. And so this acquisition when it closes in the Q2 timeframe is essentially a way for us to accelerate our innovation in this area by getting key building blocks and of course the talent that will help us to do it. So that's why as Robyn mentioned earlier we don’t think it’s going to have a material impact on our 2016 financials.
Vijay Bhagavath: Thank you.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thanks Vijay. Next question operator?
Operator: And the next question is from Paul Silverstein of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
Paul Silverstein: Thanks Rami and Robyn. I hate to ask you but just a clarification of the last two responses in the question a little clarification I appreciate and first of all we appreciate the prudence given the macro backdrop but I just want to make sure I understand when you talk about being prudent in the lumpiness one month in I recognize it's not very long it generally it’s always a late month for the first quarter but have you actually seen things that cause you concern as opposed to reading a lots of journal in CNN or listening to all the other companies had announced? And then my question will be on margins you had really strong services gross margin number relative to what you’ve done over the last year to in product gross margin was somewhere between the real question going forward what should we expect is the 63 plus you did in service is that in your norm were there extraordinary things in the quarter that accounted for this strength and some more question on products.
Robyn Denholm: So Paul thanks for the questions. Let me touch on the guidance and the outlook for Q1 first so as we said if I go back 90 days ago what I said on the earnings call is that we expected Q1 to be 7% to 10% down and what we just announced in terms of the guidance at the midpoint is 11% down so it's modestly down from what we were expecting before and that’s us being cautious and prudent. We’re not seeing any wholesale signs as any weaknesses Rami mentioned before, having said that it is early in the quarter and it's just our experience that where there are headlines we’re talking about capital purchases many of my piece around the world will start tighten things unless macro environment changes and so that’s why we’re being cautious and prudent it is more experienced than actually what we’re seeing. So on the margin side I'm very pleased with the gross margin that we posted for Q4 it’s up a couple of ticks’ year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. It is strong in terms of both the product and the services margin. The services came and the business around services is doing very well within the company, the team continues to work on the cost structure. They continue to take cost out of that business and productivity increase. At the same time, it’s improving our customer satisfaction score so I'm very pleased with that. We move to the first quarter guidance on the gross margin, we also typically see a quarter-over-quarter sequential decline in gross margins again it’s up year-over-year from Q1 of last year and that’s primarily the result of the volume in the Q1 period of time from products so this is relatively consistent quarter-over-quarter in terms of the gross margin area. Sometimes we do get some fluctuation in that depending on deployments from product because of PS revenue as part of services but we’re very pleased with our services gross margin.
Paul Silverstein: Robyn I wish you well.
Robyn Denholm: Thank you.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thanks Paul. Next question please.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Pierre Ferragu of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Pierre Ferragu: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. So maybe on the outlook you’ve pulled together and the comments you made about uncertainty do you have like a differentiated view when we think about your plans so did you have more or less the ability for service providers, vertical plans, enterprise and so how does that look like from a regional standpoint, so we see very clearly your very good performance today is mostly driven by the U.S. Are you concerned about a slowdown, a domestic slowdown as well or is still most of the uncertainty in international market? And then maybe along with the same line one last question what’s your view on the data center spending so we've seen a few data points recently potentially showing the data center spending could be slowing is that something you see something you anticipate? Thanks a lot.
Rami Rahim: Yes, Pierre so let me start first as far as the outlook really I think Robyn covered it well. There is nothing specific to anyone particular vertical or even geography. The macro volatility we're seeing is really widespread and it touches pretty much all of our customers across verticals and different geos as well. On the second question that you are talking about with respect to data center, I still see that as a tremendous opportunity for us. We are.... if you look at our switching market share although it's actually nudging up were still relatively small and for that reason the opportunity for us to penetrate into the data center with switching products, data center interconnects with our MX product line as well as some of the packet optical architectures that we are talking about and data center is in fact the area where we are strongest today from a security stand point. Finally, where we are really seeing some good momentum is with Contrail and build out of cloud for Telecom operator and large enterprises. The Contrail win rate that we are observing right now with six additional wins in the Q4 time frame alone is really healthy and we definitely see a pulling other products along with it. So macro uncertainty aside I still view data center and in particular the move to hybrid cloud environment as a tremendous opportunity for Juniper.
Pierre Ferragu: Excellent. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Simona Jankowski: Hi, thank you very much. If we look across the networking landscape, there are a few significant upgrades that seem to be kicking in this year. Couple of the carriers are moving their metro networks to 100 gig, cloud providers are moving to 25 and 50 gig in their data centers. You see enterprise data centers moving to 40 gig and then campus is moving to multi gigabyte. Of these four opportunities or any others you may want to add which ones are you involved in and which ones do you think are going to be meaningful growth driver for you this year?
Rami Rahim: Yeah. Thanks, Simona. I'd say the biggest areas of focus and where our competitive differentiation is going to be greatest as well as where our go to market attention is also the highest is in the data center opportunity. So you mentioned correctly. So they moved to 25 and 50 gig, we just introduced in the Q4 time frame the key effect 5,2000, in fact that's the first switch that we offer with a completely dis aggregated operating system to truly go after that opportunity. That compliments the spine switches that are now in the hands of our customer at least the early versions in the hands of our customer whiles we expect revenue to start ramping this year. So anything to do with data center just as a matter of strategy and focus I'm optimistic about. Metro 100 gigs the MX is the sweet spot product now for these 100 gig deployments and I do expect to be very much relevant if you will for those kinds of opportunity. Campus has been a little bit less of a focus relative to the data center. But that's only because of the timing of the product if you will. We have a new architecture that we introduced for the campus that we call fusion architecture and that architecture really comes to provision and around the middle of this year and for large campus environments I think that makes us very, very competitive. Last, on the metro opportunity. We did mention that we introduced the latest versions of our MX line cards in the Q4 time frame. This is the MPC7 with a very dense industry leading 100 gig capacity which is perfectly time to capture the metro opportunities that you are mentioning.
Simona Jankowski: Great, thank you.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thanks, Simona. Next question please?
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Jess Lubert: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. First for Rami, I was hoping you could touch on some of the factors driving the strength in the routing business which posted a second consecutive quarter double-digit growth. So any insights you can provide as to where you believe we are in the customer routing cycle to what degree you think the new PTX and MX line cards can continue to sustain helping growth in that business through 2016 that would be helpful. And then Robyn I was hoping you could perhaps touch upon to what degree you expect currency to impact the outlook and perhaps some of the exchange rate assumptions that are embedded in the forecast. Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Okay, let me start with routing. Thanks for the question and then I'll pass it over to Robyn. In routing over the last few quarters, we've been taking market share and I think that's because of the strength of our product portfolio and the engagement that we're having with our service provider and enterprise customers around the world. Last quarter was a great quarter for the MX and the PTX this quarter is another fantastic quarter for the MX. So there are really two routing product lines that are humming right now in terms of the business momentum that we are building. Both have fantastic roadmaps and both are hitting the market in terms of both the software capabilities the services and the density and the performance that they offer to our customers. In Q4 in particular, we saw broad based strengths in service providers, this is not a common specific to just the large tier 1 this is true for service providers around the world that are building out their metro their EDGE and their cores with the MX and the PTX. And I'm also very pleased with the performance that we saw in the cable in the Q4 timeframe where cable operators are really just trying to keep ahead of the growth in video traffic. They're doing this with the migration to DOCSIS 3.0, 3.1 and of course the densities that we offer with the MX and the PTX to help them to do that is really turning into a competitive advantage for us.
Jess Lubert: Rami based on the availability of the new products, is there any reason we shouldn't expect some of the share gains we've seen in the last few quarters to continue?
Rami Rahim: Share will always fluctuate on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but if I look at the win rates as well as the opportunities that are ahead of us and the product roadmap. And you have to keep in mind that we have actually managed to achieve the strength that we achieved in 2015 largely without the new products ramping up. This year I think we have the benefit of the new products ramping up which I think can help us in sustaining the market share momentum. Robyn?
Robyn Denholm: So just in terms of currency Jess. As I've mentioned before, we predominantly invoice the U.S. dollars. Having said that obviously with the strength of the U.S. dollar versus other currency, we see some and I mentioned it in my prepared remarks, some modest pricing impact in those areas which we have by and large offset with cost reductions. So our assumptions are that the currency impact remains the consistent high levels of the U.S. dollar as we move forward here.
Jess Lubert: Thanks guys.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thanks Jess. Next question Mannie?
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Sanjiv Wadhwani of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Sanjiv Wadhwani: Thank you. Rami let me just wish you good luck on your next venture. Rami broad level question for you within the context of a volatile macro. I was wondering if you could comment on how you see sort of that you're shaping up. I know you guys have talked about the 3% to 6% especially given the various new products that are starting to gain traction. So just curious to get a comment of how do you think that year might shape up thanks.
Rami Rahim: Well first thanks for the question Sanjiv. We're still sticking to our long-term outlook which includes '14, '15 and '16 of the 3% to 6% revenue range. And I think we will make progress towards if I look at 2016 all up. I do believe that we will make progress towards that goal. And that’s true from a revenue standpoint in terms of 3% to 6% but also through from an operating margin standpoint where we expect to achieve our long-term goal of 25% all up full year annualized basis.
Robyn Denholm: And Rami made '15, '16,'17 we announced it in '14.
Rami Rahim: Thank you for the correction Robyn. You're absolutely right.
Sanjiv Wadhwani: Just and quick follow-up as it relates to new products I mean are you expecting material sort of contribution this year or do you think this sort of ramps up as a year progresses and maybe in 2017 you'll start seeing more of the material contribution.
Rami Rahim: It's both because I think it ramps up but it ramps up early this year. So I do think it will have a significant contribution to 2016 across switching and routing in particular but also security.
Robyn Denholm: Yeah, and just to underscore that point and Rami mentioned that in his prepared remarks, the 2015 there was very little revenue from the new products. So it just it underscores the strength of the results in '15. And we are expecting those products to ramp as we move through '16.
Sanjiv Wadhwani: Got it. Thank you.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thanks Sanjiv. Next question?
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Jim Suva of Citi. Please go ahead.
Jim Suva: Thank you and congratulations. One clarification question then I have a follow up, so first of all the clarification question. You mentioned the currency and we know you priced mostly in US dollars and you mentioned some changes which will be offset by your cost which you've been able to do. Can you give us a little bit more detail about what you meant by those changes was that be as you lowered your price in certain geographies or you did some more rebating or what's do you mean by those changes need to be offset by cost that's a clarification. And then my main question is a lot of the other questions were asked on the other products but on switching. Can you give us a little bit of details on switching kind a maybe what's happening now versus say six months ago and kind of your outlook for switching whether be trends or product cycles, thank you very much and again congratulations.
Robyn Denholm: Thank you. So in terms of the pricing commentary or the currency commentary. Obviously the U.S. dollar has been strong for quite some time now. So we have actually seen some impacts from our pricing in on international operations outside of the US which we have largely offset by the cost reductions that we've had throughout the year. So you can see the gross margin is very healthy on that product areas it's very consistent year-over-year it's also very consistent from a sequential basis. So we obviously compete in the business and we largely compete on the differentiation of our products. But there are obviously areas where we continue to work on the cost structure and reduce our cost so that we preserve the competitiveness of our overall product ranges well.
Rami Rahim: Yeah, and Jim on the switching question, fiscal year 2015 we saw a 7% year-over-year increase in switching that is largely without the benefit of the new spine switches which we expect to ramp in this year. So I am bullish on our ability to grow this part of our business. I think if you look at where the opportunity lies; it's mostly in the datacenter and the cloud. This is true for all of our vertical market segments whether if that our telecom operators that are building out their next generation distributed Telco cloud architectures transforming their network locations to scale out data centers from which they are delivering value to their customers certainly through for enterprises that are moving to a hybrid cloud architecture. I think we can benefit from that. And then again I will put in that plug for - because I think that's really making us very relevant to the next generation architectures where there is a high degree of automation that is being applied how switching is deployed. And we're seeing that is a very strategic and sticky part of the sales motion for our customers across all vertical markets.
Robyn Denholm: Yeah and just to underscore that point, we grew switching 7% year-over-year without very much benefit at all from the new product. So I think to Rami's point we're very pleased with the switching performance that also plays with how we out moving forward from a competitive point of view with the switching line up that we have.
Jim Suva: Thank you and congratulations.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thanks Jim. Next question please?
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Rod Hall of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Yeah hi. Thanks. This is Ashwin [ph] on behalf of Rod. Hey good.
Robyn Denholm: Thank you.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay actually question is on Europe it looks like Europe was down on a year-over-year basis in Q4. I'm wondering if you're expecting that region to return to growth anytime soon given that fiscal your Q1 guidance implies growth.
Rami Rahim: Yeah, sure Ashwin. So Europe actually you're right, from a revenue standpoint it took a little bit of a step back but actually from a booking standpoint Europe was quite strong year-over-year and sequentially. So I'm not concerned. I think in Europe the area where we're seeing the greatest success is with the telecom operators. The win rate, the level of engagement on some of the next generation of architectures in not just routing but in switching and security and Contrail is very good and so for that reason again for 2016 as a whole I actually think Europe is going to be good. There has been a very deliberate focus inside of Juniper to make sure that there is the good diversity across geographies and we’re taking that seriously I'm very pleased with how the team is executing.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thanks for the color. Just one more follow up Rami you’ve commented that you’re expecting operating margins to expand in fiscal ‘16, I wanted to understand how contingent is that on revenue growth coming through and I just wanted to understand your planning assumptions there?
Rami Rahim: Yes, I think we are expecting that revenue will expand this year if you think about it from the full year standpoint and with that said we’re essentially making sure that we’re investing in a way that is commensurate with that expansion in revenue. We’re not going to as I have said many times in the past invest ahead of that growth.
Robyn Denholm: Okay, great.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thank you. Next question please.
Operator: Thank you the next question is from George Nadar [ph] of Jeffries. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, thanks a lot guys. I guess more of a housekeeping question I was curious about what your emerging markets exposure is right now I’ve seem to have lost track of that I'm specifically just in countries like Brazil, Russia, China places where the currencies have really devalued or economy slowdowns where is that now and how do you feel about those areas going forward? Thanks.
Robyn Denholm: Thanks George. We don’t actually breakout our emerging markets number but what I will say is I did provide some commentary about Asia Pacific if you excluded China we’d actually be up quite significantly in terms of the quarter. It’s in my commentary and in terms of Brazil, it’s a small business for us but I can’t actually say we’re down in the quarter and that’s in the Americas result, so in terms of the APAC results they would have been up I think it’s about 10% but we’ll come back to you with that number.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thanks George. Next question please.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Steve Mironovic [ph] of UBS. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Great, thank you. I was just wondering there was some news about Facebook’s open compute project getting the back in telcos like AT&T, Verizon, Deutsche Telecom wanted to get your perspective on that and what you’re hearing when you talk to customers?
Rami Rahim: Sure, thanks Steve. This is an industry where most of the innovation and the investment goes into software but much of the business model are tied to hardware I mean if you take a look at Juniper as an example 85% of all of our development resources are software resources that is where the crux or the majority of our R&D investment actually lies. I do believe that overtime business models will adjust so that’s more of the value is going to be monetized through software and I think we’re taking meaningful steps in that direction. So in the Q4 timeframe we announced our disaggregated architecture, our customers were very pleased we got a lot of kudos if you will from our customers, telecom operators and enterprises mostly on the telco side that this is the right step to take. Do I believe that there’s going to be an overnight shift in business model, no I don’t I think in this industry everything is sort of unfold and multi-years but I do think that we are taking the steps necessary to make sure that in a world where wide box switching starts to become more prominent that we will be able to participate, to add value and of course create shareholder value from that transition as well?
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. And Robyn there was a comment in the formal remarks about moderately elevated pricing pressure have you addressed that in your comments so today are you seeing something competitively that’s different?
Robyn Denholm: No it’s a combination of factors but we did address it obviously the currency impacts is seen through that pricing and any other factors that are in there. But we are offsetting that with cost reductions as you could see in the quarter from the gross margin so slightly elevated just what I said in the prepared remarks. And just coming back to George’s question about emerging markets in terms of Asia Pacific it was about 4% full year, we excluded China region we’re eventually up a little bit so you can see there has been a sustain period of time, quite a reduction in that business. Although I will say that it in the fourth quarter we actually saw it grow a little from the third quarter. So from a China specific perspective.
Kathleen Nemeth: Great, thank you. Next question please.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Ittai Kidron: Thanks. Couple of questions. First, Rami can you get into the enterprise business and the performance in the fourth quarter. I have to go back 10 years and I never could have found a quarter where your enterprise business took such a significant decline on a quarter-over-quarter basis. So you can give us a little bit more color on what's going there. That will be great and second just wanted a big picture standpoint. Do you have any view on what capital spending will with carriers this year? How it's going to be waited second half versus first half, any color on that will be great?
Rami Rahim: Okay. Let me start. Thanks Ittai. On the enterprise side Q3 was a very strong revenue quarter for us. If you recall it was actually double-digit growth both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. So the step back that we took in enterprise honestly I'm not too worried about it. I think that is largely as a result of the timing of large enterprise deployment and especially government. Government was actually very strong for us in Q3 and there was a bit more weakness in government just because various factors in the Q4 time frame. If I think about the opportunity for us in the enterprise and our ability to capture it especially as it pertained to cloud deployment. I actually feel very good about 2016, all of 2016. I think that's the net of it. Expecting some one peanut especially in the larger enterprises in government is something that is pretty normal.
Robyn Denholm: Yeah and actually I'll just add to that, our enterprise business for the fourth quarter was largely as we were expecting. So not anything out of the ordinary. The full year for enterprise was actually 8% which is a very good result for us for the full year rental price and it just speaks to the diversity again that Rami underscored through the commentary here. If you look at our full service provider business that was up about the same sort of level, 7% and enterprise was up 8%. So within any one quarter you will see some lumpiness between the sectors and between the verticals in the market. Just because of the deployment cycle that actually overall the diversity is working us and that it gives good gross in both areas over a full year period of time.
Rami Rahim: On the second question I think it was around sort of the capital expenditures for telecom operators in particular. I mean we are seeing the same reports that you are seeing it's still early that in the year. But it is at least one of the factors that we are considering as we provide our outlook. For Telcos in particular the most important thing we need to do, it is to make sure that we remain extremely relevant to the next generation architectures that they are now contemplating and will eventually deploy. Things like cloud CBE, things like deploying SDN and transforming their network locations to data center like entities. I feel really good about the level of engagement that we are having with our telco operator to be able to capture that opportunity when it becomes real. I think there are some real good proof points of telcos. Even large telcos that are making significant progress in that direction. And then finally, it's important for us to continue the diversification of business. So that we can increase the predictability of our business overtime across all vertical market segment.
Ittai Kidron: Very good. Good luck.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thank you, Ittai. Next question please?
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Fall [ph] of Nomura. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes. Thanks very much. And Robyn I'd like to add my congratulations to you and appreciation for all your help with me over the years. Two questions really I think first is big picture on routing you had a really nice series of quarters and they were quite good on that, I contrast that a little bit to what I hear out of the larger U.S. Telcos who have been pretty clear that NFE is an opportunity for them to reduce spending on what they call big iron in the core of the network. So I'm wondering if you could compare and contrast that a little bit and help us I think that through and then I've got a follow up. Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Yeah, sure. I will start with this routing question. I think actually where if you look where you see virtualization becoming most relevant. It's in areas of the market that are tend to be little bit less performance tend to be more around the customer premises equipment is really around the end goal of automation. And we have developed of what I think are really competitive solutions to address that particular opportunity. The big iron stuff - it's really around keeping up with traffic patterns with growth in traffic. And if you look at for examples the enhancements that we are making in the PTX where we're going from a terabit per slot to 3 terabits per slot industry leadership from form standpoint. I can tell you that is absolutely hitting the mark in terms of the kinds of technologies that are telecom operators are looking for to cost effectively address the insatiable based our traffic growth in their networks.
Robyn Denholm: Jeff your follow-up?
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, thank you. And then the second one is could you help us a little bit to understand when we can expect revenues from the QFX-10000 I think that still at one point and might have been in the first half of this year and I'm not sure if I A have that right in B if so I'm interpreting your remarks is being more of a second half 2016 story.
Rami Rahim: We well we expect the revenue ramp to start in the first half. It will obviously be more meaningful in the second half. But we do expect that the revenue will start in the first half.
Robyn Denholm: Yeah, I think it's fair to say that we expect that those revenues in the first half that right will start in the second half I think is the way we would characterize it.
Unidentified Analyst: Yeah, okay. Thank you to both for helping me parse through that language.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thanks Jeff. So we are running up to the hour. We have time for one more question.
Operator: Certainly, our final question is from Jason Muland [ph] of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks for slipping me in. I had a couple of quick ones hopefully and thank you for giving the color on the top 10 customers. And the question there with more success in cable and cloud is Rami as the business becoming more concentrated around key customers or is that the wrong way to look at it.
Rami Rahim: No I think it's actually getting more diverse across vertical markets, cloud, cable telecom operators large enterprises federal governments and so on. And I think that's good because it's adding a greater level of predictability to the business. I don't think we're done I mean I think that there is always going to be some lumpiness I mean our exposure to telecom operator is still quite high so there is going to be some lumpiness to the business which is why so important for us to continue in 2016 on our strategy of diversification across vertical markets across geos and also across technology areas of switching revenue security.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And then a quick follow up. On the comments about volatility across all markets and geos and then with security specifically ScreenOS is all but gone and you've got traction at the high end of the SRX market. Should we expect to see more resiliency in security relative to other market just given the nature of that business.
Rami Rahim: Yeah I have said in the past that this 2015 will be the year of stabilizing security and then we would start to see modest growth in 2016. So at the end of 2015 I think it's we can say that we exceeded our expectations last year. Securities grew 5% full year year-to-year comparison. And I think that's not an accident it is a result of some really great work by a lot of people to Juniper that I'm extremely proud of. There you're going to see a rolling thunder of security enhancements that we will make across managements, where we knew that we have some work to do to better penetrate the enterprise with the area of next gen firewall capabilities that are cloud offered that this product is called the sky advanced threat prevention that's in beta today that essentially starts to ship shortly in the next few months. We just wrapped up a customer and partner events actually more of the partner events just earlier this months, where we heard first hand from our partner that they are feeling much better about where we are in the security today relative to where we just a year ago.
Unidentified Analyst: Appreciate the color. Thanks Rami.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thanks Jason. And thank you everyone for joining us today. As always we appreciate all of your great questions and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Juniper Networks Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Ms. Kathleen Nemeth, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Nemeth. You may now begin.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thank you, Operator. And thanks for joining us to discuss Juniper Networks third quarter financial results and the outlook for the fourth quarter of 2015 which we announced earlier this afternoon. With me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial and Operations Officer. Today’s call contains forward-looking statements, including statements concerning Juniper’s business outlook, economic and market outlook, strategy, future financial operating results, capital return program, and overall future prospects. Actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in these forward-looking statements are listed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release furnished with our 8-K filed today and in other documents that we filed with the SEC from time to time. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances change after the date of the call. Our discussion of the financial results today will include non-GAAP financial results. Full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. For important commentary on why our management team considers non-GAAP information, a useful view of the company’s financial results, please consult the press release furnished with our 8-K filed with the SEC today. Now, I’ll hand the call over to Rami.
Rami Rahim: Thanks, Kathleen. Good afternoon and welcome to our third quarter financial results call. Juniper delivered another quarter of strong financial performance with robust demand metrics and solid year-over-year earnings expansion. Our customer diversification strategy continues to yield positive results with revenue booked sequentially and year-over-year across routing switching and security. Notably, this quarter we saw strong performance within our telecom and targeted enterprise vertical. Security was also a highlight with double-digit growth driven by our high-end SRX products. Overall, I’m pleased with the strong pipeline and execution across key areas of the business. The industry is in rapid transition, moving towards cloud delivered value. This paradigm shift to the cloud is changing the way we access technology and how IT services are being delivered. In this era of massive transformation, the network is at the heart of the action. Our goal as a pure play in high-performance networking is to make sure we invest and innovate to capture this transformation as it is happening, and our customers are looking to us to support them in their evolution. We continue to lead the industry with technology innovation. In the quarter, we know announced the new reference architecture called Juniper Networks Unite for the cloud-enabled enterprise. It demonstrates our commitment to the enterprise campus and branch segment, and our ongoing focus on IP network innovation. The new reference architecture includes our new Junos Fusion Enterprise fabric, which enables customers to simplify management of large enterprise campus network. We also announced new security innovation that will enable sophisticated threat intelligence, prevention and dynamic policy enforcement. We are forging new alliances and partnerships that will help us drive top-line growth and market expansion. In the quarter, we extended our partnership with NEC to help provide IP transport routers to Telenor Group. We are also expanding our technology alliance ecosystem, adding Aerohive network, who will along with Ruckus and Aruba will help us deliver a simple secured and cloud managed wired and wireless solution for distributed enterprises. Because of our clear focus on execution we are seeing some great customer product traction. Among our top customers in the quarter, our globally recognized high-tech company, and four of our top 10 are cloud or cable provider. Has our customers look to the future, they recognize Juniper’s unique value proposition to deliver the ultimate in performance agility and automation and we are empowering such companies as British Airways and Telefónica Spain to deliver world-class cloud services without compromise. In addition, we are pleased with several new design wins at multiple leading-edge technology companies. I’ll summarize some highlights this quarter across our technologies. First, I want to underscore how strategic our Contrail solution is in defining the IT and business evolution to the cloud. Customers are moving towards open-source products, software-driven automation and containers and micro services. We secured each headwinds in three major segments, Software as a Service, Public Cloud, and Telco Cloud and FBE. Of note, AT&T was a landmark deal for us this quarter. In routing we grew 13% year-over-year. Most verticals continued to grow with solid quarter-over-quarter growth in telecom and national government. We had another record revenue quarter for both the PTX and MX series. And in Q3, adoption of some of our newest products the PTX5000, PTX1000, ATX500 accelerated. In switching, we had another record revenue quarter for the QFX series. The QFX10000 continued to see good traction along with the QFX5100 with service providers, cloud and enterprise customers. We also saw strength in the EX family switches with enterprise, government and service provider customer. In security, we saw our second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth excluding Junos Pulse. Our security business is showing early strength in the high-end SRX with cloud and service provider customers. And branch SRX is doing low in government and managed service provider and enterprise account. We believe the combination of new threat detection capabilities and new security partnerships is a catalyst spurring our return to growth. The course we set for ourselves is now playing out largely as we anticipated. By remaining resolute in our focus as a pure play in high-performance networking we are creating tremendous value for our customers and our shareholders. Overall, while we acknowledged that recent industry consolidation activity could create some volatility, we believe overall spending trends remains healthy. Industry dynamics continue to unfold as we expected and our Q4 guidance incorporates our view of the macroeconomic landscape. The world needs a company like Juniper networks. We have a clear and deliberate strategy. And as a challenger in this industry, I continue to see tremendous opportunity for us to challenge the status quo and deliver on our vision of being the worldwide leader in network innovation. I want to thank each of our employees for being critical part of this incredible journey. And thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders, who believe in our vision to empower everyone in this increasingly connected world. I remain focused on disciplined execution of our business and prudent investments for growth to realize Juniper’s full potential. Now, I’ll turn it over to Robyn to review a few highlights of the quarter.
Robyn Denholm: Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter 2015 results reflected good year-over-year and sequential revenue and earnings growth. We also demonstrated the strength of the diversity of our revenue across multiple verticals, technologies and geographies. Specifically, we saw year-over-year and sequential revenue growth in both EMEA and APAC, as well as solid growth in the enterprise across all geography. We are pleased with the ongoing year-over-year growth and healthy underlying demand from cloud providers. However, as we have noted this vertical can be lumpy due to the timing of deployment. As a reminder, our second quarter 2015 results for routing in the Americas were positively impacted by the recognition of deferred revenue for the delivery of product and feature commitments. In reviewing our top 10 customers, five were telcos, three which were outside of the U.S., four were cloud and cable providers, and one was an enterprise customer. We expected diversification trend to continue, demonstrating the increased relevance of our product portfolio across multiple verticals and geographies. Our underlying demand metrics were healthy this quarter with the year-over-year and sequential increase in product deferred revenue and a product book-to-bill greater than one. For the quarter, we delivered strong year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin and earnings per share expansion which reflects our solid execution, focus on revenue growth, effective management of our cost structure and significant reduction in share count. We are pleased that we delivered results in line with our long-term model of 39% non-GAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue. In the quarter, we had strong cash flow from operations of $293 million as a direct result of our accrued operating margin. CapEx for the quarter also increased to $71 million, as we focused on investments to drive long term productivity and support continued innovation and developments of new products. We repurchased $50 million of shares and paid $39 million of dividend. Through Q1 of 2014 inclusive of share repurchases and dividends we returned approximately $3.5 billion of capital to shareholders, against our commitment to return $4.1 billion by the end of 2016. Now, let’s take a look at some of the underlying assumptions behind our outlook for Q4. We expect the demand environment across multiple verticals to remain healthy and anticipate the diversification of our revenue to continue. We expect continued uncertainty around the macro-environment in China and certain parts of Europe which we have factored into our outlook. We also anticipate the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to other currencies to remain strong. I’m very pleased with the ongoing operational discipline, including operating expense management across the company. Our new products are gaining traction with our customers, given the underlying healthy demand environment and to ensure that we capture the growth opportunities from these new products, we anticipate making modest increases to our go-to-market resources over the next few quarters, while remaining in line with our long-term model of non-GAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue of 39%. You can find the detailed outlook to Q4 in the CFO commentary available on our website. To summarize, I am pleased with the strong performance in Q3, including demonstrating the ability to achieve our long-term model. We anticipate overall demand to remain healthy across our target verticals and geography. We continue to see good traction with our customers, brand-new product innovations, as evidenced by new design wins and a growing pipeline. As we close out the year, we remain focused on execution and delivering on our strategic commitment. I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper’s success. And now, I’d like to open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jim Suva of Citi. Please go ahead.
Jim Suva: Thank you, and congratulations to you and your team there at Juniper. A quick question, you mentioned about investing more for the future but still within your financial goals which is great. For the investing in those items can you help us a little bit more, is that focused on say geographic expansion or product expansion or certain areas like software security or certain parts that you’re little softer? And also the timing of when these harvesting of these investments should start to see some growth where we should start to see some fruit from that investment? Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Yes, thanks for the question and the comments, Jim. Let me just start and then I’ll pass it over to Robyn. First and foremost, as a pure-play innovator, the goal for Juniper is really to continue to make sure that we have really differentiated products in the market segments that we are going after. We have incredible product pipeline as we talked about earlier this year and it’s now in the process of shipping. And we’ve also consistently said that when we invest we’re going to invest in a way, in a prudent manner with discipline that’s commensurate with the growth of the company. That’s a discipline that Robyn and I are absolutely driving through organization right now. It’s one that I think is paying off. If you just take a look at the profitability metrics in terms of operating margin and OpEx as a percentage of total revenue for the company in Q3 timeframe. And I’ll pass it Robyn if you want to add anything else.
Robyn Denholm: Yes, so specifically, Jim, what I mentioned in my commentary was that we will invest modestly as we move forward here on the go-to-market side. And Rami mentioned from a product delivery point of view, we’re very excited about the new products that we are delivering in to the market. We’ve seen good receptivity to those products. And so we’re adding prudently to the go-to-market and that to make sure that we are capturing the opportunity that’s out there.
Jim Suva: Thank you, and congratulations again to you and your team.
Rami Rahim: Thanks, Jim.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Tal Liani of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Tal Liani: Hi, just first a follow-up to the previous question. Does it mean - so you’re now at an operating margin of about 25% give or take. What does it mean from a margin target that the fact you want to invest more? What does it mean for the margin target going forward? That’s number one. Number two, I want to ask more about the market itself. There was a routing cycle. You recovered from some weakness we had in previous quarters. How is - what’s the outlook? Was there just a recovery from the lows? And then there is a new level and from there it goes flat, because I see it was flat sequentially this quarter. Or do you see demand, continue to creep up, go up, because of certain reasons, you can identify the reasons? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Okay. Thanks, Tal. So let me start, then I’ll also hand it over to Robyn. On the margin target, I think the results that you saw in Q3 with respect to our operating margins being north of 25% and also again, our OpEx as a percentage of revenue being in line with our long term model. The long term model that we outlined to our shareholders at the end of 2014 is intact. And the results of that you see here should eventually give you confidence and it gives us a lot of confidence that we can absolutely achieve that long-term model. That’s how I would think about it. And certainly that requires a level of disciplined execution and investment that are driving through in the company today that I’m honestly quite proud of how the team is executing on. On the second question with respect to routing, the trends that we’re seeing in routing in the second-half are largely playing out as we have been describing over the last several quarters. We said that there should be some improvement in telco spending in the second-half of the year. And that’s essentially happening. We did see that improvement, not only in the tier 1, but also in non-tier 1 service provider. Booking for routing, it was actually quite healthy in Q3. I think the softness was essentially is the result of cloud, difficult compared relative Q2 because of the revenue recognition to book that we had in that quarter. But visibility is solid and the product pipeline has never been this good in many, many years in the company. So I actually feel good about where we are with respect to routing. Robyn?
Robyn Denholm: Yes, I know, I think you said it well on the margin side. In terms of the percentage of revenue for OpEx we are targeting 39% of which we outlined last year and I will point out that whilst we got to the model this quarter we did get the last quarter as well from an operating margin perspective. There is still a lot of work to be done to get there on a sustainable basis and an annualized basis. So I think we’ll have the next question. Manny, can you…
Operator: Excuse me. Yes, the next is from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Simona Jankowski: Hi, thanks very much. Rami, you commented on the recent industry consolidation, but then you also made a comment that the world needs a company like Juniper. I was just curious, was that a reference to a preference you have to remain standalone versus participating in the consolidation? And then, I have a follow-up.
Rami Rahim: Okay. Thanks for the question, Simona. You look at the industry right now, certainly, there are examples of consolidation, there is at least one example where the exact opposite of a split is in fact happening. But these things that I want everybody to be aware of is the massive transformation that’s just happening in terms of technology, in terms a new approach in that service providers and enterprises are using to deliver value to their end user, that requires things like virtualization, requires things like automation and visibility and analytics. And that in my mind requires that there would be somebody that’s absolutely focused on innovation in the space of IP networking. And I believe that’s the role that we satisfy in this industry, as I go around the world and I talk to our customer CIO, CTO, CEO they all have the common theme in terms of requirements, which is a technology provider that can partner with them to offer a new way for them to deliver services and values to their end users. And they view us as that right partner that’s I think the role that we satisfy.
Simona Jankowski: Thank you. And then just a follow-up question which is to with your MX product, which has been very successful over the years. Some of your competitors physical there has been others are talking about addressing some of the routing features in the routing stack, and then aggregated fashion on the switching platforms in the data center. And I think you guys are considering or working on doing something similar, but can you just address how that developments are might impinge on the opportunity for the MX and whether that’s kind of holistic whether you do it to yourselves or others do it to you?
Rami Rahim: Sure. Thanks for the question Simona. So, the MX success is a result of a few different things that one of the biggest elements of the success has to do with the diversity of used cases that is satisfied, it really has turned into the standard Swiss Army knife, if you will, for this industry or has the ability to deliver all sorts of services whether it be business or residential or to serve at the edge of the data center connecting data centers together or connecting data centers to the consumer of cloud services. I think it’s very difficult for anybody to target the MX it is entirety with all of the used cases that it serves the flexibility that we built round up from the start to make it very competitive. Now, let’s said, I’m not confused about the fact that this industry is a competitive industry and we have to innovate in that way. Yes, I do believe that there will be competition that will go after specific used cases that the MX does target. And in that case we either show and demonstrate the flexibility of the MX in solving that used case in a better way or we do have options ourselves with other products that we can use in our portfolio, whether it would be the PTX or the new QFX10000, that can solve in particular used case in a more efficient manner. So, I think about it from a standpoint of, yes, the industry is competitive. We now have a diverse future between the MX, the PTX and the QFX that give us all of the weapons that we need to compete effectively.
Simona Jankowski: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Rod Hall of J.P. Morgan, please go ahead.
Rod Hall: Yes, thanks for the question. I just wanted to focus a little bit more on switching the numbers better than we expected momentum that continues yet, what are other data points out there pointing to enterprise in many regions. I just wonder Rob, could you just comment on where we are with the major projects that you guys are seeing and switching or implementing and have you added more of those projects that was allowing it’s about trend and then I got a follow-up.
Rami Rahim: Sure Rod. In switching I think the strength was broad-based and there we saw a good diversity of business across both the service provider and the enterprise. We also saw healthy demands for switching around the world which certainly help. And when you think about switching, for us it really comes down to cloud. There is a consistency across pretty much all of our market verticals. In the enterprise, there is a Cloud-First Mentality, where CIOs are looking to move workloads and applications to the clouds and the service provider segment and the cable provider segment they are looking at delivering more value to end users through cloud-based architectures. I think our switching, routing and security portfolios are coming together under the mega fabric architecture framework in a way that’s really resonating with our customers. And the roadmap with the new set of spine switches that were in the process of shipping into the market today is looking very solid in the eyes of our customers. I think I’m bullish on the long-term prospects we’re switching given, all of these trends and because of the differentiation that we have in our product portfolio.
Robyn Denholm: You had a follow-up Rod? Hi Manny, or Rod are you there?
Operator: Yes. The next question is from Pierre Ferragu of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Robyn Denholm:
. :
, :
Pierre Ferragu: Hi, guys. Thank you for taking the question. I would want to ask many questions, you’ve been doing so great on so many dimensions. So, maybe I would just restricted to switching and security. In switching, because to know if how like the ramp up of your product to high density spine QFX switch is doing and how much it has an impact in numbers this quarter. And if we should expect some website from this product trend, but only one or two quarter horizon. And then on the security so impressive to see SRX platform doing so well at the moment. And it would be curious to know, where are you winning with the platform at the moment and how are you replacing like nagging, in the broad-based that you had out there, so is that the product cycle are you winning this, are you displacing competitors that would be very good to know that. And then, almost everybody asked you that. I can’t helping us one more question on, how we should think about that going forward. Would that be fair to think that you guys whatever - whichever we think it’s happened going forward, I probably not going to grow your cost basedin the OpEx based on your revenues, is that the fair statement. And sorry for the embarrassing question.
Robyn Denholm: That’s okay. Yes. Let me handle the last one first, and then Rami will talk about switching and security. So, on the cost side absolutely we are focused on the discipline around cost management that we’ve shine over the last few years. And we are very focusedon making sure that we only add modest amount of costs. The increase between Q3 and Q4 again to meet point of 500 plus or minus in terms of OpEx. The majority of that increase quarter-over-quarter the vast majority is actually variable cost. So, what we’re talking about is modest increase as we now go to market we’re very focused on delivering the leverage in the model as we believe is there in lying with our long-term model.
Robyn Denholm: This is great, thanks.
Pierre Ferragu: Thank you.
Rami Rahim: And, hi, Pierre. Let me touch on switching and security. So, in the spine switches we’ve now shift the first version of the family of new QFX10000 spine switches, we anticipate that we’ll get the second version now into our customers hand before the end of the year. The traction that we’re seeing is solid, I think that these products have been now in our customers lapse for some time and we’re getting feedbacks and we are eventually putting to finishing touches on those products. I will say that the team really pushed the limits of technology developing these products and we did with the hope and the anticipation that we will have some two differentiation and it’s playing out exactly as we have predicted in terms of our differentiation relative to net sales in the market and I feel very good about that. All that being said, we have consistently set the modest revenue in the second-half of this year and that’s how I would think about it with the growth really starting to happen next year. On the security side, if you recall earlier in the year, we talked about our security pivot, we talked about reaching synergies from the standpoint of technology and cost as well as revenue, we talked about switch and security is being instrumentally tight to the network. And the initial focus for us was on the high-end. If we offer a cloud network or a campus network to our customers, we want them to have the peace of mind that it will be resilient, it will be high quality, it will be resilient to attached from that guide. And that means that you should be able to secure the network, with that’s flowing it down. So with the initial focus on the high-end I think we’ve increased the confidence in the eyes of our customers, we’ve improved the performance of the product lines dramatically it’s now effect the high endis directed the fastest firewallin the industry. And so for certain used cases around the edge of the cloud in service provider and mobile infrastructure. We really have to differentiate the products and we’re starting to see the effect of that. That said, I am not yet calling machine accomplished on security, we’ve said that 2015 will be in the year of stability and we’ve still a lot of work quite frankly for us to do to shore up the rest of the product portfolio especially if it comes to the enterprise and that’s exactly what we’re focused on right now. So, pleased with what we’ve done so far a lot more work for us to do.
Robyn Denholm:
.:
Pierre Ferragu: Excellent. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. With that, we’ll turn to Rod Hall for his follow-up question.
Rod Hall: Yes, thanks for coming back to me. Can you hear me okay?
Rami Rahim: Yes.
Robyn Denholm: Yes. Go ahead.
Rod Hall: So, If I’m just going to ask about the routing business and one of you guys can comment on what you think happened to your share this quarter in market share and also on the Contrail, on AT&T which by the way congratulations on that. I just wonder if you could maybe give us a little idea what the revenue opportunity that might look like what sorts of products that might pull through, thanks.
Rami Rahim: Sure, Rod. On market share I don’t think all of the reports are collect, yet, but these share reports you have to look at them and dissect them into different areas. I think in the edge based on the wins and the project that we’ve been executing on there is a large dynamic that’s happening around the world especially here in the US and in EMEA for edge modernization and consolidation simplification of edge architectures. And just based on the project activity I believe that we’re doing quite well. In the core, I think it’s going to take a little bit of time for us as we go through the transition from T Series to the next generation of the PTX that we’re shipping this year that we’ve lost in the early part of this year. So, I’m not sure what’s going to happen there with respect to our share, but I feel good about the roadmap and the focus in terms of the prospects for share gains going forward into next year. On Contrail yes you pointed out one of the wins that we are very proud of and that is with AT&T, but let me say that pretty much every strategic discussion that we’re having with our customers around the world especially on the service provider side, but also in some larger enterprises that are looking at transforming the way in which they manage their networks to simplify the operations of those networks and to add far greater agility in how they deliver services over those networks. They are thinking about a new architectural approach and Contrail is part of that discussion. So, we added four new paying customers, I think the engagements have expanded the developer community for the open source Contrail project is only growing the amount of innovation that’s not coming not just from Juniper, but from our partners around the industry is also growing, I’m really proud of what the Contrail team has done and continuous to do. And AT&T certainly who extremely created that project, but I think that’s just an example of others that were also engaging in.
Rod Hall: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo, please go ahead.
Jess Lubert: Hi guys, thanks for taking my question and congratulations on another nice quarter here. First, I would hope you could tell us of getting 10% customers in the period and if so what category they would fall into. And then secondly, in Europe of course like your Carrier business is fairly strong so, it’s helping to understand that was driven by a handful of large deals that would tail-off after a quarter or two, where that was driven by a larger number of transactions that might be more sustainable and then perhaps you could provide an update on the Nokia partnership how that’s proceeding, how confident you are in your ability to navigate any disruption once that deal is closed? Thanks.
Robyn Denholm: Yes. So, Jess, in terms of 10% customers there were no 10% customers in the quarter. Again, part of the strength of this quarter was actually the diversification of revenue in the quarter again with enterprise actually being quite strong, telco being quite strong, and obviously, a sequential decline but still very healthy year-over-year growth in the cloud providers and cable area. So, I’ll let Rami talk through the EMEA service provider business.
Rami Rahim: Sure. So, in Europe actually the strength was fairly broad-based, it was with both on the service provider, the key or the tier 1 telecom operators, but also in the enterprises and particularly government. So, actually I’m pretty pleased with the broad-based strength of the business, there are certainly large deals in the SP space. There are typically going to be large deals that drive the overall performance, but I don’t think there is anything that’s atypical if you will in the quarter. And then I will say that the project that we’re engaging in are really around a number of key used cases edge modernization in particular such as for example the announcement that we made recently with Telefonica Spain seems to be a really key scene in that region, I think operators are looking to streamline their networks and deliver more value with great agility over this networks and for that you need a universal edge type product and the MX satisfies that role quite naturally. On the Nokia, I think we’re executing towards strategy and the plan that we outlined in the last earnings call. We have enjoyed deep relationship with all of our customers around the world and where there is a need to make a change in our total market approach we’re doing that and we’re doing it to a schedule that I think is working very well for us, so no concerns on that forefront.
Jess Lubert: Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Brian White with Drexel. Please go ahead.
Brian White: Yes, Rami. I wonder if you could comment a little about this product cycle we’re ramping up this year, but if you had to provide us with an idea where we are in the revenue generation from this product cycle that would be great in terms of what percentage we are the way through and just the AT&T win for the carriers often define networking maybe just a little more color on why Juniper was chosen and does this categorize existing business or net-net this is incremental for Juniper? Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Yes, thanks Brian. On the product cycle and I’m assuming here you’re talking about the newer product that we’re introducing market across routing, switching and security it’s still early stages we’re consistently in that second-half, we’ll see modest revenue on the routing side, we haven’t yet shift the enhancements to the PTX product lines we’re very excited about. I think the growth really started to happen in a meaningful way in 2016 and the early customer interest gave us confidence of these products of hitting the mark in terms of the challenges that they solve for our customers. On AT&T a couple of different projects that have been announced one, is that we are participating in AT&T network on demand initiative. We’re doing this especially we’re offering, we’re partnering with them to offer to end users, enterprises. And you weigh the rising value from their networks that gives far more flexibility into the hands of the customer itself. So, they will have the ability to choose on-demand the kinds of services that they want AT&T to deliver to them and it’s a very soft or eccentric approach to market that has traditionally been driven by hardware and complexity. And we want it quite frankly because we have challenged the ways in which these solutions were delivered historically. We had actually little to nothing to lose, because it’s essentially a net new market opportunity for Juniper. And so, we’ve demonstrated to AT&T that we are a very willing partnered in that technology transformation and we’re delighted that we were successful. And the second project is really around the very strategic network control-point, this being Contrail, that will provide the network automation in their next-generation central offices. This is where I provided the commentary that this is just an example of the types of engagements we are having with service providers around the world. The fact is that SP’s are really looking to a new approach to running their next-generation network facilities and delivering values from this facilities and the network controllers at barrister to control point in the new architecture and contrail and the traction it’s seeing is a big that’s very encouraging to us.
Operator: The next question us from Sanjiv Wadhwani of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Sanjiv Wadhwani: Rami I had a question about growth, a year ago at the analyst day you had talked about 3% to 6% three year growth rate and understanding it might fluctuate in any given year. Wondering if you could comment next year might be a typical year fall within that range and how some of your new products that really ramping next year might help out in terms of growth rate next year. Thanks.
Rami Rahim: We are just going to stick it will be provided you at the end of 2014 in terms of the three your view. Certainly the results that we’re seeing this year give us the confidence that we can achieve that three year view in terms of growth. I think the fundamentals of the industry are solid. I think the spending environment is good. The product roadmap is healthy and you know all of those factors come together to give me the confidence in our ability to actually achieve the growth targets that we provided you.
Robyn Denholm: We will provide you with some color into next year as we round out this year. In terms of what we’re expecting from a growth rate perspective.
Sanjiv Wadhwani: I guess just a quick follow up. When you look at the new products, do you think that could add to some dimension in growth? Just given that starting to ramp next year? Just qualitatively, not just in terms of the actual addition or subtraction in numbers?
Robyn Denholm: Yes. As we’ve been saying consistently, our new product revenue for the products we announced earlier this year in March, will contribute very modestly to revenue in 2015. We expect revenue growth for next year to be more substantial.
Operator: The next question is from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
James Faucette: I wanted to ask a similar question. If we go back to last year, last fall you are kind of outlining your growth targets, one of the key tenants that you focused on was the eventual need for carriers to increase their spending, particularly on core as core capacity was exhausted. At the same time as we fast forward to this year, service provider spending at least among the U.S. is still been relatively flat without seeing much improvement there. I’m wondering if you can give a little bit of color what maybe allowing the carriers in the U.S. o do that? And secondly, as they do start to increase their spend, how much of an additional tailwind can this be. It seems like with the good growth you’ve seen with the U.S. Tier 1 the kicking in, perhaps can be an accelerator and then similarly, on security you’re delivering good year-over-year growth in that line in spite of the fact that you’re characterizing it as a 2015 as a stabilization. So if that’s the case we expect to see further acceleration in security in 2016 as you turn the corner and start to enter into what you think to be true growth. Thanks.
Rami Rahim: There’s a lot in there I’m going to see if I can address at all. First in terms of carrier spending. As I mentioned things are largely playing out as we expected in the second half and I expect the next quarter, Q4 also be a good quarter to also be a good quarter for us in terms of carrier spending. The dynamics between core and edge actually I’ve been consistently saying it’s become very difficult to break out those two domains. Much of the pressure that’s happening in telecom networks today is in fact happening in the metro, it’s happening in the edge and a lot of the product that have traditionally been used or deployed in the core are now actually going in the edge to deal with that tropic capacity. So I’m really more measuring our success in carrier routing from overall routing standpoint as opposed to specific to one domain or the other. That said, despite the fact that we’re seeing some improvement in telcos we are not counting on that alone in driving our overall revenue growth, we are counting on continued diversity in our business. We saw that play out in the last couple of quarters with cloud kicking in to help some weakness in carrier spending. We’re seeing it now this quarter with diversity across the enterprise, government, and different geos, all of that is kicking in to support the overall growth. And it really then demonstrates the power of that strategy to diversify our business from a technology standpoint, from a market vertical standpoint and also from a geo standpoint. On security, again this year is all about stability as Robyn mentioned essentially we are flat year-to-date. We still have I feel very good on where the work that has been done thus far on shoring up our competitiveness in the service provider high-end security space and in the cloud. We still have some more work to do on the enterprise side and just in Q3, we announced a series of enhancements to our security portfolio under the umbrella of a new architecture called Juniper Unite. That essentially brings to bear our security switching and routing assets together to create far more agility, simplicity and ease of management that’s so important to our enterprise customers in the campus and in the canvas domain and that’s what we’re working on right now and I think that plays out in resulting growth in 2016 timeframe.
Robyn Denholm: Let me just added to the first part of your question, James. On telco we actually saw good growth in the quarter both sequentially and year-over-year and globally, modestly in the U.S. but globally it was a nice quarter for growth. So we’re actually anticipating that diversification to continue and we are expecting that to continue to improve again modestly.
Operator: The next question is from Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Kulbinder Garcha: I guess it’s for Rami and a lots been [indiscernible] call about diversifying your revenue base versus the charts that we saw last year, this update on how some diversified you are now? And if you can’t get some of those numbers may be can you help us with the [Technical Difficulty] comfortable whereby Juniper could see through cycle revenue growth well it continues and you could offset on a continuous basis the typical service provider cycle that we see? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: I know that data that we had provided has been very useful and I think we can look to provide an updated view in the future. From just a qualitative standpoint, the strategy itself is definitely working out in terms of helping us offset what is in fact a cyclical industry. Do we believe that we can completely offset large cycles that might happen in telcos? No. I think that’s a pretty tall order but that said I think we’ve demonstrated with not just a diversity from a market vertical standpoint but diversity across the technology areas, switching routing securities and diversity across geos. I mean you look at Q3, enterprise kicked in and also EMEA and APAC kicked in that helped us in again, creating the overall growth. I think the strategy works. I think it has legs and I think that it will help us in the future.
Kulbinder Garcha: [Technical Difficulty]. And maybe just one very quick. There’s a question I want to ask about the question from the Juniper perspective it seems to me that you guys are hitting most of the targets were heading toward most of the targets you want. The ones I have always been question about is and given that you are achieving your working structure generating good cash return returning cash growing without the time that Juniper on the M&A do think maybe accelerate some of your growth or is that how you see the business?
Rami Rahim: Yes. I’m actually open to M&A and it will be as I said mentioned historically very much complementary to our strategy. Tuck-in type technology M&A’s that will be easy to integrate and work to accelerate the strategy that we are already executing on. Having said that, we are so focused right now on putting the finishing touches on what is a huge product pipeline that’s all coming to bear into the market simultaneously around the same time frame I honestly do not want to distract the team too much from that right now. So timing is going to be important, but that said, I do believe that M&A can be a good part of our strategy with the right timing and certainly something that’s complimentary to our overall strategy.
Operator: Next question is from Mark Sue of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Mark Sue: Robyn I think on the cost side you should just go spend the money so please go ahead. As it relates to the tech competitors some are moving quickly to combined a stack converge and seeing some hyper converge. Are there platform changes your customers are asking you to make or is it still about combining discrete assets of switching, routing, contrail, just trying to get a understanding of the long tail migration opportunity with your current product set and how you might see clean page data centers being deployed.
Rami Rahim: I will say you’re actually hitting on a topic, it’s very important to me and to my leadership team. Today the growth that we’ve seen with Juniper products in the cloud have largely been as a result of companies, enterprises, telcos, cloud providers that have the ability to choose best of breed and to combine them themselves in ways that solved the business challenges that they face. That said, there is a part of the marketing segment of the market, the value out-of-the-box converged architectures that include compute storage, networking and the software automations stack on top of that. We have in fact been working with a number of different partners so we probably have around half dozen right now, regional partners that are working with Juniper as well as storage providers and compute providers to build those converged stack offerings. They typically are very targeted to specific market verticals so some might be targeted towards healthcare, others toward retail and it’s still early days. These are relatively new product offerings, but I actually I feel pretty confident in their ability to at least give us some access to that converged or hyper converged market.
Mark Sue: And can we assume that Juniper is resorting back to the practice of not revealing products that might actually already are being tested by some of your customers?
Rami Rahim: Sorry the question was not revealing are not reviewing?
Robyn Denholm: The practice of not announcing products before they are scheduled to be shipped
Rami Rahim: I see what you’re saying. I think there is a balance here. The practice of revealing products years in advance of ship I say yes, that’s something that is well behind us. We certainly will announce within a certain reasonable timeframe like a couple of quarters type of timeframe. And I think there is value in doing that because what you do is you prime the market. You get it ready for adoption but we are very careful in not revealing our cards if you will too early. That said, there is always a lot of deep dialogue and engagement under NDA with our customers where we’re not only revealing the products but we’re actually making them stakeholders in the developments of those products and making sure that those products satisfy their specific requirements.
Operator: Next question is from Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Ittai Kidron: I had a couple questions. First looking at your enterprise business, this is the first quarter in five, after five quarters, where you had year-over-year declines in your enterprise business that you actually had a positive year-over-year growth in the enterprise. So Rami it will be great to get some color as to how much of this is sort of a little bit of reversion to the mean after five back quarters versus your confidence in them, more sustainable result out of that business and I’d like to apply that question as well to your security business. Clearly you have had two very good quarters, I’m wondering how much of it is just a reflection of the fact that clients have been sitting on the sidelines now that you have refreshed a product that are kind of updating architectures versus their true new wins, new customer additions here. So if you could give some color in the security, how much of the progress here is on your existing install base versus adding new customers that would be great. And then for you, Robyn, just as we think about that next year, can you help us think about how to think about March quarter’s [indiscernible] and also pro forma tax rate for 2016. Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Sure. Let me start. First on the enterprise. I am certainly pleased with the performance. Three reason, cloud, cloud, and cloud are essentially why we’re seeing this success that we are seeing in the enterprise. There’s been a lot of focus on targeting enterprises and service providers that are building out cloud architectures and the product portfolio that go to market focus the support infrastructure we have in place is all geared towards tapping into that segment. And it is a growing segment. At the end of the day while switching for example is a huge total addressable market, the cloud element of it is the part that’s in fact growing and we want to tap into that and we have been able to tap into that. It has been also just a big focus for me personally as part of the strategic initiative that I’ve laid out this year from the standpoint of partnerships. Creating the partnerships and the commercial engine that we need to tap into the overall enterprise opportunity specifically as it relates to the cloud. In security, it really is a combination, in fact there has been a few notable wins in the last couple of quarters that are net new. Having said that, I think there are also customers that have traditionally liked the SRX, especially the high-end SRX and the branch SRX that we are tapping into that need to modernize their infrastructure and we’re tapping into that as well. Again, we are not calling mission accomplished yet in security. There is a lot more work to do and there might be a couple of gyrations here and there as we get to overall long-term growth which happens next year.
Robyn Denholm: And I think the other area on the enterprise that’s also we’re focusing on the channel as well. Using a lot of the enterprise wins that we’ve been developing ourselves in terms of both the cloud area that Rami mentioned as well as in the security side to reinvigorate the channel and put design wins and that type of thing with them so that we can enable the channel to replicate them. Ittai you asked two questions. One to me, one was on the tax rate, what was the other question?
Ittai Kidron: How should we think about seasonality heading into the March quarter?
Robyn Denholm: Okay. So let me talk about seasonality. At this point it’s obviously early. We’ll give you more color next quarter’s call but we’re not anticipating anything outside of the normal seasonality that we would see between Q4 and Q1. So typically we see a reduction somewhere between 7% and 10%, that type of thing. So we’re not expecting at this point anything different to that. We’ll give you an update on that on the next call. In terms of the tax rate, there was a lot of excitement in the tax rate commentary this quarter which is not usual. So on the pro forma GAAP tax rate, we will expect a slightly reduced rate. Obviously the R&D tax credit is not being renewed has had an increase in our tax rate overall for the year. If that gets renewed that can have close to 2% tax rate adjustment. So at this point we wouldn’t see a significantly different tax rate for next year except for the addition of the R&D tax credit.
Operator: The next question is from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Vijay Bhagavath: I took out coverage of group from Brian, so looking forward to working with you and your team. My question is really on the sustainability and visibility of the order flow in cloud and cable. Honestly I would like to ask a question in terms of that segment has been doing well for you, cloud and cable providers you also mentioned SaaS etcetera. So are these one-offs kind of a near-term order flow, do you see sustainability from a use case point of view that this could kind of extend over a multiple quarters and then the a quick follow-on to that would be on the service provider routing side. You had the routing business, is this is expectations in Q3 is flattish. [Indiscernible] so give us kind of your view of the order commentary there in routing heading into Q4 and into over the next few quarters. Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Let me start and I’ll see if Robyn has anything to add. Cloud and cable, I think those verticals have had lumpiness historically and I’m not let’s say concerned about the relative weakness that we had sequentially in cloud in Q3. If you look at the year-over-year it’s actually quite healthy growth. Very healthy growth in fact. When I look at the fundamentals of cloud, the need to build efficient wide-area networks to connect the data centers together to connect the data centers to the consumers of cloud services to peer endpoint is all absolutely there and I don’t anticipate that changing so long-term trajectory for this vertical, the cost vertical I believe is actually healthy and the products that we’re building with the specific capabilities for this vertical the capabilities in terms of visibility and manageability, controllability are well understood by Juniper and we’re developing our products with the intent of capturing the cloud opportunity in the future. Cable as well can be lumpy, it has been lumpy historically. I think there is consolidation that’s happening in the cable industry that will result in some short-term uncertainty if you will, but the long-term prospects for us in cable I think are quite good. I see routing all up, I think as I mentioned I feel actually quite good about where we are with respect to routing. Bookings were strong, I think the sequential softness in Q3 in North America specifically had to do with timing of projects, a difficult compare relative to Q2 with the revenue recognition event that we had in Q2 that we talked to you about. Visibility is good and the roadmap is excellent.
Robyn Denholm: Thank you so much. Thank you Vijay, and I want to thank each of you for your great questions and your interest in Juniper Networks. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today’s tele-conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Greetings. And welcome to the Juniper Networks Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Nemeth, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Nemeth. You may now begin.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thank you, Operator. And thanks for joining us today to discuss Juniper Networks second quarter financial results and outlook for the third quarter of 2015 which we announced earlier this afternoon. With me today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer and Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial and Operations Officer. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning Juniper's business, economic and market outlook, strategy, future financial operating results, capital return program, and overall future prospects. Actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in these forward-looking statements are listed in our most recent 10-Q, the press release, and in other documents that we file with the SEC from time to time. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances change after the date of the call. Our discussion of the financial results today will include non-GAAP results. Full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. For important commentary on why our management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult the press release furnished with our 8-K filed with the SEC today. Now, I'll turn the call over to Rami.
Rami Rahim: Thanks, Kathleen, and welcome everybody. We delivered a solid second quarter for 2015. Revenue was stronger than the outlook we provided partially as a result of recognition of differed revenue but also as a result of an overall improvement in demand across several of our key customer verticals. I am particularly pleased with the broad diversity of both bookings and revenue in the quarter. Strong operating margin and EPS reflect our ongoing focus on execution and our disciplined approach to managing our expenses while we invest in the future of the company. I am proud of what we’ve accomplished while at the same time mindful that there is still more we can do to achieve our company's full potential. This quarter we unveiled several new products and innovative new addition to the QFX5100 product family of datacenter switching that converges compute resources, and customizable logic into the network. And ultracompact three terabits per second core router the PTX 1000 that achieves unprecedented levels of power efficiency and performance. And we also introduced enhancements to the SRX which make it the industry's fastest firewall that will enable our customers to secure their cloud network without slowing them down. Our priority now is on execution as we expect to begin the first shipments of these new products in the near future. We are investing a next generation IP networking and solutions in ways that help our customers perceive business transformations with profound effects on the cost efficiencies and time to market. By engaging with our customers directly at the engineer-to-engineer level, we've collaborated on solutions that produce the ultimate in agility and automation. Building these relationships has resulted in some exciting new customers this quarter, including some great technology innovators in Silicon Valley. One of which is a fast-growing global transportation network company. We're also pleased with the continued momentum we are seeing with our cloud services customers. It's truly an honor that so many technology pioneers continue to look to Juniper to enable them to build the advanced IP networks that their businesses depend on. I know how proud all of us at Juniper are about this. Let me summarize some highlights this quarter across the routing, switching and security components of our business. While we are excited about the new products we announced this year, this quarter's results reflect strong performance of our current routing portfolio and particularly a record quarter for both the PTX and MX series. In Q2 momentum with the PTX accelerated as customers continue to embrace the architectural thesis behind this product line, which radically increases transport efficiency in any IP wide area network. We have been at the forefront of driving this vision for efficient high performance IP transport. With the MX customers began adopting our recently introduced line card contributing to exceptionally strong MX revenue this quarter. We also secured early orders for all our recently announced edge products, including the ACX5000 and the virtual MX. We are building on the clear success of our edge routing platform across all verticals and leveraging our worldwide market footprint to drive the architectural transition towards virtualization and programmability. We believe our compelling routing solutions with our ongoing execution will continue to drive growth and enable us to take market share. As an example, we had our first revenue customers of the virtual MX in Q2, and furthermore our Northstar WAN SDN controller is in beta trials and is receiving positive field reception. Our Contrail solution has moved into production deployment and is fast becoming the option of choice for OpenStack environments. In switching, we also had a record quarter for the QFX series. We saw good momentum in the data center with broad based strength in the enterprise, as well as growth for cloud providers and carriers. Customers value our switching innovation in the data center, because it helps them stay ahead of their need for scale and performance, while also providing rich Layer 3 capability, deep network visibility and automation. We expect that our high leverage R&D strategy will allow us to easily bring the innovation to our EX product family over the next year for a mission-critical enterprise campus and branch network. In security, I'm pleased with our revenue growth of 15% sequentially and 12% year-over-year, excluding Junos Pulse. Specifically these results were driven by growth in the high end and branch SRX products in cloud data center, mobile carrier and enterprise customer segments. Having said that, there is still a lot of hard work for us to stabilize this element of our business. I continue to expect 2016 to be the year of growth for us in security, and I expect it to be a bit bumpy as we get there. Juniper's integrated network security strategy enables us to be a strong provider of secure network, and we remain confident we can win. However, it will take us time as I stated. We continue to see industries trends unfolding largely as we expected. There is no shortage of demand for network innovation as more and more organizations are turning to the cloud to transform their business and as network traffic growth remains healthy. Our results speak to the fact that our strategy is resonating with our customers, and we will continue to deliver on our vision to be the worldwide leader in network innovation. In closing, we remain steadfast in our commitment to drive profitable long-term growth and increase shareholder value. We continue to execute with a sense of urgency and a disciplined approach to how we manage the business. I am thankful for our customers, partners and stockholders who share our vision and for our outstanding employees who work hardest to help us achieve our success. Now I'll turn it over to Robyn to share her thoughts on the quarter.
Robyn Denholm: Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. Similar to last quarter, we posted my detailed CFO commentary on our website prior to this call. For the second quarter of 2015 we delivered strong financial results which reflected strength in our underlying business and the focused execution to our strategy. Our results succeed in both our revenue and earnings expectations for the quarter with solid sequential growth across routing, switching and security. The following factors contributed to the revenue outperformance this quarter. Revenue recognized from product deferred revenue, the majority of which was due to the delivery of product and feature commitments and a sell-through of channel inventory. Demand was also better than we anticipated in the following areas, cloud and cable providers, enterprise and to a lesser extent a sequential improvement from regional carriers in the Americas. The improved demand was also reflected in security, which had a growth quarter primarily due to the timing of high end SRX deployments. The underlying demand metrics were healthy this quarter with product book-to-bill greater than one. Product backlog increased sequentially and significantly year-over-year. As I mentioned the sequential decline of approximately 19% in product deferred revenue positively contributed to our results this quarter. Our solid execution, focus on revenue growth, effective cost management and a significant reduction in our share count enabled us to deliver strong year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter non-GAAP operating margin and earnings per share expansion. In the quarter we completed $600 million of share repurchases. Since Q1 of 2014, inclusive of share repurchases and dividends, we have returned approximately $3.4 billion of capital to shareholders, against our commitment to return $4.1 billion by the end of 2016. Now let's take a look at some of the underlying assumptions behind our outlook for Q3 and the demand environment in the second half of 2015. Industry trends continue to unfold largely as we expected. There is obviously some uncertainty around the macro environment, conditions in China and certain parts of Europe. We have factored into our outlook continued weakness in China and ongoing softness in the relative exchange rate of the euro. Consistent with our view last quarter we anticipate an improvement in our revenue in the second half of 2015 relative to both the second half of 2014 and the first half of 2015, and this is based on the following assumption. We expect continued diversification of our revenue with cloud and cable customers and improved demand from large US carriers. We also expect continued improvement in the enterprise market along with growth from some of our international customers as they continue to build out their networks. You can find the detailed outlook for Q3 in the CFO commentary available on our website. In summary, I'm pleased with our strong performance in Q2, and I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. I now, I would like to open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Rod Hall of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Rod Hall: Yes. Hi, guys. And thanks for taking my question. Nice quarter as well. So I wanted to start off I guess by asking you about the deferred revenue a little bit and see if you guys could dig into that in just a little more detail, maybe give us some idea of what product categories the deferred revenue was released on. As well as I guess Robyn in the guidance, could you talk a little bit about do you expect another release of deferred revenue next quarter or is that more organic revenue growth that you're guiding for? And I've got a follow-up.
Robyn Denholm: Thanks, Rod. I'll answer that question and if Rami has anything to add I'm sure he'll chime in. On the deferred revenue as you know on the balance sheet we have services in product deferred revenue. Our product deferred revenue quarter-over-quarter was down about $48 million. Some of which obviously we were expecting and anticipated in the guidance, and some of which we didn't. So I wanted to call out the fact that we did see some upside in terms of the quarter’s absolute results that came off the balance sheet. Having said that, we are very, very pleased with the underlying demand and so as you can see our demand metrics are very healthy for the quarter, both in terms of product book-to-bill, but also in terms of the overall strength across the routing, switching and security areas and in the fact that the backlog is up significantly year-over-year. So primarily the product deferred revenue in terms of guidance for Q3, obviously we always have projects that we are delivering and new projects that come on to the balance sheet, as well as future features that we're delivering through our software releases. And so for Q3 we don't expect a material change in terms of any further recognition. The other thing that I wanted to point out, in Q2 part of the reduction in product deferred revenue was associated with the channel. So as you know we record revenue on a sell-through basis. In terms of the channel inventory at the end of the quarter it was actually quite healthy demand in the enterprise space which we talked about, which actually resulted in some of the deferred revenue reduction in the quarter.
Rod Hall: Okay. Thanks, Robyn. And I - just my follow up. Well, okay. Can I have a follow up or no?
Robyn Denholm: Switch over to next question.
Rod Hall: Okay.
Kathleen Nemeth: No, no. Let's go to next question, and we'll circle back if we have time. Thanks, Rod. Next question?
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Simona Jankowski: Hi. Thanks very much. I just wanted to ask you in terms of just the – performance for the company, now this is the third quarter, would it been raised and that's before you've had the Tier 1 carriers kicking in, in terms of the anticipated improvement in the second half, and also before you test some of the recent product launches kick in as well. So I just wanted to understand a little bit how much of this is a function of the end demand environment versus your own execution versus any other factors you might point to?
Rami Rahim: Okay. Great. Thanks for the question Simona. I'll start and I'll see if Robyn has anything to add. Obviously we were pleased with the results in Q2 and I think there are a couple of underlying themes that are indicative of what we saw. First and foremost is the continued diversity in our business across a number of key verticals that have offset continued weakness in the telcos space. So cloud, cable were kite strong for us in Q2, but we're also seeing good business in terms of large enterprises and some of these, we call a high-tech companies in the Valley and elsewhere. The other thing that we saw happening in Q2 is just around the diversification across product lines. We saw sequential growth, healthy sequential growth across switching, routing and security. So all of that helped offset some of the cyclicality that would exist in the business. And your question around the second half is essentially largely playing out as we have been articulating over the last several quarters, where we expect to see some improvement in telco, but we have not been waiting for that improvement to come ideally. We have been in a mode of actively focusing on making sure that we have the products and the go to market focus to continue to diversify the business and that's what's helping – and I expect that to continue to help into the second half. As you get even beyond the second half, you know you mentioned the new products. We remain extremely excited about the new products that we announced in the Q1 timeframe. But those are not going to be significant contributors to revenue this year. Those really start to contribute next year. And that's yet another way that we help offset some of the cyclicality that exist in the business.
Robyn Denholm: Yes. Just to add and Rami said it very well. We are pleased with the results in the quarter. We are also pleased with the previous two quarters as you mentioned. But we're not confused. We are still down year-to-date on a revenue basis year-over-year and there is still a lot of work to do. So the team is focused on doing that, they are delivering. The execution is very good from the team across the board and I've seen Rami talked about some of the underlying trends that we're executing towards. So I think overall we're pleased with the health of the business.
Simona Jankowski: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Tal Liani of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Tal Liani: Hi, guys. Two questions. First is about the operating margin. 25% this quarter, 25.2% very high, what's the target, what's the next target and how do you think about it next year, how much upside? And again if you cannot give a quantitative guidance, maybe you can just speak about the puts and takes in what drives it up, what drives it down, so we know how to better model this. Second question is about the strength this quarter. Again, it's a question that I can ask on a quantitative way or qualitative. And the question is how much of the growth is pent-up demand, meaning customers are waiting for new product for a while and there is concentrated orders in one quarter, two quarters et cetera and after that it normalizes down. And how much of it is more about you finally having something and then the opportunities are wide and big and it opens up new market et cetera? So I'm trying to understand the sustainability of what we are seeing this quarter? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Okay. Hey, Tal. This is Rami. So let me start and then I will pass it over to Robyn. On the operating margin, we remain committed to our long-term model that we expressed to you guys in October of last year, which is 25% in a 3 year timeframe. Yes, we hit 25% in the Q2 time frame. I don't expect it to be consistently that in - throughout the 3 year period. It might ebb and flow a little bit as it gets there, but 25% in a 3 year timeframe remains our long-term model. In terms of the question around the strength of the business, pent-up demand. There isn't really anything that would suggest it was pent-up demand that all got released on a new product or a new market opportunity. In fact, what we saw as we mentioned in our prepared remarks was strength across a number of our key product lines, the MX the PTX the QFX all of which had record products. We've been investing and innovating in all three product lines. We've been consistently introducing new line cards, new features and new capabilities. We've been winning new business with them throughout all of last year and the last couple quarters of this year. And what you're seeing now is the - that execution playing out in terms of strength. So I don't think there is a sort of pent-up demand element that we're seeing right now, that resulted in the strength in Q2. It's just solid execution on the part of the Juniper team.
Robyn Denholm: Yes. I'll just add on the operating margin comment. We are pleased with hitting 25.2% in the quarter. Our view is that it shows the strength of the model. We've been very disciplined on the cost side as Rami indicated. We've obviously taken out structural costs over the last year. We're investing in the right product areas and the team is continuing to do that. But we're also demonstrating that there's a lot of leverage in this model. If we get some upside in the revenue or some good growth in the revenue and we are up year-over-year, if you exclude the Junos Pulse acquisition from the Q2 results of last year, albeit modestly up and a lot of that dropped to the bottom line. The other part of that which I'm sure you've noticed is that we are headed towards our 39% of revenue from an OpEx perspective, which again as Rami mentioned we're committed to doing, and we made very good progress for that this year. So there's a long way to go before we hit what we stated last year in terms of the overall business model, but we're pleased with the progress.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thanks, Tal. Next question?
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Amitabh Passi of UBS. Please go ahead.
Amitabh Passi: Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Rami you mentioned PTX a few times in the call today. I was just curious is this incremental demand from existing customers, are you seeing your footprint significantly expand? Maybe you should give us some clarity on the demand drivers. And then Robyn, just quickly on OpEx, should we now expect OpEx at the upper end of your $1.9 billion plus or minus $25 million for this year.
Rami Rahim: Okay. Thanks, Amitabh. So on the PTX question, I think that it's both. Its what we're seeing is business where we had already been deployed now expanding with some of the newer line cards and capabilities we've introduced into that product line. We're also seeing new or use cases across different verticals, so I will say for example the PTX because of its power efficiency and just the sheer scale has started to become adopted by the cloud provider customers. They love that sort of technology and transport efficiency in that product line. And I continue to believe that it will strengthen over time. Keep in mind that we're about to introduce pretty incredible enhancements to it. The announcements that we announced in the Q1 timeframe, that triple the performance and reduce the power even further. And there is a certain segment of our customers that just love that type of capability. And I'll pass it on to Robyn for the OpEx question.
Robyn Denholm: Thanks, Rami. So on the OpEx side, as I mentioned in response to the last question about the operating margin. We are very committed to prudent cost management over the future, as we've demonstrated over the last year. Our long-term model is to grow OpEx well within revenue and we've done - we've obviously been taking out OpEx at a faster rate than our revenue declines over the last period of time. We are below the last few quarters in terms of the percentage of revenue. We've been above 40% in Q1 in the back half of last year in terms of OpEx as a percentage of revenue and we're headed toward the area that we outlined in October of last year of 39%. So our view is that the business is strong and healthy as we mentioned before. We put out the $1.9 billion plus or minus $25 million at this time last year and we've executed to that very, very well. As we move forward, as we start to see revenue growth, then we expect to be towards that 39% of revenue in terms of OpEx. And so you could say there are certain scenarios where you could see us be slightly above the 19, 25 [ph] but it would be as a result of revenue factors and that would be on variable comp, as opposed to investing more dollars. It would be around that variable nature of the cost that we've been speaking about for some time.
Rami Rahim: Let me just emphasize that point. If in fact we do see that we start to get to the top end of our OpEx range or even beyond that it, it will not be because we will take our eye off the ball in terms of OpEx management, it will only because – it will be because of the variable comp element that's tied to revenue. And at that point, I would just say that the focus should anyways tilt towards profitability and specifically OpEx as a percentage of revenue, which this quarter or in Q2 was below 40%.
Amitabh Passi: Excellent. Thank you, guys.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thanks, Amitabh. Next question please?
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Mark Sue of RBC. Please go ahead.
Mark Sue: Thank you. Are we now at the point where we're making significant investment of this is the portfolio, how should we think about the switching side, continued investments there and how should we also think about security. We're seeing a balance after many quarters of declines, and particularly if you can give us a sense of how customers are resonating with a combined solution for both switching and tying that with security, what landscape that continues to live up that would be helpful?. Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Sure. Thanks for the question Mark. On the switching side I'm really pleased with the progress that the team has made. From a go-to market standpoint, we continue to see more traction, both in terms of service providers in the enterprise side. I have said in the past that we have been competing in this space without a complete portfolio that includes our spine switches and that has limited the total addressable market opportunity for us. That's largely now being addressed this year with a new series of QFX spine switches that we will start to introduce. So that I think is going to help us maintain and improve the momentum over time. Now it takes time for our customers to evaluate test - fully test and certify these new spine switches. But so far the early feedback from our customers is very positive And your question around the portfolio itself that includes switching, routing and securities is actually a very good one, it is in fact a muscle that we're building in the organization and a clear strategy of ours to talk to our customers around cloud architecture as opposed to just switching in a silo. We're doing all of our training around that and it's resonating with our customers, and we've seen, especially in terms of security, there is this incredible opportunity to leverage insights that comes from switching and routing in the cloud that can help your overall security posture and also leverage your switching and routing in the cloud to install policies that can prevent the tax from spreading if and when they actually occur. So that portfolio sale is very much part of our strategy and all the sings are that it's actually working quite effectively.
Kathleen Nemeth: Great. Thanks Mark. Next question, please.
Operator: Thank you, the next question is from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Q – Jess Lubert: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question congratulations on a strong quarter. My question is also for Rami, and I also wanted to dig into the portfolio cell, and specifically this is the first quarter in a long time where we're seeing switching, routing and security, all see very strong sequential results in the same quarter. So, I was hoping you could help us understand to what degree this is due to an uptick in customers buying a portfolio of your products and perhaps you can help us understand the pipeline you're seeing of large multi product deals, the sales efforts here and to what extent you're seeing a competitive advantage from taking a multi product base selling approach?
A – Rami Rahim: Right, I think it's still early days and there is still a lot more potential for us if you will, of leveraging portfolio selling to actually improve the overall results across all the different product line. So that exists today, it existed in the past but what we're doing right now is we're essentially doubling down on the marketing, the collateral, the sales training that will actually in fact help us make this the key differentiator for us. The other thing that we're doing is we're implementing features. So for example, some of the tie in between security, and switching, routing I just mentioned in the answer to the previous question, requires certain capabilities that you actually build into these product lines. There are definitely -- I don't know the exact percentages that I can answer your question with, but there are definitely large opportunities that we have won both in the enterprise and in the service provider, but where it has been portfolio that some combinations of our products. In Q2, strength in switching and in routing is anticipated, I think the momentum there is solid because of the strength of our portfolio in each of those segment. In security, we still have more work to do. There is -- we saw a good quarter I think because of the fact that we had great opportunities and revenue in both enterprise and SP, but I think there could be a little bit of a bumpy ride as I mentioned in my prepared remarks before we get to sustained growth in 2016.
Q – Jess Lubert: Thanks guys.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thanks Jess.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Brian White of Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
Brian White: Yeah, Rami, I'm wondering if you could just update us on what you're seeing right now in terms of appetite for NFE and SDN solutions here, and how you're thinking about it going into the next year? Thanks.
A – Rami Rahim: Sure Brian, it's definitely part of pretty much every strategic discussion that we have with any one of our -- especially service provider customers, in some cases also in the enterprise base, but mostly on the service provider side. Right now it's very much an architectural discussion of what's needs to evolve within the service provider network locations, what we call central offices or PoPs as to set their infrastructure up in order to be capable of delivering next generation services using NFV. For us what it means is, first you need to develop great VNS, virtual network function. It's our software services that will be delivered off the cloud, and we're doing just that. So we just recognized our first revenue in the virtual MX in the Q2 time frame, and the virtual SRX is also a really great example of taking what is a physical product and take and using or leveraging all of the great functionality but repurposing to virtual machines sitting on generic server. Those VNS and that architecture, that's only part of the problem. In order to really package the solution together you need to have automation and orchestration and the management to help our customers actually deliver these services with agility and with ease to their end users. And this where product like Contrail comes in, and most service providers that we're seeing are gravitating toward an OpenStack based orchestration solution, our goal for Contrail is simple, to make it the best networking stack for OpenStack. And I have to say that the data we're getting directly from our customers but also through surveys. for example, that were conducted at the OpenStack forum just a few weeks ago suggest that we are heading in the right direction in terms of achieving that goal. So it's still early days in summer, but I feel very good about the discussions we're having, the products we're building, the way that we're executing, and the go to market attention we have in terms of just making sure that we emerge as true winners in this space.
Brian White: That was good, thank you.
Operator: Thank you, the next question is from Sanjiv Wadhwani of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Sanjiv Wadhwani: Thanks, just one clarification and then a question. On the clarification, Robyn remind us if you've disclosed exposure to the cloud vertical as to percentage of revenues coming from there. And then Rami, a question for you, wondering how much of the underlying demand in the telco vertical, whether it's happened or it's coming is from 10 to 100 gig upgrades, and if that's happening, where we are in that cycle, in that upgrade cycle? Thanks.
Robyn Denholm: So, thanks Sanjiv. In terms of the percentage of revenue, we haven't put out the overall mix in terms of percentage of revenue since Q3 of last year. We will look to possibly do that in the next period of time. Having said that, what I will share with you, like I did last quarter is the number of customers and our top 10 customers in the quarter. So for Q2, our top 10 customers, four were telco, two were in the U.S. and two were not in the U.S. Five were cloud and cable customers, and one was the large enterprise customer. And so if you recall last quarter, there was one more telco customer and one less cloud and cable customer in the top 10. What I will also say is you know this underlying same as diversification is absolutely real in terms of that number of customers that we have in each one of the areas that we're talking about, both in terms of telco, not only U.S. but also international. The regional carriers as I mentioned in my prepared remarks today or in my commentary, were actually good for us in the U.S. in the second quarter. And so the diversification is they are across all of the different verticals as well as within the vertical how many customers we're serving, and then also the third element of geographic diversification.
A – Rami Rahim: And Sanjiv, on your question around 10 to 100 gig migration and that helping with momentum in the telco space. I think that has actually, largely started in certain network layers of the service provider space a while back in the wide area network, and the metro networks and we certainly benefited from that to some extent.  But beyond that, I think it will continue and it will move into different use cases and applications. Cloud providers for example, loved the fact that our security portfolio, the high end SRX actually supports 100 gig interfaces to connect their clouds to the wide area network and when it comes to 100 gig interfaces on a firewall, that we're the only game in town. Really, so that's the use cases have actually became a very good use case for us. And then certainly there is a migration that's happening in the core of the datacenter as well that we are taking advantage of. I don't think that there was any sort of a step function change anytime recently. I think this is an ongoing transformation that's happening across the SP space and the cloud space and the cable space that we'll continue to take advantage of.
Sanjiv Wadhwani: Got it, thank you, helpful.
Robyn Denholm: Thanks Sanjiv.
Operator: Thank you, the next question is from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
James Faucette: Thanks very much. I just wanted to ask two questions, first Rami, I think you've mentioned a couple of times that or always that there were record product revenues at least in some of the product families. Just if you could elaborate and clarify that, and then Robyn, you may have mentioned this but I apologize if I missed it, but just wondering if you could give a little insight as to what's happening in Asia and kind of the reason that geography seemed under perform a little bit some of the others and how you're thinking about that going into the second half of the year, I think you've said you tried to model that conservatively but just a little bit more color there would be helpful thank you?
A – Rami Rahim: Okay, thanks James. Let me start on the record product question and then I'll pass it over to Robyn to comment on the Asia question. Yes, so we did say and that is a fact that three of our product lines our flagship product, The MX, the PTX, QFX, all has record revenue quarters in the Q2 time frame
Robyn Denholm: [indiscernible] services by the way.
A – Rami Rahim: Thanks for the reminder, and each for a different reason. The MX has always been a very successful product, and we continue to invest in that platform to keep ahead of the demand for capacity, but also the demand for services. The thesis pieces behind the MX was all around conversions, is around simplifying your edge architecture by deploying a single platform that can deliver all services. I think we were pioneers in articulating that thesis and executing that strategy, and we've benefited from that, and we've introduced new line in card, new capabilities to actually make this more of a reality and we certainly saw the results in Q2. PTX, this is a product line that we knew when we initially shipped it would require a bit of a different mindset around how to develop and build out a next generation core architecture, we called it the super core. And this requires a bit of a different approach to how one might in fact architect a wide area core, or a wide are metro network. And quite frankly it took us a bit a time, took us some time to make sure our customers were educated on the transformation that's required but also on the benefit that they could reap from this architecture, and I'm very happy that we're seeing sort of that transition happened and we are starting to see faster growth from the PTX, that proves that the pieces that we had made initially was the right one. QFX, this is -- first again, we continue to add new capabilities to our QFX topper bracts, which is in our access switches, but we're also just from a go to market stand point, been focusing quite heavily on our datacenter opportunities, our cloud opportunities, and that's where the growth in the market is and that's where the differentiation that we have in the QFX in terms of things like the layer 3 capabilities, really start to become very effective and the results are that we saw a great quarter for the QFX.
Robyn Denholm: So, let me talk about APAC, and Rami can chime in as. So APAC, we did have a disappointing quarter there. The revenues were down 10% year-over-year and 3% quarter-over-quarter. We were anticipating a softness in China. And in my outlook I mentioned that I expect that to continue. Some of it is obviously geopolitical and also competitive factors in China. If we excluded China, actually the revenues would have been up for the rest of the APAC, 11% sequentially. So, we've talked previously about -- obviously about different regions within Asia Pacific, we're seeing good design wins and growth in the Asian countries, Malaysia, and Singapore, obviously Indonesia, we have seen some good wins in India. Although that market, we're continuing to increase our capabilities in. In terms of the New Zealand operations in Q2, had a good quarter. Japan was slightly soft but actually not bad overall and the -- Korea was slightly negative as well. But 10 to go more inline with service providers deployment just given the concentration that we have in those market around service provider. So our view is, in terms of the region we're making progress in a lot of different areas. China was weak in the quarter and we expected to be weak as we move forward.
Kathleen Nemeth: Okay. Thanks, James. Next question?
Operator: Yes. The next question is from Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Ittai Kidron: Thanks. And congrats on a good quarter. I had a couple questions for you Robyn. First on the deferred revenue, again going back to that. I understand that revenue came off the deferred into the revenue. But why is it that you’re long-term deferred is the one part that’s actually been declining on a year-over-year basis for three quarters in a row into high teens, what does that mean, what's going on there. And the second question goes back to the question Tal asked before, you've effectively touched on your long-term target right now, are you now at a mode where you are hiring, you are net hiring on a year-over-year basis. Do you feel that you've been running a little bit too hot, meaning the revenue relative to the employee base that you have that you need to ramp. I understand that your long-term you wanted to clearly drive revenue faster than OpEx. But is there a three fourth quarter period where is there a little bit of a catch-up, if you've gone a little bit too far maybe?
Robyn Denholm: So let me talk about deferred revenue. So, long-term deferred revenue is primarily services. So we do service contract renewals on a one year and a three year basis. And depending on the customer, depending on whether they a renew on a one year or three-year basis. And so the declines that you've seen are in the long-term are specifically to do with the proportion of three year versus one year at any point in time. So obviously three year customers it will come down before they renew again for three years. And so that's what you've been seeing fleet off on the long-term. There isn't anything more than that in the long-term deferred revenue. And so when those renew you will see that long-term actually increase again. In terms of hiring, I put the headcount numbers in my actual commentary. So we ended this quarter at 8,815 head [ph] modestly up from the prior quarter. The team is being very focused on how we actually continue to invest in the things that matter, around the product portfolio and that type of thing. I'm not expecting a catch-up in terms of headcount or significant increase in headcount. We're managing things very well and quite honestly the teams are very productive, the way we are.
Rami Rahim: Yes. The only thing I'll add is, we have what we need in the plan that we're working towards this year to invest in all the areas of innovation that we know we need to invest in for the - our long-term competitiveness in the spaces that we're in.
Robyn Denholm: Yes. That was something very conscious that we did – at this time of taking out the structural cost.
Kathleen Nemeth: Okay. Thanks, Ittai.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Kulbinder Garcha: Thanks. Maybe a question for Rami. By basic question is, given all the products and the success you are seeing across various different verticals. Do you think by the end of this year that Juniper will be in a stage where will be sufficiently diversified you wouldn't have years of touch on longer periods of revenue declines, you would have diversify, especially away from service provider cycle or that require a little bit longer of trying to understand the timing of it? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Thanks for the question, Kulbinder. I think this - the strategy that we're on and the focus across the key vertical segments, cloud, cable, telco's, financial services, government, is one that I think has a lot of list. I mean, the opportunity for us in cable for example or in cloud appears to be very good and sustainable. I know for example, let me just tick on one vertical in the cloud space where we are very, very close to them in terms of the architectural evolution of their network today, but also in the future and also in terms of the capabilities, the features, the performance, the scalability that we are implementing into our new products that will be released over the coming year and beyond. It's just a function of our strategy and I think that it's something that can actually play out for a long period of time. Very difficult to put a time period on it, but it is not something that I see as an immediate or short term end to.
Kulbinder Garcha: Thank you.
Kathleen Nemeth: Okay, great. Thanks, Kulbinder. We'll go to the next question.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Vijay Bhagavath: Yes, thanks. Yes, congratulations Rami to new team, solid results. Quick question if I may, is on the Web 2.0 cloud customer segment, more recently we have been hearing Arista and perhaps Cisco starting to leverage new merchant silicon for routing, in particular data center routing which could soon scale up into the core telco network? So like to get your understanding of the competitive dynamics that you see from your point of view from a pricing point of view mainly and also from a feature performance point of view competing with these news merchant silicon Layer 3 switch routers versus what you have currently in your portfolio with MX and PTX? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Sure, Vijay. So clearly – first let me just say this. We use both merchant and also our own silicon across the variety of products in switching and routing and in security. We are absolutely not going to be religious about using our own or somebody else's. We're going to choose the best silicon and to solve the problem in the most effective and differentiated way possible. And before we embark on a new silicon project ourselves at Juniper, we go through very extensive analysis to make sure that it is in fact something that’s going to differentiate us and therefore pay off because these chip projects as you know are not inexpensive projects, and we've done exactly that. If you look at the cloud space for example, the access layer where it really comes down to pricing not that much differentiation in certain market segments. You can easily go to commodity. As you get into the core the need for power efficiency programmability, the need for logical scale, IP routing capabilities becomes greater. And so the opportunity to differentiate with your own silicon becomes evident or becomes theirs. And so that's what we've - essentially what we have done. In the competitive environment, we understand. I mean, this is a competitive space and both from the standpoint of systems vendors that are using merchant or their own silicon and also from the standpoint of merchant silicon technology that's out there. And as long as we are innovating and focusing on the parts of the market where we know that we can achieve differentiation then that's what we will do, we'll choose the best tools and technologies for the right areas of the network.
Kathleen Nemeth: Okay. Thanks, Vijay. Next question please?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Subu Subramanian of Hinduja Group [ph]. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. Rami, my question was around visibility around the Tier1 carrier improvement that you've been mentioning and expecting for second half. Obviously September quarter guidance is a little bit more flat quarter-over-quarter, are you expecting towards fourth quarter more normal seasonality and is that when we should start seeing the US Tier 1 carriers improved. Could you talk about the outlook for the US Tier 1 carriers?
Robyn Denholm: Subu, let me just make sure I correct something that I hope people understand that the guidance for Q3 and then I'll hand it over to Rami on the visibility question. So you mentioned the word flat Q3 to Q2. Actually it's up. So the way I want you to think about it is, if you take out of Q2 results, the deferred revenue impact it's on all of the $48 million, a large portion of that and then you actually look at that versus the guidance. What you'll see is that we are actually projecting an increase quarter-over-quarter in the underlying business. More consistent actually with what we've seen historically when we've had growth years in terms of Q3 over Q2. So with that I'll hand it to Rami to talk about the visibility.
Rami Rahim: Sure. First, I just want to emphasize the fact that, while the telco space remains a very important vertical for us, we are by no means tied completely to that space in terms of what drives our business. The diversification across the vertical and across products is certainly helping us in dampening if you will some of the effects of the lumpiness in that space. As far as the second half, it really is consistent with what we have been saying over the last several quarters. We expect to see some improvement, but that's going to be complemented with continued diversity. That's going to help us achieve the results that we're expecting for the second half.
Unidentified Analyst: Understood. Thank you.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thank you. I think we have time for maybe one or two more questions. So next question operator?
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Paul Silverstein of Cowen. Please go ahead.
Paul Silverstein: Thanks. I appreciate you taking my question. First off just housekeeping, were there any 10% customers? Secondly, if you already said it, I apologize, but what was the – what pricing environment are seeing both on the service, prior to routing side, as well in enterprise switching. And then question I have listened and I've heard your comments here in terms of the diversification of the business. But I'm just wondering to what extent is the strength you are seeing now in you expect in the future, to what extent is that project driven and competitive dynamics, were you having greater success with the new platforms et cetera? And to what extent are you seeing an improvement in demand. Obviously there is been quite a number of data points about enterprise weakness from others throughout the IT spectrum. And again I'm wondering to what extent is this in demand versus the project? Thank you.
Robyn Denholm: Okay. Paul, I'll handle the first couple of questions and then Rami can chime in. So in terms of 10% customers there weren't no 10% customers in the quarter. What was the second question…
Rami Rahim: Pricing.
Robyn Denholm: Pricing. So in terms of the pricing environment, obviously it's a consistently competitive environment globally. But as you saw from the gross margins we had pretty healthy product gross margins, which reflects not only the ongoing competitiveness of the portfolio, but also the cost reductions that we continue to focus on in the supply chain. So from our perspective no discernible difference in the competitive dynamics in the quarter.
Rami Rahim: On the question around market versus projects and I am assuming you are really asking about whether something specific to Juniper in the projects we're engaging and versus something that's more broader. It really depends and in some cases it’s very difficult for us to tell really. But in the cloud space for example in our switching, what you are seeing there is more of the market opportunity shifting towards the data center. So we ourselves as a company are diverting more of our intentions, especially on the go to market side, on the support side to that opportunity and benefiting from the growth in that market segment. I think in other verticals, like maybe in the cloud space it actually could be more project driven. It could be more of a market share phenomenon that's happening because we have traditionally been really strong and very close to that vertical and something that's paying off for us. So it's a mix and difficult to really break out in any precise detail.
Robyn Denholm: And Paul, I just want to make sure the telco customers are important customers to us as well. We're not saying that we are diversifying away from the customers. They are important. They will continue to be important. Having said that, the innovation that we're delivering is as relevant to other parts of the market and through the changes that Rami mentioned in terms of not just the portfolio, but also the go to market notion. We're actually driving revenue growth through those other verticals as well. So I think that's a very important point. And I think earlier in the questions there was the comment around cyclicality. There's no question one of the reasons why we decided to work on the go to market muscle in terms of some of these other verticals was exactly to that reason to offset some of that cyclicality as we move forward.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thanks, Paul. Operator, we have time for one more question.
Operator: Certainly. Our final question comes from Jeff Kvaal of Nomura. Please go ahead.
Jeff Kvaal: Fantastic. Great.
Robyn Denholm: Hi, Jeff.
Jeff Kvaal: Hi, everyone. Thank you. I think one of the things that you folks have hit on in some of your commentary about the routing market is the blurring of the line between the core and the edge. Can you help us understand in a little bit more detail about what that means for you, I think at a high level one might say okay great, you can use your strengths in the quarter to improve your share in the edge. But then conversely one might wonder if Alcatel [ph] act, which has some presence in the edge may have a broader addressable market for them for example?
Rami Rahim: Yes. Thanks for the question Jeff. I guess the diversity what it means or sorry the blurring what it means for us is that when we go and develop our products we develop them in such a way that we becomes somewhat agnostic as to where in fact they will be placed to deal with the massive amount of IP transport traffic. In some areas in might be in more of a nationwide or even a global network, in some areas it might be more of a metro network. What's happening today architecturally is data centers in some cases are being built in more distributed locations, which puts more pressure in the metro areas and in some cases then more central locations that will put more pressure in the core areas. If we build the products that will deal with either architectural case then we win either way and that's exactly the goal. So take for example our PTX product line. It comes in a large and medium and now with the PTX1000 a small form factor and that's a perfect example of how we are building these products and the capabilities of these products to address interest the issue of scale or the challenge of scale, irrespective the architecture that the customer ultimately wants to sell. It makes more difficult for us to break out, our numbers into core and edge we can sort of estimate it. But I sort of tend to measure ourselves now as more as routing all up in the wide area network as opposed to specific to core edge.
Jeff Kvaal: Okay. Would that be misstating to you to say it becomes easier for you to sell the architectural play and therefore you think it's an advantage relative to some people who traditionally have been stronger just in one or the other?
Rami Rahim: I would agree with that. Yes.
Jeff Kvaal: Okay. All right. Okay, good. Thank you all very much.
Rami Rahim: Thank you.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thanks, Jeff. Thank you everyone. This will conclude our call for today. Thank you as always for your great questions. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And thank you for your participation.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Nemeth, Vice President of Investor Relations for Juniper. Thank you, Ms. Nemeth. You may now begin.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thank you, Operator. Good afternoon. And thanks for joining us on today’s call. Earlier this afternoon, we announced our first quarter results and outlook for the second quarter of 2015. Also shortly after the issuance of our financial results press release, we posted to the IR section of our website financial commentary by Robyn Denholm, Our Chief Financial and Operations Officer. We have also furnished this commentary to the SEC on form 8-K. We hope you find this new format helpful and we welcome your feedback. With me today are today are Rami Rahim, Chief Executive Officer; and Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial and Operations Officer. Today's call may contain certain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning Juniper's business, economic and market outlook, strategy, future financial operating results, capital return program, and overall future prospects. Actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are listed in our most recent 10-Q and the press release furnished with our 8-K filed with the SEC today. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances change after the date of the call. Our discussion of the financial results today will include non-GAAP results. Full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information can be found on the IR section of our website. As a reminder unless otherwise noted, revenue growth rates have been normalized for the sale of Junos Pulse. For important commentary on why our management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult the press release furnished with our 8-K filed with the SEC today. Now, I'll hand the call over to Rami.
Rami Rahim: Thanks, Kathleen, and welcome everyone. We delivered solid results for the first quarter of 2015 exceeding our guided ranges. Our strong year of your expansion in non-EPS reflects our continued focus in operational discipline and is a testament to our proven ability to execute on our strategy. We are making significant progress against our key initiatives and we remain steadfast in achieving our outlook realizing Juniper’s full potential. Industry fundamentals are unfolding largely as we anticipated. Based on our visibility and our discussions with customers, we continue to expect an improvement in demand in the second half of 2015. It has been a busy Q1 at Juniper and I’m proud of what we’ve accomplished in the past few months. We’ve organized our R&D team to innovate as a start-up and unveil the compelling line-up of new products and solutions across routing, switching and security that address real problems faced by our customers and that will make a meaningful difference in the connected world we live in today. We’ve been listening closely to what our customers tell us they need and a reception from those that I have had early access to these new products has been very positive. Our customers truly value our mission of creating solutions that offer performance and advanced automation capabilities without compromising on scale and reliability. We are enabling our customers to deliver new revenue generating services and a better experience to their customers. I am energized by all the new opportunities our investments and innovations will make possible. I will now comment briefly on highlights from routing, switching, and security in the first quarter. In routing, we are generally pleased with our execution and progress. Despite the expected sequential and year-over-year decline we still see growth opportunities in routing all out. The diversity of our customers across our focus verticals continues to help offset weakness in U.S. carrier spending. Cloud providers and cable operators continue to be highlights for us and we are pleased to see solid progress with large enterprise customers such as those in our governments vertical that is opting our routing and SDN solution. Regionally, EMEA returned to year-over-year growth in Q1 and we started to see traction from some key customers in APAC. In the first quarter, we announced enhancements to the PTX product line that make it the highest performing IPU routing platform in the market. Three times that of the closest competitor, empowered by Juniper’s new ExpressPlus silicon. Coupled with our NorthStar WAN SDN controller, I am confident that we will be well positioned to take routing market share once these products fully ramp. In switching, we are pleased that our mid-to-high end data center business was strong in the first quarter. So, our overall product revenue was down. We expect to continue to grow in the data center with our sales focus and new line of QFX spine switches, which will be the highest performance switches on the market. These switches can deliver unprecedented scale and port density to all types of data center and cloud deployment. Coupled with contrail and our partnership with VMware, we are well equipped with highly automated cloud data center solutions for both service provider and mission-critical enterprise network. Moving to security, we know we still have work to do to return to growth in this area of our business. Starting in early February, we outlined for customers our expected product direction over the next 18 months illustrating our commitment to offering demand level solutions to have a strong element of security. Our customers understand the criticality of securing the networks we provide and the roadmap was well-received. Just last week, we announced the in-speeds fastest firewall with 2 terabits per second of performance ideal for bandwidth intensive mobile deployment, as well as large cloud data centers. We are getting in front of our customers security challenges and we remain focused on areas where we can win. Service has deserved a quick recap as well. We saw a year-over-year increase in service revenue driven by new service contract and strong contract renewal. We continue to help customers through their next-generation network architectures and with the transition towards service agility and automation. Now to take a step back, the continued expansion of cloud computing and the mobile Internet has broad implications for the technology industry as a whole and for networking innovation in particular. There is tremendous opportunity for us to deliver on our vision of being the worldwide leader in the network innovation. We believe the industry needs a technology provider that is maniacally focused on IP networking, that's Juniper, that's what we do every day. We are squarely focused on solving our customers’ toughest networking challenges with superior products and services that transform the economics of networking through high performance and automation. And we have strong relationships with our customers and a robust growth global partner ecosystem that we believe will enable us to win in the marketplace. Our sharpen strategy and focus go-to-market model have come together to drive real competitive advantage for us. We are executing on our vision to be a worldwide leader of network innovation. We remain resolute in our focus to drive comparable profitable long-term growth and increase shareholder value. As we continue on our course, I want to thank our customers, our shareholders and our nearly 9000 passionate and hard-working employees for their ongoing support. Now I’ll return to over to Robyn, who will review a few highlights of the quarter.
Robyn Denholm: Thank you Rami and good afternoon everyone. Before I begin I would like to point out that we posted my detailed CFO commentary on our website prior to this call. For the first quarter of 2015, we delivered good year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin and earnings per share expansion, reflecting continued management of our cost structure and a significant reduction in our share count, while driving innovation and remaining focused on our growth strategy. We exceeded our revenue guidance range due to slightly better demand from our Cloud, Cable and European Service Providers, which points to the continued strength in the diversification of our customer base. Our underlying demand metrics were healthy this quarter with an increase in both total and product deferred revenue and a book-to-bill greater than 1. We continue to deliver on our capital return program. In the quarter, we repurchased $400 million of shares and we are reaffirming our commitment to repurchase a total of $1 billion of shares from January through June of 2015. Additionally, in the quarter we completed a $600 million bond offering enabling us to execute on our total capital return of $4.1 billion to shareholders through 2016. I’d like to provide our perspective on the proposed merger between Nokia and Alcatel-Lucent as it relates to the Juniper business. Our partners are a key component of our go-to-market strategies. The majority of that revenue is either resold or distributed through our partners. We have a good relationship with Nokia and in 2014, they resold approximately $190 million of Juniper products and services. Our strategy is to be the worldwide leader in network innovation and to deliver products and services that really matter to our customers. Irrespective of the router market, we have direct relationships with our large end-user customers. Moving on to the foreign currency fluctuations, the pricing environment remains competitive and we take into account currency fluctuations in our pricing strategy. As a reminder, we primarily price an invoice in U.S. dollars. And as a result, we have not seen a significant translation impact on our revenue from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. On the cost side and the balance sheet, we have a hedging program in place to reduce the variability associated with currency fluctuations. Now, let’s take a look at some of various assumptions behind our outlook for Q2 and the demand environment for the second half of 2015. We expect continued momentum from our cloud and cable customers. We also expect further growth throughout the year from our international customers as they continue to build out the network. In addition to these trends, we expect an improvement in demand from our large U.S. carrier customers in the second half of the year. Based on all of these factors, we expect to see an improvement in our revenue in the second half of 2015 relative to both the second half of 2014 and the first half of 2015. You can find the detailed outlook for Q2 in the CFO commentary available on our website. In summary, I am pleased with our performance in Q1 and I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper’s success. And now, I’d like to open the call for questions for the remainder of the hour.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Amitabh Passi of UBS. Please go ahead.
Amitabh Passi: Hi guys, I had a question and if possible a quick follow-up. I guess the question Robyn or Rami was just your conviction level and the visibility in the back half of this year in terms of the outlook particularly with U.S. service providers. I also want to just clarify Robyn your comment about second half being better than second half of ’14. Is that on a quarterly basis i.e. would you expect 3Q ’15 to be better than 3Q ’14 and 4Q to be better than 4Q ’14? And then I have a follow-up.
Rami Rahim: Okay. Let me start – sorry, Amitabh, I think we got the question first. Thanks for the question, and I’ll start and then I’ll pass it over to Robyn. The first question about conviction with respect to the second half, the really two elements to the guidance that we have provided or the outlook we provided. First and foremost, we remain very close to all of our service provider customers including those that are here in Northern America. So we obviously have good visibility into projects that we are working on together. We have as good visibility into the trends that are happening in the industry, similar visibility to what you see. And based on that, I would say that, yes, we are pretty confident in the improvement in spending and a demand in the second half of this year. The second element I think to your question that’s equally important is the fact that we expect to see continued diversification of our business across all of our key verticals. So Q1 was another really good quarter in terms of the traction that we saw with cloud providers and cable operators. And clearly, these are very strategic verticals where our engagement with customers are happening on an ongoing basis and we feel good about the strength and our position in the industry if you will, our competitive position relative to these verticals in the second half. And Robyn, I’ll it to you for the rest.
Robyn Denholm: Yes, Amitabh, in terms of the commentary what I said was that, we expect the second half of 2015 in aggregate of it is going to be above the first half of 2015 as well as the second half of 2014. I am not expecting a different trajectory Q3 to Q4 versus what we’ve seen in the past.
Amitabh Passi: Okay. And then if I can just squeeze a quick follow-up, hey, Rami, just on the new product announcements you had, a few of them in the last three to six months, which one, two, or three would you think would start to add to revenues as we move towards through the rest of 2015 and into 2016.
Rami Rahim: Yeah. Thanks, Amitabh. First, I feel really good about the products and the announcements that we just unveiled to the industry. These are obviously technologies that we have been working on very diligently over the last several years and Q1 was honestly very exciting for us business we finally had an opportunity to announce to everybody what it is that we’ve up to. And as you know, they really touch all of our different business areas in switching, routing and security. I have to sort of just remind everybody that, yes, these products all go through their normal certification cycles. We have to first get them out of the market. So right now we are all working around the clock to make sure that we get them into our customers’ hands and ready for deployment, crossing all of the tees and diving the eyes if you will on the testing that needs to happen right now. I expect the first products that hit the market will be the switching products and there I think the ramp will be sooner just based on the availability of that product to that market followed by the enhancements that we’ve made to the PTX product line that happens in the Q3 timeframe.
Amitabh Passi: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Simona Jankowski: Hi, thank you. Just a couple of questions and a follow-up to the prior question on the new products. So Rami, based on your guidance for both Q2 and the second half, it sounds like they are not really expecting a pause or kind of an half burn effect because of these new products as customers wait for the better products to come out later in the year. Can you just comment on why that is? And then follow-up on specifically the switching part of the portfolio, we haven’t yet seen you announced anything in the area of 25 or 50 gig in the datacenter or 2.5, 5 gig in campus. Can you just comment on whether those are segments that you plan to address.
Rami Rahim: Yeah. Sure Simona. Thanks for the question. First, on the overhang effect that you are talking about, we’ve gone through product transitions at Juniper now a number of times. So we obviously are aware and always factor into our projections and our plan, the potential for any sort of an overhang effect. But that said, I am just going to drill one level deeper. We’ve been talking to our customers about these innovations for quite a long time now. In fact, with many of our customers, we’ve developed these products with direct input and guidance from them. So it’s not going to be new news for them. Secondarily in the – let’s say the routing demand with the PTX. Here, our customers have actually really liked the fact that we are continuing to invest in this product line and so they know they have the peace of mind if you will that they can continue to purchase it and have the ability to upgrade in the future when their capacity require them. On the switching side, I would say the overhang effective slim to none because of the fact that this essentially addresses the gap that exist in our portfolio as opposed to something that replace of the product line that already in the market. On the – your follow-up question, on 25 gig and some of these newer interface speed, we haven’t gone out externally and talked about specific products. All I’ll say for now is that actually this is an important topic for us in the company. We understand what our customers’ requirements are with respect to various different inter phase speeds and we are building that into our roadmap.
Simona Jankowski: Great. Thank you, Rami. And then I just had a very quick follow-up for Robyn. Robyn, I heard in your comments on FX having not had a translational impact which makes sense. It was interesting how strong your EMEA business was. Did you not see any impact in terms of either deal size is getting smaller or competitively or in terms of pricing, just from how strong the dollar was?
Robyn Denholm: So clearly in the first quarter, we did have very good results in our EMEA business. It was actually up year-over-year. In terms of the pricing impact, it is a competitive market and we continue to take into account the currency impact on our customers budgets, if you like, as opposed to just our own product pricing. And so it is a factor that we’ve dealt within the past and we will continue to deal with it. Obviously, going forward, we factored in what we believe will be the impact from currency into the guidance that I have given you for the second quarter and then also more in terms of the color for the second half of the year as well.
Simona Jankowski: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Pierre Ferragu of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Pierre Ferragu: Hi, thank you for taking my questions. Rami, first of all, we’re talking a lot about the consolidation in the industry, of course, you’ve mentioned the Nokia/Alcatel-Lucent merger. And so, I’d love to hear your thoughts on the topic. First of all, how do you see that affecting you guys? Like, more consolidation in the industry, and I’d say beyond of course the direct impact of Nokia being one of your distributors? And then, so, I would love to hear your thoughts about how you see the industry evolving, going forward? Do you think there could be more consolidation? Do you think you could play in that? And I’m thinking about two things: could Juniper be stronger as a part of a larger entity with service provider clients? And also from a technological perspective, how do you think about you guys potentially being stronger closer to adjacent technologies like wireless and transport versus being independent and focused on IP routing? And then I have a very short follow-up for Robyn.
Rami Rahim: Okay, great. Thank you, Pierre. Okay. So, certainly, we see the industry dynamics that are panning out right now. Consolidation is one of those industry dynamics and difficult to predict, but, yes, it could continue going forward. There are other dynamics that are happening as well. There are transformational architectural shifts that are happening right now across the industry, of a movement towards cloud-based service delivery, value delivery to the end users whether that’d be residential or business end uses. And honestly I believe that there is a need for a company that’s going to be really laser focused on developing the types of IP innovation that are necessary to get our customers to make this transition. That’s the role that we play in this company. That’s the role we play at Juniper. So the net of it is there is no change to our strategy, our strategy remains one of delivering and competing based on the merit of our technology and on achieving scale through really effective partnerships. With respect to Nokia, Robyn addressed in her opening remarks, we have deep direct relationships with all of the customers that we work with whether they go through Nokia or not, and we have a variety of other partners to choose from as well in taking our innovation to market. As far as the second part of your question with respect to potential M&A for Juniper, I have said in the past and I still do believe that our strategy to innovate is going to be largely organic, but with the potential to augment it with some M&A activity. Right now the focus is primarily on getting the products that we’ve announced out the door, but at some point it will probably make sense for us to think about M&A to complement that and we continue to do that as part of our ongoing strategic process.
Pierre Ferragu: Thanks a lot. And, Robyn, a very, very quick follow-up on the $190 million of business you’ve generated with Nokia last year. How should we think about how sticky the business is? So I understand that you have relationship with client, it’s not completely fully at-risk, but there will be pressure on – potentially on these numbers. Is that something that can happen in the short-term, or is that more like a longer-term race, because you have like good contractual and like protection related to the fact that it's difficult to swap out technology in a network?
Robyn Denholm: Thanks, Pierre. I think that is a good question. I mean from our perspective, obviously, what we control is actually our relationships with our customers, our end-user customers. In terms of the profile of that $190 million for 2014, it was both product and services; it was actually routing, switching, and security, in those numbers. Clearly, there is some overlap in terms of routing with the Alcatel-Lucent portfolio as and when this transaction closes and so that will take some time. So, we believe that there is an opportunity to continue to partner on those areas where we don’t overlap. And then, obviously, the services contracts continue over time with those end-user customers. And the profile of the revenue products versus services is roughly the same as the overall Juniper profile in terms of overall percentage.
Pierre Ferragu: Actually, that’s very good. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Ehud Gelblum of Citi. Please go ahead.
Ehud Gelblum: Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Rami, welcome conference calls, I guess you did one before too, but –
Rami Rahim: Thank you.
Ehud Gelblum: Sure. So, a couple of things. First of all, we have mergers in lots of different directions. One obviously is the vendor one, you’re talking about. The other one, given that you are seeing strength in cable is coming from two large cable companies in the U.S. that were on a merger path that may or may not be on a merger path, going forward. Can you give a comment as to how would that impact things positively or negatively, if that merger doesn’t go through? And what kind of like signposts should we be looking for, in terms of what that would mean to your business at EDH1 and just thought process on that? And then, Robyn, a couple years ago, when you had a slew of new products coming out in 2011, I want to say, you gave us this target, I believe it was $75 million – $75 million or $150 million, I can’t remember. That was about seven quarters out. Is there some kind of signpost that you can give us on growth of these new products that you came out with that are coming out now that we can kind of look to, a couple of like a years or so out, so we can kind of track the progress of the new products? And then I have a very quick – just a small follow-up.
Robyn Denholm: So, Ehud, I will address the second part of the question and then Rami can address the first part around customer consolidation. So in terms of the new product ramps to revenue, obviously, we are very focused on doing that. And Rami went through the number of steps that we need to do in terms of getting the products out and then also having them certified for the networks and that type of thing. We have not put out nor are we going to put out a number in terms of the quantity of revenue to expect. What we would do is give you progress as we incur design wins and that type of thing. But in terms of an overall number, it’s included in our outlook for the second half of the year and it will be modest this year in terms of any revenue impact.
Rami Rahim: Thanks, Robyn. On the question regarding cable, first, I will remind everybody that cable is one of our key strategic vertical that we are focusing on and measuring ourselves against in terms of performance of the business. We enjoy a really strong relationship on both sides of the potential merger, you talked about Comcast and Time Warner, and we continue to do so. We’re working very closely with them on the variety of different projects. I personally engage with executives on both sides. So, honestly, whether it happens or not is a very neutral thing for us, it doesn’t change the importance of the vertical for us, it doesn’t change our investment level that we would put into the vertical to make sure that we remain aligned with the innovations that we are introducing into the market. And I will say that some of the new products that we have just talked about were developed with explicit and detailed feedback about the requirements for the cable industry. We know what they want, we know what kind of performance, the capabilities, the feature set that is required to build out their networks, and I feel confident that they are actually going to play out very well for the vertical.
Ehud Gelblum: Thanks. So I was just confirming that you actually are on both sides of that, Time Warner and Comcast. Robyn, my question was, on cash flow statement, there is a line, professional services related to non-routine stockholder matters. That was $7.3 million in the year ago quarter and $3 million in this quarter. Is this to deal with your activist investor? And what was the $3 million spent on?
Robyn Denholm: So that is actually to do with the settlement that we reached in first quarter in relation to our proxy.
Ehud Gelblum: Excellent. Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Tal Liani of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Tal Liani: Hi, guys. I have two questions. The first one is more kind of a longer term. I understand that routing will have cyclical recovery, but if I try to think outside in terms of kind of recovery, in the last four years, routing revenues were flat, 0% growth. What do you think is the outlook? What are the – even if you don’t get to a specific number, what are the puts and takes for growth over the next four, five years? Why should it accelerate now, if it didn’t grow the last four years, if you take the whole 2011 to 2015? The second question is about the outlook for cost cuts, if at all. So, you’re coming out of the big restructuring program. Is that it from cost cuts point of view? So going forward, will margin enhancement be more of a function of revenue growth, or is there any room for additional cuts? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Okay. Let me start, Tal, and then I will pass it over to Robyn. The outlook that we had provided on our routing business over the next three years was essentially 3% to 5% in revenue growth. And I believe that’s achievable because of a number of different things. First, just based on the merits of our product portfolio. The dynamics in the routing business are such that in order to grow, you need to take market share, and in order to take market share, you need to have better products. We just introduced a router that has three times the performance of anything else that’s out there in the industry today. At a time the traffic is growing substantially and our customers care about the economics of routing. We have a product that truly demonstrates to them what we’re capable of doing in moving that amount of traffic cost-effectively. That’s why I think we have confidence in our ability to achieve these projections. And then, as far as the restructuring costs that you’re talking about, let me just start and I will pass it over to Robyn. The most important thing that I think you need to understand is, yes, last year was a year of restructuring for us, but going forward, I think we’re going to make sure that the investments we make in OpEx are going to be commensurate with the revenue growth. We are not going to get ahead of ourselves as we have done in the past quite frankly in terms of how we invest in the business. We have to see the growth that will give us the freedom, if you will, to invest in the business, not the other way around. Robyn, do you want to add anything?
Robyn Denholm: Yeah, thanks, Rami. I think, firstly, I’m very pleased with the cost performance in the quarter and also the year-over-year declines that we’ve actually achieved this quarter in terms of the cost. I think also just amplifying what Rami said, I mean, clearly, we put out in October that 25% is still our goal in terms of operating margin over this next three-year period. And we are focused on doing that in a balanced way. We want to make sure that we continue to invest in the future of the company, which is obviously the innovation that we are delivering to market. And we will, as Rami said, grow OpEx outside of this year slower than we grow our revenue. And so that’s how we will continue to expand operating margins just like we did in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis. So that is our strategy and we are continuing to do that. So the other side of that tale is that we are always looking for cost improvements, a lot of those will be invisible because you have to actually take cost out to even keep it flat in any sort of environment. So we are very focused on the cost side, but in a very balanced way.
Tal Liani: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Mark Sue of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Mark Sue: Thank you. It’s good to see the encouraging commentary. If I look at it from a historical perspective, you went through a period of product pruning. We now know you will keep routing, security, and also switching. As you balance your commentary with OpEx, are there submarkets or perhaps verticals where you might potentially retreat from, while you fortify your efforts into the other verticals of cloud, data center, and service providers? Just trying to get a sense of how you narrow the scope so you get multiplied the effects on the other end.
Rami Rahim: Yes, thanks, Mark. You know last year was a busy year and a tough year quite frankly because we have to make some difficult decisions about which particular product areas we are going to remain in and which ones we would divest and which ones we would unwind. That work is effectively behind us at this point in time. So I feel very good right now that we are not stretching ourselves too thin, that we are investing in areas and investing sufficiently in the markets that we are playing in in order to differentiate, to compete and to win. It’s that simple. So at this point, the focus really is on the focus in our strategy that we have to grow top line and we’ll go from there. We are in execution mode.
Robyn Denholm: Yeah, and if I can just add as well, Mark, you know the work that [indiscernible] go-to-market side is also obviously yielding results and if you look at our strategy more deeply in terms of the vertical focus that we have, it’s obviously clearly focused on those customers that differentiate the network or run their business on the network across cloud, cable, carriers, as well as strategic verticals in enterprise and government. And so we are very pleased with that. And partnering is a key element of making sure that we continue to get the growth rates from a revenue perspective and continue to drive operating margin expansion as well.
Mark Sue: That's helpful, Robyn, and on that, as you look at margin improvements and you look at firming net income, how should we think about cash flow from operations, considering the business, when it hums along, generates a lot of cash? Any thoughts on how we should think about cash flow from operations, this year?
Robyn Denholm: Yes, I think cash flow generation is a core strength of the business model that we have here at Juniper. I think that operating cash flow in particular does follow the operating margin and the expansion of that will obviously lead to more cash per revenue dollar being generated. And so we are very pleased with our cash flow for the first quarter and even for the whole of last year and that enabled us to continue to drive the investments that we need going forward and also deliver a healthy return for our shareholders in terms of the capital returns that we’ve been committed to.
Mark Sue: All very helpful. Thank you, and good luck.
Robyn Denholm: Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Thanks, Mark.
Operator: Thanks you. The next question comes from Rod Hall of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Rod Hall: Yeah, hi, guys, thanks for taking my question. I guess I wanted to ask either one of you on the routing cycle, maybe a little bit more short-term question. Which is, you guys seemed to think the routing cycle had bottomed last quarter, is down 15% year-over-year in your numbers. This quarter, you are down 8%, it does kind of feel like that was the right call for you, anyway. Should we anticipate the routing cycle continuing to improve? And, do you think that we're getting to positive year-over-year growth in the second half of your routing? So, that’s the first question I’ve got. And then I’ll just ask a follow-up after you guys answer that one.
Rami Rahim: Let me start and I will see if Robyn wants to add anything. I’ll just go back to the commentary we had made. We do expect just based on the two factors that we’ve outlined, service providers spend in general, I mean, I’m talking telco spend in general and, specifically, here in the United States, should improve in the second half of the year and then also the further diversification of our business across the different key verticals that includes cloud, that includes cable. Now based on that, we do anticipate the second half to be better than the first half and also better than the second half of last year. Robyn, anything else?
Robyn Denholm: Yes, I agree with obviously everything Ramey said there. I would also point out and I mentioned it in my CFO commentary that we actually had a good routing quarter in Q1 in enterprise as well and that just speaks to not only the diversification of the revenue, but some of the key strategic pivots that we made last year around the data center. So, obviously, in enterprise as well as in cloud data centers in the service provider world there is an element of routing that’s in those solutions as well. And so we are pleased by that performance. We saw some good wins and some good revenue on the enterprise side of routing as well as the SP side. But to confirm, we do expect service provider routing to improve through the year as well.
Rod Hall: Okay. And then my follow-up I guess is a strategic question for you, Rami. As you look at the routing business, it looks like, overtime anyway, routing and optical will come closer together. We know there's some organizational reasons at carriers that’s not going to happen as quickly, particularly in some of the bigger carriers, but I’m just wondering what you’re thinking about prospects of a standalone routing company? How badly do you think you guys need to develop an optical capability, a deeper optical capability, I should say, and do you think it would ever make sense to acquire assets to provide that kind of a capability?
Rami Rahim: Yes, Rod, you are absolutely right, there is a transformation that’s happening right now in the industry where the packet world if you will and the optical world that are moving closer together, you are also right about the velocity at which that’s happening. It’s not happening very fast there are all sorts of non-technology barriers that are in the way that will prevent it from moving fast. As far as our own strategy, we do have a small, but very effective optical team in-house to Juniper that I do expect will grow over time that has the capability of taking off-the-shelf optical components that are available to anybody really and integrated them into our routing products, but I also do believe that where most of the innovation is going to be on the packet optical convergence topic. It is going to be in software, it is going to be around the ability to look across layers and to make optimal decisions how to move information from place A to place B, leveraging optical and packet technology as efficiently and effectively as possible. And we have now a product called the NorthStar controller, which is essentially our WAN SDN controller that does exactly that. Honestly, I think we have some of the best minds in the industry right now that have developed algorithms that have the ability to optimize these pass across layers in a way that is very meaningful to our customers and we are engaging with a number of different customers on these products. It is still early days, early stages, but I’m encouraged by the progress that we are making.
Rod Hall: Great. Okay thanks a lot guys.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Jess Lubert: Hi guys thanks for taking my question. I have a question on the security business and specifically I was hoping to understand if you see any developments that will you believe this business may be nearing a bottom, would you expect the security business to also strengthen through the year and potentially return to growth during the second half and perhaps you can walk through what’s going well and are the keys to better participating what seems to be a fairy vibrant security market?
Rami Rahim: Yeah thanks Jeff. So, our goal for this year as I stated last quarter is around stabilizing the security business, if you take a look at our SRX business in Q1, it was more or less flat with Q4. The part of the business that’s in decline and that will continue to be in decline is going to be the legacy ScreenOS business. We’re still in working progress mode if you will on security. I did mention that we pivoted our strategy, we’re not working on a security strategy that’s very highly aligned with the rest of our product portfolio and offering to main level solutions to have a strong security element to our customers and we are executing on a very high leverage engineering strategy. So, just last week in fact we announced the industry’s fastest firewall that’s 2 terabits per second. For cloud operators they are trying to protect massive cloud infrastructure and for mobile operators that are trying to protect the mobile users, their mobile infrastructure that’s very, very meaningful and it’s only possible because of the silicon innovations that we’ve already developed in-house for our other product lines and it just demonstrates the power of the synergies if you will from a cost standpoint that exist in the organization. So, in summary we are focusing on a narrow part of the market. It’s the network security space, tightly aligned with the rest of our products and we believe that we can in fact innovate to differentiate and win there. It’s just going to take a bit of time.
Jess Lubert: Rami in the security business over the last couple of years, a lot of your success has been at the high end with large services providers, as services provider spending improved in the back half of the year, should we expect that to also benefit the security business and how are you thinking about security with respect to enterprise, is the recovery likely to be more carrier focused or are you also expecting similar improvement on enterprise? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Well as CapEx improves for services providers I expect that to help all of our business, I don’t know whether specifically for this second half it will have an effect on security. We haven’t broken that out in that way. The enhancements that we are making right now to our Juno Space security products, I want to make clear are certainly very compelling for the service provider space, but it is also compelling for large scale enterprises, so those that are building large enterprise clouds will benefit from the performance and scale that we are adding. And of course it doesn’t stop there, we’re also continually enhancing our virtual security products and assets, which is very meaningful for the enterprise space because at the end of the day breaches will always happen, you are always going to be able to overcome any security barrier you put as a parameter, once that happens the key is to prevent the spread of Malware inside of the enterprise and our reversal security products are now being used by enterprises to do exactly that. So, yes our strategy is very much around SP and enterprise. The scale and performance helps both. Certainly more on the SP and the cloud infrastructure space, but also in the enterprise side and finally virtualization is something that will certainly help both SP and enterprise.
Robyn Denholm: And just to underscore that I made the comment before about routing and datacenter and the enterprise. The same was true in the quarter for security. The high-end was up again, nothing to write home about yet because it was flat overall. SRX fled overall sequentially. However, the area that did grow nice was actually the datacenter space in the enterprise in this quarter. So, it’s early days, but our overall aim for this year is to create stability in that business this year and then go from there.
Jess Lubert: Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank.
Vijay Bhagavath: Yes thanks. Hi Rami how is it going. A question for you and Robyn. A question for you Rami is, it seems to be like you are doing quite well in the non-telco segments, you know the cloud portals Web 2.0 etcetera that will be helpful for us to get any color on the rough percentage split in terms of revenues like for routing. So, would it be less than 10% for Web 2.0 cloud maybe somewhere in the 10%, 20% and then the remainder would be telco and cable. It would be very helpful. Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Hi Vijay. Look we haven’t broken that out. We can consider doing that at point. I will say that the fact that we are seeing strength in cloud and cable and government is not an accident, it’s a deliberate part of our strategy. So, we are in fact listening very closely in making sure that we weave in the requirements from all the customers in these verticals into our products. And I feel good that that’s going to continue. I mean I will tell you again that the products that we have just announced that will be shipped throughout this year were all developed with a deep understanding of specific requirements in these verticals that others that might not have the strategic relationship that they have with these customers would have implemented. So, I expect that that part of the business will continue to do well and certainly the telco side will do well as there is improvement in the CapEx environment there.
Robyn Denholm: Yes. I just want to add one more point Vijay. I think the diversification of the revenues, the core strengths of ours and this quarter one of the stats I will leave you with is of that top 10 customers in the quarter, 5 were carriers, 3 were outside of North America. We had four customers in the top 10 that were either cloud or cable and one enterprise customer. So, to me that is - it is really good in terms of the diversification and it is not something that happened over night. That’s been work in progress by the team for quite some time. It speaks to the strength on the go-to-market side as well as the relevance of the products across multiple customer types and so we are pleased that with that progress.
Vijay Bhagavath: Excellent. So here is the question for you Robyn that Juniper obviously is engaged in many new initiatives programs, many different types of customers to work with, how would you look at OpEx as a percentage of revenue for the remainder quarters of the year, you see that trending up as you get into new project from an NFE on the service provider side. The Web 2.0 cloud have their own idiosyncrasies in terms of how they want to work with you, how should we look at OpEx? Thanks.
Robyn Denholm: Yes. So, OpEx as we’ve talked about before for this year, for 2015 we have set a goal of $1.9 billion plus or minus $25 million. As we move forward, we said earlier that we’re committed to the 25% operating margin over the next three years. As we grow revenue, OpEx as a percentage of revenue, will start to come down. And so, we’ve talked about that for quite some time. The structural actions that we took last year and the cost areas that we continue to work on are a testament to that. So we are committed to doing that in a balanced way so that we can continue to grow the business over the long term.
Vijay Bhagavath: Okay. Thanks. Good luck to you and your team.
Robyn Denholm: Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Thanks, [indiscernible].
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Sanjiv Wadhwani of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Sanjiv Wadhwani: Thanks. Rami, a question on the switching side. Last year in the first half, you did really well in the switching touching $200 million in revenue in the June quarter which historically has been tough to get there. I’m just curious you are tracking about $20 million, $30 million below that number. What’s changed between last year and this year, and what gets you back to that $200 million or north of that? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Yes, sure. Thanks, Sanjiv. On the switching side, let me sort of try to breakout the business and then probably shed some light on some of the observations that you’ve made. There is a service provider and an enterprise component to our switching business. The service provider side especially as it pertains to cloud has actually performed quite well and that includes performance in the Q1 timeframe, the quarter that we just wrapped up. The enterprise side is a bit of a mixed story which is what you are seeing right now, observing right now in the numbers. Cloud as it pertains to enterprise, so private cloud type deployment as well as enterprise IT datacenters has actually done quite well. So that area of the business just I think because of the focus and some of the newer product introduction has helped us grow in that area of the business. On the campus side, you have to understand that we’ve just sort of done a bit of a campus pivot in our switching business or in our strategy all up that includes taking some of the products that we had in-house, take our SSL VPN business, our Pulse business, the wireless LAN business and we pivoted there to a partnership approach. And I think that that strategy needs to play out over a number of quarters before we get to some sort of stability and return to growth if you will. Once that happens, I think that will create the environment if you will for all of growth in switching. Last but not least, clearly we have been competing even in the datacenter without a complete portfolio of products which we are just about to plug if you will with the innovations in the QFX 10K product line that we have just announced and we’ll start to introduce for our customers in the middle of the year. That gives me more confidence again that I think that switching can be a good growth engine for the company going forward.
Robyn Denholm: Dany, are you still there?
Operator: Yes. Our next question is from Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer. Please go head.
Ittai Kidron: Thanks. Rami, I want to drill into that switching segment that Sanjiv started. First of all, can you give us a list of qualitative assessment of the breakdown between your datacenter and your campus wiring closet switch just from a revenue breakdown standpoint?
Rami Rahim: We don’t break it down but I will say that they both represent pretty meaningful portions of the overall switching business, Ittai.
Ittai Kidron: Okay. And then regarding your, the new announcements that you’ve made is very exciting the new switch, but you’ve had a couple of switch cycles in the past and you’ve kind of fumbled on them whether it be the QFabric and even the high end of your modular portfolio, the 9200 and the 8200. They never really managed to catch any traction. It seems like that can modular. You’ve always had very difficult challenges. So what changes in the next cycle?
Rami Rahim: Well, I mean at the end of the day these are just words and it’s the numbers that are going to have to prove our thesis if you will of our competitiveness in this space. But all I’ll tell you is that, we have learned tremendously, tremendously from the lessons of introducing the products into the market that are in the market today whether they’d on the EX side or the QFabric side and so forth. And we have taken all of those lessons and applied them over the last couple of years as we were developing these new products into the development of those product lines. And we have now been talking to many of our customers about this product line for quite some time and so far what we’ve heard from them and in fact some of the them had early access to the products and in terms of an ability to actually kick the tyres on them. The feedback has been quite encouraging. Now we have a lot of work to do to finish up testing, ramp up production and get these products into the market. We are doing exactly that right now. But I feel really good about the prospects of this product line.
Ittai Kidron: Okay and very good. Lastly, from me, HP announced its acquisition of Aruba, that was your Wi-Fi partner since you’ve exited your Wi-Fi business. Any thoughts on how you plug that hole since you’re trying to plug a lot of holes.
Rami Rahim: Yes. Fortunately, I don’t consider this as a hole at least not right now. Now, things could evolve in certain ways but at this point in time, I am very close to the Aruba executive team. I’ve talked to their CEO. That partnership continues. The foundation of that partnership is one that is based on open interfaces between our technology and their technology. So having the ability for our customers to choose battery technology is fundamental. And anybody that lose side of that will lose just because our customers will not accept anything else. And I think that’s the thing that makes this solution a) long lasting, but more importantly or just is importantly it gives our customers the ability to interchange either at Juniper or the Aruba side with different types of technologies.
Ittai Kidron: Very good. Good luck.
Rami Rahim: Thank you.
Robyn Denholm: Thanks, Ittai. I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Brian White of Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
Brian White: Yeah, Rami, looking at the enterprise market, it was much stronger than seasonal on a sequential basis. In fact it was the best since the first quarter of 2010. So maybe you could walk us through some of the drivers I know Robyn mentioned enterprise routers. But what’s the dynamic in enterprise that it came in so much stronger than seasonality.
Rami Rahim: Okay. Thanks, Brian. Let me start, yes, we are pleased with our enterprise performance at least from a sequential standpoint. There are a couple of dynamics here. First and foremost is from a industry vertical standpoint, the government is actually helping here. We are seeing good strength in some projects that we have with the government agencies and this helps us and switching helps us and routing it also helps us to some extent and security as well. Beyond that, the focus that we have on this transformation that’s happening towards cloud based service delivery is very important. So we are working right now with a large Fortune 500 company and building out their cloud infrastructure around the globe. And that is a testament to the strength that we have in our MetaFabric architecture and the switching product that we’ve introduced into the market. It’s also a beautiful example of how security ties in really effectively to complete the cloud solutions that we offer to our customers. I expect that to continue.
Brian White: Okay. And just around the product cycle, when is the bulk of the products hitting the market becoming generally available in the second quarter or third quarter? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: It starts in the second quarter but it actually goes throughout the second half of this year.
Brian White: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.
Robyn Denholm: Okay. Thank you. Thank you everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your participation and your great questions. Before I close, I just want to give a head up for the Juniper IR and SG&A team that worked out the new format for today’s call. We hope you found it helpful and we love to hear your feedback. Thanks everyone. Talk to you soon.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.

Rami Rahim: Thanks, Kathleen, and welcome everyone. I am delighted to join you today on my first quarterly conference call as CEO of Juniper. First, let’s talk about what we have accomplished and what I see ahead. 2014 was a year of significant change for Juniper. We made major strides having implemented a series of initiative designed to streamline our organization, reduced our cost structure, improve our balance sheet, return capital to our shareholders and drive long-term profitable growth in a challenging revenue environment. In many areas we exceeded our commitment by working in a more efficient manner with greater accountability and customer connectiveness. And while we achieved much in 2014, I recognize that there is still more we can do to realize the full potential of our company. Rest assured, we are moving with urgency. We are very excited about the changes that are taking place in the industry and inside Juniper, and we believe that our best days are still ahead. To that end, let me share with you what I have been up to in my first few months as CEO. I have spent considerable time talking and listening to our customers, our partners and our employees. Working with the senior leadership team, I set out key execution initiatives for 2015 aligned with our R&D and go-to-market strategy in the areas of routing, switching and security for both service providers and enterprise customers. I appointed Jonathan Davidson as Head of Juniper’s Development and Innovation or JDI to ensure a smooth transition and uninterrupted focus on our product roadmap. Jonathan is an accomplished leader and technologist who knows how to bring focus and clarity to developing the innovative products our customers require. I moved network automation project that have graduated out of the incubation phase from the office of the CTO to JDI to ensure tighter alignment with the rest of our portfolio and end-to-end solution development. And I oversaw a comprehensive review of the security components of our business including our capabilities and product roadmap. While my new role at Juniper now has the added dimension of ensuring that our business performs across a range of metric, I will, as I always have try to ensure we build and deliver great products that advance the state-of-the-art and network innovation, and drive long-term growth for the company. I’ll spend some time now articulating our strategy. How we plan to execute against our vision and our 2015 initiatives. First, our strategy, we will deliver the most scalable, reliable, secure and cost effective networks, while revolutionizing their agility, efficiency and value through automation. We will focus on customers and partners across our key verticals, who view these network attributes as fundamental to their businesses. Product and solution differentiation with the relentless customer focus will allow us to achieve our primary goal of growing revenue faster than the market. Second, on execution, our innovation engine is running stronger than ever and we are executing on a compelling product roadmap that will drive future growth across routing, switching and security. I'm very excited about our product pipeline, which has never been better and will offer our customers break through performance and impressive capabilities unmatched in the industry. In security, I acknowledge that it has underperformed and we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge during the quarter. 2015 will be a year of stabilizing our security revenue. To win insecurity, we are pivoting our strategy to building integrated solutions that focus our network resiliency and business continuity across cloud, data center, branch, campus and service provider mobile infrastructure. To emphasis, we are focusing on areas where we can compete effectively and I am confident that we will do just that. And importantly, we will be employing a high leverage development strategy that takes advantage of the existing and ongoing innovation within Juniper. Our common threat through all of this is our Junos based SRX platform, which is adaptable to serve all of this environment and can accommodate the security needs of any number of different use cases. With this new strategy in effect, we will be delivering substantial enhancements to the SRX platform in 2015 and they will be closely intertwined with the network. We believe this new approach will allow us to deliver superior offering and we have energized team focus on helping our customer get in front of their security challenges. Our exciting product portfolio along with our focus go-to-market models are coming together to create real competitive advantage for our customers. We have a sound strategy in place, we are executing well against our plan and we continue to make progress with new design wins and diversification of our business across our target verticals and geographies. I’d like to turn now to the macroenvironment and our business. I am confident in Juniper’s future and I see substantial opportunities to grow and deliver value over the long-term. In the near-term, we continue to face headwinds in U.S. carrier spending. However, we do expect an improvement in spending in the later half of this year. We have signaled in July of 2014 that the market was going to be challenging and we ran our business under the assumption that it would be so for the full four quarters cycles that we have historical seen. Based on recent conversations with our customers, we still expect that to be the case with a return to growth in investment in the second half of this year. Although 2014 routing revenue declined 4%, the diversity of our business helped offset the decline from U.S. carriers. We continue to see growth in routing from cloud providers, cable, financial services and strategic enterprise customers that are building and operating their own network infrastructure. In switching, we are just at the early stages of an exciting journey of growth. It will be more to come from me over time on this topic as we take a leap in performance in automation in the datacenter switching space. Let me announce that expectations moving forward. While we navigate industry and customer dynamics in the near term, we have continued to focus on things that matter most to our customers and our shareholders. There are no changes to our planning assumption. Juniper remains committed to the financial targets we set out at our Investor Day last October where we stated an overall growth rate of 3% to 6% over the next three years. We are continuing to manage the business prudently. We maintain our stated non-GAAP OpEx target of $1.9 billion plus or minus $25 million. We are also committed to continuing the aggressive capital return plans that we have been executing again. To summarize, our team remains steadfast. We will drive profitable growth and develop and deliver the innovative IP networking products and solutions that our customers rely on. We will continue to be intensely focused on operational excellence, cost discipline and targeted growth initiative. I will be monitoring our business closely and will report on our progress quarterly. In closing, I thank our employees for their resiliency through a year of much change. Juniper employees around the world continue to focus on executing as one Juniper. And I’m proud of and grateful for their dedication. I also appreciate the continued support of our shareholders, partners and customers. Now, I’ll turn it over to Robyn to provide more details of our financial results and our revenue outlook for the first quarter of 2015.
Robyn Denholm: Thank you, Rami and good afternoon everyone. Before I review the Q4 and full year results, I want to update you on our restructuring and share repurchases, as well as give you the context of the goodwill impairment charge. We have completed the restructuring actions that we first announced in February of 2014. In Q4, we exceeded our expense reduction commitment and implemented the additional structural actions to achieve the $1.9 billion plus or minus $25 million OpEx target for 2015. As Rami mentioned, one of the actions we completed during the quarter was the tightened focus of our security portfolio, allowing us to dedicate our security resources to the SRX platform. Total restructuring and asset write-down charges for Q4 were approximately $29 million and for the full year 2014 were $209 million. We also finalized the sale of Junos Pulse and recorded $20 million net gain. We are executing very well on our capital return plans. We paid a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share in December and repurchased $500 million of shares in Q4. For 2014, we have returned $2.3 billion of capital to shareholders and we are reaffirming our commitment to return a total of $4.1 billion to our shareholders through 2016. Overall, I’m very pleased with our cost structure and the progress that we’ve made towards achieving the capital return commitments we made to our shareholders. Now, I’d like to address the goodwill impairment charge that we recorded in Q4. As required under GAAP accounting rules, we will perform a regular review of the carrying value of goodwill. During Q4, this review resulted in an estimated non-cash impairment charge of $850 million related to the goodwill of our security reporting unit. There are several factors which contributed to this impairment including the recent underperformance of this reporting unit and our assets to refocus our security offerings in addition to the divestitures of Junos Pulse. Combined these factors result in a delay in achieving revenue and profit forecast needed to support the historical security goodwill valuation. I want to remind everyone that this accounting charge has no direct effect on Juniper’s cash balance, operating cash flows or business outlook. We remain committed to the long-term growth targets that we outlined at our October investor meeting. Now, let’s return to an analysis of the Q4 result. As a reminder, the following revenue commentary and growth rates have been normalized for the sale of Junos Pulse. Overall, revenue and demands of the fourth quarter was better than we expected. However, the things that we have discussed over the last six months remain consistent. That is large U.S. carrier demand continues to be vague but has been somewhat offset by healthy demand from cloud providers and cable customers, pockets of momentum in EMEA and APAC service providers and improving enterprise demand. Looking at our demand metrics, products book to bill was much greater than one. We exceeded 2014 with about $445 million in product backlog. Total revenue for the quarter was $1,102 billion, down 11% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. Product revenue was $794 million, down 17% from last year and essentially flat quarter-over-quarter. Services revenue was $308 million, up 8% year-over-year and 2% from the prior quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.41, excluding the benefit of the R&D tax credit of $0.03, non-GAAP diluted earnings would have been down $0.05 per share year-over-year and up $0.02 sequentially. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to lower revenue, partially offset by the cost reductions and the positive impact of $0.06 from reduced checkout. The sequential increase was largely driven by improvements in our cost structure. For the quarter, GAAP loss per share was $1.81, which includes the $850 million impact from the goodwill impairment charge. Excluding this impairment charge, diluted earnings per share would have been $0.19. Included in this result is $0.07 impact for restructuring and other charges and $0.04 benefit from the renewal of the R&D tax credit and a $0.05 benefit from the gain of the sale of Junos Pulse. Now let’s look at revenue results in detail by the product area. Routing product revenue was $523 million, down 15% year-over-year and a 2% decline from the prior quarter. Year-over-year decline was driven by weakness from our large U.S. carriers partially offset by strength in cloud providers. Switching product revenue was $174 million, a decrease of 12% year-over-year, primarily due to declines in enterprise. Quarter-over-quarter switching product revenue increased 13%, driven by demand from cloud providers and financial services for our QFX products. Security product revenue was $97 million, rather disappointing 28% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. The decrease was due to a decline in the SRX platform from U.S. carrier customers, as well as the continued declines from ScreenOS products. Moving on to gross margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margins for the quarter were 64.1%, compared to 64.2% a year ago and the elevated level of 65.2% last quarter. Non-GAAP product gross margins were 64.3%, down six-tenths of a point from a year ago and 1.8 points from last quarter. The expected sequential decline was primarily attributable to a shift in product and geography mix. Non-GAAP services gross margins was 63.6%, up 1.7 points from a year ago and six-tenths of a point quarter-over-quarter. This increase was due to lower support-related costs from operational improvements and variable cost savings. We are pleased to report that our non-GAAP operating expenses were $465 million, below our guidance range and down $74 million, or 14% year-over-year. This reflects the implementation of the additional cost savings commitment announced on our Q3 2014 earnings call, as well as the significant benefit from the reduction in variable expenses in the quarter. Our headcount ended the year at 8,806, a decline of 677 employees or 7% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margins for the quarter were 21.9%, flat year-over-year despite lower revenue. This is due to our significant focus on cost reduction efforts. The non-GAAP tax rate was 21%, down 6.1 points from the prior quarter, primarily due to the $13 million of one-time benefits from the renewal of the R&D tax credit for 2014. The GAAP tax expense in the quarter was $75 million on a GAAP loss of $694 million, resulting in a negative tax rate of 11%. The GAAP loss is due to the goodwill impairment charge, which is the non-deductible tax item. The GAAP tax rate this quarter was also impacted by the gain on the sale of Junos Pulse. Now, I’d like to discuss the 2014 full year results. Total revenue was $4,532 billion, approximately flat from last year. For the full year, large U.S. carrier revenues declined, offset by an increase from cloud providers and cables and a steady performance from enterprise. While we are not happy with the overall results, we are successfully achieving diversification of our customer service and increasing the relevance of our products across multiple customers’ segment. We are adding product revenues and finished the year down 4%, primarily due to the softness from U.S. carriers in the second half. Switching product revenue was up 13% for the full year, driven by growth from cloud providers. Security product revenue was down 14% for the full year. This decrease was primarily due to a decline in the legacy ScreenOS products. Non-GAAP gross margin was 64.3% for the full year, approximately flat with 2013. This is a good result and represents the value our customers’ same innovation, as well as our intense focus on supply chain cost reductions. The benefits of which offsets both revenue mix changes and the normal levels of pricing pressure. I’m pleased with the improvement in our overall cost structure. We ended the year with $2.15 billion of non-GAAP operating expenses, down $88 million or 4% from 2013. This decrease in OpEx allowed us to expand non-GAAP operating margins by 1.5 points to end the full year at 20.7%, despite the challenging revenue environment. Non-GAAP diluted earnings were $1.45, up $0.17 or 13% year-over-year. This increase was primarily due to positive impact of approximately $0.12 per share from a reduction in share count of 9% year-over-year, as well as significantly lower operating expenses for the full year. GAAP loss per share was $0.73, which includes the impact from the goodwill impairment charge. Excluding this charge, GAAP diluted earnings per share would have been $1.11, inclusive of the $0.45 impact of restructuring and other charges. We ended the fourth quarter with approximately $1.8 billion of net cash and investments. The decline from Q3 was primarily due to the capital return of $542 million in the quarter. For the quarter, we generated good operating cash flow of $291 million and $763 million for the full year. DSO was 49 days, which is flat from last quarter. During 2014, in order to foster our channel business and reduce our expenses, we transition some of that distributor financing to Juniper’s balance sheet through a targeted financial services program with certain partners. Going forward, we expect DSO to be in a range of 45 to 55 days. Now, I will provide an outlook for Q1 of 2015. As a reminder, these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis except for revenue and share count. We continue to expect that demand environment for our largest U.S. carrier customers to be challenging throughout the first half of 2015. As we have said, we are two quarters into what we expect to be a full quarter cycle and as a result, we remain cautious in our revenue planning assumption. For the first quarter of 2015, we expect revenues to range from $1.20 billion to $1.60 billion. Gross margins are expected to be 63.5%, plus or minus 0.5% at the lower end of our long-term range due to the lower volume. Operating expenses are expected to be $475 million, plus or minus $5 million and as a reminder, our Q4 2014 results included a significant benefit of variable cost savings. We remain focused on our cost structure and we are committed to managing expenses throughout 2015. Operating margins are expected to be approximately 18% at the midpoint of guidance. And we expect the non-GAAP tax rate to be 27% for the first quarter, assuming no extensions of the R&D tax credit for 2015. We expect diluted earnings per share of between $0.28 and $0.32 per share, assuming a weighted average share count of approximately $420 million. I’m also pleased to report that the Board has approved a dividend of $0.10 per share for the first quarter. I would like to thank our teams for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper’s success. Now, let’s open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Pierre Ferragu of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Pierre Ferragu: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Maybe on your -- on all the comments you’ve made on the service provider outlook, do you have a sense from technicians you had with your clients of what drove so relatively sudden slowdown in spending that started about a couple of quarters ago? And/or so what would be the driver behind like recovering, spending in the second half of the year? And then beyond the -- of course beyond the U.S. and the rest of the world, if you could give us a bit of flavor of how the service provider business is likely to reply for you in 2015. What I am wondering of course is, if we have a recovery in the second half of 2015 in the U.S. and if it becomes more clearly visual for you, is there a risk of seeing the sustaining in the rest of the world? Thank you.
Rami Rahim: Okay. Thank you, Pierre. So let me just address your first question, which is around the service provider outlook, primarily here in the United States. There are number of factors that we look at. Obviously as we talk to our customers and we engage with them very closely, number one would be things around the timing of projects that we’ve been working with them on. We are looking obviously at macro trends that are happening around M&A activity, the investment split between wireline and wireless that are large service provider customers that are currently expecting to undertake spectrum auctions. All of these have contributed to our assessment, but it makes sense for us at this point to maintain our prudent outlook looking forward and manage our business accordingly. Now that said, we are engaging with them on an ongoing basis. And based on that engagement, the timing of projects and so forth, we do anticipate that their investment levels would start to recover in the second half of this year. On your second question, which is more around the geo-profile for service providers, and maybe more broadly speaking, let me just touch on the Juniper business as it pertains to our performance across the globe. And I will touch on it more from a service provider standpoint, because I believe that’s what you’re interested in just from your question. In EMEA, I am actually pleased with our performance and the momentum that we’re seeing both in the smaller Tier 2, Tier 3 service providers that have really adopted a number of our products, especially our MX and PTX products as a build-out converged infrastructures and we are actually seeing some good momentum in the quarter as well in the Q4 timeframe. And in APAC, there its bit more of a complex answer because I think the situation in places like China is somewhat different than the outside of China. In China, we have to be very laser-focused on opportunities that we believe we actually have a good chance of winning and it’s very much a partner-led model in doing so. And that can result in some lumpiness. Now we actually had some good sequential performance in China in Q4. But generally speaking, as I said, that could be lumpy. More broadly speaking, outside of China, as you look at South Asia for example, there based on a number of wins that we’ve had historically and ongoing projects that we are working on, we are actually doing quite well and I am pleased with our performance there. And I expect that to continue throughout this year in 2015.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thank you. Next question please.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Ehud Gelblum of Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Ehud Gelblum: Hey, guys. Thank you. Appreciate it. Couple of things. First of all, Rami, just an open-ended question, I know, it’s been more specific. But the open-end question is, what difference are you -- you’re making a lot of difference I’m sure, but what different strategies have you set in place vis-à-vis website I was doing when you first came in and I did a full review of the product portfolio and took a look at couple businesses, continues posting one of that sold? Are there any other fundamental things that you’re changing or are you basically just taking current strategy that was there before that you obviously had a lot to do with and continuing it nicely? I have a follow-up that’s more specific [indiscernible]?
Rami Rahim: Okay. Let me address that question, thanks Ehud. So first, yes, you are right, you have to keep in mind that I was a part of the leadership team that developed, created that strategy and it’s a strategy that I very much believe in. It’s a strategy that from a go-to-market standpoint is laser-focused on key verticals that we believe will value the types of technologies and products that we develop and where we have the maximum chance of success. It’s a strategy where from an R&D standpoint, we’re really executing on the performance, scale capabilities that customers require, but just as importantly the software-driven innovation around automation, absolutely fundamental. So, that all remains absolutely intact. And we are executing towards that. There are changes or twist to the strategy as it pertains to security. I mentioned some of that in my prepared remarks upfront. But just to reiterate, we are pivoting away from thinking about security from a standpoint of Point products. We are moving much more towards integrated solutions across switching, routing and security that address domain level problems that our customers want from us. And we are executing on a very high leverage strategy and engineering across switching, routing and security. I will just say that there are tremendous assets across silicon and routing, or as I should say silicon and software that have largely gone untapped for security. And we have this incredible opportunity as a part, as a function of this new strategy to leverage these assets to give us relatively quick gains in the performance, scale and capabilities of our security products, and that’s exactly what we’re going to be executing on now.
Kathleen Nemeth: You had a follow-up. Go ahead. Okay. The next question.
Operator: Certainly, the next question is from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Simona Jankowski: Hi. Thanks very much. I just wanted to ask how much visibility you have into the ramp in the second half with some of your U.S. carrier customers and specifically the timing of the domain sort of ramp that you’ve been designed into? And taking that into account, assuming that those customers can normalize in the second half do you think it’s possible for your revenues for the year to grow as a whole?
Rami Rahim: Okay. So as far as the service provider timing, nobody has a crystal ball that tells us exactly what is going to be. But again based on the data that we gathered from our customer on an ongoing basis and understanding of the macro trends, we do believe second half will resume the growth that we had anticipated as we have said earlier Simona. I can’t really talk about any specific projects, but I will say this, we are very tightly aligned with our large service provider customers, both here in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. Everybody, many of our customers are looking at new approach to delivering services to their end users using cloud-based service delivery models. And I believe that we are very well-positioned with the products that we have [Technical Difficulty] having the strategy that we’re executing on to set ourselves up to participate in the growth once it resumes. So I can’t talk about any specific projects, but I can say, products like our virtual MX, products like the virtual SRX or what we call the Firefly that really represent a new way of service delivery using cloud-based models are exactly the kind of products that our customers are requesting today. And I think set ourselves up for success when spending starts to recover.
Kathleen Nemeth: Next question please.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Ashwin Kesireddy of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Ashwin Kesireddy: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Rami, could you comment on the strength in switching and how should we think about that going forward? Any color you could provide on the drivers of market share gains will be helpful. And I was hoping you could elaborate on some of the security features you’re planning to add to SRX and give us more concrete timelines on when you’re planning to add these new features. And then I’ve got one question for Robyn. I was trying to understand some of the factors that could have influenced the timing of the impairment. Why did you decide to pay that now? Is it just due to normal year end process? Are there any changes in customer contracts or other factors that could have led to this?
Rami Rahim: Okay. Thanks for the question. Let me start with the switching and security and then I’ll pass it over to Robyn for your last question. On the switching side, I think you need to keep in mind that around two, two and a half years ago, we took a step back and under -- and we set up a new strategy in switching or we took a lot of lessons that we had learned from the first set of products that we introduced into the market in the roadmap that we are now executing towards. So if you look at what we just announced last year, our QFX5100, our OCX1100 product, which is essentially a Junos-based white box switch. These are just the beginning of what I would consider a very compelling product roadmap that our customers are going to respond very well to in switching. And I have alluded to in the past and I will just reiterate again that we will continue the rolling thunder if you will of new products and switching this year that will contribute to the momentum that we expect. Now there are two dimensions to our switching business. There is, of course, the enterprise and the service provider. Service provider dimension has always been somewhat lumpy, and as a result of that predicting the ups and downs is not going to be all that easy, but I expect to continue to take market share in switching as a result of our go-to-market focus and our product strategy. In security, I can't really get into the timing, although you'll find out when we make the public announcements. I will just say that I'm very excited and encouraged by what the team has accomplished thus far. And just to give you a clue, because it is a high leverage strategy, it does not involve a large amount of time. We’re essentially leveraging technologies that we have already developed in the company but now packaging them up and testing them in a way that they contribute to our security capabilities. And they will be capabilities from the standpoint of performance, scale and our ability to detect and stop threat factors in the competition. Robyn?
Robyn Denholm: And so Ashwin, let me just address the goodwill and the timing of the impairment charge. We do a regular review of the current value of goodwill as required under GAAP. In Q4, the underperformance of the security revenues continued and so we took another look at that. In Q4, we also took into account the other factors that I mentioned in my prepared remarks around the restructuring that we have done in that business area in the security roadmaps and then also the pivot on the strategy as well. So all of those, as Rami mentioned before, culminated after his review of the security portfolio and so it’s the combination of factors. It’s not one factor that led us to impair the goodwill, the continuing underperformance and the product rationalization that we’ve completed now.
Kathleen Nemeth: Okay. Next question.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Mark Sue of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Mark Sue: Thank you. Rami, security, are we too lead into security at no longer standalone products in the future. Will you be leading and integrating it into routing and switching platforms, and is that something that customers are asking for? And then, Robyn on cash, you are returning more than your annual cash flow in buybacks and dividends. How should we think of cash flow from operations going forward? I think it’s around $800 million a year, maybe if you could just help us understand cash generation here versus abroad and the subsequent appropriate debt-to-equity ratio for Juniper?
Rami Rahim: Okay. Thanks, Mark. Let me start with the security question first and then I’ll pass it over to Robyn. I believe, the industry is moving in the direction in which securities increasingly being intimately tied with switching and routing, where understanding traffic pattern and flows through switches and routers actually allow you to improve your security posture, substantially, overall, when you look at a domain like the data center cloud or the service provider edge. So that’s effectively the strategy that we’re going to be executing towards. It does involve building security products and they are going to be very effective security products, but those products are going to be very much integrated if you will from a solution standpoint to switching and routing. They’re going to be tested together and there will be a very high leveraging of technology components between silicon and software across three of these product lines. So think of it from the standpoint of lots of cost synergies from the leveraging of technology, as well as revenue energy, very commensurate with what I believe that the industry is heading toward and how they think about the combinations of these products. Robyn?
Robyn Denholm: Thanks, Rami. And so, Mark, in terms of the cash position, as we mentioned that, we had strong operating cash flows for the year of 2014 about $763 million. We do generate cash strongly from the business in terms of our operating cash flow. We did last year return more than our free cash flow to shareholders. On the past, we’re on that task too and efficient capital structure as we’ve outlined previously. And therefore, you would expect that to happen last year and through the first half of this year, we anticipate buying back about a billion dollar shares as we’ve talked about before part of our repurchase and capital return program. In terms of overall debt to cash ratio, we are looking to maintain our investment grade rating and therefore, we’ll be now financial means in order to maintain that rating. And so that is what we’re doing as a company and we continuing to execute to that capital -- efficient capital structure, as well as our investment credit rating.
Kathleen Nemeth: Next question please?
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Tal Liani of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Tal Liani: Hi, guys. Sorry, I had to take it off mute. I have two quick questions. First one is about services, it declined 2.8% sequentially and in prior years it was always up in the fourth quarter. What is driving? I thought it's more stable source of revenue, so what is driving the decline? Second question is a follow-up …..
Robyn Denholm: Tal. Sorry, I was going to answer that one for you.
Tal Liani: All right.
Robyn Denholm: Allow me to do that one for you?
Tal Liani: Yes.
Robyn Denholm: So, Tal, we provided to table in the slides. The decline was purely the result of the post divestiture. So when you normalize to that services for the post business, we’re actually sequentially up. And so that business is very healthy as you see by the operating margins that we are yielding and actually the revenue continues to increase quite agnostically well.
Tal Liani: Thank you. So the question is about security and I am trying to understand the decline this quarter because over the last three years, there were two parts of security. SRX was up and the old NetScreen was down. And the magnitude of the decline this quarter suggest that SRX also has issues in the quarter that we -- in the period of time, not just the quarter where we see all other security companies reporting very strong quarters, very strong results. And I’m trying to understand what is wrong with SRX that is driving or what is missing, maybe it’s a better way to phrase it? What is missing in SRX that is driving revenues down that much and how can you fix it? Can you discuss the parts that are weak and you are going to improve? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Yeah. Sure, Tal. So you are right that there are two components to our security business. First is the NetScreen products or the ScreenOS products that have been in decline and continue to be decline, a fairly rapid decline in fact and now represents a relatively smaller fraction of our overall security business. The SRX products, they are the high end and the low end component and especially the high end component does have a sort of a lumpiness to it because it relies on large deals and typically they are service provider deals around the world. So, we did see that impacts us to some extent in the Q4 timeframe. But I think the overarching message that I want to get across on this call is that I am not pleased or satisfied with the performance of our security business. I think we can and will do better and this is a competitive space and we have to operate and innovate under that assumption. And that requires that we take a much more focused approach and ensuring that these products, the ones that you are asking about the Junos based products are going to be incredibly competitive against everybody else in the industry, especially as it pertains to integrated solutions of security and routing. That’s exactly what we are going to be focusing on, and that’s where you are going to see some of the enhancements that I have talked about coming out later this year.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thanks, Tal. Next question, Operator?
Operator: Certainly. The next question is from Bill Choi of Janney. Please go ahead.
Bill Choi: Okay. Thanks. Unfortunately, I’m going to have to go back to security here as well. I guess the problem we are having Rami is security, if anything is getting more specialized, not generically integrated with networking component. So, I could see from Juniper’s side how you could leverage your existing strengths and try to differentiate your solution. But which customers are actually asking for this? Is this kind of to Tal’s question, what kind of competitive dynamics are you seeing? Are you losing, when you are just focusing on your prior strength of your scalability, flows session? I mean, these were good enough to win, lead your businesses with mobile customers who were actually buying a ton of Gi firewalls going forward. So that’s probably the big one. Second just, if you guys could try to give a little more quantifications of the very positive comment on book-to-bill and perhaps kind of the visibility you might have on a product level basis, core versus edge routing and whether it’s more of the switching design wins that you had that is converting into revenue? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Yeah. Sure. Bill, thanks for the question. Let me address the security question and then I will hand it over to Robyn to talk about the financial metric that you are asking about. All right. The strategy that we need to be on is in fact the one that you are taking about right now, where we can -- we have to focus in areas where we can in fact be effective, where we actually have been effective historically. If for example, you are talking about the Gi firewall, their scale, performance, power efficiencies and the effectiveness of stopping attacks is very much there. And there are in fact synergies there with routing. And so this back-to-basics approach that I have just described or I can leverage some of the silicon enhancements that I have already funded, that I have already invested in to improve my routing and switching, can be used very effectively and securities can be done and that’s what we will do. So, I recognized that we are probably stretching your patience a little bit here with respect to this business. But I also want to emphasize that I’ve taken now a thorough look as part of my onboarding as CEO. And I’ve looked at, where it is that we should focus and where we should not focus. And as a result of that, we’ve come out with this high-leverage strategy that I think will make us very competitive in the securities space.
Robyn Denholm: And Bill, in terms of the book-to-bill, I can say that it was greater than one in fact I think much greater than one you replace with the book-to-bill, our backlog was at about $445 million exiting the year, roughly flat with the beginning of the fiscal year, which we’ll replace about.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thank you. Next question please?
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Amitabh Passi of UBS. Please go ahead.
Amitabh Passi: Hi. Thank you. I had question and then a follow-up. I guess my first question was for you Robyn. The midpoint of your revenue guidance is roughly about $1.04 billion. I think for last quarter it was $1.05 billion but your guided gross margins at 64% plus or minus last quarter and this quarter at 63.5%. So nothing of fact, just curious why the 50 basis point reduction and should we expect things to normalize around 64% as we progress through the year?
Robyn Denholm: Yes, but firstly thanks Amitabh. In terms of the gross margins to date, we did call out for the guidance range that there will be towards the low end of our long-term model that we’re actually -- have been our long term targets that we called out in October. And then it’s a fixed result of Q1 mix in all that volume reduction as we mentioned in the prepared remarks. In terms of the ongoing gross margin on place with the performance of gross margin as I’ve mentioned for the full year of 2014, we were roughly flat with ’13. That’s really a reflection of the intense focus that we have on the cost side of the supply chain and also a reflection of the value that customers see in the innovation that we are bringing to market. And so as we move forward here, we expect to be in the range that I talked about at the Investor Day which is 64 plus or minus a bit.
Amitabh Passi: I think there is still a lot of confusion out there in terms of what exactly vMX means for you for Juniper. Can you maybe clarify for us how exactly are you positioning the vMX? What are you hearing from your customers initially and how do they intend to buy the vMS versus your physical MX?
Rami Rahim: Yeah, sure. Let me try to demystify it for you. So if you look at Juniper’s routing business overall, vMX is in fact a router, just has to be a virtualized router. We make the bulk of our revenue in the high performance end of that range i.e. the larger systems are the systems that sell the most, just by virtue of the applications and the used cases that we are solving for our customers. There is also market out there for low end routers. It’s a market that we are not as penetrated in today. It is a market where this trend of virtualization will in fact impact first because virtualization i.e. this movement of services in the case of virtual MX. It’s a layer three routing service on to virtual machines that fit on standard servers is interesting in some -- and it’s ability to deliver agility to our customers. But it certainly cannot keep up with the performance that our customers require for their high-end applications where we already are very well penetrated today. So the net of what I’ve just said is that, the Virtual MX represents a great opportunity for Juniper to go after the low-end routing environment and use cases for our customers. So where are our customers are thinking about deploying small PE router that the service provide edge, they now might consider using a Virtual MX software license, download it off of our website and deployed on a standard rack servers, that’s a revenue opportunity for Juniper and of course, the profit opportunity for Juniper. So it’s highly complimentary with the rest of our portfolio. It still, I don’t -- I want to also set some expectation, because the market is still in its early stages here. This is a developing market. But in developing and shipping this product, we are essentially sending the message and putting a stake in the ground to our customers that we want to participate in this emerging market with really compelling feature rich products, a product like this is one that we are -- we have to be proud enough of to put the MX logo on it and that’s essentially what we have done.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thank you. Next question.
Operator: The next question is from Paul Silverstein of Cowen. Please go ahead.
Paul Silverstein: Thank you. Rami, I think a short way, in recent history all of you noticed that is, you are particularly focused on cloud opportunity and enterprise switching business. My question is, can you give us some breakdown between the cloud, data center portion of business than more generic to your assortment price campus use? And as we go forward, many metrics you can offer us in terms of number of customers, progress, et cetera, that speak to your success, to wonder you are another to go forward with respect to your switching business? And one additional question, with respect to your new products in 2015, switching and routing? How much of the growth you expect will come from these new products and given that historically, there is a lag period for any company between product introduction and revenue generation, you are assuming success? What is the timeframe? What do you expecting in terms of timeframe in that as well?
Kathleen Nemeth: Paul, it’s Kathleen. So we are as you know running closer on time, so which question would you like to prioritize?
Paul Silverstein: We will go with the first one Kathleen?
Kathleen Nemeth: All right. So the one on the cloud.
Rami Rahim: Okay. So on the cloud and especially as it pertain to the switching opportunity. If you look at our business today, there -- the bulk of our switching product fell into either data center or some combination of data center and campus. And even when you look at the campus dimension of this, it’s actually the larger, more mission critical campuses that we are going after, because quite frankly, it’s geared toward customers that care about carrier class capabilities, performance and scalability that we address very well. So that is how I would look at the business today. Now as we start to introduce some of the new products. Certainly, we will have an opportunity to go deeper into these exiting opportunities and the enterprise for data center and mission critical campus. But we also open up new opportunities in the cloud providers and financial services in particular. That’s how we’d characterize where we are today and the opportunity going forward. I’ll just touch very briefly on the second question which is a -- yes, I mean, you’re right. Even if we introduce new products this year, there is the typical certification and qualification cycle that can take a quarter -- I should say few quarters by our customers. Enterprise customers will typical make that more on the lower end of the range, maybe a quarter to two quarters service by the customers could take nine months to a year of certification.
Kathleen Nemeth: Next question?
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Subu Subrahmanyan of The Juda Group. Please go ahead.
Subu Subrahmanyan: Thank you. Rami, I wanted to ask about customer segments. You made the point at analyst event, how the cloud operators now represent 16% of revenues versus 14% for the U.S. large service providers. So one part of the growth story is waiting for the U.S. service providers tend to get better, the other part is you have higher exposure to the growing parts. So can you talk about the puts and takes, maybe talk about what the growth rate you’re seeing in the faster growing segments are and how much reliance you still have on U.S. service providers to get better to see growth return in the second half?
Rami Rahim: Yeah. Sure, Subu. So certainly, you picked up on something that’s very important, which is that -- and you see this in our Q4 results, in fact, which is that we have offset some of the weakness in the large U.S. service providers by diversifying our business across a number of key verticals including cloud providers and cable. That is by design, that is very much a function of our strategy. And I think that’s a very healthy thing to do and we will continue to do just that. So whereas we anticipate a recovery in spending by our large service provider customers in the second half, we certainly are not counting completely on that. We’re also executing on this high diversification strategy across all of our key verticals both from a go-to-market focus standpoint as well as from the solutions that we’re developing for those verticals.
Robyn Denholm: And Subu, if I can just add, in my prepared remarks today, I talked about the full year of 2014, just like at the Analyst Day, I talked about the three quarters through the end of Q3 of 2014. A similar sort of pattern as Rami mentioned happened in the fourth quarter as well. What we thought for the full year of 2014 is that the U.S. large service providers were actually down year-over-year and they were offset by growth in cable and content service providers. And that was the thing that we talked about at the Analyst Day as being an important one because what it does is that it shows not only the diversification of the revenue but also the applicability of the technology and the solutions that we’re developing across multiple customer segment and that includes the Enterprise, because enterprise for the full year was pretty steady. It was actually a good performance for enterprise for the year. So, I think that is a very big part of the leverage strategy that Rami’s talked about in terms of the product portfolio that we have and also going forward in terms of growth, targeting those areas that are going faster than the rest.
Kathleen Nemeth: Next question?
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Brain Modoff with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Brian Modoff: Yeah, guys. Question really on the switching side. You’ve been really selling mainly top-of-rack switches, two main competitors in the spine switchovers than Cisco. I know you’ve got to work in that area. When can we see a product and how you plan to target it from your go-to market strategy and that’s it? Thanks.
Rami Rahim: Yeah. Sure. Thanks Brian. You are right. I think that the switching products that we have today limit the opportunities to very specific opportunities that we go after, where we know that we can be successful based on the capabilities of our product portfolio. We do have a programmable spine today that’s very useful for certain types of cloud data centers and campus environment, this is EX9200. But that said, if the requirement is more around very dense spine switches than there the product positions that we have is the QFabric. Now, yes, I have alluded to the fact that we are introducing more products in the switching space of this year and certainly I expect that those products are going to help us address a broader set of applications across a broader set of vertical markets, including as I just mentioned in the cloud provider space.
Kathleen Nemeth: Okay. That is all the time we have this afternoon. Thank you so much for joining us today. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Juniper Networks Third Quarter 2014 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Kathleen Nemeth, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Here on the call are Shaygan Kheradpir, Chief Executive Officer; and Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial and Operations Officer. Vince Molinaro, Executive Vice President, Chief Customer Officer; and Rami Rahim, Executive Vice President, Juniper Development and Innovation, will be available for the Q&A portion of the call. Please remember when listening to today's call that statements concerning Juniper's business outlook, economic and market outlook, strategy, future financial operating results, overall future prospects, planned operating, expensed reductions and capital allocation plans are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including: economic conditions generally or within the networking industry, changes in the overall technology spending and spending by communication service providers and other major customers, the network capacity requirements of service providers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply chain constraints, variation in the mix of products sold, customer perception and acceptance of our products, rapid technological and market change, litigation, the potential impact of activities related to the execution of Juniper's Integrated Operating Plan and other factors listed in our most recent 10-Q and 8-K filed with the SEC. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances change after the date of the call. Our discussion of the financial results today will include non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why the management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult the press release furnished with our 8-K filed with the SEC today. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results, please see the Investor Relations section of our website. In today's call, we will also be providing forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, other than revenue and share count, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis. All guidance is forward-looking, and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier. A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance to GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to the charges which are excluded for non-GAAP guidance. As a reminder, we completed the sale of our Junos Pulse security product line earlier this month. Please ensure your financial models are appropriately adjusted. Further information and our long-term model will be shared during our Investor Day later this month in New York City. Please note that today's call is scheduled to last for 1 hour. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll turn the call over to Shaygan.
Shaygan Kheradpir: Thanks, Kathleen, and welcome, everyone. I wanted to give you an update on progress at Juniper, including the impact of industry trends on our revenues, our work on our Integrated Operating Plan and steps we are taking to ensure we are well positioned to deliver shareholder value going forward. While we have made significant progress executing beyond our IOP commitments associated with capital return and operating expenses, we are disappointed with our revenue performance this quarter. Our Q3 revenue declined 5% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. The primary driver was lower-than-expected demand and slower ramp-up of new projects from service providers, particularly in the U.S. That said, our traction with Web 2.0 leaders has allowed us to partially offset the decline in carrier spending and increase the diversity of our revenue base. Notwithstanding these industry headwinds, we delivered non-GAAP EPS within our guidance range. We did so by maintaining strong gross margins, diligently managing expenses and executing aggressively against our IOP capital return goals. We have met or exceeded our commitments set forth in our Integrated Operating Plan in February while not losing sight of strategic engagements with key customers. We achieved our original cost reduction target this quarter by getting to a $500 million quarterly OpEx level from $539 million in fourth quarter of 2013. This came 2 quarters ahead of the original commitment. We're now further reducing our operating expense levels to $1,900,000,000 for the fiscal year 2015, a meaningful reduction from current levels. We believe that by continuing to take this kind of surgical approach to our cost reduction efforts, we can still invest sufficiently to grow our business and lead the next wave of IP networking innovation. Our One-Juniper organizational structure is allowing us to get products to market faster and cheaper as our common operating system and coalesced engineering and go-to-market teams continue to operate faster and more efficiently. In fact, we are excited about our product pipeline ahead and pleased with progress in our pivot to strategic vertical markets focused on cloud building and high-IQ networking. We have also exceeded our capital return commitment set forth at the Integrated Operating Plan. Our commitment through Q1 2015 was to return $2 billion of capital. We will return greater than that by Q4 2014. Our commitment through 2016 was to return $3 billion in capital. We have increased the size of our capital return program by $1.1 billion and now plan to return $4.1 billion by the end of 2016. Given market conditions, we will take an aggressive stance and will plan to repurchase $1.5 billion by the end of Q2 2015. We also announced today a $0.10 per share cash dividend to be paid in Q4 with the intent to grow it in line with earnings over time. I'd like to spend a few moments discussing the macro environment and our business. As I've stated previously, I believe the global networking market is at an inflection point, presenting substantial opportunities for growth. The underlying long-term demand trends support the need for increased investment in the network. Based upon historical trends and discussions with customers, we feel investment will return in the second half of next year, and that our integrated portfolio of routing, switching and security products will be well positioned to address critical customer requirements. Despite weaker macro conditions, the market fundamentals for Juniper's routing products continue to be healthy, and our customer base continues to be increasingly diversified. In Security, we saw good demand for high-end SRX products from service providers. Switching revenue declined quarter-over-quarter as we experienced an ebb in the wave of customer build-outs that we saw earlier in the year. Though we continue to see momentum for our switching products, we expect modest improvements until the recent wave of customer design wins ramps in 2015. We continue to see our integrated solutions as a fundamental building block and a differentiating factor for customers of cloud building and high-IQ networking, including the focus on secure routing and switching solutions for active defense. So what should you expect moving forward? We are focused on continuing to drive long-term shareholder value through profitable growth. We assume the carrier spending will remain constrained for several quarters, and we are streamlining our business with the before-mentioned operating expense reductions. We expect this to result in healthy year-over-year operating margin expansion in 2015. I am enthusiastic about our technology roadmap to deliver the next wave of IP networking, and I'm confident in our strong market position. We remain intensely focused on operational excellence, cost discipline and targeted growth initiatives. We appreciate the support of our shareholders and thank our employees for their ongoing commitment and relentless dedication to execution. Now I'll turn it over to Robyn to provide more details on our financial results.
Robyn M. Denholm: Thank you, Shaygan, and good afternoon, everyone. The September quarter was challenging from a revenue perspective primarily because the Service Provider demand, particularly in the U.S., is slowing more than expected. Despite this, we delivered non-GAAP earnings within our original guidance range due to our continued focus on cost reduction initiatives. Before I go into detail on the results of the quarter, I'd like to provide an update on our Integrated Operating Plan. We continue to make good progress against our targets. We have achieved our IOP quarterly operating expense target 2 quarters earlier than expected. We also completed the consolidation of our Sunnyvale campus and negotiated an early exit of our lease, which has resulted in a credit of $26 million against our prior restructuring estimate. As announced on October 2, we finalized the sale of the Junos Pulse business. As a result, we anticipate booking a GAAP gain on the sale in Q4 of 2014. As expected, our Q3 results reflect a full quarter of this business. We are executing well on our capital return plan. We paid our inaugural dividend of $0.10 per share in September. We also completed our $1.2 billion ASR in July and repurchased an additional $550 million of shares in Q3. Since inception of our Integrated Operating Plan, we have reduced our fully diluted share count by 10% and 13% over the last 2 years. I'm very pleased at the pace of our cost reductions and our progress towards a more efficient capital structure. In the outlook section, I will provide detail on the additional costs and capital allocation action mentioned by Shaygan. Now let's turn to an analysis of the Q3 results. Demand was relatively weak in the quarter. Our product book-to-bill was approximately 1, and bookings were almost $100 million less than we expected. Total product deferred revenue declined $57 million year-over-year and $29 million versus last quarter. The sequential decrease was mainly the result of the sell-through of channel-related inventory and the reclassification of the Junos Pulse deferred revenue to a held-for-sale asset category. Total revenue for the quarter was $1,126,000,000, down 5% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. Product revenue was $810 million, down 10% year-over-year and 13% over last quarter. Services revenue was $316 million, up 11% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. For the quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.23, an increase of $0.04 year-over-year, including a $0.03 benefit from restructuring credit. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.36, up $0.03 year-over-year and down $0.04 versus last quarter. The sequential decrease was due to lower revenue, partially offset by improvements in gross margin and operating expenses. Looking at our revenue for Q3. There were 4 primary factors which negatively impacted our results versus our expectations. U.S. carrier spending was worse than we had expected, and Web 2.0 Switching revenue was lower than anticipated due to the timing of deployments and the slower ramp of new projects. To a lesser extent, we saw a softening in the broad-based enterprise market and a greater-than-expected slowdown in demand from Eastern European service providers. Now let's look at the revenue results in detail. Americas revenue was up 3% year-over-year and down 5% sequentially. Americas Service Provider was up 1% year-over-year and down 7% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by Web 2.0 and cable provider growth, partially offset by decline from carrier demand. The sequential decline was driven by weak demand by large carriers and a significant reduction in Web 2.0 Switching revenue in the quarter, partially offset by continued strength in cable providers and Web 2.0 routing. Americas Enterprise was up 5% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Sequentially, we saw continued strength in the U.S. federal market and financial services, which was offset by some softness in the broad enterprise market. EMEA revenue was down 5% over last year and 11% versus last quarter. The year-over-year decrease was due to declines in Western Europe and the Middle East, primarily in Service Providers, whilst the sequential decrease was driven by weakness in Eastern Europe. APAC was down 28% year-over-year and 19% versus last quarter, primarily due to Service Provider weakness in China and Japan. Service Provider revenue for the quarter was $742 million, down 6% year-over-year due to EMEA and APAC and U.S. carriers, partially offset by a slight increase in the Americas from Web 2.0 and cable providers. Sequentially, Service Provider revenue for the quarter was down 11% due to declines across all 3 geographies. Enterprise revenue was $384 million, down 3% year-over-year and sequentially. APAC and EMEA were down in the broader enterprise market year-over-year. Sequentially, the decline was partially offset by continued strength in the U.S. federal market and financial services. By product area, Routing product revenue was $533 million, down 12% year-over-year and 14% sequentially. The declines were driven by weakness in the carrier market in both core and edge. We saw good traction in both the PTX and MX2020 product lines. Enterprise Routing was healthy. Switching product revenue was $155 million, an increase of 5% year-over-year, driven by QFX into service providers, partially offset by a decline in the EX, mainly in the broad enterprise market. Sequentially, Switching product revenues declined 22%, coming off a record revenue in Q2. The decline was the result of lower demand from our Web 2.0 and softness from our broad enterprise customers. Security product revenue was $121 million, down 16% year-over-year but up 9% versus last quarter. Our SRX platform and security software were down 6% year-over-year and up 11% sequentially, mainly as a result of increased demand by service providers. Moving on to gross margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margins for the quarter was 65.2% compared to 64.4% a year ago and 64.2% last quarter. The improvements were driven by an increase in both product and services gross margins. Non-GAAP product gross margins were 66.1%, up 0.7 points from both a year ago and last quarter, mainly due to favorability in product mix and reductions in costs. Non-GAAP gross margins for services were 63%, up 1.7 points from a year ago and 2.5 points versus last quarter. The increases were due to lower support-related costs from operational improvements and savings from variable costs. We are pleased to report that our non-GAAP operating expenses were $493 million, well below the range we gave last quarter, reflecting our focus on cost as well as the benefit of reduced variable costs in the quarter. Our headcount at the end of the quarter was 9,059, which includes approximately 200 employees who transitioned as a result of the sale of the Junos Pulse business. Adjusting for the exiting Pulse employees, headcount declined 7% versus Q4 of 2013. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 21.5%, reflecting a year-over-year expansion of 1.7 points due to continued cost reductions. We experienced 0.1 point sequential of decline due to lower revenue, partially offset by improved gross margins and lower operating expenses. The non-GAAP tax rate was 27% compared to 26% last quarter as a result of the increase in the mix of U.S.-based taxable income. The GAAP tax rate was 37.4% compared to 24.9% in Q2 due to a change in the geographic mix of earnings and other onetime items. We ended the third quarter with approximately $2 billion of net cash and investments. The decline was primarily due to the capital return of $594 million. Onshore cash and investments represented approximately 26% of total gross cash balance. For the quarter, we saw a net cash outflow from operations of $79 million, mainly due to timing differences in working capital, specifically an increase in accounts receivable, payments for incentive comp, tax payment and a reduction in deferred revenue. In Q4, we expect to return to our historical pattern of strong positive cash flows. DSO was 49 days, up from 41 days last quarter due to the timing of shipments and invoicing linearity. Capital expenditures were $43 million, and depreciation and amortization expense was $44 million. Now I will provide our outlook for Q4. As a reminder, these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis, except for revenue and share count. The demand environment for our largest U.S. carrier customers continues to be challenging. We have good relationships and design wins with these customers. However, the timing of deployments and improved demand is uncertain. At this stage, we are taking a prudent and cautious stance on revenue over the next several quarters. As previously mentioned, we completed the sale of Junos Pulse, and the quarterly revenue impact of approximately $30 million has been factored into the Q4 guidance. For the fourth quarter of 2014, we expect revenues to range from $1,025,000,000 to $1,075,000,000. Gross margins are expected to be 64%, plus or minus 0.5%. Operating expenses are expected to be $480 million, plus or minus $5 million. Operating margins are expected to be 18.5% at the midpoint of guidance. We expect a flat tax rate versus the third quarter. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $0.28 and $0.32 per share, assuming a weighted average share count of approximately 435 million. I'm also pleased to report that the board has approved a dividend of $0.10 per share for the fourth quarter. For the full year 2014, using the midpoint of Q4 guidance, revenues are expected to be approximately $4,576,000,000. Gross margins will be approximately 64%. Operating expenses will be approximately $2,030,000,000, and operating margins will be just under 20%. EPS is expected to be approximately $1.35. Excluding Junos Pulse revenues of $95 million for the first 3 quarters of 2014, Pulse adjusted full year revenue will be about $4,480,000,000. Now I'd like to move into a discussion of how we are planning the business for 2015. We see the long-term demand drivers as healthy, and we are confident in our innovation pipeline. We continue to earn good design wins across our carrier, web services, cable and enterprise accounts. That said, we are planning for the overall revenue environment to be challenging over the next several quarters as near-term factors are impacting demand from our largest Service Provider customers. Given this market environment, we are targeting 2015 operating expenses of $1,900,000,000, plus or minus $25 million. This is a $130 million reduction for our estimated full year 2014 operating expense levels and translates to a $260 million aggregate IOP commitment. To achieve these additional savings, we will continue to carefully manage headcount, drive efficiency improvements and prioritize revenue-generating projects and resources. As part of our ongoing commitment to drive shareholder value, we also announced earlier today that the board has approved an additional $1.1 billion to the previously authorized capital return program. This brings our total capital return commitment to shareholders, including dividends, to $4.1 billion through 2016. As a reminder, our original IOP commitment was to return $3 billion to shareholders through 2016. We have been opportunistic and aggressive in reducing our share count and have paid our first dividend. This brings the total return to shareholders through the end of Q3 2014 to $1.8 billion. We expect to continue to be opportunistic and aggressive in reducing our share count given the current market conditions, and we are currently expecting to complete a minimum of $1.5 billion in aggregate share repurchases before the end of Q2 2015. Given these additional actions, even with a cautious revenue outlook, we expect significant year-over-year operating margin and earnings per share expansion in 2015. In summary, we remain committed to returning value to shareholders while maintaining the financial flexibility to invest in innovation and growth. I am very proud of our team and thank them for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper. Now let's open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jess Lubert from Wells Fargo Securities.
Jess L. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: You gave some color on your expected operating expenses for 2015. Can you also let us know if you expect to grow next year? And can you help us understand how you're thinking about Q1 seasonality given the weaker second half? And then despite fairly soft router sales, you suggested fundamentals in the business remained healthy. So I was hoping to understand what's driving confidence here in this market. And given the carrier focus on NFV technologies and reducing costs, what leads you to believe the business will snap back in the second half?
Shaygan Kheradpir: Jess, this is Shaygan. I'll make a few comments and I'll pass it to Robyn. One, I would say that the visibility to revenue in the near term, in the next few quarters, is poor. And this is because we're going through a cycle, as you know, and these cycles take 2 to 4 quarters. We think it started last quarter. Plus, in our last earnings call, we also mentioned that there are some specific dynamics in the carrier market in the U.S. So put them all together, it gives us poor visibility into the near future on revenues. Because we think these cycles typically take 2 to 4 quarters, at this point in time, our planning assumption is that growth will return in the second half of 2015. And we're planning our business accordingly. Robyn, do want to say a few words?
Robyn M. Denholm: No, I think that's very good, Shaygan. In terms of the near-term environment, as we mentioned, for the fourth quarter, our guidance -- we obviously put that number out there. And then we do expect that we're in this 2- to 4-quarter cycle, as Shaygan talked about. For the full year next year, we're not putting out specific revenue numbers. As Shaygan mentioned, the environment is challenging. We expect that to continue for the next several quarters. So our planning assumptions at this point is that we expect that challenging environment to continue through the first half of next year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Amitabh Passi from UBS.
Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Shaygan, if I look at Juniper over the last 4 years, you had an up year, a down year, an up year, a down year. And it seems like the company is becoming increasingly cyclical. So I guess I wanted to get your thoughts. We talk a lot about a lot of secular underlying drivers, but we're not quite seeing it in your business. And so would love to get your thoughts in terms of can we get a secular growth trajectory for Juniper or is the company increasingly now cyclical?
Shaygan Kheradpir: Amitabh, good question. I mean, if you look at the curves, your statement is actually correct. It looks like sinusoids going back many years. But you also -- the other observation is the magnitude of the sinusoids are coming down in terms of how they swing. What I can say is our business is increasingly diversified. If you look at it this year, Amitabh, most of our growth has come from Web 2.0s, a little bit from cable and so forth. So our strategic vertical that these are selected, we selected them for this specific purpose because we think, be it cable, carrier, Web 2.0, financial services, federal government and so forth, these are the verticals that are going to carry us forward. And we think while some are taller than others in terms of growth capability, we think over the medium to long term, they're going to be within -- I mean, some of them are going to be within the same zone. So we see continued diversity of revenue, but we are -- traditionally has been -- we have a carrier base. And as you know, the carrier CapEx cycles do exist, and it's something that we don't control industry spend. And when they swing down, we swing down with them. And when they go up, we go up with them. But now we have these other 3 engines, and we expect them to grow over time. Robyn, any more comments on that?
Robyn M. Denholm: I think -- I think that said it well. I think also the question around the router cycles and whether we expect them to continue, I think Rami can comment on that as well.
Rami Rahim: Sure, happy to. I mean, when I look at the Routing fundamentals, obviously the first thing you're going to look at is traffic. And all our indication is that traffic continues to grow across all of our customer base, whether it be the Web service providers, telcos, cable operators. I think that's sort of a truth among all of them. There are certainly trends that are happening in the industry and where -- these are obviously trends that we factor into our strategy. But when you take a look at these trends, whether they be Layer 4 to Layer 7, service virtualization or things like the virtualization of the CPE, so low-end routing virtualization or SDN for the purpose of automation, I view these as all largely complementary to our strategy. So this is very much an opportunity for us. It's very, very difficult to virtualize the kind of product, or I'd say impossible, to virtualize the kind of product that solved the performance necessary to deal with capacity growth. So this is why I'm confident in the long term.
Operator: Our next question comes from Pierre Felgaru (sic) [Pierre Ferragu] from Bernstein.
Pierre Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: So you -- on the Service Provider front, you mentioned specific dynamics that prevent the carriers to spend in the near term. I think we understand well what's happening in the U.S. You have like the debate with Netflix. You have like net neutrality. You have ongoing merger discussions. But what was very surprising this quarter is actually weakness of your revenues in the rest of the world. You mentioned China. You mentioned Eastern Europe. You mentioned Japan as well. Could you maybe review these geographies one by one? And maybe tell us -- it's probably like 2, 3 major clients in each of them. So it would be helpful to get some kind of color on what's happening, what's creating this lack of visibility in these regions as well?
Shaygan Kheradpir: Thanks, Pierre, for the question. Actually, we have Vince Molinaro here, who is our Executive Vice President for go-to-market globally. And he -- Vince, can you respond to Pierre...
Vincent J. Molinaro: Sure. Thanks. Thanks for the question, Pierre. Like Robyn discussed and mentioned, we were down in Asia Pacific, primarily because of China and Japan, largely due to Service Provider and a few projects that have come to conclusion. And we have seen a first half with some real good design wins that will carry forward. As I look into Q4, in Asia Pacific in general, look to flat to slightly up. And the reason for that, from my perspective, we're seeing growth in Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia, Southeast Asia in general for opportunities for the broad portfolio. Rami just mentioned traffic growth, and specifically in that part of the world, LTE and mobile build-outs presenting opportunities for us in access and aggregation in mobile backhaul as well as traditional core routing, edge and security. I'll also say in Asia Pacific, the focus in our verticals is beginning to resonate with both our Service Provider and Enterprise customers, particularly in Web and in cloud provider, Web 2.0 companies in India and Japan. So hopefully, that rounds out the picture for you. In EMEA -- in EMEA, I kind of characterize that steady as they go. Good first half. And again, as Robyn mentioned, some geopolitical issues in Eastern Europe and Middle East. We are seeing good traction with new design wins across the entire portfolio. And again, that is in our Enterprise and our Service Provider business across all verticals and even in the strategic verticals like higher education, for example. I think the other area of opportunity, the European providers, they typically invest as the demand presents itself. Traffic is growing in EMEA, 38% to 50% in the public space year-on-year. High network utilization, so we're -- and everything mobile. And that growth is pretty significant. So we're watching the industry dynamic and in the geographies that Robyn mentioned. But in general, we just see a steady trend going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ehud Gelblum from Citigroup.
Ehud A. Gelblum - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I have a couple of clarifications first before my question. First of all, Robyn, I just want to make sure that you didn't mention anything about the 25% operating margin target for 2015. If you can comment on that, if that's still on the table. You didn't mention it, so I'll put that out there as a clarification. Lower OpEx, another clarification. How much of that, Robyn, was reversal of prior bonus accruals so not really where the OpEx would've been if we were doing it on a quarter-by-quarter basis? Third, Switching, obviously, fell pretty substantially and you gave some good reasons. I'm assuming within that, was it mainly the Web guys you're talking about? Are there other verticals that we should just be aware of in there? Was U.S. Service Provider in there? And then finally, Kathleen, I know you're going to love this, but AT&T CapEx, if you look at what they did, they're obviously a big part of what you guys do and dictate a lot. They were very strong in the first half of the year. They haven't change their full year number, $21 billion. It's still pretty much set in stone. So if you mapped out AT&T's CapEx, wireless, wireline, however you slice it, the fall-off in Q3 and the further fall-off in Q4 was put in stone back in June, July. So what really did change as you went through this quarter that seemed to be a surprise versus what AT&T was telling you? Was it kind of a mix in that CapEx number? Because the total CapEx number seems to kind of flow with what your new numbers are versus what you had previously thought going into the preannouncement.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thank you, Ehud. So there were 4 comments there, 2 clarifications, 2 questions. We will address 2 of them, 1 clarification and 1 question. Which would like them to be?
Ehud A. Gelblum - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. How about the lower OpEx bonus accruals for the clarification and then the AT&T CapEx question for the question.
Kathleen Nemeth: Okay. All right. You got it. Thanks, Ehud.
Robyn M. Denholm: So I'll address the OpEx question. So you're right, we did have some variable comp in the quarter in Q3. I actually called it out in the script. We said it was about $10 million in terms of the fourth quarter guidance. So in other words, we did 4 -- we're putting out $480 million, plus or minus $5 million. There's about $8 million to $10 million in there that's variable-comp related.
Shaygan Kheradpir: Yes. And Ehud, on your second question, obviously, we don't comment on any specific customer. So let me make my comments general. And in fact, I read your report. Nice job on the one you've just recently written on another customer on the same issue. And I think it's -- you can project that to my comments. So it's -- as you said, it's the mix and where service providers are spending their money and what part of the network. That's the answer to the question, essentially. And so it is -- if that's in the mix area, that is the answer to the question.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thanks, Ehud.
Operator: The next question comes from Jeff Kvaal from Northland.
Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division: My question is, I think, a number of us on this side do worry a little bit about the declining R&D budget and to make sure that the pipeline continues to generate the technical -- technically leading products that you are known for. Could you give us a little bit -- perhaps maybe a bit of an example of how you can be reducing the R&D and yet continuing to not suffer from a thinner pipeline of product or maybe an example of where the efficiency has come into play? I think that would be helpful.
Shaygan Kheradpir: So Jeff, I'll make a few comments and I'll then have Rami go into perhaps examples and give more color. So first of all, in the whole Integrated Operating Plan, the issue has been focus and unleashing the talent of our best R&D and go-to-market people for innovation. And so we said that many, many times we know R&D is the lifeblood of this company. In fact, I am super excited about the product pipeline, and this is not infinity. This is in front of us. So you should rest assured that innovation and engineering and product pipeline is healthy. It's broad. It's deep and it's very exciting. And so you should just rest assured on that. And we are very focused to ensure that our R&D is focused on things that matter to the customers, where the market is going and making sure that we are not wasting our resources in areas that don't matter. Now with that, I'll pass it to Rami.
Rami Rahim: Sure. So most of, if not all, of the changes that we've done in R&D to reduce the OpEx have been structural in nature. So it's around streamlining the organization in such a way that allows us to deduplicate functions that were, quite frankly, duplicated only because of the organizational design. So that has been eliminated. Beyond that, we've been very, very vigilant with respect to the priorities of the projects that we're working on, making sure that everything that we are working on is aligned 100% with the company's strategy. And as you know, we've said in the past, that has resulted in stopping development of certain projects and products. So there are a number of pre-revenue-generating projects we were working on that we are not anymore. We just divested the Pulse business as you are aware of not because it's a bad business but because of the fact that we could not invest in it ourselves and also all of the other things that we know we need to do for the company's strategy. The last thing I will say is now that all of R&D is in a single organization, one of the fundamental tenets, if you will, of our engineering principles is to leverage, is to make sure that all of our technology components across silicon systems and software are highly leverageable across all of our product lines. And this is something that we're very much executing towards.
Shaygan Kheradpir: Thanks, Rami.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Sue from RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: If I look at the year-over-year decline, it's actually the worst in the company's history since the IPO. And that's despite the company being more diversified and despite traffic growing every single year. So underneath the cyclical nature, is there a fundamental change that's going on in the business? Is there an increasing structural issue, price deflation, shifts in purchasing power by carriers? And if that's the case, we understand you're addressing the OpEx for the cyclical part, but what are the plans to address the structural part?
Shaygan Kheradpir: Mark, yes. I think if you look at the numbers, the overwhelming majority of this is carriers. It's U.S. carriers. It is the cyclical nature of their buying. Once you open that cover, there are things. There are pluses and minuses, and they always are in the business. But I would say is that is the bulk of the issue that we saw in the third quarter. Robyn, do want to say a few words on that?
Robyn M. Denholm: No, I think that covered it, actually.
Operator: Next question comes from Simona Jankowski from Goldman Sachs.
Simona Kiritsov Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I wanted to ask a clarification and a question as well. Just on the clarification, again, I wanted to follow up on the question on 25% operating margin for next year, if that's still on the table as your target. And then my question was just digging in a little bit into the Switching business given the sharp decline there. Can you just characterize for us a little bit how lumpy that business is in terms of customer concentration? Are there are a handful of maybe 10%, 15% customers in there that could have driven the magnitude that we saw in the decline?
Shaygan Kheradpir: Simona, I'll take a crack at that quickly at both, and then on the second one, I'll pass it again to Rami. So on the first one, 25% is our long-term target and very achievable. The visibility to revenue, as you know, has turned quite poor just in the past 6 weeks. If you look at the CapEx numbers from the big carriers, you would see how they have changed and it's just the past 4 to 6 weeks. What we control is our costs, our products, our customer relationships, the design wins. All of those are well in hand. We've got great customer relationships, a lot of design wins. On the costs, we have given you definitive numbers, which is 1.9, minus 25, plus 25. And based on our track record on our costs so far, you can see how we come with costs. We're doing that while preserving ability to invest sufficiently for growth despite the challenging environment. And when you put it all together, we're going to expand operating margins significantly from 2014 to 2015. And this is just arithmetic, this number, depends on revenue. And revenue, we don't control industry spend. The visibility is poor. And these things can change very quickly. They have just in the past 6 weeks. And so whenever -- and we are constructive on the second half of this year. We think we're going to get growth back. That will depend on the revenue number. But we are very focused on the 25%, and we think it's very achievable as a long-term target.
Rami Rahim: Switching. So should I comment on Switching? Simona, so first, to your question about concentration. Certainly, there is a Service Provider and an Enterprise component to our Switching business. The Service Provider component tends to be fewer larger deals, fewer larger customers than the Enterprise. That's natural. We've always said that the SP portion is going to be lumpy, and this quarter was certainly an example of that. And I would say, I mean, we're certainly disappointed in our results. I think we can and will do better in Switching. So what gives me confidence about the Switching business going forward? First is we've had a number of wins that just haven't yet been -- gone into deployment mode that will kick in, in future quarters. Second is if you take a look at what we've done in Switching in terms of R&D over the last couple of years is we've realigned the organization. We've focused it on a new strategy and product roadmap, and we're now just starting to see the results of that strategy in terms of new products like the QFX5100 being a great example of that. But we're not done yet, and there's more to come. And I have a lot of confidence in what is more to come in terms of our ability to grow this business. And I'll just pass it to Vince for performance.
Vincent J. Molinaro: Yes. Now let me just tag on that, Rami, with respect to Shaygan mentioned the vertical focus and the customer differentiation. We're starting to see both in Service Provider and in Enterprise a number of data center wins to leverage the portfolio and positioning forward, especially in the massively scalable data centers. We're seeing a much broader architectural conversation that puts us in a position for continued growth. So I'm excited about that. And then automation and everything else that's going on relative to the environment in the data center, looking forward to again diversity and portfolio of customers where we have applications that position and drive our Switching business. So thanks.
Shaygan Kheradpir: Yes. And I'll just wrap it up, Simona, on -- as Rami and Vince said, I'm actually very encouraged by all of the vertical engagements on Switching and the design wins, and I'm enthusiastic about the ramp in 2015.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thanks, Simona.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Modoff from Deutsche Bank.
Brian T. Modoff - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I think when you [indiscernible] data, about whether it's a cyclical issue in Routing or if there's something more structural going on, like maybe Metro Optical using that Switching substitution for some of the Routing. The question is really around Switching in terms of -- are you guys planning to do a spine switch? This is clearly an area as you note that you could see some growth in because there's still growth in Switching and you have a small market share. So are you going to do anything architecturally to really get into that market in a bigger way?
Shaygan Kheradpir: Brian, we obviously are not here to unveil our product roadmap. Suffice it to say, as I said, I'm personally very excited about it. And I think it was Brian's report we just recently read, right? We have a lot of comments on that, but that we'll take up online. But Rami, can you sort of take that?
Rami Rahim: Sure. So look, on the Switching side, I'll just sort of revert back to what I mentioned for Simona, which is that we're not done with our roadmap. We're not going to get into specifics on this call. But I think there's a lot of confidence all around on our roadmap. And in terms of talking to customers, we're getting a lot of very positive feedback on the roadmap. As far as Metro optical and so forth, there are certainly trends and aspirations by all involved in that market. And one can easily talk about IP and packet-based transport and so forth, but actually executing on that, there aren't that many people in the world that can effectively do it and do it competitively and scalably. So for that reason, I'm not 100% sure I agree with the premise that there is sort of this long-drawn-out trend, if you will, in Routing where everything will move to optical. I just don't buy it. That said, there are -- there is an evolution in architectures for the Metro and even for the core where the packet and optical demands will be much closely integrated together. This will be done with things like intelligent software that can balance traffic more effectively across the 2 layers, also done in terms of automation. And if you look at our product roadmap with respect to, for example, NorthStar, this is the controller that does exactly that. It does it with our own packet technology and partner optical technology. And we're seeing, actually, some very good interest from customers. I think it's early, but we're seeing very good interest from customers on such approaches.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thank you. Thank you, Brian.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ben Reitzes from Barclays.
Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Back to the Switching question. Could you just -- I think the Enterprise number for Switching might have been below as well what you were thinking at the beginning of the quarter. And what did you notice competitively there with Cisco ramping new products and Arista doing things? And I guess everybody's asking 2 questions so I'll sneak one other in there. Strategically, you guys have done the IOP and the Junos divestiture. But is there any other strategic options on the table? Anything else that we should be thinking about that you have in your ability to enhance shareholder value that we haven't looked at yet in the analyst community?
Shaygan Kheradpir: Ben, I'll make a couple of quick comments and then I'll pass it around. So on Switching, we are actually quite bullish about our Switching products. They really shine most where scale, sophistication, openness, programmability, hardened IP protocols, those things matter. And so we are very bullish about that. As far as your comment, your second comment, we -- as a matter of course, we review our portfolio regularly. And we are in that sort of phase and that's how our process works. So we do that regularly. But Rami, can you take a crack on the Enterprise question specifically?
Rami Rahim: Yes. I mean, most of the -- most of what affected us in Q3 in Switching was on the SP -- in SPs. And that's, again, the lumpier portion of our business. There was also a broader Enterprise component, but it was a minor component compared to the SP side. As far as strategy is concerned, it's scoring and winning more and more of the opportunities from customers that truly, like Shaygan said, value high capacity and high scale. And those customers tend to be fewer and larger. So there is -- again, there's that lumpiness component to it. And then also, like I said, there is still an element to our product roadmap that has not yet been completed that I think is going to be necessary to make sure that we continue the growth. So that's, again, what it is that we're counting on for continued growth in the future.
Vincent J. Molinaro: And I think from a customer perspective, you've seen the announcement on Nike, and that is a complete portfolio but switch-led. And those are the kinds of opportunities, when you take the full portfolio, leveraging the competence and capability of our switch platform, allows us to get into these global data centers, allows us to provide the agility both on a converged campus as well as among data centers to deliver private cloud. And so I think that's a good example, and it's just a ramp and replication of more opportunities like that where we either lead with routing and pull the switch or lead with switch and pull the broader portfolio. And then I -- think about MetaFabric in general, which is the Routing, Switching, Security where we can lead with that enabling switch technology and pull through the entire portfolio and create that end-to-end solution for customers like Nike and others that we're winning designs around that need to move into production. But it is that better together with leveraging the switch and pulling the rest. MetaFabric is, I think, a perfect example of that.
Shaygan Kheradpir: Thank you, Ben.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kulbinder from Crédit Suisse.
Kulbinder Garcha - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Yes. I guess my question is that you spoke before, Shaygan, about the product cycle, and it normally lasts 2 to 4 quarters. I guess the question is -- this still seems to have materially surprised Juniper. So my question is what is it about the product cycle that surprised you this time and transpired because you -- you have had these cycles before, but this seems to have caught Juniper by surprise again. And I guess just linked to that, I guess the secular concern would be is there something more serious competitive going on, and how would you respond to that kind of concern?
Shaygan Kheradpir: Yes, I mean, it's a good question. It's difficult to call cycles. I think there are a number of analysts on this call right now and I'm not sure how many of us would have called the cycle. And as I said, in addition to that, there is some -- what also complicated it in terms of visibility, Kul, is some specific industry dynamics that is going on. So those 2 together make visibility quite poor, and the industry dynamics isn't one. It's probably, I would say, half a dozen things, and some of them are different on one customer than the other. And then on top of it, you've got the sinusoid with noise fluctuating around it. So I guess that's the answer. And we all wished that we could tell the cycles, but we didn't see it and I don't think many people did either. And in fact, just in the past 6 weeks, we've gotten -- the numbers have moved on CapEx as well on the area that we work.
Kulbinder Garcha - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I guess just on the...
Shaygan Kheradpir: Rami, do you have any other comments?
Kathleen Nemeth: Go ahead, Kulbinder, and then we'll take one more question.
Kulbinder Garcha - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Yes. I guess my question and follow-up would be just you mentioned the need for revenue diversity. With the new products, the new projects, is it fair to say that you would have the revenue diversity in a year that you can mitigate some of this going forward beyond that? Is that what it might take to get this diversity of revenue that you think Juniper might need?
Robyn M. Denholm: Yes. I think, Kulbinder, on the diversity of revenue, that obviously takes time. And we will have more information next week at the Investor Day on how diverse some of our revenue has gotten over the last 5 years. But to Shaygan's point, we obviously still have some concentration around carriers. And in particular, when those cycles happen, sometimes it's very difficult to get visibility into the depth or breadth of the cycle. And so you're right, the depth of it did exceed our expectations in this quarter. But our view is, at this point, that we're planning for the revenue environment to be challenging. And we've obviously taken appropriate actions in terms of the cost structure and making sure that we're investing in the right things over the right period of time to catch the wave of growth as we come out of this cycle. And that's what the team is very focused on doing.
Shaygan Kheradpir: Thanks, Robyn. Thanks, Kul.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thank you. We have time for one more question.
Operator: Our last question comes from Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer.
Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: She's been killing names all night. Ittai. Yes. I guess my question is more on the incremental OpEx cuts. Shaygan, Robyn, I know cuts are never easy. And when you first announced the IOP plan, you had a very heavy OpEx structure where, I would say, on a relative basis, it was easier to identify the cost-cutting. I guess the question from here, how easy or difficult is it to squeeze that extra $100 million out there? Are the things that you need to do a bit more structural and longer in duration in order to squeeze those cuts? Or they can be -- whether either easily identified or quickly extracted? Can you give us some color on the process there? That would be great.
Shaygan Kheradpir: Ittai, yes, we did IOP that we announced in February for $160 million. We are doing $100 million more. On a year-over-year basis, it's $130 million more in OpEx savings that we are doing. It's a variety of actions. I would say the first $160 million we did, it was tilted more heavily towards the structural things we need to do. Robyn will talk to some of that. This one, we've got a little bit of that. But we also, in IOP, said that we are also sharpening that muscle of continuous focus on efficiency and ensuring that all our dollars go to where it matters most. And this is a reflection of the company strengthening that muscle to be able to take yet another 130 million year-over-year out while preserving a very exciting R&D portfolio, and as Robyn said, be in a position to catch the revenue growth that, from a planning perspective, we are announcing in the second half of next year. Robyn?
Robyn M. Denholm: Yes, I think Shaygan said it well. What we're trying to do -- what we are doing is continuing to sharpen our focus in terms of productivity and efficiency across the company. And as you could see by the results for the third quarter, we are ahead of plan of the original IOP. And so our view is that we can take these additional costs out. It's never easy to take cost out, as you mentioned in your question. But with the right focus and the right attention, doing that deliberately across the company by managing headcount and continuing to work through discretionary expenses as well as effectiveness and efficiency across the company. And the team's very well aligned around that.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thanks, Ittai. Okay. That is all the time we have today. We'd like to thank you for participating on the call and your great questions, in some cases clarifications. And we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thank you. Bye-bye.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Operator:  Greetings, and welcome to the Juniper Networks Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Results Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Ms. Kathleen Nemeth, Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and thank you everyone for joining us today. Here on the call are Shaygan Kheradpir, Chief Executive Officer; and Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial and Operations Officer. Also with us is Rami Rahim, Executive Vice President, Juniper Development and Innovation, who will be available for the Q&A portion of the call. Please remember when listening to today’s call that statements concerning Juniper’s business outlook, economic and market outlook, strategy, future financial operating results, and overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including economic conditions generally or within the networking industry, changes in overall technology spending and spending by communication service providers and major customers, the network capacity requirements of service providers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply chain constraints, variation in the mix of products sold, customer perception and acceptance of our products, rapid technological and market change, litigation, the potential impact of activities related to the execution of Juniper’s integrated operating plan, and other factors listed in our most recent 10-Q and 8-K filed with the SEC. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances change after the date of the call. For purposes of today's discussion, we will also review non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why our management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult the press release furnished with our 8-K filed with the SEC today. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results, please see the Investor Relations section of our website. Please note that today’s call is scheduled to last for one hour and please limit your questions to one per firm. With that, I'll turn the call over to Shaygan.
Shaygan Kheradpir: Thanks Kathleen, and welcome everyone. I am pleased to report that Juniper had another solid quarter, delivering on the upper end of our guidance. On a year-over-year basis, we grew revenue 7% and expanded our non-GAAP earnings per share by 38%. Our revenue was well diversified across our target verticals including carriers, Web 2.0, cable and financial services and across all geographies. We're seeing good trends in U.S. federal aided by more stable market environment and government budgets normalizing after a protected period of constraint. We delivered good performance across our routing and switching product lines, both of which grew year-over-year. I am particularly pleased with our routing performance which grew 7% year-over-year and if normalized for last year's deferred revenue recognition of $34 million, grew 14% year-over-year. Our highlights include switching growth of 25% and continued customer transaction of Contrail SDN. While overall security was down Junos Space SRX products delivered good year-over-year growth of 9%. All-in-all, a very good performance for the June quarter. Since the last earnings call, I have been on a whirlwind tour meeting with over 70 customers and partners. They are all enthusiastic about our strategy to be the leading provider of High-IQ networks and best in class cloud builder. What’s really resonating is our approach of listening and understanding in a deep way to the particular business imperative and linking them to Juniper’s out of the possible innovation. Parts of our renewed focus aligns our efforts across our go-to-market and R&D organizations by taking a deliberate used case driven approach to helping our customers deliver innovation that matters to their customers and operations. While our strategy is clearly resonating with our customers, there are some specific, customer specific dynamics in the near-term that we are factoring into our outlook. Specifically, within U.S. based service providers, their market dynamics including M&A activity are impacting, both sequencing and timing of projects. While this will impact our near-term outlook, we are well positioned with these customers with major design wins in key areas of their network including next generation projects. Despite the current near-term uncertainty, there are number of positives. First, we expect continued strong growth in our Web 2.0, cable and federal customers; second, EMEA is showing positive momentum with customers continuing to build out their network capacity; third, we are seeing good performance out of our enterprise sector. I am very confident that our market position is strengthening and our momentum in winning new business and new customer logos over the medium and the long-term is strong. Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the four pillars of our Integrated Operating Plan. We are maintaining a disciplined approach to our commitments and I'm pleased with our progress.  First, we pivoted our strategy towards growth areas of the market centered on cloud building and High-IQ networking. And we deliberately aligned our resources and partner ecosystem to customers in defined verticals that are in a build cycle for these growth areas. We are seeing clear signs of success as well as an increasingly diverse customer set. For example, three of our top five customers this quarter are either Web 2.0 or cable companies. Second, we successfully implemented to organizational structure required to drive our strategy. By streamlining the company with a One-Juniper mindset, one go-to-market organization, one R&D organization and one aligned infrastructure organization. We have focused our go-to-market and R&D resources on projects with highest potential for growth and we continue to drive leverage engineering across our routing, switching and security products, via Junos, Silicon end systems. As part of this realignment, today we announced that sale of our Junos Pulse business which is our SSL VPN solution for securing remote network access. We are making the pivot fully toward stated high growth strategy of Cloud-Builder and High-IQ networks for which security is essential and we are shifting our resources into security areas to commensurate with this strategy. In terms of how we work. We are implementing initiatives to drive greater collaboration and co-creation across organizational boundaries as well as setting new standards of accountability. These changes will allow us to grow faster, work more efficiently and be more responsive to our customers business imperatives. Third, we continue to drive structural efficiencies across the organization and have executed on specific cost management actions focused on four key areas, consolidation and reduplication, de-layering the organization, greater automation of business processes and focusing on innovation that matters most to our customers. Our OpEx this quarter was $515 million, which is $24 million lower than Q4, 2013. Our baseline for the IOP. This represents an annualized savings of approximately $100 million, nearly two-third towards our goal of $160 million in annual savings. The $24 million of in-quarter savings are primarily headcount related costs and structural in nature. Approximately three-quarters of our headcount savings comes from de-layering and reduplicating management positions. We also reduced approximately 10% of our facility footprint by implementing a new dynamic workplace model. In addition, we have made decisions that will give us line of sight to do remaining cost savings goal by Q1, 2015. Our cost control committee under my leadership continues to drive implementation of efficiencies throughout the organization. All actions to-date are strengthening Juniper's muscle and smart efficiencies with mechanisms in place to ensure cost will not come back even after we reach our targeted savings goal. Finally, we've greatly improved our allocation and management of capital. We continue to deliver very strong cash flows from our operations. This has been a consistent area of our strength for Juniper enabling us to invest in growing the business as well as generating returns for our shareholders. The actions we’re taking include the initiation of the quarterly cash dividend this quarter and then aggressive return of $3 billion to our shareholders as per our plan. In addition, we’ve successfully concluded our patent litigation and recorded a gain of $195 million. We are committed to delivering our integrated operating plans and driving significant value for our shareholders. Now let me talk about the industry outlook. As the customization of demand for rapid innovation as mass scale, our customers willing to continue to invest in the network. We are seeing our key verticals at the forefront of this wave of change making the transition to high-IQ networking and Cloud-Building and they’re all driving towards a common set of network architectures that are converging across verticals. Market fundamentals for Juniper’s routing products continues to be healthy and increasingly diversified. Routing demand is being driven by consolidation of networks across business and residential services, wireline and wireless and the need for Cloud-Building. Bandwidth demand continues to increase and favors our products speed and density advantage such as the industry’s first 0.5 Terabyte per second line card in our MX platform that we’ve just begun shipping. Demand for switching products also remain strong driven by four trends. First next generation data center transformation projects, and the need for carrier grade availability and operational simplicity. Second, hyperscale cloud build outs. Third proliferation of big data and video requiring very high performance networking and 10 Gigabit Ethernet refresh. And fourth, increasing need for open architectures and end-to-end automation. These trends favor our products. For example, our customers have been using our QFX5100 line as a fundamental building blocks for carrier class layer 2 and 3 switching as well as the foundation for automation capabilities such as seamless workloads movements. In addition, many of our customers are going into production with Contrail as they look to automate and orchestrate the creation of highly scalable virtual networks. In Q2, we have had two large public clouds go live with Contrail, one in APAC and the other CloudWatt, the largest cloud in France. We've helped launch private cloud as well including one with a global leader in enterprise security. In security, the decline of our legacy NetScreen product has accelerated and while we disappointed with overall growth rate, we are pleased that our Junos Space SRX portfolio was up 11% in the first half of the year, the growth was driven by demands for high performance Firewalls, virtualized Firewalls, high IQ features for stress detection and mitigation and end to end management simplicity. As I've noted before, SRX based security offerings are a differentiated and critical element of our strategy of Cloud-Building and delivering high IQ networks. Let me walk you through why. One, our Cloud-Building customers are increasingly aware that integrating carrier class security is an imperative and therefore are choosing our security ramping and switching products as an on-sample for the cloud and virtualized data centers. Two, as our customers make the transition to LTE and NFV, security has become a crucial component of their overall solution. And example is security based services that work seamlessly with our MX and Contrail products. And finally there is a significant level of technology sharing between our Junos-based SRX security routing and switching across silicon systems and software that enables a very high leverage R&D strategy. We are executing on this strategy focusing our security investments on projects with the highest ROI, while improving the overall profitability of our company. As the only high performance, pure play IP networking company, we are uniquely positioned to build the bridge of the future for our customers. We are playing a critical role in helping them be more relevant as they look to create new business models, increase productivity and optimize for rapid deployment of new services. I see great opportunity across our customer base and I am confident that Juniper can help our customers change the world in creative new ways. In summary while there are some specific customer dynamics that we are carefully navigating in the near-term I am confident in our opportunities and growth prospects in the medium and long-term. I would like to thank our employees for the commitments and relentless focus on our customers and execution. Now I will turn it over to Robyn to provide more details on our financial results.
Robyn Denholm:  Thank you Shaygan and good afternoon everyone I am pleased to report that our Q2 ‘14 results reflect healthy revenue growth and continued strong earnings expansion. Revenue increased 7% year-over-year with growth in all three geographies, driven by good performance in our routing, switching and SRX security products. Non-GAAP earnings per share grew 38% year-over-year, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of strong double-digit earnings growth. Before I go into detail on the quarter's results, I’d like to provide an update on our Integrated Operating Plan. One of the important elements of our cost reduction activities is that we have been very mindful of how we allocate and shift resources to ensure that we continue to invest in areas that will drive the future growth of the company. In the quarter, we consolidated our Sunnyvale campus, discontinued several R&D projects which had a lower return on investment and lastly, completed our headcount restructuring. As a result of these actions in the quarter, we recorded restructuring and other charges of $72 million, approximately $10 million with the headcount actions taken during the first half of the year, the remaining $62 million was related to asset write-downs including $44 million for facility consolidation, $14 million for inventory and $4 million for R&D project cancellations and asset impairments. This brings total restructuring charges to-date to $194 million versus our original total estimate of $220 million. We are pleased with the pace with which we are taking out structural cost out of the business and anticipate our future restructuring charges to be in the order of $5 million to $10 million. I'm also pleased with the execution of our capital return plan. As I mentioned during our call last quarter, we initiated a $1.2 billion ASR of which $900 million of shares were delivered in Q1. We expect the remaining shares to be delivered no later than the end of August. Given our strong cash generation, we intend to opportunistically repurchase a minimum of $550 million in addition to the ASR by the end of the year. This means that before year-end we'll complete at least $1.75 billion against our commitment to repurchase $2 billion by the end of Q1 2015. I am also pleased to announce the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share of common stock. This puts in place another piece of our commitment to returning $3 billion to our shareholders over the next three years. As we have said before, we expect to grow this dividend over time. These capital initiatives reflect our confidence in the underlying long-term strength of Juniper's business as well as our commitment to enhancing shareholder value. We have carefully structured the program to ensure flexibility to support innovation and growth initiatives. And as you would expect, we will provide update on our progress against these initiatives each quarter. Now, I would like to move into a discussion of the Q2 results. Looking at our demand metrics, our book-to-bill was approximately 1. Total product deferred revenue was up sequentially $20 million and down $26 million year-over-year. The sequential increase was due to an increase in channel related inventory. Total revenue for the quarter was $1,230 million, up 7% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Product revenue was up 8% year-over-year and 6% over last quarter. As you may recall, in Q2 of 2013, we recognized $34 million of previously deferred routing revenue from a U.S. government customer. If you exclude the revenue recognition from last year’s results, total revenue growth this quarter would have been 10% and product revenue growth would have been 12%. This revenue recognition also impacted the year-over-year growth grades through enterprise and routing. Services revenue was $300 million, up 5% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. There were no 10% customers this quarter. For the quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.46, an increase of $0.27 year-over-year. This included a net gain of $195 million related to a patent litigation settlement, which resulted in a $0.41 positive impact to earnings. This was offset by restructuring and other charges of $72 million which resulted in a $0.15 negative impact. In the quarter we also incurred a charge of $0.03 associated with an industry wide memory product quality related item. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.40, up $0.11 year-over-year and over last quarter. This represents a 38% increase, both sequentially and year-over-year. The sequential increase was due to a substantial improvement in operating margin fueled by higher revenue, improved gross margins and the decrease in operating expenses. We had a positive impact from reduced share count of approximately $0.02 year-over-year. Before I go into detail on revenue, I’d like to highlight some of the trends that we saw this quarter. We continue to see healthy drivers of long-term demand and design wins with customers across the world. In the U.S., we saw continued momentum in demand with Web 2.0, cable and enterprise customers. This diversity of demand is a key strength for us going forward. However life in the quarter, we saw some delays in the timing of project with the few key U.S. service providers. Based on current visibility, we expect these delays to impact second half results. Outside of the Americas, we saw continued strength in EMEA carrier spending coupled with several good build in select markets in APAC. Now let's look at the results in detail. All written experience sequential revenue growth Americas revenue was up 5% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Americas service provider was up 13% year-over-year and 3% sequentially driven primarily by Web 2.0 customers, a reflection of the continued diversity of our revenue. Americas enterprise decreased 9% year-over-year. However taking into account the previously mentioned government deferred revenue recognition from last year the growth rate would have been 6%. Sequentially Americas enterprise increased 6% led by strength in the U.S. federal market. EMEA revenue was up 8% over last year and 10% sequentially due to healthy growth in the service provider market with particular strength among large carriers in Central and Eastern Europe and the Middle East. APAC was flat sequentially, an increase $0.11 year-over-year primarily driven by strength with regional carriers across the theatre as well as growth in the enterprise market. Service provider revenue for the quarter was $832 million, up 15% year-over-year across all three geographies and up 6% sequentially driven by EMEA and the Americas. Enterprise revenue was $398 million down 6% year-over-year excluding the government deferred revenue recognition from last year so year-over-year growth rate was 2%. Sequentially enterprise revenue was up 3% led by healthy U.S. federal and financial services demand partially offset by routing products revenue with $618 million up 12% sequentially and 7% year-over-year; the sequential growth was driven by a strong performance for MX and significant improvement for (inaudible). Switching products revenue was a record $200 million up 25% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. The sequential growth rate was driven primarily by QFabric products. The year-over-year growth was driven by a combination of both QFX and EX products. Total security product revenue was $112 million down 17% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. We are disappointed with this performance however it does reflect the trend that we have been seeing as steady increase in Junos-based security products and a significant drop in the non-Junos-based security products. Our SRX platform and security software were up 9% year-over-year and up 11% for the first half of the year. We have included a table in our slide deck breaking out the security product revenue. Moving on to the gross margin and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 64.2% compared to 63.5% last quarter and 63.7% a year ago. The sequential improvement was driven by an increase in both product and services gross margin. Non-GAAP product gross margins were 65.4%, up six-tenth of a point from last quarter and up 1.6 points from a year-ago. The sequential improvement was primarily driven by increased volume. Non-GAAP services gross margins were 60.5%, down 2.8 points from a year ago and up eight-tenth of a point sequentially. The year-over-year decline is higher support cost. The sequential increase is due to higher revenue and flat support related cost. We expect services margins to continue to modestly improve in the second half of the year. We are pleased to report that our non-GAAP operating expenses were $515 million at the lower end of the range that we gave last quarter, reflecting our focus in execution against our integrated operating plan. This represents the $27 million or 5% sequential reduction. This includes a $6 million reduction in patent litigation related expenses versus the first quarter, due to the settlement. The remaining legal and litigation fees in Q2 were $12 million, consistent with Q1. We are on track to deliver against the $160 million of annualized cost reduction goal that we announced in February. Our headcount ended the quarter at 9,083 which represents 5% decline sequentially and year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 22.3% reflecting a year-over-year expansion of 3.4 points and a sequential increase of 5.1 points due to higher revenue, improved gross margins and lower operating expenses. The non-GAAP tax rate was 26% compared to 25.6% last quarter. The GAAP tax rate was 24.9% compared to 25.3% in Q1. We ended the quarter with $2.6 billion of net cash and investments, an increase of approximately $480 million sequentially. This includes a $165 million related to the patent litigation settlement. Onshore cash and investments represented approximately 37% of total growth cash balance. Q2 operating cash flows were unusually strong at $425 million. This included $75 million of cash received from the patent litigation settlement. The strong cash flows during the quarter were also attributable to higher net income, lower incentive compensation payments and improved working capital metrics. Inline with recent trends, DSO improved to 41 days. CapEx was $41 million in the quarter and depreciation and amortization expense was $45 million. Now I will review our outlook for Q3. As a reminder these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis, except for revenue and share account. As previously mentioned, there were some customer specific dynamics in the near term that we have factored in, into our outlook. While we are well positioned with these customers, with our current visibility to we expect sequencing and timing related delays to effect both Q3 and Q4. This is partially offset by science and strength in emerging verticals such as Web 2.0 and cable as well as a positive outlook for enterprise. We see positive momentum in EMEA with customers continuing to build out their network capacity. For the third quarter we expect revenues to range from $1,150 million to $1,200 million. Gross margins are expected to be 64%, plus or minus 0.5%. Operating expenses are expected to be $505 million, plus or minus $5 million, which at the midpoint is a $10 million reduction from Q2, and a $5 million reduction from our previously published targets. We’re delivering on our cost reduction commitments. Operating margins are expected to be 21%, plus or minus 0.5%. This is expected to result in non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $0.35 and $0.40 per share, assuming a share count of approximately $475 million. This continues our strong expansion of earnings with growth of 14% at the midpoint of the guided range. We expect a flat tax rate versus the second quarter. As you know, we announced the sell of our Junos Pulse business today. The impact has been factored into this guidance and it’s immaterial to our revenue outlook for Q3. The revenue impact beyond Q3 can be guided from the supplemental table provided. We expect this sale to close late in Q3. We have factored the cost-savings associated with this sale as part of our goal of achieving a $160 million in cost savings as we exit the first quarter of 2015. To conclude, I am really pleased with the performance of the entire Juniper team. The first half of 2014 has been a time of solid execution for the company, we have lots of moving parts and we have continued our focus on the things that matter most to our customers and shareholders. I am very proud of our team and thanks them for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper. Now, let's open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, first just housekeeping item and then my question. Can you provide us the numbers for Pulse and also the all platform also for Q3 and Q4 of last year, then we'll have a complete picture of how security was trending? Second question and then that goes back to my main question. When I look at your, and this is more kind of a statement than the question I would like to here maybe Shaygan might, I'd like to here your view. When I look at your plan, the expense side of the equation is almost done, you almost finished with the expense reduction. And then I look at the numbers in switching is relatively flat for three quarters now, the growth is mainly because you have easy comps from last year. In security, we are back to the levels, we are down back to the levels of March 13 you quoted the six months numbers, but if you actually look at Q2 numbers were down sequentially back to the levels of first quarter '13 and in routing there are delays. So how long do you think if put the expenses aside, how long do you think is going to take us to see the changes you are implementing on the product portfolio and growth acceleration and impact on switching and routing and security et cetera? Thanks.
Shaygan Kheradpir:  Hi Tal, this is Shaygan, good afternoon. On your first question on drilling into Pulse, I am going to ask Robyn to sort of go through the numbers and then we’ll take the second one.
Robyn Denholm:  Yeah so in the slide deck, that’s on our website we have provided the data for the last six quarters, so you can see the Junos Pulse revenues for the quarter Q2 of ‘14 we did product revenue of 15.9 million which is included in our security product revenue and we also did about $15.5 million worth of services. And as I mentioned the transaction on the Pulse file I will conclude right in third quarter is what we are expecting and so we don’t expect any impact to the revenue in Q3, but you can use the table to model the impact to Q4. Just going back to the other housekeeping question the ScreenOS product revenue for Q2 ‘14 was about $13.2 million which is less than 12% of our total product revenue that compares to previous quarter where it was under 14% at about 18.3%. So it’s dropping off quite significantly from the ScreenOS perspective.
Shaygan Kheradpir:  Thanks Robyn and Tal on your second question, I would say that we continue to take share on both switching and routing. And as you mentioned before on security this year the stabilization phase, if you look at our numbers this quarter if you normalize for the one time from last year at this time on routing, routing was up 14%, switching was up 24%. We are taking share and we continue to do significant enhancements at both product lines. For the balance of the year, we mentioned in our prepared remarks that we have a couple of U.S. service providers with whom we are very close at all levels and in continuous dialog. Because of their market environment and what they need to do, they are risk sequencing and that's going to impact some of the timing of our programs as we were working with them. We are -- the growth drivers, our product positioning, we are very encouraged by both and overall for our 2015, we have an overall constructive view of where we are heading. So overall, we feel good about our product positioning and our market positioning. And I think this quarter's growth and growth year-to-date for both routing, switching and I would also say even though in security we are tuning in now heavily to our SRX space, Junos space products, it has respectable growth of 9% year-over-year. So, we feel good. Thank you very much.
Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.
Ashwin Kesireddy - JP Morgan: Yes, hi. This is Ashwin on behalf of Rod, thanks for taking my question. I want to understand a little bit about the customer specific dynamics you talk about. You said it's going to be weak in Q3 and Q4. So are we sort of expecting a better seasonal Q1 and Q2 next year? Also if you could comment on which verticals you see impacting, that would be helpful.
Shaygan Kheradpir:  Yes, your first question was about -- Ash was about the dynamics, the market dynamics of the couple of the service providers. I don’t want to really go into that but I think you can see they’re very transparent in terms of where they are putting their capital, for what reason and there is some M&A that is in the market, we know that and I encourage you to think about M&A in the broader sense. And when you put it all together and I have lived in those markets in the U.S. specifically for a quarter century, it makes everything comes together and some of our internal metrics also late in the quarter sort of flash. So we want to be prudent and we want to be cautious for the balance of the year. But we're also because of the growth drivers that we talked about and where we are from a product perspective, we are overall constructive for 2015. Robyn, do you want to add anything there?
Robyn Denholm: I think you've discussed it quite well, Shaygan.
Shaygan Kheradpir:  Thanks Ash.
Operator:  Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs: Hi, thank you. Can you clarify if Pulse was contributing positively to EPS for new account for the associated expenses? And then just remind us how much of your revenues go in to campus or access environments as opposed to the focus areas, Shaygan that you’ve talked about of datacenter and cloud.
Shaygan Kheradpir:  Hi Simona, this is Shaygan. I will pass the question to Robyn. I will just say about Pulse, two second. Pulse is a good asset. The issue is it's not in line with our strategy which is very much focused on cloud build or High-IQ and how those markets are shaping. And we want to really focus our security line around growth where the markets are going and very strong in. So with that I am going to pass to Robyn to take the question on Pulse.
Robyn Denholm: Yes. As Shaygan mentioned, intent of doing strategic review with our portfolio, Pulse was an asset, a good asset but as Shaygan mentioned, not directly in the line with strategic focus of the company. And therefore we have announced the sale of the asset today. It has been mildly accretive for us over the years in terms of the overall P&L but given the focus of the company and the intent to return on investment, we’ve decided that that’s an asset that with better in the hands of the another entity to look after it.
Shaygan Kheradpir: And Simona, on your second question I am going to ask Rami to comment and say few words.
Rami Rahim: Yes. On the question on campus versus -- sorry Simona, on the question about the campus versus data center aspects of our switching business. The majority of our switching business goes into data center and combination data center campus switching scenarios. There are in fact large enterprise customers where the line between their mission critical campus and the data center is essentially blurring. They view the campus as an onramp to the data center. We’re not going after the smaller wiring clauses types of campuses; we’re really going after the larger strategic high performance High-IQ type of campus networks that many of our customers are building.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs: Thank you. 
Shaygan Kheradpir: Thanks Simona.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ehud Gelblum with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup: Hey guys, hey Robyn, hey Shaygan. How are you?
Shaygan Kheradpir: Hi Ehud.
Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup: Hi. A couple of quick questions. First of all, back to the SRX, it was strong in Q3, Q4, was very strong in Q1 and then fell fairly hard to about $80 million in Q2. I want to get a sense if that’s seasonal or because Q2 last year also had a similar impact or was there large build that one on for those three quarters Q3, 4 and 1 or any other color that we can get on the dynamics over there. Then, I wanted to pick up a little bit on Contrail. You talked about continued traction in Contrail. Can you give us a sense as to is that -- is Contrail actually selling the standalone product yet, is there some revenue we can be looking at that or is there pull through that we can be looking on possibly the QFX or other products? And now that Cisco is out with their ACI and their APIC, how are you seeing that change of dynamic in the conversations on Contrail? And then lastly, Web 2.0 and cable guys, Robyn you talk about these guys a lot now. Can you give us a sense how large to Web 2.0 guys are? Are they 5% of your revenue now? Give us a sense as to what we should be looking from that vertical? Thank you.
Shaygan Kheradpir: Thanks Ehud. There is I think four or five questions there, so I'll punch them some quickly and I’ll have Robyn and Rami also chime in if they want. So on SRX, as we have pivoted to Junos Space SRX security line, obviously this is a cloud builder High-IQ service provider carrier grave kind of firewalls. And the sales of that obviously is more lumpy than I would say your grandfather’s firewall in normal branches and stuff. So you will obviously see lumpiness in those sales just because of the nature of what we are selling which is very, very high end. On Contrail we are very happy and encouraged with the progress is that we are very early in the game obviously and it’s all about design wins holistically for clouds be it private clouds or public clouds infrastructure as a service and so forth and so on. So they started this just last year, late last year they have a large number of talks proof of concepts, they have pivoted now from talks making those go into production and the funnel keeps growing on talks. And they are being very deliberate on these wins because they are big they are sophisticated and we have to get them right and we are doing that. The other two questions were Robyn and Rami.
Robyn Denholm:  So I can answer the question. One thing I wanted to underscore on the SRX Ehud, so you are right it is lumpy and Q1 we did have a deployment in the service provider area and so that is one of the reasons why we saw the sequential decline in SRX based products. In terms of Web 2.0 and cable they did drive the growth in the Americas both sequentially and to some extent year-over-year and as Shaygan mentioned three out of our top five customers as a company are in that Web 2.0 cable sector in the quarter. So they are obviously an important part from a future perspective around the diversification of our revenue. Having said that, obviously our carriers are also very important to us and as we highlighted in the outlook given their size and relevance to our revenue any reduction in their revenue in the near term does have a direct impact on us.
Shaygan Kheradpir: Thank you Robyn. And Ehud on your last question, I would say, suffices to say we are intense of course with our customers all the time and clearly the customers that we work with Cloud Builder, High-IQ types, they are very much want open no lock in and future proof solutions under cloud solutions. So, that's all I say Rami do you want to say anything else on that from that front?
Rami Rahim: I'll just add on the SRX front, there is a service provider component to the business that tends to be somewhat lumpy, the biggest use case being for example LTE security. And then on the Contrail side, I think Shaygan already mentioned it. The one thing that I will add is that we are seeing that in the first few deployments they are being deployed, Contrail being deployed in heterogeneous networks where there is a combination of Juniper and other peer type of infrastructure and it just speaks to the openness of the solution which our customers very much appreciate.
Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup: [And no lock in].
Rami Rahim: Yes. Thanks Ehud.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thanks Ehud. Next question please operator?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping to understand to what degree the delays are likely to be the most impact of routing business in the second half or if you are expecting to see impact in switching and security given many of your carriers who have buying portfolio products. And then I was also hoping you could help us understand if you expect revenue for the second half of the year to be up relative to the first half of the year and is there any reason we shouldn't expect the overall you to grow in 2014?
Shaygan Kheradpir:  Hi, Jess. So on your first question since they are -- the softness is coming from a couple of U.S. service providers and you are right they buy upon sample, but they are very -- we are very heavily embedded with them with our routing products of MX and TTX series. So the impact is going to be more on our routing rather than switching and security. And the second question I forgot but I think you will have a Robyn?
Robyn Denholm: Yes. So overall as we said in terms of the outlook we are expecting a down quarter for the third quarter and we are expecting these delays to impact our fourth quarter as well. We do expect on the switching side Shaygan mentioned the routing side, we do expect in switching that in the second half of the year that we will grow that business as well the products in switching area. Just bear in mind the compares that we have as is that look at the second half for us to switching. And on security we expect the same trend that we've seen over the first half that the ScreenOS product will continue to decline and the Junos based SRX platforms will increase over the second half.
Kathleen Nemeth:  Jess this is Kathleen just to answer your question specifically we do expect overall 2014 revenue to be up this year.
Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo: Thanks guys.
Shaygan Kheradpir: Thanks Jeff.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi guys. This is Trevor (inaudible) in for Ben. My questions on security specifically and around the strategy so what gives you the confidence in the strategy in general and the ability to return to growth across the portfolio? While SRX seems to be core to the strategy it’s on a negative trajectory at the same time as 1Q ‘13 and while the other two businesses are growing pretty nicely despite this. So, at what point does it make sense to consider alternatives given that returns to growth seemingly would require significant investment?
Shaygan Kheradpir: Hi Trevor this is Shaygan. We are very committed to security. Point number one, I went through in my prepared remarks of the logic behind that behind our SRX based security which we think is very differentiated and it’s a very critical element of cloud builder and high IQ networks. I don’t want to repeat what I said in my script but you can go it, I think we’ve laid it out very nicely, quickly know what is going to buy cloud with the big giant hole on the side. So that’s why it’s critical for there. It’s critical for our service provider customers which are even with our increasing diversity of our revenues as you can see, they’re still very material customers. And in their transition to LTE and NFV it is an absolute critical component for their transitions and it works seamlessly with MX and Contrail as hand in glove. And finally if you come into our labs and see the amount of commonality in terms of componentry Silicon, Chassis, of course Junos software they are all, I would, I think leverage engineering is now doesn't quite do justice too, it's a lot of commonality. And now that all three switching, routing and security are under our JDI organization that's led by Rami, we expect growth to pick-up over to medium and long-term on our security, the logic is very sound and impeccable and pick-up profitably because of the natural synergies that exists between these product lines.  So yeah, we are very committed to SRX based security products and actually very encouraged to the medium to long-term prospects for the rationale that I went through. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Sue with RBC Marketing. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Sue - RBC Marketing: Shaygan, will you recognize the company will keep the assets routing, switching and security/SRX. Are there other non-essential assets that you can further divest or we [missed you] done with that. And as we look at improving the strength of the SRX and perhaps the other product portfolio segments. Should we think about, how should we think about R&D spending, how should we think about spending potentially going backup or in the process of reducing OpEx but I will be at a point where you need to defend your market share and also improve the products so that the OpEx needs to kind of increase again. How should we think about from a planning point of view what the steady rate OpEx should be on an annual basis?
Shaygan Kheradpir: Yes. Mark again very quickly. As you have managed the business very closely and very prudently, and very focused we continue as a matter of course continue to always look at our portfolio to make sure that they are aligned with our strategy point number one, which is the one you have stated which is IOP which is cloud that there are High-IQ which is around growth and profitable growth that matters to our customers we continue to do that. As a matter of course we talked about Pulse this was one of them that didn’t fit our (inaudible) charts and we took action. So that’s just been normal course of our business and now that we have a very clear strategy that we have tested over and over again, internally, externally I just came back with 70 partners and customers, it’s just a very vivid that this is where the world is going and what we are doing is exactly right. So we have the right filter to balance that upon. The second question is it’s about we are also very committed to our IOP targets and I reemphasized that so you should rest assured there. And I think our track record so far should give you some comfort that we know how to land the IOP targets. And the last question was…
Robyn Denholm:  Yes sure, just on the planning purposes on the OpEx side in the slide deck we included our charts, obviously we are committed to the 160 in terms of cost reductions exiting Q1 of 2015 as Shaygan mentioned. We have also said that will be less than $500 million for Q1 of 2015 we have just achieved the low end of their range for Q2 in terms of 515 and we have given you guidance for 505 plus or minus 5 for both Q3 and Q4. So, as Shaygan mentioned, we are very committed to the OpEx target and we are doing it in a way that makes it clear that we continue to invest in our long-term future around product development. And yes…. 
Shaygan Kheradpir: And thank you Robyn. And Mark, the last point is IOP is all about focusing on where the market is going and profitable growth. So all the actions we are taking is actually putting our best engineers, our best go-to-market people very focused around areas of growth and strengthening those. So, as we’ve said before this is not a slash and burn kind of a project. It's very surgical, very focused, we are -- the thing we just did with Pulse and some of the best engineers and so forth and so on. We all focusing them on the growth of security and SRX based products as opposed to in a wide spectrum of things which we may have net prospects for growth. So, we feel very good about our strategy and feel very good about our focus on the product line, our level of talent where the products are going, very excited about the pipeline and very extremely happy with the level of customer engagements, the way I described in my prepared remarks in terms of going deep with them on the strategic customers and strategic partners. This is what IOP is all about. And the good news is when you focus, you also eliminate unnecessary cost. This is what we're doing and we're committed to all of the above. Thank you.
Mark Sue - RBC Marketing: That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amitabh Passi. Please proceed with your question.
Amitabh Passi - UBS:  Hi guys, thanks for squeezing me in. Shaygan, Robyn I was wondering is there a way to quantify what do you think the impact is from the delays with the U.S. based service providers? If I look at the midpoint of your guidance, you are about 85 million short of where consensus was. And I am just trying to get a sense is the majority of that explained by these delays? And then just a quick follow up on Junos Pulse, Robyn why wouldn't we see incremental OpEx savings in the fourth quarter once the divestiture has occurred?
Shaygan Kheradpir:  Hi Amitabh, this is Shaygan. I think the answer to your first question, quick answer is yes it is those couple of U.S. based service providers for very specific market reasons in their markets and dynamics that have impacted their second half. I will now hand it to Robyn to take the rest.
Robyn Denholm: Yes, in terms of the OpEx related to Pulse that is included in $160 million of OpEx savings. We had identified this as an area for which we believe that we could save some OpEx and focus the company in terms of the overall strategy that we were focused on.
Kathleen Nemeth:  Okay. All right, thanks Amitabh. I would like to thank everyone for joining us today. That is all the time that we have. We appreciate your excellent questions and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you.
Operator:  Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Juniper Networks First Quarter 2014 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Nemeth, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Nemeth. You may begin.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and thank you everyone for joining us today. Here on the call are Shaygan Kheradpir, Chief Executive Officer; Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial and Operations Officer; and Rami Rahim, Executive Vice President, Juniper Development and Innovation. Please remember when listening to today’s call that statements concerning Juniper’s business outlook, economic and market outlook, strategy, future financial operating results, and overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including economic conditions generally, or within the networking industry, changes in overall technology spending, and spending by communication service providers and major customers, the network capacity requirements of service providers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply chain constraints, variation in the mix of products sold, customer perception and acceptance of our products, rapid technological and market change, litigation, the potential impact of activities related to the execution of Juniper’s integrated operating plan, and other factors listed in our most recent 10-K and the press release furnished with our 8-K filed with the SEC today. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances change after the date of the call. The purposes of today’s discussion we will also review non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why our management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the Company’s financial results, please consult the press release furnished with our 8-K filed with the SEC today. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results, please see the Investor Relations section of our website. We’ve extended today’s call to an hour and a half in order to accommodate more questions. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Shaygan.
Shaygan Kheradpir: Thank you, Kathleen, and welcome to all of you who are joining us on today’s conference call and webcast. I joined this iconic company, because I saw a unique opportunity to optimize the organizational’s phenomenal assets, deep customer relationships, great technology, and fantastic people to address our customers’ most pressing needs, high performance, agile, secure, automated, context-aware networks all delivered in an open framework. It is also my belief that we can deliver improved results for our shareholders by working in a more efficient structure with greater customer connectedness and accountability for performance. These are the areas I’m going to cover with you today. First, a review of our quarterly results, and second, an update on our IOP and the steps we’ve taken to achieve our stated target of $160 million in annualized OpEx savings. Our quarterly financial results demonstrate that we are on our way. On a year-over-year basis, we delivered 10% revenue growth and expanded our non-GAAP earnings per share by 21%. And we achieved this while creating our integrated operating plan and kick starting an execution. In addition, today AT&T announced that Juniper has been selected as a strategic vendor to help deliver their Domain 2.0 vision to deploy a User-Defined Network Cloud. This is an honor for our company and one I know we are all very proud of. I want to recognize our team that collaborated so well across the company in support of AT&T. Clearly, this is an exciting and important time for us as a company and I am thrilled to be on this journey with my colleagues around the world. I am pleased with our Q1 2014 results, which reflect continued momentum in the business. Importantly, our revenue was well-diversified. We saw continue demand from our service providers across Web 2.0, cable and carriers in all geographies, as well as from the Americas Enterprise customers, reflecting significant opportunity to capture share in the meaningful, high-growth segments our Cloud-Builder and High IQ networking across the globe. Robyn will give you more color on the quarter in a moment, but before she does so, let me share with you the progress we’re making related to IOP. I am very impressed with the thoughtful and disciplined approach the team has taken to ensure the success of our IOP. We have already demonstrated our ability to execute quickly as one unified organization, or what we call one Juniper. I want to thank all of my colleagues around the world who have been responsible for implementing this plan and delivering the outstanding results this quarter. So, here is an update on our progress across the four dimensions of IOP. First, we have sharpened our strategic focus on the highest growth opportunities in the networking as customers migrate to best-in-class cloud environments and High IQ networks. The demand for highly scaled, sophisticated, secure, automated, context-aware networks and cloud environments requires the ensemble of agent core routing, switching, security, virtualization capabilities and network intelligence and control all working seamlessly together in an open framework. That is the value proposition that Juniper alone can offer. This strategy is focused on the continued diversification of our revenue with a deeper focus on a set of targeted customer segments that are in the build cycle for High IQ networks and cloud environments. We see four clear customer segments that fall into this category, carriers, cable, and content providers, where the network experience is fundamental to their business. Web 2.0 companies who are also at the forefront of building advanced, secure, intelligent networks. A set of enterprise customers like financial services and national governments, who are building large-scale internal clouds, and other enterprise customers who view the network as mission-critical to their business. This strategy is clearly resonating with our customers. In addition to today’s announcement with AT&T, we have secured a very important design win with a major global financial services company in transforming their network for best-in-class, cloud builder, and high IQ attributes. Second, we have implemented a One-Juniper structure to create a more focused, connected, agile, and execution-oriented company centered around the fastest growing opportunities in the marketplace, where we see the market evolving too, and equally as important where we excel as an innovation driven company. So let me tell you what we’ve done to execute towards the One-Juniper initiative. On the go-to-market side, we have evolved our model to one that is focused on targeted industry verticals. This is the next stage in our evolution from a geography and sector-based model. We have consolidated our advanced technology teams with a focus on being true centers of excellence around cloud building and high IQ networks. We are becoming more deliberately focused on a key set of partners who deliver these solutions and see them playing an important role in furthering our commercial business going forward. This structure allows us to be more connected to our customers than ever before to ensure we anticipate and co-create with them to meet their ever-changing needs driven by their highly dynamic end markets. I think of this as an outside-in customer imperative fused with Juniper’s inside out approach to innovation. On the R&D side of the house, you will hear more from Rami shortly about the new consolidated organization positioned to capitalize on Juniper’s engineering expertise across routing, switching, and security, tightly linked with our CT organization. This new consolidated R&D structure will optimize our engineering resources across product lines and leverage our products in a more holistic and differentiated fashion. Third, we are on schedule to eliminate $160 million in annualized structural costs from our operations with a clear glide path from second quarter 2014 to first quarter 2015. We have a detailed execution plan within each category of delayering, automation, and focused innovation that matters. These efficiencies will strengthen the company by focusing our resources on high growth areas of the market. Importantly, we have a governance model in place to ensure complete accountability. Our newly formed cost innovation board reporting directly to me meets regularly to ensure we stay on track with execution. We continue to work with an independent consultant to provide outside expertise as needed. And our entire leadership team is unified and fully committed to appropriately managing our cost structure. Robyn will cover our cost actions in more detail during her remarks. Fourth, in February, we introduced a new capital allocation program, which preserves flexibility for future growth while returning capital to our stockholders via buybacks and dividends. Robyn will review the progress we’ve made on this program during her remarks as well. In summary, I’m very confident in our integrated operating plan. The granularity of the execution plan and the level of oversight give us the confidence to achieve the goals we committed to in our IOP. Our strategy is the right one centered on meeting our customers’ most pressing needs with innovation that truly matters to them. We are committed to executing on the goals set up in February, including reducing our cost base and significantly increasing our operating margin profile to deliver profitable growth and shareholder value. In closing, this is my commitment. We will remain relentlessly focused on disciplined execution and we’ll continue to update you on a regular basis. Thank you for your time today. Now, I’ll pass the call over to Rami.
Rami Rahim: Thanks, Shaygan. I would like to first share details of our new Juniper development and innovation organization or JDI, and then provide insight into the key drivers behind our first quarter results. As Shaygan discussed, a key component of the IOP is to streamline our organization and our product portfolio combining our best-of-breed products for the world-class cross-functional innovation, and solutions to solve the most challenging and most meaningful used cases for our customers. In the first quarter, we made a serious of related organizational changes to ensure our R&D and go-to-market functions are focused on cross-functional execution attainment of JDI strategy and business plan. This included merging Juniper’s three product marketing teams into a single integrated marketing function and creating an integrated business operations team consolidating what was once two separate teams into a single team focused on driving JDI execution. These changes are consistent with our One-Juniper approach to reduce unnecessary complexity, increased clarity ownership, and improved efficiency. In addition, this new structure focuses our R&D resources on areas of innovation that matter most to our customers and partners high IQ networks and cloud. In short, these changes will give up the opportunity to truly focused on resources and double down on value creating technologies. For example, we have identified several pre-revenue generating project and are currently transitioning those resources and investing in technologies that matter most to our customers. Juniper remains firmly committed to our existing security, switching, and routing businesses. As Shaygan mentioned, each plays a vital role in our high IQ network and cloud builder strategy, and they areas where we excel as a company. Now, let me shift gears and share with you some insight into the performance drivers behind the first quarter results. Routing product revenue was up 7% year-over-year driven by strong performance in MX. Our increasing focus on customers building smarter networks, capable of generating faster return on their capital investment is paying off. Our MX Universal Edge continues to win in the market and this quarter we enabled many new customers with these capabilities. These customers include large carriers in North America, EMEA, APAC, and Latin America. This quarter, we will begin taking orders for the world’s fastest rich IP line cards with the MX2020 clocking in at over a half of terabit per second. Core was down this quarter mostly as a result of the lumpiness of build-up by large operators, but I’m pleased with current pipeline for core routing. Also, industry trends continue with service provider investment in Edge and Metro are outpacing that in core. Clearly, the MX is benefiting from that. We secured a number of new PTX logo wins in the past few weeks alone and that give us confidence in the future. In Q1, we shipped the industry’s highest density packet optical solutions with new Gig-E DWDM line cards for the PTX. We had a very strong quarter in switching with product revenue up 46% year-over-year, following a 36% year-over-year growth in Q4 2013.
 : During the first quarter, we had wins at top tier web services companies, large content providers, global banks, including a recent win with a major global financial services company and with high growth public cloud service providers. We’re encouraged by early interest and the sales ramp of the recently introduced QFX5100 top-of-rack switch in both enterprise and service provider applications. We are making good progress in our security business. While total product security revenue was down 2% year-over-year, we are seeing continued strength in our high-end SRX business with double-digit year-over-year growth as data center consolidation and clouds drive the need for performance and scale. We remain fully committed to our security business, focusing on what matters the most of our customers and where they are spending. It’s important to note that security is a critical element of, and fully aligned with our strategy and high IQ networks and cloud. We’re seeing good traction with our 100 Gig-E SRX I/O Card launched in the fourth quarter of last year. Juniper remains the only Firewall on the market with 100 Gig-E connectivity leading to wins in large cloud environment. For example, in the quarter, we had a win at a major Web 2.0 company, whereas 100 Gig-E was a critical differentiator. Q1 also saw the successful introduction of new innovation to embed security in the cloud with a Firefly product suite. We closed a key win in a top financial services firm on the strength of features like high availability and better operational efficiency through automation support.
 : At this point, I will turn it over to Robyn. Thank you.
Robyn Denholm: Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. I’m pleased to report that our Q1 2014 results reflect good year-over-year revenue growth and significant continued earnings expansion. Revenue grew 10% year-over-year and non-GAAP earnings per share grew 21%. We also continue to see strong demand signals. This sets the stage for what we expect will be continued year-over-year earnings expansion. I’m very pleased with the diversity of our revenue. We saw year-over-year growth in all three geographies with good revenue growth coming from our newer target areas within both the Service Provider and Enterprise segments. We continue to see strong demand from our Web 2.0 and cable customers. The trend that we saw in 2013 has continued in the third quarter. In the quarter, revenue growth was driven by strength in our switching and routing products and continued growth in our SRX-based security products. Before I go into detail behind the results of the quarter. I would like to review the financial impacts related to our integrated operating plan. On April 2, we disclosed restructuring charges related to the cost-saving initiatives that we have begun under our IOP. In Q1, we booked $122 million of restructuring and other charges. We announced a head count reduction of approximately 6% and the vast majority of the affected employees have already been notified. In Q1, the head count related restructuring charges were $28 million. Non-cash asset write-downs of $94 million included $85 million related to the cancellation of the development of the application delivery controller technology and $8 million related to inventory. As we have stated, we are committed to achieving an annualized operating expense run rate reduction of $160 million. We are making good progress towards this target. These changes are expected to be structural. We anticipate the mix of savings to be as follows, approximately 60% related to head count savings, 20% related to program and project reductions, with the balance coming from facilities consolidation and other savings. The fiscal 2015, we expect an expense to revenue ratio of approximately 39%. Please refer to our chart in our supplemental slide deck posted to our website of our expected quarterly operating expense path over the next four quarters. In addition to our IOP cost reduction activities, during the quarter we announced robust and comprehensive capital allocation strategy. I’d like to walk you through the actions we have taken, which highlight our strong balance sheet and cash flow potential. As part of our commitment to return a minimum of $3 billion of capital to stockholders over the next three years. We initiated $1.2 billion accelerated stock repurchase program of which $900 million worth of shares were initially delivered in Q1. We also raised $350 million of debt, allowing us to fund the ASR in a way that is consistent with our liquidity policy. Now I would like to move into a discussion with the Q1 results. Looking at our demand metrics, we begin the second quarter with a very healthy backlog. Our book-to-bill in Q1 was slightly below one, which is typical of our Q1 trends. Product bookings were healthy with a year-over-year growth rate exceeding the revenue growth rate. Total deferred revenue was up $174 million year-over-year and $85 million sequentially. Product deferred revenue was down $14 million sequentially, due primarily to lower channel inventory. Total revenue was $1,170 million, up 10% year-over-year and down 8% sequentially. The sequential decline is in line with our typical seasonal pattern. Product revenue was up 12% year-over-year and down 10% sequentially. Services revenue was $294 million, up 6% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. There were no 10% customers this quarter reflecting the continued diversity of our business. For the quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.22. We recorded a GAAP restructuring charge of $122 million, which resulted in $0.25 impact on GAAP earnings. This was offset by a $0.33 gain from the sale of minority equity investments. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.29, up $0.05 year-over-year and down $0.14 sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven primarily by higher revenue and operating margins. In the quarter, we had a positive impact from the reduced share count of about $0.01. Now, let me provide color on revenue by region, market, and product area. All regions reflected year-over-year revenue growth. Overall, Americas revenue was up 15% year-over-year and declined 1% sequentially. Americas service provider was up 13% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. As a reminder, our service provider revenue includes carrier, cable, and Web 2.0 customers. Americas enterprise increased 22% year-over-year and declined 15% sequentially. The strong year-on-year growth was led by federal and financial services. EMEA revenue was up 2% year-over-year and down 18% sequentially. Of note, we saw strong year-on-year performance in the German and UK market. APAC increased 9% year-over-year and decreased 16% sequentially. These results reflect service provider growth year-over-year in both Korea and Australia. Service provider revenue for the quarter was $783 million, down 5% sequentially and up 10% year-over-year with growth across all three geographies. Enterprise revenue was $387 million, down 13% sequentially and up 12% year-over-year due to broad-based strength in the Americas and public sector spending in EMEA and APAC. Now, let me review our revenue by product area. Routing product revenue was $550 million, down 11% sequentially and up 7% year-over-year. Revenue was driven by strong performance in MX, while the new MX2000 series and the MX104 continue to gain traction and experience solid growth sequentially. This growth was offset by a decline in T-series revenues, both sequentially and year-over-year. Total switching product revenue was $192 million, up 46% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially from a record Q4 2013. This was driven by strong sales of both EX and QFabric product families. And we are pleased with demand for both areas. Total security product revenue was $134 million, down 15% sequentially and 2% year-over-year. This is due to the continued decline of the oldest ScreenOS products and non-Junos-based products now represent less than 15% of our security revenue. The SRX products grew 13% year-over-year, led by good growth in the high-end SRX. Moving on to gross margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margins for the quarter was 63.5% compared to 64.2% last quarter and 64.6% a year-ago. The sequential decline was largely due to a decrease in services gross margins. Non-GAAP product gross margins were 64.8%, down one-tenth of a point from last quarter and seven-tenths of a point from a year-ago. The sequential decrease reflects anticipated lower volume, whilst the year-over-year decrease is primarily due to mix. While the pricing environment remains competitive, we remain focused on innovation and cost improvements in our supply chain. Non-GAAP services gross margin was 59.7%, down 2.2 points sequentially and down 2.4 points year-over-year. The declines are related to high support costs and increased spares. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $542 million, about what we anticipated due to an increase in legal costs. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 17.2% reflecting a year-over-year expansion of 1.5 points due to higher revenue offset by lower gross margins. The non-GAAP tax rate was 25.6% compared to 18.8% last quarter. This change is primarily due to the expiration of the federal R&D tax credit and one-time items that were reflected in the prior quarter. The GAAP tax rate was 25.3% compared to 18% in Q4. The increases is primarily due to the net gain on the sale of minority equity investments and the expiration of the federal R&D tax credit. This is partially offset by the impact of restructuring other charges. Looking at the balance sheet, we made substantial progress on our commitment to return capital to our stockholders. During the quarter, 33.3 million shares under the ASR program were initially delivered and retired for an aggregate purchase price of $900 million. These actions reduced the average diluted share count to 497 million, down by 9 million shares sequentially. We ended the quarter with $2.1 billion of net cash and investments. Net cash declined by approximately $1 billion sequentially, primarily due to the ASR. We continued to generate strong operating cash flow of $126 million, down sequentially due to the seasonally lower income and annual payments for incentive comp. Onshore cash and investments represented 29% of total growth balance. In line with recent trend, DSO was 46 days and capital expenditures were $57 million in the quarter. Depreciation and amortization expense was $46 million. Now, let’s look at our outlook for Q2 of 2014. As a reminder, these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis except for revenue and share count. As demonstrated in our recent results, we are executing well and the assets we are making to drive further execution improvements are taking hold. We see underling demand in the markets we serve is healthy and we expect to continue the year-over-year expansion in earnings. For the second quarter, we expect revenues to range from $1,200 million to $1,230 million. Gross margins are expected to be 64% plus or minus 0.5%. Operating expenses are expected to be $520 million, plus or minus $5 million, and we’re well positioned to deliver on our cost reduction commitments. Operating margins are expected to be a healthy 21%, plus or minus 0.5%. And this is expected to result in non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $0.36 and $0.39 per share assuming a share count of approximately $480 million. We expect a flat tax rate versus the third quarter. As a reminder and as previously disclosed in Q2 and throughout the rest of this year, we expect to book additional restructuring charges, the majority of which will be related to facility and other asset write-downs. To summarize, we anticipate overall demand to remain healthy, and our product portfolio continues to be strong. We are very focused on executing on our integrated operating plan and continuing to drive innovation. Now, let’s open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Brian Marshall of ISI Group. Please go ahead.
Brian Marshall – ISI Group: Hi, thanks. This is Stephen Patel calling in for Brian. Could you clarify in your OpEx guidance about 20% of the cost savings coming from actions taken to programs and projects. Have those actions already been announced and how should we think about any associated revenue growth impact from those cuts?
Shaygan Kheradpir: Yes, Stephen for Brian, thanks for the question. We have a very deterministic glide path that we shared with you, and we track these – our cost saving cuts very rigorously almost on a weekly basis. We have taken a lot of the actions, it’s actually front loaded, and – but the savings of these will come – the actions are taken, but the savings will come through the second quarter and the third quarter. Most of the head count related cuts have been already taken and we’ve executed those. They will come – some of them already done, some of them will take longer, because they are in regions which just takes longer to get off payroll. And let me see if Robyn, you want to say anything else on that?
Robyn Denholm: No, I think you answered the question well. Thanks, Shaygan.
Kathleen Nemeth: Okay. Next question?
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Ben Reitzes of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Ben Reitzes – Barclays Capital: Yes, good afternoon. A few if I may, Could we just parse out that legal expense and what costs would have been in the quarter without it and how much is recurring? I think that will help lend visibility to your plan and credibility behind that cadence you have on the slide. And then also Shaygan, if you could just talk about the sustainability of the switching momentum, what are you really seeing there and how sustainable is it, because obviously 46%. I think that need everybody’s model for the second quarter in a row. And what you see in the competitive dynamics there? Thanks a lot.
Shaygan Kheradpir: Sure, Ben. So the first question I’ll ask also Robyn determine. Most of the upward pressure we saw on the first quarter was due to legal on G&A. I will ask her to parse that I suffice it to say before I pass the Robyn. And then I’ll come back on the switching. Is that we are committed and we see our way clearly to the $160 million cost cuts as laid out in that charts that we have published between now and first quarter 2015, quarter-by-quarter. So for example we would be at $520 million in second quarter and $510 million in the third quarter and less than $500 million the first quarter 2015. We are quite clearly to that we’ve got most of the actions front loaded and executing. So, you shouldn’t worry about the 160. And in terms of the legal. I’ll pass it to Robyn and then I’ll come back on switching.
Robyn Denholm: Thanks, Shaygan. In terms of the legal expenses that Shaygan mentioned they were above what we were expecting for the quarter. If you look at the G&A increase quarter-over-quarter a substantial is $7 million to $8 million. And the majority of that in fact more than that increase is due to legal in the quarter. Some of which was expected and some of which wasn’t as I mean in prepared remarks. If you look year-over-year in terms of OpEx, we have been making progress and that is in pre-out recently announced actions that we have been taking. So, if you look at our OpEx is a total as a percentage of revenue is about 46.3% of revenue in the first quarter of 2014 versus 48.9% for last year. So, we have been making some progress even though the legal expenses did increase more than we were anticipating in the quarter.
Shaygan Kheradpir: And if I can, thanks Robyn. I’ll take the switching. Obviously, we had, we are very pleased with the switching quarter. I can tell you and I have been engaged since I have been here with a lot of conversions with the customers of what they are doing, why they are doing and specially in regard to switching. It’s actually quite fascinating. It’s a lot around Cloud-Builder and is putting in place our switching with our routing and security as an ensemble and our controller and Contrail into sort of many accounts. Now, every single one of them that I have been engaged, if you’re actually sophisticated implementations and each company is doing something quite interesting. And so that is also lend itself very well to Juniper’s DNA on sitting with the customers and cranking. So, they love features in Cloud-Building like in service software upgrade that’s a fantastic feature do you love. They love things like micro-bursting, which gives them lot of telemetry and very fine-grained levels. They love the fact that they can write get the on some switches. And on and on and on. And they like the fact that they are open, high for scale with sort of no extra package and they can do a lot of things that each of them once they are slightly differently. And the fact they work very well with MX and SRX.
 :
Rami Rahim:  Yes, I think you covered most of it, I’d just say that the team has been working really hard over the last year and so when we consolidated our switching organization we streamline, simplified our portfolio and we implemented as number of capabilities from fabric technologies, IQ and a number of different things that Shaygan mentioned has made our portfolio including switching, routing and security really appealing to both enterprise and service provider.
Shaygan Kheradpir: Yes, I would just say one other thing, its Rami hit as a nail on the head where the leverage engineering between routing and switching actually quite phenomenal and why customers buy in a switching it’s not your grandfathers switch and security is your grandfathers, this is a new world and all the leverage engineering we are getting from Junos really giving us a leg up and of course open net derivatives since you talk about.
Kathleen Nemeth: Okay great. Next question please.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Ehud Gelblum of Citi Group. Please go ahead.
Ehud A. Gelblum – Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: 
 : Shaygan you mentioned the pre-revenue projects that you are getting rid off and of course that you are trimming the cost structure, you are finding a number of these, can you give us some example beside from the right opt for the riverbed deal, where you can give us best example and that’s things you have gotten out of, so we can understand this kind of put a red basket box, whatever targets around kind of understand the different areas, that you are getting about, and identify any other areas kind of that you can that you think you still might be looking toward. And then finally Robyn again it’s been at the legal thing and again, brought up last conference call and then it’s brought up here again. But can we just be specific in terms of what was the actual legal amount this quarter? what we are expecting I know there was some controversies last quarter on whether its $15 million this quarter you expecting from legal. So we assume that it was $15 million plus 7 to 8 you actually spent $23 million this quarter on legal. But you expected $15 million if you are going to just give us the Q1 legal where that goes in Q2. So we can compare, what that looks like in Q2, and just levels that us a Q4 number as well and that’s a lot, but that really it’s kind of set that bar as to what’s the ups and downs in legal and kind of how that is falling through those three quarters, that would be, great. Thanks.

Thanks.
Robyn Denholm: And Ehud I think that was like 18 questions rising there but …
Ehud A. Gelblum – Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: It was three main topics broken down to a category part…
Shaygan Kheradpir: I know, I know I am just kidding, I am just kidding yes, yes. So on AT&T as I am sure you are familiar to have this program called domain 2.0 which is called the user defined network cloud. And essentially they are pushing their network into the next phase which is around clouds and it’s around a lot of attributes of the cloud. So what are those attributes they obviously, is a carrier class nature of it which you are very good at Fort Knox security which is very, very good at. Multi tendency and in terms of the high IQ piece of it it’s a lot around automation for efficiency and effectiveness in terms of virtualization and so forth and so on. Service chaining, traffic movements a lot of STN, so a lot of the attributes that you put together to create a modern cloud based architectures they have been very clear this is what they want. And they – we are very fortunate to be sort of selected for these attributes. And we have by the way products in all of these categories and they work and they work very well each other. So and I believe, I don’t know this to be a fact but I believe that would a first re-routing and a supplier announced I don’t know but that’s so I think we’re very pleased with that. What was the other question?
Robyn Denholm: Some of the project that we might be investing from, Rami has that.
Shaygan Kheradpir: Right. So, I’ll pass it on to Rami so, and he can go more but, I would just say that with high IQ looked at our product lines are very carefully through operated charge, in terms of return on investment, in terms of the match to cloud builder on high IQ our strategy, so fact that to say we are focusing on growth and we are focusing on accretive work that matters to our customers. And based on that we have – you saw decision on ADC and as far as normal course of business we do continuous mark-to-market to evaluate our products and projects. And we are transitioning our portfolio to technologies that match our strategy and on our workforce and where can get leverage engineering Rami do you want to say a few more words on that.
Rami Rahim: I’ll just add that, we on an ongoing basis are always in the process of evaluating the ROI expectations the market conditions of all of our project and making decisions based on this analysis. And the IOP was really no exception to that we did take a look across the board of all of our projects and we did identify a number of pre-revenue generating projects that we will transition resources off of and to put them on projects that are more highly aligned if you will with our strategy things like STN and NFB like many of our forward thinking customers are thinking about today and on legal Robyn.
Robyn Denholm: Yes. Let me just add on the project side, the projects we evaluate with not just R&D Rami went through some of the R&D projects. We’ve also evaluated other projects that we’ve been doing on the infrastructure side within the company as well and some of those will, I’ve seen targeted for completion or preparation if you like as well. So it’s an across-the-board review of our project, across all three of the areas. So specific to legal, I’m not going to give you the dollar amount, but I will point you to the G&A line that you can see in the press release and on the various filings that we’ve done. And what you can see that G&A is up significantly year-over-year, it’s 39% year-over-year increase, and the legal expense increase is more or less the entire increase. So you can say that it is – has been a large amount. Having said that as Shaygan mentioned, we are committed to achieving the $160 million of cost reductions on an annualized basis exiting Q1 of next year.
Ehud A. Gelblum – Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Thank you. And we are co-listing all our resources around driving profitable growth and connecting report and growth. Thank you.
Kathleen Nemeth: Okay. Next question Manny?
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Jess Lubert – Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Hi, guys, two questions, maybe just a follow-up on your earlier switching question, but given some of the cloud momentum and big wins you mentioned on the call, do you think Q1 is a new base off of which we should see sustainable sequential growth moving forward, or would you expect some lumpiness there? And then I was hoping you could help us better understand some of the dynamics driving the uptick in support costs and spares that impacted service margin in the period, when you think about the likely range of service margin moving forward. Should we be thinking about numbers getting back into the 61% to 63% range, we’ve seen over the last few years or should we expect service margin to remain closer to current levels? Thanks.
Shaygan Kheradpir: Sure. I will pass this question. The first one is about forward momentum on cloud building. Just suffice it to say that we – we are pleased with the momentum and the pipeline of what we see. Rami, do you want to give some more color to that?
Rami Rahim: Yes, I would be happy to, thanks, Jess. So as you know, our Switching business has an enterprise component where we are selling to enterprise, IT, private cloud and data center, machine critical campus combination, as well as service provider applications, including things like cloud data center intra-POP infrastructure connectivity, certain parts of access infrastructure. And I have said in the past that especially the service provider components of that business can be lumpy. In Q1 we actually saw strength in both enterprise and service provider. So can you expect this level of performance going forward, I would say that’s probably unrealistic. Our goal is to continue to take market share and I’m very confident in our ability to do so.
Shaygan Kheradpir: And, Robyn, do you want to take that.
Robyn Denholm: Yes, so in terms of the services gross margin Jess, the gross margin in the quarter was 59.7%, it has been quite some quarter since we’ve been below 60%. And the reason for that as I mentioned in my prepared remarks was that the support costs were higher in the quarter and we also had increased bearing. We normally get increasing bearing when we have our new customers or new contracts or new product introduction. And so the timing of those do vary from time to time in terms of when we get those spares on board. So we do expect the services gross margin to improve from this low level of 59.7% in the quarter.
Kathleen Nemeth: Great. Next question please Manny?
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Kvaal of Northland Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jeff Kvaal – Northland Capital Markets: Hi, thank you very much and happy to be back in business. Could I ask a couple of questions, one is from a high-level? There has been some talk about our core routing refresh cycle and I think talk about some of the carriers running hot. There seems to be now, your commentary was more focused on growth from the edge than the core. If you could sit some light on that I would to be delighted. And then Robyn for you, could you clarify a little bit lower products deferred revenue outlook, the channel is that driven by seasonality is that driven by a pullback from certain areas of business what goes into that reduction in the channel? Thank you.
Shaygan Kheradpir: Okay, on the first one I’ll ask Rami to comment the hedge dynamic versus the core dynamics, which is obviously different. And can you just focus on the core please.
Rami Rahim: Sure, thanks Jeff. But you’re right the strength we saw on routing was primarily back in the hedge and primarily driven by our MX product line. And that’s essentially a play out of the strategy that we have been developing on the MX product line around the universal edge. So, in carriers and service providers are looking to consolidate their services onto fewer networks and to provide virtualization to enable business residential in video and mobile type services, we really have a fantastic weapon to compete within the form of the MX. On the core, you’re right core was in fact down, I think the biggest things that we saw in Q1 was primarily that of lumpiness in spending and in the builder. I say that because if you take a look at Q4 of last year, the core investment was actually quite okay. And then if you look at our pipeline if you will. They’re again I think what you see somewhat encouraging. There is in fact also an industry trend, which we had mentioned in the past where the bulk of the investments and routing is still happening in the edge and in the metro. And that of course is putting pressure on those parts of the network the edge and the metro, which the MX benefits from and to some extent it can elevate some of the pressure from the core. So that might push out the need for investments in the core of it. The best thing that Juniper can do in a situation like this is to execute on a high leverage R&D strategy for a product that satisfied both market segments edge and core and to be ready for the cycle irrespective of where it actually start to occur. 
Jeff Kvaal – Northland Capital Markets: Thank you, Rami and Robyn you want to talk about deferred revenue question?
Robyn Denholm: Yes, Jeff in terms of the channel inventory, it is typically the case in our Q1 that there is a seasonal reduction in the inventory. But I would also so we had a strong channel quarter as well. So a strong finish all the way through to the end of the quarter through the channel. And as Shaygan mentioned in his prepared remarks, we are doing a lot of business with our channel partners in terms of particularly on the enterprise, but also on the service provider area as well. And so we have a strong focus on partnering and on the channel so. And the inventory volumes will lower as we exhibit the quarter. 
Jeff Kvaal – Northland Capital Markets: Thanks.
Kathleen Nemeth:  Okay, great. Next question please. 
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Sanjiv Wadhwani of Stifel. Please go ahead. 
Sanjiv R. Wadhwani – Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.:  Thanks so much. Two questions, perhaps if you look at the router outlook right now versus a year ago. I just wondering if you guys could make a comment on sort of how things stand now versus a year ago. And as far as the cost of announced in early April. Any color on where they happened and specifically what product areas where impacted that most in those cuts? Thanks.
Shaygan Kheradpir: Sure, Sandeep. So again I’ll start and then I’ll pass them to my colleagues here. So on routing, what’s going on I’ll give you the top-level dynamic as I see them. First of all you’ve got obviously that – well everybody knows which is the bandwidth growth, which is driven really by mobile and content concentrated by video, there is pressure there. Now that actually that pressure people usually think about it in the carrier networks spread – it splashes also into data centers and clouds and also some interesting ways. So that’s an end-to-end pressure and routing is very much front and center on both ends of this. Then you’ve got Rami mentioned, the second one is convergences and convergence is in two forms, one is on the access sides, that’s things like P&G and then there is now finally a good move towards wireless and wireline network convergence and when that happens and you’ve got the beautiful machine called MX which is right at the front center and PTX. And then the key part of this is more and more every month that passes, we all are getting stuff as a service that is an undeniable fact and that – to do that you need to build this giant cloud systems and High IQ networks a lot of the attributes we’ve been talking about and there it’s much more a layer 3 discussion and as soon as you have layer 3 discussions, you land on routing, you land on routing, you land on MX, PTX and T series and all the rich, both the rich functionality on the agents, there is so many, we can’t even count and then super high scale at the core. And so all of these three things we don’t see that these pressures are abating relative to last year. Rami do you want to sort of give the overview on it?
Rami Rahim: The only thing I’ll add Shaygan is that if I look at service provider again with that definition of web services and telco and cable then the market in fact should be a healthy market for us in this year. So it really comes down to the competitiveness of our products and our ability to actually go and satisfy the pressures that they are seeing and that’s where I’d just reiterate that I’m actually quite confident in product and the technology that we have in the market and what’s coming up in the roadmap.
Shaygan Kheradpir: Very good, so as far as the second question was around cost cuts right? Yes, so the cost cuts I would say all of them will make our company stronger going forward because they are around taking bureaucracy out, delayering the organization, the duplicating repetitive effort and as fact, so basically all of those that aren’t closed about, our customers like its grade I can go directly back to back with your best people be it on go to market and engineering. Its going sort of back to way it was in a bigger fashion, so that’s good. The biggest leverage is actually amongst all it. Its not that they have put teams together for example in engineering there is all sorts of leverage work that we can get across the board in one – one are in the organization as an example. And sharpen your focus on things that matter which is on cloud building and High IQ and things frankly that we are not going to focus on either because its not really our core competency, or its not where the market is going and we’re going to focus on growth. So that really their focus and the cost cuts I’m certain of it, they are going to make the company stronger going forward for the following reasons. There is a lot of work, its not only in R&D, in go to market having focused on those verticals that are in the business of cloud building, High IQ networks and where our networks are mission critical and little deepening relationship putting our entire portfolio in play, in interesting ways to take share, more valid share out of those accounts. And then be a little bit deliberate on partners much more much deliberately partnered dependent, and then the whole organization is one Juniper focused on the strategy. So the cost cuts should really be viewed in that way that they that out there – they will actually make the company stronger. Robyn, do you want to say anything?
Robyn Denholm:  No I think you’ve covered a lot. Also earlier in the Q&A Rami went through that in R&D we had cut some projects like the agency that were non-revenue generating and therefore and not aligned. So there was a thorough review done in terms of both projects that would not revenue generating and also not aligned with the cloud builder in High IQ strategy, and so the teams has done a very good job on executing and spacing those types of projects as well.
Shaygan Kheradpir:  It’s not accretive and it’s not aligned to the strategy and its not leverage engineering, it doesn’t really survive.
Kathleen Nemeth:  Okay, great. Next question please, Manny.
Operator: Thank you. The next is from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Simona Jankowski – Goldman Sachs & Co.: I had a couple of questions on the cost side and on the revenue side as well. So first on the cost side I think you talked about some cuts and consolidation you did in R&D operations and marketing, or there any outflow cuts to sales?
Robyn Denholn: Yes, they were Simona, there is cuts in sales and marketing as well, in fact if you look at our slide deck, we put the glide path in there from Q4 of 2013 quarterly OpEx and we’ve also put a chart that shows by area, R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A. What we expect the profile of our go forward OpEx to be and again the profile from where we are coming from which is the Q4 2013 numbers versus the Q1 2015 estimates that we have in terms of the post IOP, post 116 reduction on an annualized basis. And so there are cuts across the board, G&A, R&D, and sales and marketing.
Shaygan Kheradpir: Yes. Of course in G&A Simona there is operation. Robyn side exactly right on the sales front, we really are focusing both on service provider and enterprise those segments that we mentioned. We are gathering our forces around those segments, so they can go deeper and more focused and frankly all those customers sets they want the same things that, for example in AT&T and Verizons which is depth and with a lot of technical hands on skills. And so that’s really the sales motion and getting that focus will also gives us synergies which is in another way of what Rami is doing win, he is doing go to market, Rami is doing good to get the leverage on engineering and making sure we’re focused on cloud building and high IQ network. So you should think of it more as a focus on debt and leverage rather than, sort of cuts that weaken you.
Kathleen Nemeth: And Simona, do you have a follow-up question as well. Manny, can you open the line again for Simona, I believe Simona had a follow-up.
Operator: Sorry, and just one moment.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thank you.
Simona Jankowski – Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes, thank you very much. Yes, I did have a follow-up question on the revenue side, so you talked about de-emphasizing or cutting some of the resources for three revenue project, does that imply that you are still focusing on some early revenue projects like Junos Pulse, the wireless LAN business, and the access business. And really the bigger picture question here I’m trying to get to is, you’ve given us a lot of hopeful detail on the cost saving side, but as we tried to think about what is the sustainable revenue growth profile for Juniper now with this set of businesses in the next two to three years, how should we think about that and part of the missing piece is that we don’t really know if you’re still pursuing some of the enterprise edge on access kind of businesses that I just mentioned?
Shaygan Kheradpir: Yes, Simona, this is Shaygan again. I would just summarize that we are not providing competitive information on this call. So that sort of point number one, we are not drilling into that zone. On the cuts, the cuts are structural, they will remain with us. And in fact, this is a muscle that the organization is building, which is good, we can always get more efficient all the time and we will leave it at that. And when we have more news about anything in terms of products, we will share with you. But right now suffice it to say, we’re focused on Cloud Builder and High IQ. And, Rami, do you want to say anything else there?
Rami Rahim: No, I think that summarizes it. I will just – I just want to reiterate what I 100% committed towards switching or routing and our security businesses. I think we got a great team, great technology, fantastic roadmap, and now one that is very highly aligned with our forward looking strategy with Cloud Builder and High IQ.
Robyn Denholm: Yes, and I just want to remind you as well that, the integrated operating plan is about also focusing on the top line revenue growth. It’s not just about cost reductions. We’re talking a lot about cost reductions today, because it’s the first time we’ve unveiled our glide path and the detail of the cost reductions. But what – we’re about is actually growing and expanding our operating margins and our earnings over time. And we know that to do that we have to invest in the right innovations and the right market that really our customers need and want. And that will actually ultimately drive our revenue growth as well, which we’ve been doing very well over the last six quarters or so in terms of revenue growth.
Kathleen Nemeth: Great. Thank you. Manny, next question?
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Mark McKecknie of Evercore. Please go ahead.
Mark McKecknie – Evercore Partners: Great, thanks. Hi, Shaygan and crew, I appreciate you get me in here. So a couple of questions, one, last quarter your router orders were pretty strong up 20% quarter-on-quarter, 30% year-on-year. So looking at the near-term and the context of your guidance, it looks like about 5% sequential at the midpoint, and we heard a lot of comments on the Switching business, would you expect a little bit of growth next quarter, quarter-on-quarter for routers, what type of margin impact that might have on the mix? And then the second question is on the AT&T award, first off congratulations on that, but I wanted to know, who you competed against their. It sound like this is more for sort of public cloud business as opposed to some of the NFP. I want to understand that and I’m assuming this is QFabric in some of your Contrail on a controller. But on that front, are you going to work with someone else’s controller VMware someone else or is this a full QFabric and Contrail type solution? Thanks
Shaygan Kheradpir:  Sure, first thanks for congratulating us on the AT&T. We are all very excited about that. And by the way, on the AT&T question you should reach after them about that this scope of it. Suffice it to say it’s a material and it’s really that Domain 2.0 kind of work that they’ve been talking about. As far as routing is concerned, the pipeline, the design wins and the backlog, they are all pleased with those numbers for routing. And as both Rami and Robyn was said there is a different dynamics between edge and the core and the lumpiness of the core and they are out in the first quarter and all the activity around hedge that is happening under first quarter. But the pipeline we are pleased both from pipeline and design wins and the backlog on routing anything else Rami you want to add that.
Robyn Denholm: I’ll just add for Rami, don’t forget that last year in Q2. We had a sizable amount of our enterprise routing with the government customers. So just there in mind with that when you look at our result. Having said that, we are very pleased with the strength of routing particularly in the service provider space in terms of pipeline and design wins that we have as Shaygan mentioned. So, we are actually expecting Q2 on the service provider side to improve in terms of routing in the second quarter. 
Shaygan Kheradpir: I would just agree with that. I would say I’d expect continue to strength in our edge portfolio and keep in mind that we are continually enhancing these product offering itself that we are starting to take orders now for new line cards that’s going to give us a real good performance increase in addition to new software capabilities. On enterprise routing was actually good for us in Q1 and I see a good pipeline there. And then finally I provided some commentary on the core, the pipeline for the core coupled with some wins that we’ve had recently in our PTX, in fact it’s our brand new logo for us. Are going to start to pay off now is that going to happen this quarter or the next quarter is difficult to say usually there is a certification cycle that takes a good couple of quarters, maybe even three quarters to play out. But based on all of that, all of the above I said have pretty good confidence in Q2.
Mark McKecknie – Evercore Partners: Gotcha, thanks. Shaygan nothing on the competitive front for this AT&T, when I guess will find out?
Shaygan Kheradpir: Yeah, I mean, I should really situate – I don’t have average ability like that all I can say is the engagement with them has been fantastic and very forward looking across the board all the things. There was a question I think also about Contrail and I don’t want to talk about anyone specific customer, but I will say that network function virtualization is a very hot topic today as many of you already know. We’re engaging with the number of our customers on that topic and showing them proof-of-concepts of technology that we have that essentially couple. Our high performance services on the edge, on the MX, for example, along with the layer 4 to layer 7 service is that virtualize on general-purpose processors. Now that solution has to be nicely coupled together and provided in a way provide seamless service experience across both physical and virtual and Contrail plays a fundamental role in that. So Contrail now in fact over just a past short period of time has gone into life deployments and we have gone to probably around 2 to 3 dozen engagements and live trials with some customers around the world.
Kathleen Nemeth: Okay, great. Next question please Manny.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Amitabh Passi of UBS. Please go ahead.
Amitabh Passi – UBS Securities LLC:  Hi, thank you ask couple of quick questions on your security segment. This is a segment that has been quite volatile although we are seeing year-over-year trends improve. I was wondering if this is a segment that you actually believe can grow in 2014, particularly when we are hearing greater competitive pressure from companies like a F5, particularly in the service provider community. And I also wondered on Shaygan do you requiring incremental investments in this part of the business and can you support that given all the OpEx rationalization that you’re doing?
Shaygan Kheradpir: Yes, thank you for the question. So, I’ll go through it. The quick version of the answer is that yes, we expect our security to grow year-over-year, now what I have to tell you is securities are paramount importance to our strategy, because you can’t really as I said have a cloud be a Cloud Builder and not have security. In fact, it’s much more important than before. We are pleased with our performance and growth in our SRX and Firewall both in enterprise as well as on service provider, we have as you know decline in our ScreenOS, the declines are – we had 6 ScreenOS flagship design, it was 20% of the base in that 15%, so that’s diminishing. As you said correctly it is, I would believe it is stabilizing it is too be minus 18%, minus 7%, minus 2% year-over-year and we expected to return to growth by the end of this year. Having said all that we are not satisfied of where we are and we need to execute better, we acknowledge that and now that we have security in, are coming R&D team. I think we are going to get a much better leverage engineering and with everything else we have. And as you well know security market is changing, security is moving into the core, cloud, security is virtualizing everywhere else. Security is in desperate needs of high analytics. Because when you have a cloud and High IQ networking have a lot of valuable assets in it. And so having analytics to defend especially against things like military spider attack is very important. And of course you have to and need to have high efficacy. And we have a lot of capabilities, now we have to execute better they all under one R&D organization and that’s our focus is to return back to year-over-year growth. Rami, do you want to say anything else on that? 
Rami Rahim: I will just add, we saw a great growth in the high end, that direct double digit growth and I don’t think that’s an accident that the result of a lot of really hard work had gone into improving the session scale, the performance, the efficacy of that solution something that we are proud of and I think we demonstrated what we can do, when we focused on the rest of the portfolio and that’s exactly what we’re in the process of doing right now. And it’s going on the last thing as I says that there will be a high leverage approach to doing so. The work that we’ve done in the high end absolutely applicable for the rest of our portfolio.
Kathleen Nemeth:  Next question please. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Rod Hall of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Rod B. Hall – JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yes, hi guys thanks for taking my question. I just had a follow-up question on earlier question and then other one for Shaygan. So I just wanted to see if Robyn or Rami you guys would give us the order volume growth rate for routers in Q1. And then kind of related to that and that $471 million of backlog exceeding the year. And I know you don’t usually get that number, except for the Q4, but it sounds like I mean your book-to-bill is such as just slightly less than one, is it right to think you’re carrying pretty much as similar level of backlog on its Q2. And then for Shaygan, I just Shaygan could you comment on, I think you made comment before about how you’re reallocating technical resources for large accounts and trying to just get more effective the way you put together Juniper’s product range when you talk to these big accounts or looking at architecture. I just wondered if you could comment on how far through that you are and whether you have learned anything from those changed engagement levels with some of those accounts? Thanks.
Robyn Denholm: So, Rod. I’ll start on the order booking commentary. So, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the order booking overall for the company was higher then our revenue growth and that’s very good thing for Q1 actually. And as you know typically when we are going into the next quarter a lot of the backlog is our routing products. And so, as Shaygan mentioned earlier that is one of the reasons why we are confident in our routing in a pipeline, because we have visibility to that we also have visibility to the design wins and we have a very good portfolio in terms of routing across the board as Rami mentioned. So, I think that answers your question with that our overall bookings rate was higher than our revenue growth in the quarter.
Shaygan Kheradpir: And Rod, on your second question. Yes, I have embedded deep personally with our teams in many of these accounts that’s have been here across all those segments that we mentioned. And I have tell you, once your are underground and you see the action and you see all the interesting workloads and very new and non-linear workloads that our customers are trying to handle and the problems were trying to solve on the innovation side, on the quality side revenue generation, automation and like it is absolutely paramount that we have our in the best and brightest teams on go-to-market on operations on technical and engineering shoulder-to-shoulder with them. And so this now have you heard this saying, people have heard me to say this before have been through. These cycles, when we are going through non linearity or inflection points in tech. We are absolutely going through one of this five years from now history if is a judge we normalize and then we can go normal formations and every can do there little bits and brigade can begin of delivery. This is not one of those times if you sit in with the cloud providers, Web 2.0, carriers and so forth and so on cable, financial services and the like. They are trying to solve stuff that frankly they had never seen before in terms of sophistication, complexity, scale, why is that the case is because everything is more as a service delivered to the end market continuously and that requires a different level of scale and sophistication and every company has a different starting point, every company has a different enduser market that they are trying to satisfy. Every company is trying to get an edge in this new world that they all see. And so being in force and in-depth in these companies to ensure you don’t miss those nuances and we can execute on them and normalize those features in your product line is absolutely crucial. Now the great news about Juniper is this is what Juniper is. They are a builder company by DNA, so it’s a fantastic opportunity for all of us in Juniper to engage and grow up our sleeves. And I have to tell you I’m having a fantastic time being at the shop floor of all these accounts and it’s phenomenal what’s going on, on the ground. I’ve been in this business almost 30 years in networking and this reminds me of the days when I first came out of college and I saw this, it’s very cool, it’s very exciting, it’s very sophisticated, and the world out there really desperate to meet all these innovations that we are an increasingly in place to deliver and to do that you have to have different skill and know-how and be able to take customers from one side of the river to the other side and build a bridge for them. So, yes, long answer to your question. We are super excited to Juniper about this opportunity.
Kathleen Nemeth: Okay, great. Next question please?
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Brian Modoff – Deutsche Bank Research: Hi, guys. I have a couple of questions if I could. First, in terms of the cutbacks in R&D, do you worry about any of those cutbacks impacting some of your next generation ASIC developments for your kind of a MX PTX products coming out next year? Second, can you talk about kind of work here in the STN framework what your least fine strategy is, do you plan, right now is 110 gig switches, top-of-rack switches that are driving your revenues? What’s your strategy on 1040, can you talk a little bit about that please? Thank you.
Shaygan Kheradpir: Sure. So let me assure you, we are not cutting any muscle out of R&D that matters to our strategy and to our customers, in fact, it’s the opposite. We are focusing our forces around a set of things that we think truly matter and we’re putting all the force rather than be distributed and distracted. So we should view IOP as a focus on sort of big things that matter, and obviously ASIC know that you just mentioned is one of them. On the switching side I have Rami chime in, obviously we cannot give competitive information, where we’re going. But I can tell you what the customers tell me about their switching line is that it already has a lot of capabilities like I mentioned in service software upgrade micro bursting, Virtual Chassis, which people love and so forth and so on. And in terms of its fees and feeds, Rami, do you want to take that?
Rami Rahim: Yes, sure. First, I’ll just reiterate what Shaygan said about R&D from the guidance running R&D, it’s pretty much most of the cuts we’ve made for structural nature were a result of the decomplexifying if you will the organization streamlining things so I am not concerned our ability to compete. And in fact you mentioned silicon, I am very excited about the silicon roadmap that we had in the works right now in Juniper. On the FDN framework in fact part of the reason why you’re seeing the growth that we have right now in switching is preciously because of the fact that we are building a set of switching building blocks. These are building blocks that have a number of different applications, the data center and cloud automation being a very important used case. So, we are building directly into our switches the kinds of automation, visibility, controllability and very importantly open this there are customers absolutely like. And that give us the ability to work with great partners like VMware, where we are going in addressing private cloud like virtualization environment for many of our customers, but also with contrail, where for example in public cloud scenarios or in network function virtualization. There is a really nice seamless if you will tie in between the controller and our switches. This is very much a 10-gig story today, but the products were offering are all 10-gig, 40-gig and there is in fact going to be this migration overtime to 40-gig. So work that well setup to take advantage of that 10-gig to 40-gig migration that’s happening in the market.
Kathleen Nemeth:  Okay, great. And we do have time for couple of more questions. We’re coming up on the hour so operator next question please. 
Operator: The next question is from Jason Ader of William Blair. Please go ahead.
Jason Ader – William Blair & Company, LLC: Thank you. I just wanted to follow-up on an earlier question around the identification of other user product lines that you might be exceeding and I know you want to give competitive information, which I totally respect. But I guess the question is have you identified other use in product lines at this point or you still in that process. And then secondly just for Robyn, can you give us the guidance for interest and other income now that you have in your debt flowing through the balance sheet?
Robyn Denholm: Rami, you would answer the question
Rami Rahim: Yeah, sure. I’ll start. The question of did we actually take action already, the answer is yes, we have gone through the analysis we’ve evaluated the projects that we are already undertaken and we have in fact reallocate resources of the project that all pre-revenue and that has already given us an ability to start to focus on some of the really important strategic initiatives around cloud, High Q network function virtualization FDN that’s just very meaningful to our customers and I just kind of leave it that.
Robyn Denholm: Thanks, Rami. So on the interest side yes, clearly the interest rate, borrowings that we made in the quarter will add to our interest expense in the quarter, next quarter. So, we expect that we had reasonably low interest quarter for this quarter is just under $10 million. We expected to be in the $14 million to $16 million range for the next quarter.
Kathleen Nemeth: Okay, great. Next question operator. 
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. 
Kulbinder S. Garcha – Credit Suisse Securities:  Thanks and most of my questions has been answered. I just wondered a broad one for Rami in the routing side, we’ve seen historically just cycles in this business driven partly by product repurchase sometimes by macro. I am just thinking as we come to this repurchase, can you speak about how it’s different and how this won’t be a situation where by from now with difficult comps looking at significant deteriorated revenue line what’s different of value, which is - what that top two or three things that come to mind that would help?
Shaygan Kheradpir: Okay, yes sure Kulbinder, I’d say again you have to take a look at the market opportunity and the service provider spend in light of cable and in light of web services. And also telcos of course and each of these have a very different set of drivers and the cable space for example there is a huge amount of demand on the network because of the video traffic. In the web services space its things like cloud data center interconnect and peering technology. And telcos the things like consolidation of different network functions into fewer networks that are capable of providing a multitude of different services. Network function virtualization and so forth. These are trends that have been in the market for some time and they will continue. Now there might be ebbs and flows if you will of spending in different parts of the market like in the core or on the edge and different architectural approaches that our customers take, might in fact put more pressure on certain parts of the market or network then in others. And again I will just go back to my statement that is just really important for us to make sure that we’ve got the solutions and the product that can satisfy those architectural trends irrespective of the way that they in fact play out or timing of how they play out. If you look at all that, and you look again at the broader definition of the service provider that I talked about I think that the opportunity for us to have a good revenue, its healthy growth in the TAM and a great product portfolio help that took advantage of it.
Kathleen Nemeth: Okay great, and operator we have time for one more question before we close today.
Operator: Thank you and the next question is from Paul Silverstein of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
Paul J. Silverstein – Cowen & Co. LLC: It’s always great to be last you can ask unlimited number of questions. Let me start off.
Kathleen Nemeth: Hi Paul.
Paul J. Silverstein – Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi Kathleen appreciate you taken the question. A couple of questions if I may first of, can you all talk about pricing trends in switching, co-routing and edge routing. In switching how much of the growth is new customers, how much is from existing customers and with the respect to existing customers how much of that growth is from a refresher or upgrades to the new 9200 relatively new 9200 platform from the older EX platforms and how much is more organic. And that on to security piece can you set some insight, I know you told us that the old NetScreen OS point products are now 15% down from 20% but with respect to the SRX. How much of the revenue is from the enterprise SRX which you have been struggling on track and how much is from the higher end product that’s been doing so well, as we try to understand going forward. One last question which is I know the legal expenses questions has been asked a lot, but my simple question is if then when legal expense comes back to normalized level is that over and above the OpEx reductions that you have projected in the IOP or is that part of the IOP projections?
Shaygan Kheradpir: Okay so we’ll go one at a time quickly. We start with the IOP question, we have a very rigorous disciplined execution path 4160 we are committed to 160 – and so that’s we leave it at that, so that I think it’s the moving parts, we are going to hit 160 in the glide path as Robyn went through and we put on our slide back.
Robyn Denholm: What was the other question?
Shaygan Kheradpir: Okay, on pricing Robyn, do you want to take a cover?
Robyn Denholm: Yes, Paul as I mentioned in my prepared remarks it is a competitive environment overall. And what you could see now in gross margin – our product gross margin, we are actually doing quite well on that. Year-over-year we saw a slight degradation due to mix, but quarter-over-quarter actually was only one can stand, and as you can see we are moving into different categories and that type of thing and our gross margins are doing very well. And so that’s because we are focused on innovation and differentiation with the product set. It’s also because we are focused on reducing our costs over time as well, and as a company we’ve had a huge focus on that over the past four to six quarters. Rami, do you want to add anything in terms of competitiveness.
Rami Rahim: No, that’s it. We focused on the parts of the market where the discussion with the customers certainly in both pricing, but it’s not purely about pricing it’s about a multitude of things and capabilities in addition to pricing and that’s what we do I think quite well.
Shaygan Kheradpir: And then I think that last one and maybe I’ll ask Robyn and Rami as well is I mean I coupled a last sort of two questionnaires, this company the diversity revenue now across those segment it’s just not that one segment, it is multiple segments and then when you overlay the dynamics of these segment with all the different types of workloads that they are trying to handle as they build their clouds in High IQ networks. It’s a – one size doesn’t fit all, right and we see that sort of in switching, security and routing like your questions on switching, mostly new customers, but its frankly when you look at the, that the type of workloads it is not sort of commodity closet switches. It’s actually quite interesting sort of the used cases that we handle. Rami, do you want to sort of take the switching question and I think that was also part of your question.
Rami Rahim: I don’t have an exact figure in my head of what the ratio is, it’s both. I mean we love selling to our customers chassis that are partly populated with lying card, whether they have been in switching, and routing or security because we are reserving self base that we can go and populate over a period of time, and there is a lot of that going on. But as we also mentioned in the prepared remarks and earlier in the Q&A, we’re winning global bank, we’re winning web services companies that are all leveraging our switching, routing and security products and that just adds on to our business some it’s the combination.
Robyn Denholm: So on the security side I can answer that for you Paul in terms of our Junos Space firewall security product, you were right it was less than 20% a year ago and now it’s less than 15% that’s related to the non-Junos Space products. In terms of the SRX products they grew 13% year-over-year and in terms of the contribution to that growth the majority in this quarter was service provider, but we also had year-over-year growth in terms of enterprise as well. And as Rami mentioned before some of the focus that we’ve had on the high end SRX over this last four quarters to actually improve the performance of that is equally applicable in terms of the branch SRX and those types of products and that’s what the team has focused on as we move forward here.
Kathleen Nemeth: Okay, great. So that is all the time that we have this afternoon. We appreciate your participation and all of your great questions, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you so much everyone.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.

Please note that today's call is scheduled to last for 1 hour. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll turn the call over to Shaygan.
Shaygan Kheradpir: Thank you, Kathleen, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm pleased to be here on my 23rd day at the company and on my first quarterly conference call with you. It's an honor to be selected as Chief Executive Officer of Juniper and to lead the company at this exciting time. My first 3 weeks have been busy. I have and will continue to engage with our customers, employees, investors and other key stakeholders. I am actively reviewing the company's business lines, operating model and capital structure. We are building up a strong base. We delivered record revenue this quarter, good growth on year-over-year basis and a strong book-to-bill. And I continue to see substantial opportunities for Juniper to grow and deliver value. As you will hear shortly, my initial priorities are centered around developing an integrated operating plan, which is focused on profitable growth and shareholder value creation. I will present the details of this plan to you more fully in a few weeks. Before I hand it to Robyn, I want to share with you why I made the decision to join Juniper and provide some insight into my and my team's initial priorities. First, I see a great opportunity with an iconic and pioneering company that has phenomenal assets, technology and people that can address our customers' most pressing requirements. Juniper uniquely leverages its strength in systems, silicon and software to build the kind of networks that fits where our customers want to be and importantly, where the market is evolving to: high performance, agile, secure, automated, context aware networks in an open framework. I know this because I've been in this industry for 27 years as a customer, in both the service provider and enterprise sectors. I understand intimately their environments and imperatives for new revenue growth, speed-to-market, service quality, operational and capital efficiency and how to put Juniper's portfolio to work in powerful ways that matters to customers. To achieve this, Juniper needs to be the leading provider of high-IQ networks and best-in-class cloud builder, where the network is the most sensitive piece of the puzzle and has to be the first mover. I intend to play an active role in guiding this transition. But I'm also here as an agent of change. Specifically, I believe I can leverage my operational experience, as well as my deep engineering and technology background to drive effective and efficient business operations and lead Juniper through the changes required to reach its full potential. In short, this is an outstanding platform for which to deliver a great customer value proposition and substantial shareholder value. Since arriving at Juniper, I've been interacting with the key stakeholders and analyzing our revenue streams, including what customers are buying and for what use cases. This information reaffirms my view of where the markets are headed and where Juniper has the most significant competitive advantage. I can see our heritage, secure, high-performance networking, open architectures and deep engineering talent, converging with this future. This, I believe, will position Juniper as a world-class provider of innovative, high-IQ networks and cloud builder across our customer base. This includes not only our strong base of service providers and public sectors customers, but also newer customer segments such as Web 2.0, cable, content and financial services, as well as other customers who all want clouds and high-IQ networks. I also recognize that we have work to do. So my team and I are already hard at work, developing an integrated operating plan that addresses 3 key priorities. Firstly, we are tailoring our strategy to focus on innovation that matters to our customers and where we excel, bringing in the outside in customer imperatives. I intend to restore Juniper's focus on thoughtful, highly value accretive innovation and rebuild the get-it-done culture that unleashes the talent of our people. Additionally, we will implement a more efficient cost structure, commensurate with our strategic focus and the competitive environment, resulting in reduced costs. I'll be taking a three-pronged approach: focused R&D that matters, radical simplification on automation and rightsizing. We will do this in a smart way, with an eye towards returns on investment and focusing on the cost drivers, such as operational leading indicators. This is something I've done before and I'm confident can be effectively implemented at Juniper. Lastly, we've been taking an in-depth look at our future cash flows and capital structure to assess how we can best return capital to shareholders, while still maintaining the financial flexibility to invest for future growth. We're actively evaluating the capital return policy, which includes level of share repurchases and dividends. While the company has been working on the areas of cost structure and capital return for some time, since I've joined the team and I have been full-on, on strategy, cost structure and capital return and we resolve to deliver meaningful results in this area. We will do this with an emphasis on disciplined execution on business fundamentals. I look forward to announcing and sharing with you the details of our integrated operating plan in the next few weeks. You have my commitment that the plan we present to you will be well considered, specific and achievable. I also look forward to spending additional time with our shareholders and analysts in the coming weeks. And as we have said previously, we are very interested to continuing a constructive and open dialogue with our shareholders. I've been talking about what I've been doing and will continue to do in the next few weeks. As I indicated, Juniper had a strong Q4. And I now hand it to Robyn to take you through the details.
Robyn M. Denholm: Thank you, Shaygan, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report that our Q4 2013 results reflect strong sequential and year-over-year revenue and earnings growth. We had a record revenue quarter, driven by strength in both service provider and enterprise. Non-GAAP earnings increased sequentially due to higher revenues, partially offset by high variable operating expenses. In the fourth quarter, we completed the restructuring actions that we announced 90 days ago. We have been comprehensively analyzing our cost structure in the context of our strategy and, as noted by Shaygan, we will provide additional details on our integrated operating plans in the coming weeks. Looking at our demand metrics, we had a very strong bookings quarter, with book-to-bill greater than 1 and net backlog at a very healthy $471 million. While total deferred revenue was up $48 million quarter-over-quarter, product deferred revenue was down $35 million sequentially, primarily due to strong channel sales, resulting in lower ending channel inventory and the timing of certain future feature releases. Total revenue was $1,274,000,000, up 7% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. Product revenue was up 8% quarter-over-quarter and 15% from a year ago. Services revenue was also strong at $300 million, up 5% sequentially and 2% year-over-year. For the full fiscal year of 2013, total revenue was $4,669,000,000, up 7% year-over-year. There were no 10% customers in Q4 or for the full fiscal year, which reflects the continued diversity of our business. For the quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.30, including a $0.04 pretax impact from restructuring charges and a $0.04 benefit from a lower tax rate. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.43, up $0.10 sequentially and increased significantly $0.15 year-over-year. The sequential growth was driven primarily by high revenue and operating margins, which were at their highest level since Q1 of 2011. For the full fiscal year, GAAP diluted earnings were $0.86, up $0.51 for the year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings were $1.28, up by $0.43 or 51% year-over-year. Now let me provide color on revenue by region, market and product area. Americas revenue was up 4% sequentially and up 13% year-over-year. Americas service provider revenue was down 2% sequentially and up 6% year-over-year. The trend in bookings, however, was notably different, as we saw strong bookings in the Americas service provider business, up more than 50% quarter-over-quarter. We continue to see strength across the customer base, especially in cable and content or Web 2.0 providers. Americas enterprise grew strongly at 16% sequentially and 29% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in both financial and federal sectors. EMEA revenue was up strongly at 17% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. The sequential growth was driven by strong service provider performance in Germany, U.K. and Eastern Europe. EMEA enterprise also rebounded nicely in the quarter. APAC increased 5% sequentially and 18% over Q4 of last year. Both service provider and enterprise grew in the region. While we are encouraged by the performance in the quarter, there's still some work that needs to be done to get the region growing on a more consistent basis. Service provider revenue for the quarter was $827 million, up 5% sequentially and 12% year-over-year, with good new design wins across all 3 theaters. Enterprise revenue was $447 million, up 12% sequentially and 11% year-over-year, with broad-based strength across the customer verticals. For the full fiscal year, service provider revenues were $3,054,000,000, up 9%. And enterprise revenue was $1,615,000,000, up 4%. While the growth was across all customer segments, content and cable were the key drivers. It is worth noting that over 50% of the total revenue growth in 2013 came from the web services content and cable customers. Now let me review our revenue by product area. Total router product revenue was $618 million, was up 1% sequentially and 16% year-over-year. While routing revenue in the quarter was healthy, bookings were very strong and grew over 20% sequentially and over 30% year-over-year, driven by MX and PTX product lines. In addition, our newly released MX104 router is off to a solid start. For the full year, router product revenue grew 14%. Total switching product revenue was a record $199 million, up 35% sequentially and 36% from a year ago. This was driven by strong sales of EX and QFabric. And we are very pleased with the EX design wins with top enterprise and service provider customers and key data center wins, which resulted in significant sequential and year-over-year increase in QFabric revenue. In the quarter, we also shipped the QFX5100 top-of-rack switch and expect it to be a very good contributor to our switching portfolio going forward. For the full year, switching product revenue grew 15%. Total security product revenue was $157 million, an increase of 9% sequentially. Bookings also increased sequentially for the third quarter in a row. We saw a moderation in the decline on a year-over-year basis to 7%. As I've noted in the last couple of quarters, we have begun to see good signs in this business and customer feedback is encouraging. So while revenue for the full year was down by 16%, the last few quarters of demand indicated that we are in the midst of a turnaround. Our new products, as designated by the Financial Analyst Meeting in 2012, including T4000 PTX, QFabric, MobileNext and ACX, generated slightly less than $140 million in bookings in Q4, short of our goal of $150 million. Since we set the goal, we eliminated the MobileNext product and have also introduced a number of other new product lines, not included in the above goal. Moving onto gross margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margins for the quarter was 64.2% compared to 64.4% last quarter and 65.3% a year ago. Non-GAAP product gross margins were 64.9%, down slightly over the last quarter, mainly due to product mix. Non-GAAP services gross margins were 61.9%, up 0.6 points from last quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $539 million, an increase of $10 million sequentially and higher than we expected. This increase was primarily due to high commission-related costs due to the higher demand and an increase in legal expenses. Absent these items, our operating expenses would have declined sequentially. I had mentioned at the last earnings call that we would be undertaking some restructuring and rebalancing actions in the fourth quarter. We executed to that plan and eliminated 248 positions, of which 112 were in R&D and 95 in sales and marketing. We ended the quarter with 9,483 heads, down 231 heads or 2% sequentially. In the quarter, we took an $18.9 million restructuring charge, of which $13.9 million was related to headcount action. For the full year, operating expenses were $2,102,000,000 or 45% of revenue, down from $2,124,000,000 or 48.7% of revenue for the 2012 year. This reduction was in spite of legal expenses in the year that were approximately $30 million higher than expected. As Shaygan outlined, we are focusing on making changes to the overall cost structure and will present that plan to you in a few weeks. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter expanded to 21.9% compared to 19.8% last quarter and up strongly over the 18.2% last year. The sequential increase was driven by higher revenue and an improvement in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. For the full year, operating margin expanded by 23% to finish at 19.2% for the year. The non-GAAP tax rate was 18.8% compared to 25.5% last quarter. This improvement is primarily due to the geographic mix of income and some onetime items. Looking at the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $3.1 billion of net cash and investments. We generated strong operating cash flows of $390 million due to the higher operating margins and our continued focus on the cash conversion cycle. Q4 DSO was 41 days, down from 42 days last quarter. Capital expenditures were $50 million, while depreciation and amortization expense were $45 million. We repurchased 11.8 million shares for $242 million at an average price of $20.47. We had $1 billion remaining on our current authorization. And as Shaygan previously noted, we have been working on our capital allocation policy and we will present this strategy, along with our integrated operating plan, in the next few weeks. Now I will review our outlook for Q1 of 2014. As a reminder, these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis, except for revenue and share count. We believe that the underlying demand trend for our markets will remain healthy in 2014. We expect the March quarter to reflect typical seasonality in the top line. And as a reminder, we see a Q1 increase in OpEx as a result of the impact of FICA taxes. We also expect legal expenses to continue at their elevated levels that we've seen since Q3 of last year. Please note that our outlook for March does not include the potential impact of activities related to the execution of our Integrated Operating Plan, which we will be sharing with you within the next few weeks. For the first quarter of 2014, we expect revenues to range from $1,120,000,000 to $1,160,000,000. At the midpoint, this reflects a growth of 8% year-over-year, highlighting our expectation of continued momentum in the underlying demand. At the midpoint of guidance, gross margins are expected to be in the range of 64%, plus or minus 0.5%. Operating expenses are expected to be flat to slightly down from the fourth quarter. At the midpoint, operating margins are expected to be approximately 17%. This is expected to result in non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $0.27 and $0.30 per share and assumes a flat share count. We expect a tax rate of approximately 25%, assuming that the R&D tax credit is approved by the end of March. If it's not approved, the tax rate may be higher by 1.5 percentage points and would impact EPS by about $0.01. To summarize, we anticipate overall demand to remain healthy and we will continue to focus on our innovation and our operational excellence objectives. I would like to thank our employees for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. And now with that, let me turn it back to Shaygan for some final thoughts before we take your questions.
Shaygan Kheradpir: Thank you, Robyn. I'm excited to begin this journey with you and leverage my experience and expertise as a customer and operating executive and a technology innovator to drive value for all of our stakeholders. And I very much look forward to meeting with you, listening to you and presenting our Integrated Operating Plan in a few weeks. Now to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Ehud Gelblum of Citi.
Ehud A. Gelblum - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: So a couple of questions, if I could. Clearly, on the revenue side, guys, switching was incredibly impressive. Strong as it's been in -- certainly from a growth perspective, in [indiscernible] in forever. QFabric seems to be doing very well. Can you give some insight as to what got QFabric going now? And is it all top-of-rack switches, is it just a -- I mean, are they actually deploying real QFabric, are they just using the top-of-rack switches instead of the EX? And was there a new sales plan, was there a growth in the VAR channel, was it new products or something that really -- what really got QFabric going? And if you can give us a little bit of insight on the security side, which was nice and strong as well, was it new products, was it something of that sort to give us a sense? And then Shaygan, you've been here now for, I guess, 2.5 weeks. You said you're going to come out with a much larger plan on business model on the company going forward. Clearly, there's an activist involved that might be leading you to that. Do you think that coming out in 5 to 6 weeks after you got there is the right time, or do you -- would you actually rather have longer to take a look at the company and maybe come out with a plan, maybe 12 to 15 weeks? And if so, should we be looking for successive revisions to whatever you're coming out with, as we go forward and you learn more about the company?
Shaygan Kheradpir: Hi, Ehud, and good speaking with you. I'll take both of those questions and I'll then pass them to Rami and Robyn, they can drill in on your switching question. So first of all, I came into the company, of course, being 25 years in the industry as a technology builder and as an operator. So I have a great deal of understanding of what the customers are really looking for and, more importantly, where they're going. In fact, that's connected to the switching question as well, which I'll come back to. And obviously, I spent my last 3 years at an investment bank with my telecom expertise. So I came in with a lot of thoughts and an understanding of the company. And from the second that I was announced, I've been sort of working myself and now -- since January 1. So we're in full motion, getting started here. As far as -- and I'll pass to Rami -- I think the very first thing I did, Ehud, when I first came here, I've been peppering everybody with questions of, yes, we know they bought, they're buying a lot, who's buying and why? And the why piece of it has pretty much reaffirmed what I thought, from a customer angle, which is people are buying pretty much the same things across multiple customer sets for the same reason, which is everybody's trying to build, what I call high-IQ networks and cloud ecosystems. And as you see in our switching results and in our security results, it sort of jumps out. Those are key components of high-IQ networks and cloud ecosystems. We'll have a lot more time to talk about this when I meet you all. But I'll now pass to Rami to drill in on this, Ehud's switching question.
Rami Rahim: Sure. Thanks, Shaygan, and thanks for the question, Ehud. On the switching side, first of all, yes, we're certainly very pleased with the results that we saw in Q4. A couple of things that I will say, over the last year or so, you know that we have been in the process of essentially integrating our 2 separate switching business units. As a result of doing that, we not only streamlined the portfolio, we actually simplified the portfolio and focused it on the most pressing problems that our customers are solving today. So if you take a look at the result, a lot of the performance that we saw is, it came from that hard work in new products that we introduced just last year, like the EX4300, the EX -- the EX9200 are both examples of those products. And then from a market dynamic standpoint, we have large customers now, both on the service provider and the enterprise side, that are building a cloud network that require the kind of high performance products that we are developing. And they love not only the product themselves, but the tie-in that we have developed with our SDN solution, whether it be Contrail or with our partner at SDN solutions like VMware.
Robyn M. Denholm: And just to add to that on the security side, so we saw good growth sequentially in terms of security. And we moderated the decline year-over-year. What's driving that growth is the same that's been driving the bookings growth over the last couple of quarters and that is high-end SRX. And it comes back to the theme that both Rami and Shaygan talked about in terms of data center and what we're doing with our service provider customers as well as our enterprise customers. And so that is what drove the growth this quarter, the high-end SRX.
Operator: The next question is from Amitabh Passi of UBS.
Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Robyn, I was just trying to reconcile the commentary around strong bookings with what appears to be slightly subseasonal guide. You're guiding revenues down 10%, 11%. I think the last 3, 4 years, it's been down 7%, 8%. So I would just love to get some incremental insight. Was there some one-off orders you saw of revenues this quarter that you think won't repeat? Would love to get some clarity on the guidance relative to the bookings commentary.
Robyn M. Denholm: Thanks, Amitabh. So on the actual guidance for Q1, at the midpoint of guidance, what we're reflecting is an 8% year-over-year growth. And our perspective is that the business is healthy across the board. We've got good design wins in all 3 geographies across the business areas. In Q1, it typically does take us a little time to get moving, if you like, but we're very pleased with the demand fundamentals that we have across all 3 areas of the business.
Operator: The next question is from Ben Reitzes with Barclays.
Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division: My question is for Shaygan. Shaygan, I wanted to ask, have you -- within the plan, not that you can go through the details, but have -- is there any feeling about the product line at Juniper in your initial thoughts? Is there -- are you wed to any products or is everything deserve a full look? And then just my second part of the question, if you don't mind, is you went through the 3 points you'll address in the plan, I was just wondering if accountability will be part of it and you will tell us how we can hold you accountable for whatever we do here to make sure that the promise is fulfilled, sir.
Shaygan Kheradpir: Hi, Ben. And also hi to Amitabh, I both look forward to seeing you both shortly. So as far as the -- I'll start with the second one. Accountability is one of the big tenets of our plan, which is we're going to have a detailed Integrated Operating Plan, which includes who's going to do what, when are they do it and discrete milestones that we can track with tangible observables and make sure we are on course. The reason it's integrated and we can't do this thing in piece parts, as you well know, Ben, is that it starts with, what is your strategy, where can you win? That goes into what customers want. Where are the markets going, what are your strengths that you can win in those markets? We have to get that down and we've got a lot of progress already on that and there's good convergence and thinking with the team. So that's on that. That flows into your structure, your company structure. That flows into your cost structure. And the cost structure, you probably have an unfair advantage because you are from Barclays. It sounds similar, right? We focus on markets. We focus on automation, on process improvement, 21st century industrialization, you would know that term. And then you'll focus on rightsizing, to make sure we are sized right for the anticipated volume of the business. All of these things gets wrapped in. And then from there, you flow into return of capital. And you wrap it all in, in an integrated plan, detailed milestones with hard accountability and you can hold us accountable quarter-after-quarter for results. And I'm holding my team accountable, personally, for their pieces. And we know how to do this. I've done this all my career. And the team here is excited and energized to hit the afterburner button, so to speak. So be assured of that.
Operator: The next question is from Subu Subrahmanyan of The Juda Group.
Natarajan Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group, Research Division: I wanted to understand, Robyn, a little bit more on the routing side. Routing growth, you've mentioned orders had grown much more strongly than revenues. If you could clarify that? And then U.S. service provider down in traditionally seasonally very strong quarter, can you just talk about what the dynamics behind that were?
Robyn M. Denholm: Yes. Thank you, Subu. In terms of your question, from a routing perspective, we were very pleased with the routing performance in the quarter in terms of the sequential increase and year-over-year increase. We had a 1% increase sequentially off a record quarter last quarter for routing and a 16% year-over-year increase. And the strength of that is amplified in the bookings. So and that's why I called it out. The trend on revenue, as you know, sometimes follows the trend in bookings, but not always the case in terms of the one quarter view. So I wanted to add some color in terms of the bookings in routings which were very strong. And as I said, they were up over 20% sequentially and over 30% year-over-year. So the team has done a very good job on driving the design wins to bookings in the quarter from a routing perspective.
Operator: The next question is from Paul Silverstein of Cowen and Company.
Paul Silverstein - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Two quick questions, if I may. First off, on the security, I thought I heard you call out the high-end SRX in particular is driving the security. My question to you on security is given this sort of lumpiness of the high-end SRX and your efforts in the branch SRX, can you share with us insight on the progress with branch SRX? And the other question, on the service provider routing piece, can you comment on the competitive landscape in pricing in particular Alcatel-Lucent and Huawei, as well as the new Cisco core routers, if that's having any impact in the landscape.
Robyn M. Denholm: Thanks, Paul. I'll comment first on security and then I'll hand it over to Rami in terms of the competitive landscape in routing. If you look at security, we've had 3 quarters in a row now of good sequential bookings growth and it is coming from the high-end SRX. As we've talked about, that product set, we sold both into service provider and into enterprise. And the service provider buildouts are lumpy, as we've called out before. What drove the growth this quarter was actually enterprise, was the predominant reason for the high-end SRX increase. And we've talked about it in prior quarters in terms of some bookings momentum on the data center side. But on the revenue side, that is what was behind the growth in high-end SRX this quarter. And so, on the routing competitive dynamics, Rami?
Rami Rahim: Sure, certainly. The competitive situation for routing hasn't really changed. This remains a very competitive industry in the -- so the way in which we compete is essentially the same. In the Edge, for example, it's about having a single unified, the most complete, most scalable, highest performance, Universal Edge, which is the MX, which is really growing nicely for us and competing very well there, both with incumbents and new players. In the core, yes, there are different dynamics that are happening here. Certainly, there are sort of incumbents and new challengers that are coming in, but I would say that, that has not, again, changed the way in which we compete. It's a high leverage strategy using our massive T Series deployed base. It's an architectural approach to packet optical transport with our PTX. And we're actually seeing some pretty good early momentum with the MX2020 for high service rich cores around the world. In certain geos, like you mentioned, there are sort of geo-specific competitors, like in Asia. And there, it's just about being laser focused on the areas where we believe that we have the highest amount of technical differentiation. That's why we're successful.
Operator: The next question is from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs.
Simona Kiritsov Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Shaygan, I had a question for you. You talked about your views on strategy influencing your approach to cost cutting and rightsizing the business. And I just wanted to ask you if at a high level you still view the strategy as staying in both service provider and enterprise is the correct strategy for Juniper? And then conceptually, how you think about businesses in which you may have a relatively small market share, such as switching, for example, in which your share is about 3%? Is that the kind of scale that you think is sufficient to keep investing in the business?
Shaygan Kheradpir: Simona, good speaking with you. Look forward to meeting you. We have -- as part of the Integrated Operating Plan, we have one big work stream around our R&D. And so I'm actually personally involved in that one, too, given my engineering background and the background in networks. What I would tell you, Simona, is when I entered here -- so we do all the work and then we'll present to you in 3 weeks or 4 weeks or whenever that is, in a matter of weeks. But we -- what customers are buying, the customers says, we're looking at and I count them and this is sort of from my perspective coming from the customer side, these are not necessarily a taxonomy that some of you may have used in the past. So you've got our -- a great service provider customers, which is like AT&Ts and Verizons and BT and DT and down the chain. You have those sets of customers. Then you move into the cable and content and then Web 2.0 customers like Google and Amazon and the rest. And then you move into special enterprises, yours being one, Goldman Sachs and all the companies that are represented on this call. Those 4 sets of customers, with a little bit -- maybe a few others, like federal government and so forth, they pretty much are all coalescing around the same set of things, as far as networking is concerned, which is clouds and high-IQ networks. Rami talked about and Robyn talked about the key components, MX, QFabric, PTX, SRX, with the big brain called Contrail. Essentially, that's what people want to buy because they're trying to solve some very specific business problems that we'll get into when we sit down with you and go over it. So the markets are changing for a set of these customers and we just have to make sure that we will be able to win and win big in these markets, given our heritage of high performance networking, only really pure play company out there in IT networking in high performance, in open architectures, carrier-grade, super big SRX, defending the cloud and so forth and so on. And in fact, this was my view when I came in as a customer, being on both sides, operating obviously at Barclays, CIO, CTO on Verizon. And in fact, the buying -- or what people are buying and the mix is sort of confirming that. Now as I've said it last quarter, this has to continue, but it has certain logic to it. So I think that's the -- that's what in my mind, if that helps.
Operator: The next question is from Simon Leopold of Raymond James.
Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: I want to ask what I think is a pretty quick one and then maybe more involved. First for Shaygan, if you could just maybe articulate how the activists have either influenced you or not influenced you starting in on your job. And then I wanted to follow-up on the guidance in that you highlight a number of areas with very strong bookings, so that leads us to try to figure out what's weak or are you suggesting a much better than seasonal growth rate in the June quarter?
Shaygan Kheradpir: Well, thank you for the question. As I said, I've been in this business now exactly 27 years. And so I come in with a lot of views on where the markets are going and what the customers want. And I think that is -- since I've been actually a builder in these companies, so I have great appreciation for building. And since I've had tens of thousands of people in my organization, from an operating perspective, I was the heart of sort of operations. So I come in with a good view of what is a well-run operation. I come in with a view of what the customers want. And I come in with a view of technologically what's the art of the possible and where the markets are going. So I sort of took this job because I saw great opportunity at this phenomenal company, sort of ready to go, to put in play 27 years of my experience. So that's on that end. On the other end, obviously I am on a big listening tour and our shareholders is one of the most important stakeholders. I've been listening to shareholders, I continue to do that and the investors and the sell-side and the buy-side analysts and of course our customers to pull all this in. And we also have urgency of action because every month that passes 2014, I want to make sure the new Integrated Operating Plan is in place, the company is behind it and we can move and drive shareholder value and make sure that our customers get to solve their business problems, which is all around, how can I generate more revenue? How can I bring down my operating costs? How can I make sure I don't get hacked? And so forth and so on. These are -- when you put a customer hat on, these things -- when you actually live and sweat the details in a customer, these are -- get a different gravity. So I'm actually very confident that we will be able to come up with a great Integrated Operating Plan and put it in motion and really solve our customer problems and in the process drive great shareholder return. And just hold on for a few weeks and we'll unveil it.
Robyn M. Denholm: So on the guidance question -- in terms of the midpoint of guidance, as I mentioned before, is an 8% year-over-year growth, which is actually -- reflects our confidence in the strength of the underlying business. Our view is that there is a sequential -- sorry, seasonal pattern to our Q1 business, particularly on the enterprise side. And we saw in the fourth quarter, the enterprise actually drove a lot of the year-over-year growth. And so what I want to make sure of is that we take that into account. That's what we've taken into account. The underlying demand trends are healthy. Q1 always has a seasonality to it and we wanted to appropriately reflect that in our guidance.
Operator: The next question is from Mark McKechnie of Evercore.
Mark McKechnie - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Shaygan, welcome. I certainly look forward to working with you. A very refreshing approach here. I had a few questions. First, your background at Verizon and Barclays, 27 years in the business. I'm kind of curious, I don't know if you can expand a bit on your interaction with other carriers and enterprises. I'm sure you work with them, but are the meetings you're having with customers, new engagements or you're meeting with familiar people? Whatever you can say there. And then on the routers, I know people have beaten on this a bit, but I wanted to get a sense. I mean, that was really strong bookings, 20% sequentially. I wanted to get a sense for areas of strength where you attribute that. I mean, is this the PTX big orders here for the U.S.? Are you participating over with China Mobile? Is this Europe? Is it the T4000? I mean, what can you tell us about that? And how you see that playing out through the year.
Shaygan Kheradpir: Sure, Mark, and hi, great to be speaking with you. So yes, somebody asked me that question the other day and said, "How do you feel?" And I said, "Well, I feel like I'm back home." In the sense that many of the accounts I go to, they are friends and colleagues from the past. Now as I said, I've been here 27 years, so some of the friends and colleagues have retired, but there's still quite a bit that are still there. And so, yes, I know many of my friends have been there for a long time. We've worked together on the buyer side of things. We have a similarity in thought across the planet. I actually used to chair the CTOs for telecoms a number of years ago when I was at Verizon. And by the way, on the enterprise side, I used to chair the CIOs for a number of years. And so I have a lot of friends there as well. And in fact, my rotation at Barclays, which I have to say was completely phenomenal and magical, I've gotten to be even closer to my CIO friends at the banks and financial services. So yes, it sort of feels in the family but, of course, as time goes on, I become more of the supplier and they become more of the buyer. But at this point, it's very much like coming back home. As far as the routers and PTX is concerned, I'll ask Rami to give us some color on that.
Rami Rahim: Yes, sure. Happy to. Thanks, Mark. So on the router side, I think one of the really encouraging things about the booking was just the diversity in who bought. So we saw strength in our large telcos, even our smaller Tier 2 telcos, our cable operators and also the Web 2.0s. So that diversity is something that we track and something that we consider as very healthy. From a product standpoint, very specifically, MX continues to do very well and the particular applications here that we're driving are convergence of Edge and aggregation networks to simplify operations for our customers, data center interconnect to connect clouds together. And then the other area where we saw some real strength from a booking standpoint is in PTX. As you know, PTX is somewhat of a different architectural approach. So the sales cycles are long and what we're seeing now are the results of the design wins that we had several quarters ago now turning into sales. And the last thing I'll just say is in each of those product line, the MX and PTX, we introduced new specific products in Q4. We introduced the MX104 that takes all of the sophisticated capabilities of the MX down to a very small, power efficient form factor that's ideal for smaller operators and now into the access navigation part of the network. And similarly, the PTX3000 that takes the transport capabilities of that platform and takes it into the metro transport area. So we're expanding the applicable footprint for each of these product lines.
Operator: The next question is from Brian Marshall of ISI Group.
Brian Marshall - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Shaygan, congratulations on the new opportunity. Obviously, some of the fastest-growing workloads on the planet are housed in a lot of the hyperscale guys. And you gave some comments on the conference call with respect to how much that and in conjunction with some other businesses, like cable, are growing for you, over 50% of your incremental growth over the last 12 months. But I guess I was wondering if you care to take a stab, did your hyperscale business actually grow in line with what we estimate is kind of 30% CapEx growth year-over-year? Or perhaps, maybe what percent of your total revenue is coming from this group? 5%, 10%, something like that? Any color would be helpful.
Shaygan Kheradpir: Brian, good to meet you. A really good question. This -- the Web 2.0 and, by the way, the cable and the content businesses are also dear friends of mine for many years, got good insight into those networks, have worked with them for many years. And I'll ask Robyn to take that question around their cloud that they're building and their growth. Go ahead.
Robyn M. Denholm: Yes. I think, Brian, in terms of the overall full year, what we wanted to give you color on is where the growth was coming from. And the comments that I made was that it was -- those areas of web services, content and cable actually accounted for more than 50% of the overall growth of the company for the 2013 year. And I think the comment that Shaygan made is very applicable because it's a cross-sector view of those types of companies. And even in some of our traditional companies, there are faster growing parts of that company's revenue with us or their CapEx spend with us, if you like, than other parts. And so that's what we were trying to convey with that comment, that there is faster parts of the market that are growing even in some of the traditional areas, as well as some of these newer opportunities and newer type companies on the web services and cable side.
Operator: The next question is from Rod Hall of JPMorgan.
Roderick B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Shaygan, welcome aboard and congratulations. So I just had a quick one, I guess, for Shaygan. Can you help us understand how in prior leadership positions that you've taken on, you've thought about the structure of your leadership team? And just as an example, we've had a person take over our company recently as the new CEO and he said, "I like to have 1/3 of the people existing managers, 1/3 internal promotes and 1/3 external." So just any rules of thumb that you think about when you think about structuring your leadership team? And also, just timing on that, how soon do you want to make critical hires if you have to make them? And then I wanted to ask Robyn, if -- Robyn, could you talk to us a little bit about government revenues and what happened in the quarter? I don't think I heard you comment on that. So if could you give us any indication on what federal and non-federal revenues did in the quarter? And then, Rami, I wanted to just go back to your commentary on the switching and also Robyn's commentary on the routing order growth. Can you help us understand what the concentration of those orders is? Like in switching, was it a handful of big customers or is it spread pretty broadly? And then also on the routing orders, is that a few big customers or broadly spread?
Shaygan Kheradpir: Thanks, Rod. Thanks for the question. A broad question. As I said, I've had many, many years in this, both Verizon and Barclays, and many -- tens of thousands of people. And I think it's, at the top level, it all starts with what are we trying to do, where are we trying to win. So this is why it's really important to get the focus on product innovation and our markets really right because that flows in what I used to call strength on strength. Have excellent people positioned in the areas that they can put -- push the ball for us forward through excellence. And then it's working as one team, as one Barclays -- I'm sorry, one Juniper, one Juniper, one Juniper. I've had one Verizon, one Barclays, one Juniper, I'm consistent. And then, as you talk to the people about me, it's all the same, right? Because you have success and you repeat that. And then you have execution with no excuses and metabolism execution with no excuses. I look for people who are detail oriented, they're hands on, not a lot of layers, massive focus on the customer, massive know-how internally and really have that outside-in focus brought infused with an inside-out art of the possible, camp on customer's door and execute. And so that's sort of the management philosophy. And now I'm going to pass in to Robyn for the second part of the question.
Robyn M. Denholm: Thank you. Thanks, Rod. In terms of the government business, I did actually call out that the government area -- enterprise was actually very strong in the quarter. We had good sequential and year-over-year growth in enterprise all up. The federal team did an outstanding job this quarter. If you remember back to the guidance that we called out on last quarter, I was expecting federal to be weak this quarter. And actually, the team did a really good job and actually they had a good quarter in Q4. Clearly, the federal business, the government business is down for us for the full year, year-over-year, which also underscores the fact that enterprise, absent the full -- from a full year perspective, absent government, has actually been growing very nicely all year. The other commentary on the fourth quarter was that financial services was strong and that's a global comment. So from my perspective, a good enterprise quarter, a good service provider quarter and a good federal quarter in Q4. Go ahead, Rami.
Rami Rahim: The only thing I will add is, I already added some color on the diversity of customers on our routing side. On the switching side, there too we saw a good distribution between enterprise, especially at the financial services, Web 2.0s, and also service provider. We have said in the past that the service provider component of the switching business can be lumpy. And for this quarter or Q4, I should say, we saw real strength in both SP and enterprise. I think that just based on the -- what we're seeing in terms of demand metric, I'm pretty confident about 2014.
Operator: The final question comes from Brian White of Cantor Fitzgerald.
Brian John White - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: Shaygan, welcome. I'm wondering, what type of forum are we -- are you introducing the Integrated Operating Plan, you said 3 to 4 weeks. Is this an analyst type meeting or is this going to be a conference call? That's question number one. Number two, maybe talk a little bit about what Juniper is seeing in emerging markets. A lot of peers are complaining about emerging markets, specifically China. Maybe give us just an overview of what Juniper is seeing in emerging markets.
Shaygan Kheradpir: Thanks for the question. On the forum, actually, we are working that as we speak. So stay tuned on that. As far as the emerging markets, Robyn, you want to take that one?
Robyn M. Denholm: Yes. In terms of emerging markets for us, and there are many different emerging markets around the world for us. What I would say, at a high level, our strategy is quite different in some of the emerging markets. You mentioned, for example, China. What we've done at the company is be very focused in terms of the areas where we are most differentiated in that market and Rami mentioned that before. And so our approach varies by market. We're very surgical in some markets where we focus on those areas where we have the most differentiated and we win opportunities in those markets. So from my perspective, our emerging market strategy is different. We sell through partners in a number of different locations through the -- across the world. From a technology perspective, the technology that we sell is consistent and it's in high demand in different parts of the world in terms of that focus.
Kathleen Nemeth: Okay, thank you. That, unfortunately, is all the time we have today. Shaygan, would you like to have a closing comment?
Shaygan Kheradpir: Yes. It's -- I'm thrilled to be here and I'm really looking forward to seeing all of you very shortly and have a much deeper conversation about everything we talked about and hear your views of Juniper and our industry. So look forward to seeing you all. Thank you. Have a great day.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Juniper Networks' Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Kathleen Nemeth, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Ms. Nemeth, you may begin.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Here on the call are Kevin Johnson, Chief Executive Officer; Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial and Operations Officer; and Rami Rahim, Executive Vice President, Platform Systems Division. Rahim is in Brazil today, where he is presenting at the Futurecom Conference. Please remember when listening to today's call that statements concerning Juniper's business outlook, economic and market outlook, strategies, future financial operating results and overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including economic conditions generally or within the networking industry; changes in overall technology spending and spending by communication service providers and major customers; the network capacity requirements of service providers; the timing of orders and shipments; manufacturing and supply chain constraints; variation in the mix of products sold; customer perception and acceptance of our products; rapid technological and market change; litigation; and other factors listed in our most recent 10-Q and the 8-K filed with the SEC today. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances change after the date of this call. In discussing the financial results, Robyn will first present results on a GAAP basis. And for purposes of today's discussion, we will also review non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why our management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult the press release furnished with our 8-K filed with the SEC today. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results, please see the Investor Relations section of our website. On today's call, Robyn will also be providing forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis, other than that with respect to revenue and share count. All guidance is forward-looking, and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier. GAAP guidance measures are not available on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to certain charges, which are excluded from the non-GAAP guidance estimate. Please note that today's call is scheduled to last for 1 hour. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin.
Kevin R. Johnson: Thanks, Kathleen, and welcome to all of you joining us on today's conference call. I'm pleased with our results this quarter as we delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, reflecting good execution against our strategy. Overall, our results were in line with the expectations we set in the second quarter. We continue to see strength in the service provider market, the enterprise tracked largely as we expected, and security continued its trend towards stabilization, with sequential growth in the third quarter. In each of these areas, we continue to exhibit the strength and innovation of our product portfolio. Overall, the macro environment remains dynamic. While we are encouraged to see the U.S. government reopen, we are mindful of potential volatility in the Federal sector. There are a few things I'd like to highlight for the third quarter before I turn the call over to Rami for an update on our Platform Systems division. First, the response we're getting from customers indicates our SDN and network function virtualization strategy continues to resonate with them. SDN is a growth opportunity for us in both networking systems and software. Our vision is to unleash innovation and agility in customer IT investments by unblocking the impediment of the static network to their cloud strategies. We're doing this in 3 ways. First, we offer a unique advantage through our deep knowledge and proven track record of innovation in high-performance networking, with a focus on systems and software. Second, we provide clarity of choice with software and programmable systems that are based on industry standards and open source models with Open Contrail. Customers can buy our products and solutions today. And finally, we have outlined a clear 4-step implementation strategy for customers that includes a flexible, cloud-oriented software licensing model, the Juniper Software Advantage. As we mentioned last quarter, following highly successful beta trials, we launched our Contrail SDN Controller earlier than our original 2014 ship date. Contrail works in private and public cloud environments to virtualize the company's data center network and enable service providers to build new Edge networks that significantly reduce the time required to deploy future services. We have both a commercial and an open license model for Contrail. Open Contrail, our open source license version, provides access to all aspects of the Contrail source code, offering easy integration, a stable platform, a production-ready code base and compatibility with both CloudStack and OpenStack. It is our view that the open-source business model of Open Contrail will enable maximum reach, while the commercial Contrail business model allows us to monetize Contrail for those customers who look to Juniper for a supported version of the product. In addition to providing world-class end-to-end solutions across Juniper's routing, switching and security systems, we have also enabled Contrail to work with competitors' network hardware and software products. This will reduce both the time and risk associated with deploying network virtualization technologies by customers, accelerating the benefits of SDN and network function virtualization. In other product highlights, we had a strong quarter in routing, which Rami will discuss in more detail. We also saw good growth in our switching bookings that reflect good traction in the data center. You can expect some additional data center announcements later this month. Looking at our overall markets, we continue to drive innovation in service provider, where we're focused on carrier, including wireless and wireline, along with cable and web 2.0 companies. As I mentioned, we're executing as we said we would in SDN and network function virtualization with Contrail, and we're continuing our progress in systems and software and data centers and service provider networks. In addition, we're continuing to focus on advancing the integration of optical and routing. We are well-positioned to take advantage of the continued growth we're seeing in the Edge and the expected growth we've been talking about in the core, with good momentum across our broad product portfolio. Globally, we're seeing strength in service provider across all 3 geographies, the Americas, EMEA and APAC. In the enterprise, we continue you to focus on high-performance networking to help transform the SDN-enabled virtualized data center. Within the data center, we help customers virtualize their network and connect their private clouds to commercially provided public clouds. This is also enabled by our Contrail Controller. In security, as we have said consistently in recent quarters, we continue to see signs of stabilization in the product portfolio. For data centers, we are driving the industry agenda on security, and today, we have the most advanced solution to protect data centers from attack. Our campus and branch installed base is significant, and we're evolving that technology to meet the emerging needs of our customers. And we continue to introduce new features and improve manageability of our security solutions. Although we haven't yet returned to year-over-year growth in this business, the sequential growth we saw in the third quarter is encouraging, and we believe our security business is well-positioned for a return to growth in 2014. Wrapping up, we continue to drive our innovation agenda, offering unique solutions for our customers in each of our markets. While the macroeconomic environment continues to be dynamic, we believe the business is healthy and momentum is building. We are focused on executing with agility and delivering long-term growth to our stakeholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Rami.
Rami Rahim: Thanks, Kevin. It's great to be here today to discuss the third quarter results for the Platform Systems Division. Overall, I'm pleased with this past quarter. Kevin covered the results at a high level, so what I'll do is walk through some of the drivers behind this quarter's results for PSD and provide some additional context. There are 2 key businesses within PSD, Routing and Switching, and the customers we serve span both service provider and enterprise. I'm pleased to report that PSD's revenue came in at $939 million, up 3% quarter-over-quarter and up 13% year-over-year. Our PSD product revenues were up 3% quarter-over-quarter and up 17% year-over-year. For Q3, PSD product revenue was at $742 million, our highest product revenue on record, demonstrating solid performance and continued growth in this business. The sequential increase in PSD revenues overall was driven primarily by growth in routing and strength in service providers globally. This quarter's switching results were mixed, up slightly year-over-year, but down sequentially due to lumpiness in service provider demand for data center solutions. While switching revenue declined sequentially, our switching bookings were healthy. In routing, we saw strong spending among our Tier 1 service providers, as well as strength among our cable and Web 2.0 customers. In the enterprise, demand is being created by data center consolidation, data center modernization and the continued adoption of fabric-based architectures. Let's go a bit deeper on our results. First, Routing, the PSD Routing business was up 7% quarter-over-quarter and up 22% year-over-year. Quarterly growth was driven by both core and edge routing, and the year-over-year growth in routing was driven primarily by edge routing. We continue to have a diverse customer base and a robust product mix. We simplified our product portfolio and delivered innovative products and technologies, including new variants of the MX2020 and the MX2010 and a new multiservice line card that delivers high-performance services to the MX. The Junos 13.2 release also came out in Q3, and it was packed with compelling customer features. We had some great routing wins this quarter, one at a leading Australian provider of home and mobile communications and broadband, and another at a leading Canadian provider of cable and Internet. The PSD Switching business was down 8% quarter-over-quarter and up 1% year-over-year. The quarterly decline was partly due to coming off a strong quarter in Q2 and partly due to the variability in service provider demand for data center solutions. On the other hand, we did see good bookings growth year-over-year and have a strong backlog going into the next quarter. We continue to see growth in both data center and combined campus and data center deployment. We saw strength in top-of-rack and 10-gig overall, both sequentially and year-over-year. We also saw good repeat and new business in both Service Provider and Enterprise accounts for switching. Our innovation pipeline was rich in the third quarter as we shipped several new variants of our EX family of fixed switches, as well as new 100-gig line cards for the EX9200. On the SDN front, Juniper also announced the general availability of our Contrail Controller that enables seamless integration between physical and virtual networks for both service providers and enterprises. It had been in trials with roughly 40 customers across the world. We are very pleased that we were able to pull in the dates of this release and ship a product that supports industry-standard protocols. All credit goes to our hard-working and innovative engineers. We also joined with VMware at VMworld in August to announce a hardware accelerated physical to virtual gateway solution using Juniper's high-performance networking infrastructure and VMware's NSX. The data center is an important focus area for us, and you'll continue to hear about our innovations in the domain, as Kevin mentioned earlier. We had some great wins in switching and wireless as well, one with a multinational industry leader in oil and gas exploration and refining, and the other at a global financial services firm. So with all that said, I summarize as follows: we are well positioned in the edge, core and virtualized data center with our portfolios today and innovations in the pipeline. Customer feedback around our solutions and recently launched innovations have been very positive. We are pleased with the progress we are seeing, and I'm satisfied with how we are delivering against our innovation agenda. At this point, I'm going to turn it over to Robyn. Thank you.
Robyn M. Denholm: Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report that our third quarter results reflect continued momentum in revenue and earnings growth. Revenue came in slightly higher than our expectations, driven by continued strength in Service Provider Routing. Non-GAAP earnings increased sequentially due to healthy growth margins, partially offset by operating expenses that were at the upper end of our guidance. Our focus on driving top line growth and operational excellence is unchanged. With that goal in mind, we continue to work to improve our cost structure. In the third quarter, we took additional steps to rationalize our product portfolios and rebalanced our investments. I will talk more about this and associated restructuring charges later in my prepared remarks. Looking at our demand metrics, we continue to see signs of strength in the service provider market and, for the first time in several quarters, saw this in all 3 geographies. We had a good bookings quarter, with book-to-bill greater than 1. Product deferred revenue was up slightly quarter-over-quarter, and backlog remained at healthy levels. Total revenue was $1,186,000,000, up 3% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. Product revenue was up 4% quarter-over-quarter and 7% from a year ago. Services revenue was down slightly versus the prior quarter, primarily due to the timing of certain renewals. Although we had no 10% customers this quarter, we saw strong revenues from our top-tier carrier customers. For the quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.19, including a $0.02 impact from restructuring charges. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.33, up $0.04 sequentially and increased significantly by $0.11 year-over-year. The sequential growth was driven primarily by higher revenue and gross margins, but also included a $0.01 benefit from the lower tax rate. Now let me provide color on revenue by region, market and business segment. Americas revenue was down 2% sequentially and up 18% year-over-year. The sequential decline was due to Enterprise. As a reminder, Q2's Enterprise results included the recognition of $34 million of government revenue that is previously being deferred. Excluding this, Q3 Enterprise revenue in the Americas would have increased by 1% sequentially. Also, Enterprise was up 6% year-over-year, reflecting broad-based strength, partially offset by some softness in the financial services and Federal markets. Americas Service Provider increased sequentially by 4% and had its third quarter in a row of double digit year-over-year growth, reflecting wins across content, carriers and cable service provider verticals. EMEA revenue was up 2% sequentially, but down 5% year-over-year. The sequential growth was driven by strong Service Provider performance as design wins in the U.K. and Middle East began converting to revenue shipments. Enterprise demand was weak in the quarter relative to a strong performance in Q2 due to some business taking longer than we expected to close. APAC router rebounded sharply from a weak Q2, growing 25% quarter-over-quarter with double digit increases in both Service Provider and Enterprise. This strong performance was driven by good growth in China, Australia and South Korea. Service Provider revenue was $788 million, up 9% sequentially and 12% year-over-year, with broad based strength across all 3 geographies. Enterprise revenue was $397 million, down 6% sequentially and 4% year-over-year. Excluding the government deferred revenue recognition in Q2, Enterprise would have been up slightly quarter-over-quarter. The year-over-year decline was due to weaker financial services and government business globally, and the timing of some large switching builds in APAC and EMEA. Now let me review our revenue by segment. Platform Systems division revenue was $939 million, up 3% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. Total router product revenue of $609 million was up 5% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. The MX product line had its second successive revenue record quarter, growing 15% sequentially. The recently released MX2020 and MX2010 product continued to gain traction with customers. Core routing had a good quarter, growing 11% sequentially, with the T Series product line having its best quarter in the last 4 quarters. Total switching product revenue of $148 million was down 8% sequentially from a record Q2 and up 1% year-over-year. The sequential decline was primarily due to the timing in certain Service Provider data center deployment and the migration to the new EX9200 switching platform. We did see strong bookings in the quarter and expect switching to regain its momentum. SSD revenue was $246 million, up 5% sequentially, but down 15% year-over-year. Total security product revenue was $144 million, increasing nicely at 14% sequentially. As I mentioned last quarter, we were seeing early signs of the business turning around, and this quarter's results are a positive sign. Service Provider security revenue was strong in the quarter, with high-end SRX growing double digits sequentially. Enterprise security continued to stabilize with a record quarter for branch SRX and good sequential growth for high-end SRX in the data center. This is still the early stage of our security business recovery, and we continue to focus on growing revenue. Our new products continue to secure design wins with revenues greater than $110 million for the quarter. Moving on to gross margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margins for the quarter was 64.4% compared to 63.7% last quarter and 65.6% a year ago. Non-GAAP product gross margins were 65.4%, an increase of 1.6% over last quarter and a decrease of 1.4% from last year. As expected, the sequential improvement was largely the result of the non-recurrence of last quarter's Federal revenue recognition. Non-GAAP services gross margins were 61.3%, a decrease of 2% from last quarter and a 0.9% from last year. The sequential decline was a result of lower revenue and higher support-related costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $530 million, an increase of $14 million sequentially and a decrease of $15 million year-over-year. This increase was primarily due to higher legal expenses. We continue to focus on operational excellence and driving efficiency in our investments. With that goal in mind, we have taken some restructuring and rebalancing actions in October that will result in the elimination of approximately 280 positions in the fourth quarter. We have also continued our real estate consolidation. Looking at headcount, we ended Q3 with 9,714 employees, a sequential increase of 201, primarily in lower cost regions. Non-GAAP operating margins for the quarter expanded to 19.8% compared to 18.9% last quarter and a significant improvement over the 16.9% last year. The sequential increase was driven by higher revenue and gross margins, and an improvement in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. The non-GAAP tax rate was 25.5% compared to 27.4% last quarter. This improvement is due to the geographic mix of income and some onetime items. Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $3 billion of net cash and investments. We generated strong operating cash flows of $176 million, in line with our historical patents. Q3 DSO was 42 days, up from 40 days last quarter. Capital expenditures were $41 million, down 43% sequentially as a result of the completion of the first phase of our Sunnyvale campus, while depreciation and amortization expense was $41 million. We repurchased 4.4 million shares for $93 million at an average price of $20.92. And we have $1.2 billion remaining on our current authorization. Now I will review our outlook for the fourth quarter. As a reminder, these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis, except for revenue and share count. We expect the December quarter to reflect continued strong Service Provider demand, with some improvement in Enterprise. However, we are carefully monitoring any impacts in Federal spending from the recent U.S. government shutdown. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenues to range from $1,200,000,000 to $1,230,000,000. Gross margins are expected to be in the range of 64.5%, plus or minus 0.5%. Operating expenses are expected to range from $510 million to $525 million. At the midpoint of guidance, operating margins are expected to be approximately 22%. This is expected to result in non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $0.35 and $0.37 per share, assuming a flat share count and a tax rate of approximately 27.5%. On a GAAP basis, we also expect an additional restructuring charge of approximately $10 million related to the fourth quarter headcount actions. To summarize, we anticipate the overall demand to be healthy, with some potential challenges in Federal. As we drive to close out the year, our product portfolio and focus on execution are very strong. I would like to thank our employees for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. And now, with that, let me turn the call over for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rod Hall of JPMorgan.
Roderick B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I just had a couple. I wanted to go back to security, because I thought that was a pretty positive number and just see if you could elaborate a little bit on what's going on there? What should we be thinking about trajectory, et cetera? And where are those revenues coming from customer-wise, if you can give us any more color on that? And then just on the guidance, which is below what we were expecting -- I mean, it feels like it's probably related to Federal/Enterprise, but can you just clarify what the driver for this slightly weaker revenue expectation is for Q4?
Kevin R. Johnson: Yes, thanks for your questions, Rod. I'll take the first one, and then I'll hand off to Robyn to take the second question on the guide. Yes, on security, we had a good sequential uptick on revenue in our security business. And I think it's a reflection of the continued progress we're making. As I mentioned before on these calls, there's kind of 3 categories of scenarios that we're focused on in security. One of them is securing Service Provider LTE networks and the mobile Internet. The second is data centers, both service provider and enterprise data centers, and the third is campus and branch. In the area of service providers and securing the LTE networks, we did see some good momentum again on the service -- or this quarter on the service provider said, which is one of the contributors on that uptick, but we also saw very good growth sequentially on our high-end SRX, which is used both for those service providers and the data centers. So I think that the data center solution that we have, that provides Web AppSecure, Spotlight, as well as that high-end SRX, we believe, is an industry-leading solution, and we're seeing some continued progress, especially with the high-end SRX. And then for campus and branch, we also saw good sequential growth in our branch SRX, and that is also an area that we are doing some additional work for some new capabilities that we'll hear more about in the future. But I think overall, the SRX business did well. The ScreenOS revenue as a percentage of the total is a lower percentage of the total than it was in the prior quarter, which is a reflection of us continuing to make progress on moving that installed base and migrating from the ScreenOS revenue streams to the SRX and the rest of the security products. So overall, I think it's a good data point that gives us confidence we're executing against the right things. But that said, we know we still have a lot of work to do. We're very clear about that. We're very focused on that. We have the resources applied to that, and we believe we're well positioned for growth on our security business in 2014. Robyn, I'll let you take the question on guidance.
Robyn M. Denholm: Yes. So, Rod, on the guidance question, in terms of the Service Provider momentum that we've been seeing and we saw in the third quarter, we expect that to continue. We're seeing good design wins in all 3 theaters, and we continue to execute really well. The guidance is tempered by our expectation of Federal being weak in the fourth quarter. We did see some signs of that in the third quarter, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, and we do expect that in the fourth quarter. And so absent that, even through Enterprise, we're expecting to continue on a good path. But the Federal weakness, we're expecting in the fourth quarter.
Operator: The next question comes from Tal Liani of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Tal Liani - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: On the core side, I have 2 questions. On the core side, can you discuss where the strength is coming from PTX versus the T Series, the new T Series? That's one question, and if you can elaborate actually on PTX, given that it's a architectural change. And then this one is a broader question. If I look at your chart, Chart #9, basically, the growth is coming from service providers in North America, if I combine 2 pieces. Is this a tied -- spending tied, and that's what lifts up revenues? Or is this more company-related? That means, if we have some slower growth of spending next year in certain projects, are -- is there going to be a reversal of these positive trends? Or do you have enough product cycles that can lift you up even in a more challenging environment?
Kevin R. Johnson: Yes. Thanks for your questions, Tal. Why don't I take your second question first, and then I'm going to hand over to Rami to talk a little bit more about core and the trends that we see there. Your second question had to do -- or sort of around broad growth in the service provider sector. And I think what we see unfolding is very consistent with what we outlined in the last earnings call at the end of Q2, which is we continue to see service providers turn their attention and their CapEx investments to their IT networks. And we saw a lot of strength in edge. But this was a quarter where we also saw good sequential uptick in core. We believe that is going to continue. We believe -- if we look at the projects that we have, there are a pipeline of projects that we're working on that will begin deployment in next year. And so I think that we anticipate continued momentum going forward. In -- specifically in our America Service Provider business, not only did we see strength with our Tier 1 service providers, but we also saw it in cable and the Web 2.0 content providers. And so -- as well as the Tier 2 and Tier 3 carriers as well. So it's a broad trend that we believe will continue. In Europe, I think, with the service provider landscape in Europe, I guess, the way I would characterize it is that the large carriers were mixed but stable. There were some that had projects that ended, others that had projects that kicked off. Some of those service providers projects that ended, we have visibility to the next wave of projects. So I think Europe service provider has stabilized, and I think it's at the point they too need to invest CapEx in their IP infrastructure. And there's been some wins that Rami mentioned that we had there. And in Asia, we also saw good sequential uptick in service providers, primarily in countries such as Korea, Australia, China. I think other countries were not quite as strong. I think Japan was also a good performer. So the net is, I think, on a global basis, this trend that we see of service provider CapEx on the routing infrastructure was evident in the fact that all 3 theaters showed good sequential growth. And we think that, that's going to continue into 2014. With that, let me hand over to Rami. And perhaps, Rami, you can take Tal's first question on core and what we're seeing there related to PTX, T and some trends in core. Rami?
Rami Rahim: Yes, I'd be happy to, Kevin. First, I'll say that the main drivers that are sort of affecting our year-over-year performance in routing are still in the Edge. And I think that the demand factors there are very strong, whether it be capacity or service delivery or connectivity. But that said, we are pleased with what we've seen from a sequential standpoint in the core. We've been saying now for a couple of quarters that the core networks are running hotter, and therefore, there is going to need to be an upgrade cycle. And the fact that we're now seeing some sequential performance gives us conviction in that belief. As far as the question around T versus PTX, certainly, both are performing quite well. PTX year-over-year performance is very healthy. T Series in fact, I will say, is driving a lot of the sequential performance. You're actually right in that PTX is a bit of an architectural transition, which is why we have the T and the MX as other options for our customers to round out our portfolio and make sure we're well equipped to address any sort of core build out. The T Series remains the best investment story, investment protection story in the industry. And the PTX, especially now, is we introduced before the end of this year, we've announced this already, our 100-gig DWDM interfaces is really going to make it a very compelling packet optical solution for operators that are looking to consolidate layers in their network and simplify their network.
Operator: The next question comes from Kulbinder Garcha of Crédit Suisse.
Kulbinder Garcha - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Maybe first for Kevin, just in terms of going back to the previous comment you made, it just feels like many of the service providers, I'm thinking the telco service providers, are indicating slowly -- it seems that they need to invest not only in the U.S. but Europe is recovering. There is signs of life, continued signs of life in Asia. I'm just wondering, how has your visibility changed over the last 3 or 6 months in your conversation? And color you could give around that would be helpful. And my second question is on the SDN side, I know it's very early days, if you were to guess today in terms of these customers going from the 40 or so trials to an actual stage of relatively meaningful deployment, whatever -- however you want to describe that, how long is that away? Is that 2 to 5 years, 12 months? Just the discussions you're having with the products you've launched. How do you see the whole shape of that evolving?
Kevin R. Johnson: Thank you for your questions. I'll take the first question, and then perhaps I'll hand off to Rami to talk a little bit about SDN and how he sees that unfolding in the marketplace. In terms of looking at what we see as a continued building strength of the service provider industry and marketplace, your question specifically was how we've seen visibility change in the last 3 to 6 months. And I would say that the trends that we identified, I would say in Q3 of the year ago, so about 12 months ago, are consistent. Yet I would say our visibility to the specific projects has -- continues to improve and continues to strengthen. And that's a function of bids that customers had that they were in the process of working that we have been awarded, and the teams are now engaged working on those projects. And in some cases, it includes new features, new software. I think the fact that our backlog is up, our deferred revenue is up, the pipeline is strong, all of those, are data points that are indicators that the visibility to that service provider spending cycle has improved over the last 1 to 2 quarters. Let me hand off to Rami to share our perspective then on SDN and how quickly, Rami, you see deployments unfolding.
Rami Rahim: Certainly. So I look at a number of different layers. With respect to SDN, it is certainly still in the early stages, and there are a lot of customers that we're having discussions with around the journey that they will undertake in order to deploy SDN in their network. Today, what we're doing in fact is we're implementing the hook into our systems, into our platforms and the programmability into our platform that gives customers the peace of mind that they are investing in switching, routing, security that will evolve through this SDN journey without having to do a wholesale of network upgrades. That is very much resonating with our customers and we're seeing momentum in the market as a result of that message alone. Now we're also of course developing really industry-leading software, like our Contrail Controller, that provides unprecedented scales, that provides things like resiliency and peering between controllers and so forth that our customers are starting to really think about how they're going to deploy in order to solve a number of challenges in their network. I think that this is going to play out over multiple quarters. I think that one of the most prominent applications for it will be in the data center, to build out overlay networks for the purpose of virtualizing networks in the data center. We want to do this both with our own systems and our own controller, as well as with our own systems and partners like VMware. As I said, it's going to take a few quarters for this to pan out, but we're very confident in the solutions that we're developing to address these applications that I mentioned.
Operator: The next question comes from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I just had 2 questions. The first one was I think you commented that China bounced back in the quarter. If you can just dig into that a little bit since some others have commented on weakness there. And then the second one, kind of back to the core routing dynamics, and perhaps this one's for Rami, are you seeing any impact at all from the new product introductions in the market from Alcatel, as well as Cisco's CRS-X, and the NCS, whether in terms of market share or pricing or just any other implications?
Kevin R. Johnson: Thanks for your questions, Simona. I'll take your first question, and then I'll hand off to Rami for the second question. Just to clarify, I think in the comments, what we saw was we saw good sequential growth in APAC, of which China was one of the contributors. And I think my comments on China, specifically on the service provider side, is that our strategy has always been one that we've been very targeted or very surgical on the opportunities or the areas that we focus on in China, specifically those opportunities that play to our strengths, of having a differentiated product set in the areas of scale and performance for very -- obviously very high volumes of traffic in China. And I think there were some opportunities in the quarter that unfolded, that generated some revenue for us in China, specifically in the service provider routing side of the market that contributed to the overall APAC results. I think China -- we work closely with our partner, Ericsson in many of the service provider instances. And so Ericsson continues to be a very good partner for us in certain geographies. And certainly, China is one of them, and that's a contributing factor as well. Rami, I'll hand over to you for the question, Simona's question on the core.
Rami Rahim: Thanks for the question, Simona. I'll say that this market, whether it be core routing or edge routing, has always been a very competitive market. And I certainly don't expect any of our competitors to stand still. I operate -- we innovate under the assumption that both Cisco and Alcatel are going to be releasing new products, as they both have. It doesn't change the strategy that we are executing towards and the fact that I remain very confident in the technology that we're developing and releasing into the market. I mean, the fact remains that the PTX is still the only platform of its kind in terms of the efficiency of which it can move packets around. So it appeals to the transport buyer. T Series remains the best investment section. It's been out there for a decade. It's still growing. It still has excellent capacity. And then, as I also mentioned in the past, the 2020, the MX2020, now gives us an architectural approach that blends services throughout the entire network, edge and core, and that also is resonating with many of our customers. So I remain confident in the technology that we're -- that we have today. And of course, were not standing still either. We're working on next-generation silicon, next-generation software, to make sure that we maintain our competitive edge.
Operator: The next question comes from Mark Sue of RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: You are proactively pruning the headcount. Would you consider extending or pruning to the product portfolio? If I look at the Enterprise, for example, the routers there are down 50%. Security is better now, but it was -- it's been somewhat inconsistent and even for carrier WiFi -- enterprise WiFi products. So I'm wondering, are there benefits to becoming more focused and less broad? Or do you feel that with the return of the carrier router cycle, that perhaps you'd double down in some of the other investments?
Kevin R. Johnson: Yes. Thanks for the question, Mark. Let me comment on that, and then I'll let Rami add to it a bit on the product portfolio side. But let me just say, first of all, we have been pruning the product portfolio. I think one example of that is MobileNext. And just to give you some perspective there, when we launched the MobileNext project, it was part of an overall strategy to continue to increase our push into the wireless side of the business. And we continue to see good growth in the wireless side, as evidenced by the strong performance we've seen on the MX and some of the core convergence projects that were doing with PTX. And now, with the introduction of the ACX in the backhaul, I think all those things have helped us continue to strengthen our position in the wireless side of service providers. In addition, the inflection point of network function virtualization and SDN, we believe, is going to create a paradigm shift in how evolved packet core solutions are deployed. We believe that's going to become more of an x86 virtualized network function, and something like Contrail will play a role in service chaining and help enabling that. And so we took a decision to cancel that project. And so that cancellation of that project is pruning the portfolio and is part of this reduction in the headcount that we just spoke of. And I think there is a number of examples of smaller things like that, that we are doing. Now specific to your question on routing, and you said enterprise routing was down, keep in mind these are the same routers that we sell to service providers. And much of -- well, part of the reason it's down is related to the U.S. federal and other large entities like that, that have similar attributes to their business like service providers. So unless we took a decision to start to prune the portfolio in our core business and service providers, which I don't think makes sense, these are the same products that we sell to many of our large enterprise customers. But certainly, we do believe that the strategy we're on is one of narrowing our focus. We've been very clear that our focus on the service provider, and specifically the domains of the core and the edge of their networks, and now with ACX on the access layer of their networks, as well as their data centers, and that data center priority, is one that then crosses over into enterprise. You will hear more about some new things that we'll announce in the data center here later this month. And then certainly, there are some areas that we'll continue to assess, but we're very committed to the fact that monetizing our investment in R&D across both service provider and enterprise, with products that sell to both, is the most leveraged way to drive value, both for our shareholders and for our customers. Rami, let me hand over to you and let you -- see if you -- if there are things you want to add to that or amplify.
Rami Rahim: I'll just add a couple of things. I think you've covered it well, Kevin. The engineering principle that we're applying to our strategy are really all around focus and high leverage. If you think about what we've done in the past, for example, in focusing our investing dollars in the MX as opposed to spreading them across multiple different edge platforms, that is an example of a strategy that has worked very well for us and an example of what we are essentially doing now. I want to make sure that we solve our customers' high-performance networking problems with the fewest number of high-quality differentiated platforms as possible, and that's essentially what we're doing. We want to make sure that we're leveraging between our data center and our campus. We've done that in our organizational designs. Between service provider and enterprise, we've seen tons of opportunities to do that as enterprises start to seek the same sort of carrier class capabilities in their platform. We're doing just that as well. So I think these are just some of the principles that we're applying that have worked for us well in the past and will continue to work well for us going forward.
Operator: The next question is from Subu Subrahmanyan of the Juda Group.
Natarajan Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group, Research Division: My question is on the switching business. Could you talk about, excluding the lumpiness, what are the other drivers you're seeing going forward? Is it share gain? Is it new products that you're releasing in the data center? And can you talk about QFabric versus a standalone best-of-breed product strategy, how we should see that play out in 2014?
Kevin R. Johnson: Yes. Subu, thanks for your question. Rami let me hand this one to you, and I'll let you talk a bit about our switching portfolio.
Rami Rahim: Certainly. So the major driver that we're seeing right now for switching are in data center and combined data center/campus opportunities. We execute at -- a good fraction of our business goes to enterprises that are building common cores that serve both their data center and their campus. 10-gig upgrades are still happening. They're coming strong from the growth in our 10-gig ports across our portfolio. SDN, as I mentioned earlier, the discussion now is about making sure that our customers are equipped with the infrastructure that can help them move through the -- sort of their SDN strategy, whether it be one with our own controller, Contrail, or one with our partner controllers, for example, VMware. We did not break out the QFabric versus EX performance. At the end of the day, we have multiple different fabric options that will solve various different problems that our customers need solved. The Virtual Chassis and the EX, QFabric and the QFabric architecture are both different options. And depending on who you're talking to or what problem you're trying to solve, each one will have a sweet spot in terms of its applications. And yes, as we did say, we're at -- revenue was essentially flat year-over-year. The bookings momentum that we saw in terms of growth gives us confidence in -- and backlog that we built, I should say, gives us confidence in the next quarter. And Kevin did mention that we are going to be announcing somewhat shortly some new innovations in the spaces that are going to help us and only increase our confidence.
Operator: The next question comes from Ben Reitzes of Barclays.
Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Could you talk about services expectations for the fourth quarter? You mentioned there were some renewals that didn't get signed, and maybe that implied some services revenue pushed into the fourth quarter. I wasn't sure. And then just on Federal, is it still about 4% of sales? And what did it do in the quarter? And what's in your guidance for Federal? You said qualitatively. If you can quantify any of that around federal, that would be really helpful.
Robyn M. Denholm: Yes. Ben, thank you for the question. On the first question around services, so we did see a slight decline in the revenue quarter-over-quarter. We do expect that to come back over the next couple of quarters. We also saw a drop or a decline in the gross margins by about 2 points, and we do expect that to come back as well over the next couple of quarters as well. So the services business is very healthy. On the support side, obviously, as our footprint grows, we need to continue to make sure that we're there for our customers in terms of maintaining the products that we have out in the marketplace. So that's why the gross margin came down a little bit. In terms of the federal revenue, about a year ago, I gave you the percentage of about 4.5% of total company revenue and that, that had come down over the previous year. On a year-to-date basis, including the revenue in the second quarter, the routing revenue that we've talked about in the second quarter, we are at about that level, at about 4.5% on a year-to-date basis. I expect the fourth quarter to be weaker than what we typically see, and therefore, the percentage of overall total revenue for the year to be lower than the 4.5%. I hope that clarifies it.
Operator: The next question comes from Brian Marshall of ISI Group.
Brian Marshall - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Obviously, service provider continues to move in the right direction, but enterprise is down a little bit. Can you talk a little bit about sort of your partnership with IBM in conjunction with Pure and what else you're doing to address this kind of pre sort of configured pre-integrated stack? I think EMC earlier this morning talked about 50% year-over-year growth in their Vblock. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that? Then perhaps a quick update on the CEO search process and where we stand with that.
Kevin R. Johnson: All right, Brian, thanks. Let me hand your second question first, and then I'll frame your first question, and then hand it off to Rami. On the CEO search, on our last earnings call, I commented that the board have put together a search committee and it started a search. I would say that we're in the later stages of the process, and I would expect -- there's no news to announce on that today, but I would expect that when they conclude, we'll make that news available, certainly, and just remind you that in the interim, I will continue to fulfill the role as the CEO and will make sure that I'm available to have a smooth and thoughtful transition to my successor. So the update is I think the -- I would characterize the board as being in the late stage of that process. Your first question around the enterprise, I think a couple of things as -- certainly as Robyn highlighted, there were some weakness in Federal. And we did see some good results on our SRX sequentially on the security business. And then I think as Rami commented, our bookings for switching, we saw some good year-on-year growth with bookings and switching. You put that together, and I think there were some good signs of some progress and momentum there. The relationship with IBM, I think, continues to be a very important one to us. They're a key partner for our go-to-market in the enterprise. I would say much of that relationship is anchored on the services side of their business and what we're doing to help enable their services side of the business. And there are certainly opportunities for us to continue to expand that. Your question specifically then is how are we addressing the integrated stacks of compute storage and networking that we're seeing on the market today. And for that, let me hand over to Rami, and he can talk a little bit about the work we're doing with IBM in that area. Rami?
Rami Rahim: Yes, Brian. This is certainly an important segment of the market, and this is precisely why we have created a partnership with IBM to make sure that we do have an offering that can satisfy that part of the market. But I will just point out that it's not only about that. There are the large sets of our customers, especially the very large customers that are looking for much more modularity, open interfaces between the various different stack elements in their data center, and we're well equipped to have those discussions, especially as a result of partnerships that we have with EMC and VMware and CloudStack and OpenStack, and so forth. We want to promote an open ecosystem of the different sort of software and hardware stack elements that will appeal to many of our customers. So both segments of the data center markets are really important to us, integrated and more disintegrated, if you will.
Operator: The next question comes from Amitabh Passi of UBS.
Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I had a 2-part question on security, and then one for Robyn. Kevin or Rami, just on the security side, can you give us a sense of how the service provider market is? We're hearing some noise in the market of increasing competitive pressure in that market. Just wondering how you would characterize the environment for your Service Provider security business. And then, Kevin, just related to your data center strategy, is there any -- or are there any metrics you can give us that give us a sense of how WebApp and Spotlight are developing? And then, Robyn, just one for you on the OpEx front. If we assumed 5%, 6% growth next year for top line, how do we think about OpEx progression for 2014?
Kevin R. Johnson: Yes. Thanks for your question, Amitabh. I'll take the first on and then hand over to Robyn for the second one. The first part of your question was related to security, specifically in the service provider market. And the specific area that we are focused on with that is securing the LTE network. So the mobile Internet of our large wireless carriers. And we've had a significant number of wins and success in that area. And the key driver is the fact that these require very high end systems to handle large amounts of traffic. And the high-end SRX has been a very strong offering for service providers in securing their LTE networks. We don't see a lot of competitive threats in that particular area of the service provider, which is where we're focused on security. Certainly, service providers have other security needs in other areas, whether it's data center, their own campuses. And certainly, there are competitors in those areas. But when it comes to securing the LTE mobile Internet, I think we continue to feel like we've got a strong position, and we enhance the product to have even more scale and the ability to handle more concurrent sessions and more throughput. I think some of the evidence is just the sequential growth that we've seen on our high-end SRX, is evidence of supporting that. On the data center side, your question was what do we see that -- with WebApp Secure and Spotlight. With WebApp Secure and Spotlight, we're now seeing some of the early stages of the deployments and the implementations of those. By the same token, we're seeing the high-end SRX that goes into data centers, that sequential uptick was also contributed by wins in the enterprise. And a number of these enterprise data center wins with -- in the area of security, in many cases, would fall into customer segments like financial services and Federal government that also have very large data centers and high-end computing needs. So there's no specific data that I can give you on WebApp Secure and Spotlight today. I would say it's -- we see sort of -- customers are now in the process of going through the early stages of deploying. We're starting to see deployments increase. But it's still early in that cycle. But it does -- those deployments do reinforce the value of the high-end SRX, and we did see good sequential uptick on the high-end SRX. Robyn, I'll hand over to you for the second part.
Robyn M. Denholm: Yes, Amitabh. In terms of the OpEx side, obviously, as a company, we're committed to growing revenue and also to continue our journey on the operational excellence front. And we've done a pretty good job, I think, in terms of managing operating expenses and to reduce the overall cost structure of the company over the last 12 months or so. As we move into next year, obviously we're not at a point where we can give you guidance on that, but I will refer you back to our operating model, where we've talked about being -- OpEx as a percentage of revenue in the 39% to 42% range. At the midpoint of guidance that I gave you for Q4, we'll be approaching that 42% range. It's about 42.5% at the midpoint of our OpEx guidance for the fourth quarter. So my view is that's where we're headed into the long-term model range as we move through next year.
Operator: The next question comes from Simon Leopold of Raymond James.
Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: I wanted to see if you could update us on the target for new products. You mentioned on the call and the prepared remarks that you are at $110 million for that set of new products. You've, in the past, talked about exiting the year at $150 million. I'd like to get an update on that target, as well as an update of how the mix has evolved in terms of your expectations on those new products.
Robyn M. Denholm: Thank, Simon. I'll start, and then I'll let Kevin comment as well. So in terms of the third quarter, we were over $110 million of revenue on the new products. And as you will recall, there were 5 products that I talked about at FAM a year ago in terms of what constituted that $150-million target. It was T4K, the T4000, the PTX, QFabric, and then we also included ACX and MobileNext. It is very fair to say that the 3 products, T4000, PTX and QFabric, make up the bulk of the revenue in the third quarter. And they have done -- over the past few years, I've given you updates against that target. We feel very good about the pipeline that we have and about the design wins that we have across the board in terms of our T4000, PTX and QFabric, and the momentum on ACX is starting to build. And so we're 90 days away from the end of the fourth quarter, so we'll report out against that target in the fourth quarter. But we feel very good about where we are in the cycle of new products that we've launched. And don't forget, since we've talked about these byproducts, we've also launched some pretty compelling new products in the MX2000 series, both the 2010 and the 2020. And we've also had quite good revenue against those products as well as we've developed through the year as they've been out there for a quarter. I'll let Kevin comment as well.
Kevin R. Johnson: Yes, thanks for the question, Simon. I think the -- when it comes to the core routing, whether it's PTX or T Series, I think we saw good sequential uptick on T4000, and we've done a lot of work to lay the foundation for that. And as Rami mentioned earlier, PTX continues to be a good performing product for us. Key on us achieving that will be continued evidence that service providers are shifting or complementing their CapEx expenditures that we currently see on the edge and complementing those with continued upgrades and continued investment in the core. And we saw evidence of that in Q3, we'll see how that unfolds in Q4. The ACX addresses the access layer of the network, and I think we're seeing some beginning traction in the ACX. And we'll see how that unfolds as well. That's a newer product in the product family, but it does reinforce the strategy we have of focusing on the wireless service providers with a product set that gives us mobile backhaul. In terms of data centers, I think the -- we had a very strong quarter in Q2 with QFabric. We continue to move forward with some of the key QFabric wins that Rami mentioned, and this is both on the service provider side, as well as the enterprise side. And I think there's a number of deployments. I think Q4 will be a function of how many of those new systems get deployed, combined with how many of the existing installed base customers expand their networks. And then I think, in regards to MobileNext, we commented earlier on the call that we had canceled that project based on what we see happening in the market with a shift more towards network function virtualization. So I think the mix shift of perhaps what we expected to what we will see, we're probably going to see a higher percentage certainly in core versus the MobileNext, and I think Access will be probably about what we expected. And data center, I think, will be about where -- perhaps where we expected when we set that target a year ago in June. So the mix has slightly changed, but not too far off. And I think the key factor is going to be what we see in terms of SP CapEx focused on the core, as well as some of these big data center deployments with QFabric.
Kathleen Nemeth: Okay, thank you. That is unfortunately all the time we have today. We'd like to thank you for your great questions and for your participation, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thanks, everyone.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Juniper Networks Second Quarter 2013 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Kathleen Nemeth, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Ms. Nemeth, you may begin.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Here on the call are Kevin Johnson, Chief Executive Officer; Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial Officer; and Bob Muglia, Executive Vice President, Software Solutions Division. In addition, Rami Rahim, Executive Vice President, Platform Systems Division, is on the call and will be available for Q&A. Please remember when listening to today's call that statements concerning Juniper's business outlook, economic and market outlook, strategy, future financial operating results and overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including economic conditions generally or within the networking industry; changes in overall technology spending and spending by communication service providers and major customers; the network capacity requirements of service providers; the timing of orders and shipments; manufacturing and supply chain constraints; variation of the mix of products sold, customer perception and acceptance of our products; rapid technological and market change; litigation and other factors listed in our most recent 10-Q filed with the SEC. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances change after the date of this call. In discussing the financial results, Robyn will first present results on a GAAP basis, and for purposes of today's discussion, we will also review non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why the management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult the press release furnished with our 8-K filed with the SEC today. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results, please see the Investor Relations section of our website. On today's call, Robyn will also be providing forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis other than that with respect to revenue and share count. All guidance is forward-looking, and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier. GAAP guidance measures are not available on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to certain charges, which are excluded from non-GAAP guidance estimates. Please note that today's call is scheduled to last for 1 hour. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin.
Kevin R. Johnson: Thanks, Kathleen, and welcome to all of you joining us on today's conference call. Before we review our earnings, I'd like to take a minute to comment on my decision, which was announced today, to retire as CEO of Juniper once a successor is named and an orderly transition is accomplished. After 32 years in a line operating role, with the past 5 years here at Juniper, my family and I have decided it was time to take a break. The company is healthy and growing, we have a strong management team and world-class talent in the domain of networking. The board has formed a search committee, and we are working closely together to ensure we manage the process in a thoughtful way. I'm committed to working closely with the board and my successor to ensure a smooth transition for all of our stakeholders. Until then, I continue to serve in my current capacity. I will also remain focused on fulfilling my board commitments through this process. It is an absolute privilege to serve as Juniper's CEO, and I've enjoyed the past 5 years. Together, we have grown our business and strengthened our position in the networking industry as evidenced by this quarter's results. The business is healthy and momentum is building. So let's spend some time to talk about the quarterly results. We delivered strong second quarter results, reflecting good execution on our strategy, as well as the strength in our product portfolio. I'm pleased with the performance of this quarter in what remains a dynamic global economic environment. To put these results into context, you may recall that for the past 3 quarters, we have been talking about demand improving in service provider. We saw good strength in service provider this quarter, both in terms of revenue and certainly in terms of the bookings environment. I'll speak more about the service provider segments, carrier, cable and content in a moment. In enterprise, while there continues to be areas of weakness, we are seeing some early signs of stabilization and improving demand in the U.S. and Europe. In service provider, we focused on 3 customer segments: carrier, cable and content, also referred to as Web 2.0 providers. Carrier includes both wireline and wireless. In the second quarter, we experienced good overall demand in wireline, while demand also was strong in wireless in the Americas. In EMEA, we are seeing emerging signs of growth in wireless, we performed well in cable and we are seeing great traction with major cable providers. In content, our good traction in core routing and switching are translating into improved performance as CapEx strengthens in this segment. For the routing market, we continue to see very strong demand in the Edge. Core networks seem to be running hotter, which is a positive indicator as we expect investment in core routing begin to pick up in the coming quarters. Overall, the trend we identified 3 quarters ago of a routing CapEx cycle appears to be picking up. On the enterprise side, our switching and data center business performed well in the second quarter. Highlights included strong demand from our newly introduced EX9200, as well as our QFabric family of products, which had a record quarter. Customer response to the EX9200 has been good, as it satisfies our customers need for programmability in core switches that power both campus and data centers. This also aligns with our SDN strategy. In security, we're seeing positive activity in bookings. Bob will provide more detail on our strategy and progress in a few minutes. As a company, we continue to drive innovation and differentiation through our systems and our software. We're focused on delivering world-class scale, performance and reliability in our systems, which is the heritage of our company. At the same time, we're complementing the value delivered through our systems with a software strategy that enables our customers to be more agile. This is delivered with our network function virtualization capability in a way that helps customers reduce cycle times and be more efficient, and we expect to enhance this capability with future product introductions that are part of our SDN strategy. We believe the combination of scale and performance in our systems, plus the agility and efficiency in our software, provides unique value that is resonating with our customers. The second quarter was a strong one for revenue, bookings and backlog. In addition, we remain focused on prudent cost management and effective capital allocation, which Robyn will discuss later on the call. To sum up, our 2013 results show that we are successfully executing on the 5 operating principles we established at the beginning of the year. We expect macroeconomic environment to remain uncertain, we expect modest growth in the markets we serve, take share in routing and switching and stabilize share in enterprise security, expand 2013 operating margins over 2012 and continue to generate solid cash flows and prudently allocate capital. The strength that we're seeing in the service provider market and the stabilization we're seeing in the enterprise market reinforce our confidence that we are in the right markets with a great product portfolio. We continue to feel very good about the health of the business, and we will continue to stay focused on executing with agility and delivering value for all our stakeholders. Now I'll turn it over to Bob to discuss the latest developments in security and SDN. Bob?
Robert L. Muglia: Thanks, Kevin. Today, I'd like to update you on our progress in the security business, as well as with SDN and our overall software strategy. As we've previously outlined for security, we expect our recovery to occur over multiple quarters. With that background, Q2 is a tough quarter for our security business, with revenue of $126 million, a decline of 20% year-over-year and 8% quarter-over-quarter. However, the actions we are taking are showing some positive signs and results. Our security bookings grew 6% over Q1 2013, and we exited Q2 with a strong backlog in our security business. We are also seeing encouraging growth in our security sales pipeline. Providing color on this, as previously outlined, you can divide the network security business into 3 distinct customer value propositions: securing service provider customers, securing corporate end users within the campus and branch and securing the data center from Internet hackers. The primary usage of network security for service provider customers is enabling high-scale firewalls for mobile users. Juniper has benefited from the growth of LTE networks as the scalability and reliability of our SRX product is ideally suited to this application. During 2013, we have seen this business slow in North America as the large service providers focused their capital spend on other areas, including Edge routing. Moving forward, we expect to see growth opportunities in EMEA, South America and to a lesser extent, in Asia, as these carriers roll out LTE. We have a leadership position in service provider security, and we intend to maintain that as more carriers around the world modernize their mobile networks with high-capacity LTE service. For Campus and Branch, we continue to see the impact of the product transition from our older ScreenOS product line to the current SRX products. Our ScreenOS products continued to decline, but we have seen good year-over-year growth in our branch SRX products. That said, this is the area where our products fell behind in the transition from ScreenOS to the SRX, and we expect recovery in Campus and Branch security will occur over multiple quarters. While we still have work to do, this transition is well underway. In Q2, ScreenOS products accounted for approximately 20% of overall security revenue. For the data center, in Q2, we shipped the highly innovative Spotlight service that works in conjunction with Junos WebApp Secure. Spotlight is the only cloud platform in the world that shares fingerprints of individual attackers' devices. This intelligent service protects our customers by blocking attackers before they have a chance to do damage. The combination of Web AppSecure and Spotlight provide a foundation for differentiation of Juniper's overall data center security products. This strategy is working for us, generating considerable interest from major enterprise customers, including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Interactive Data, who have chosen Juniper to secure their data center environments. In Q2, we also shipped Junos DDoS Secure, a unique application-centric service that provides protection against Distributed Denial of Service attacks. DDoS Secure was chosen by First American Bank to secure and protect their financial systems, and this win further strengthens Juniper's relationship with this important customer. We are seeing strong interest in using our security products to protect enterprise data center. And to further capitalize on this, in Q2 we took steps to restructure and grow our enterprise security sales force. We expect those steps, together with the introduction of new and improved products, to bring stability to our security business in the second half of 2013 and enable a return to growth in 2014. Switching to SDN and our broader software business, we have established a strong industry thought leadership position with our SDN strategy and products. That strategy is resonating with customers, industry analysts and the press as demonstrated by the positive feedback and reviews we perceived, as well as our overall share of voice within the press, which far outstrips what might be expected from a company of Juniper's size. In May, we announced that we had entered beta with our Contrail SDN controller and we pulled in the ship date of this product from 2014 to second half 2013. Pulling in ship date of a new product is an unusual event in this industry, and the progress we've since made with our beta customers further increases our confidence that we will meet our commitment. In terms of those beta customers, they are relatively evenly divided between enterprise and service providers, and include a strong representation of customers in all 3 global geographies. We see several value propositions emerging for SDN across both the enterprise and service providers. Within the data center, as customers implement private and public cloud infrastructures, they must virtualize their network to enable elastic scaling of resources. Enterprises want to build hybrid clouds that connect their private cloud to commercially providing public clouds for disaster recovery and on-demand availability of resources. Service providers seek to improve service creation agility within their Edge network by implementing network function virtualization. All of these capabilities are enabled by our Contrail controller, and with the beta trials that are underway, we have established strong mindshare and experience in this important emerging area. Interestingly, many of these trials bring other Juniper services, such as Firefly, our virtual firewall. While we don't expect to see material SDN revenue in 2013, we are well positioned to benefit from the growth in this area in 2014 and beyond. For our broader software business, we achieved record Q2 bookings, which is reflected in backlog, and this will be recognized over multiple quarters. We expect to see the trend of ratable revenue recognition continue as we move our software licensing to Juniper Software Advantage; the networking industry's only comprehensive software licensing model. Earlier this month, we moved the majority of our MX application software to Juniper Software Advantage, and we anticipate transitioning more of our security products in Q4 of this year. All of these steps, rebuilding our security business, establishing leadership in SDN strategy and products and moving to our new Juniper Software Advantage licensing model are meant to build a foundation for the future. It will take time, but we are on our way. Now let me pass this on to Robyn.
Robyn M. Denholm: Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report that our second quarter results reflect strong revenue and even stronger earnings growth. Revenue exceeded our expectations due to 2 main factors that were roughly of equal size. The first being increased service provider spending momentum and improved enterprise demand, and the second factor was the earlier-than-anticipated recognition of some U.S. federal revenue. Operating income and the EPS both improved significantly, reflecting the leverage in our financial model. Looking at our demand metrics, we had a good bookings quarter, with strength across our customer base, resulting in book-to-bill greater than 1. Product backlog, which you've already seen at healthy levels, increased both sequentially and year-over-year. Product deferred revenue was down modestly quarter-over-quarter. Total revenue was $1,151,000,000, up 9% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. The sequential growth was driven largely by enterprise, whilst the year-over-year growth was balanced between service provider and enterprise. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenue in the quarter. For the second quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.19. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were a strong $0.29, up $0.05 sequentially and $0.10 year-over-year. Now let me provide some color on revenue by region, market and business segment. Americas revenue was up 14% sequentially and 15% year-over-year. Enterprise had a very good quarter, driven by federal and financial services that resulted in double-digit sequential and year-over-year growth. Federal had a good quarter even without the benefit of the deferred revenue recognition. The year-over-year strength in the Americas was due to another quarter of double-digit service provider growth. This growth reflects the improving broad-based demand across cable, content and carriers. EMEA revenue was up 4% sequentially and 1% year-over-year, driven by enterprise strength, while service provider's revenue was flat sequentially. We did see improved demand in Northern Europe and in Germany. APAC revenue was down 1% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. We saw soft demand in enterprise across the region, and Japan continues to be weak. We did see sequential growth in service provider, primarily in China, Taiwan and South Korea. Looking more closely at the markets we address, service provider revenue was $726 million, up 2% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. USSP was strong, especially in cable, content and pockets of strength in EMEA and APAC. Enterprise revenue was $425 million, up 23% sequentially and 8% year-over-year. Sequential growth was driven by federal and financial services in the U.S. and broad-based growth in EMEA. Now let me review our revenue by segment. Platform Systems Division revenue was $916 million, up 13%, both sequentially and year-over-year. Total router product revenue of $578 million was up 12% sequentially and 14% year-over-year. The MX product line had another record revenue quarter, growing 19% sequentially and 43% year-over-year. This reflects continued strong customer acceptance of our Universal Edge offering. In addition, we recognized our first revenue on the recently released MX2020. Total switching product revenue was a record $160 million, up 22% sequentially and 15% year-over-year. In the data center, the newly released EX9200 is off to a good start and QFabric continues to generate momentum. SSD revenue of $235 million was down 6% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. Total security product revenue was $126 million, down 8% sequentially and 20% year-over-year. This area of our business remains challenged. However, as Bob mentioned, we are seeing good customer activity and response to our new initiative with some early signs of the business turning around. In the second quarter, both orders and revenue from new products increased sequentially, and we feel good about our ability to achieve our yearend quarterly run rate of $150 million. Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses, non-GAAP gross margins for the quarter were 63.7% compared to 64.6% last quarter and 63.4% a year ago. Non-GAAP product gross margins were 63.8% and non-GAAP services gross margins were 63.3%. Gross margins for the quarter would have been roughly flat sequentially, except for the negative impact of the Federal-deferred revenue recognition. We are pleased with the progress that we have made in our supply chain and our services cost reduction.  Non-GAAP operating expenses decreased $3 million sequentially and $5 million year-over-year to $515 million. OpEx was at the high end of our guidance, reflecting good progress in cost reduction, partially offset by higher variable compensation and legal expenses. OpEx as a percentage of revenue was 44.8% versus 48.9% last quarter and 48.4% in Q2 of last year. Looking at our headcount, we ended the quarter with 9,513 employees, a sequential increase of 191, primarily in lower cost ranges. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 18.9% compared to 15.7% last quarter and 16% last year. Operating income increased 31% sequentially and 35% year-over-year. This reflects our strong focus on achieving our long-term model by driving operating leverage with good top line growth and OpEx management. The non-GAAP tax rate was 27.4% compared to 19.8% last quarter and 30.7% a year ago. As a reminder, last quarter, the tax rate reflected a onetime benefit of the 2012 R&D tax credit. Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $2.8 billion of net cash and investments. For the quarter, we generated strong operating cash flow of $284 million, in line with our historical pattern. DSO was 40 days in the quarter, down from 45 days last quarter, due primarily to better order and shipment linearity. Capital expenditures were $71 million, down 1% sequentially, while depreciation and amortization was $42 million. We have now largely completed the construction of our Sunnyvale campus and also consolidated some of our labs and office space in our existing Blade facility. We repurchased 6.4 million shares for $106 million. We have $333 million remaining on our current authorization. As announced, the board has approved a new incremental authorization of $1 billion, and we expect to continue calibrating our buyback in future quarters with market conditions. Now I will review our outlook. As a reminder, these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis, except for revenue and share count. Our outlook for the September quarter reflects our expectations of continued good service provider demand in the U.S. and modest improvement in EMEA. We expect routing and switching to remain strong, while the security business begins to stabilize. For the third quarter, we expect revenue to range from $1,140,000,000 to $1,180,000,000. Gross margins are expected to be in the range of 64.5%, plus or minus 0.5%. Operating expenses are expected to be $525 million, plus or minus $5 million. As we have demonstrated, we are focused on driving leverage in our financial model and continue to bring our cost structure in line with our long-term operating model. As an update to our cost reduction activity, we've experienced high labor claims all year, and given the improved demand environment, variable expenses will be higher than we anticipated for the year. We also are making some incremental investments to maximize our top line growth. With that in mind, we now see a net year-over-year OpEx reduction in 2013 of approximately $50 million. We are well ahead of our $50 million cost reduction goal. At the midpoint of guidance, operating margins are expected to be roughly 19.5%. This is expected to result in non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $0.29 and $0.32 per share, assuming a flat share count and a tax rate of 28%. To summarize, we expect the demand environment to continue to improve. We are confident of our product portfolio in routing and switching and improvements in security. We are focused on executing to drive revenue growth, maintain healthy gross margins and manage OpEx to achieve our long-term model. I would like to thank our employees for their continued dedication and commitment to successfully executing our strategy. Now let's open the floor to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ehud Gelblum of Morgan Stanley.
Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I've got a bunch of questions for you, so hope you're ready. Question one is on the switching business. That was the strongest, I think we've ever seen, at $160 million. Can you give us a breakout on -- you said QFabric was strong. How strong was QFabric? Is it still in the order of small numbers or substantial? Kind of just give us a sense as to how big it is. And when you talk about QFabric, is it at the top-of-rack switches or are people buying the directors? And clearly, I assume it's more than minis than the original QFabric. And if you can give us a sense also as to how much of your strength in switching was from data center versus campus LAN, anything you can tell us about WiFi, just breaking out switching. And then on security, when you look at your 2 businesses in security, the carrier side and the enterprise side, Bob mentioned that the carrier SRX was not doing as well this quarter because route -- carriers are focusing more on routing. Does that mean that the 2 are kind of out of sync with each other and you can never get the 2 on the same page? And then finally on enterprise, I'll let someone else take care of that.
Kevin R. Johnson: Ehud, what was your last question on -- was it on enterprise security?
Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: It would have just been how -- is it possible to separate that from the carrier security side and sort of maximize that for cash as opposed to -- run it for cash as opposed to for growth, what you're doing in carrier?
Kevin R. Johnson: Okay, got it. Thanks for your questions. Let me sort of kick off on the first one on the switching business. I think we had a very strong quarter on switching and I think a part of that was the introduction of the EX9200, which replaced our EX8200 switch. And the difference in the EX9200 is the programmability that, that switch enables. And it is a great switch both for data centers and we see some customers even using it for campus because of the programmability. And so I think the product transition from the 8200 to the 9200 was one contributor to the strong performance in switching. And as we noted, QFabric had a record quarter. And we talk about QFabric as the QFabric family of products, which does include the top-of-rack switches, it includes the smaller version of the Interconnect as well as the larger version of the Interconnect. And this is a quarter that we had -- we certainly had continued sales and good performance of top-of-rack, but we also have very good performance of the Interconnects, both the lower end and the higher end. And Rami -- we don't break out the specific numbers, Ehud. But, Rami, do you want to comment more on the switching part of the business?
Rami Rahim: Yes, I'd be happy to. On the question of the particular segments or subsegments of switching, I can tell you, for example, with the EX9200, the early traction that we saw was a very nicely balanced between campus and data center. And it actually fits really nicely with the strategy that we've been executing towards. In fact, what we found is that many of our customers deploy our switches in scenarios where it's a common core that's used for both the data center and the campus. The software that we're introducing for our switches in the form of network director as part of our broader SDN strategy is very much about converging the management of the switching environment across these multiple areas as well. So we were pleased with the performance we've seen certainly this quarter.
Robert L. Muglia: Okay, and thanks for your question. I mean, with regards to the relationship within the SP environment between routing and security, as Kevin has described in a number of times, we see different trends within service providers of areas of capital spending and those change over a period of time. And in the case of security, the area that is most strongly influenced is it follows the RAN, the build-out of the RAN of wireless carriers, as they increase the availability of spec -- and they use their spectrum and increase the ability to move on to newer networks such as LTE, that is where we see security being most closely correlated to. And what we've seen now is in North America, some of the major carriers have largely gone through their LTE build-outs. And so we see opportunities in other geographies around the world. Now the interesting thing here is just that as the capacity increases of the radio network and that is being secured, obviously, there's a need for Edge services and that's a routing thing. And as we've discussed over time, that makes the cores run hotter, and so there's opportunities there. So the correlation is really based on how the carriers are doing their capital allocation.
Kevin R. Johnson: I'll just comment on the last part of your question which was if we just focus on enterprise security and didn't do carrier, would that be a way to run the business for cash, I think was the term, used in your question, Ehud. And the fact is the high-end SRX is the same high-end SRX that we used to secure these LTE networks as we used to secure large data centers. So there may be some slight differences in the features, software features that go -- are used in the high-end SRX, but fundamentally, the incremental R&D required to be in security for the LTE mobile networks is not significant -- significantly different or more from what you would do in data center. So we think it's the best return on investment to invest in that R&D and then be able to monetize that same product in both service provider and enterprise.
Operator: The next question comes from Rod Hall of JPMorgan.
Roderick B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I just had a couple of questions for you. First of all, I wonder -- just kind of housekeeping point, Robyn. Could you give us any quantification on that deferred revenue from federal and let us know if there is anything in guidance for further unwind the deferred revenue there? And then secondly, I just wondered on the security business. I mean it feels like we still saw sequential decline in security revenues but it feels like you've got a grip on that market now a little bit better. I wonder, could you give us some ideas, do you expect that market revenues or that your revenues from security to be flat quarter-on-quarter in Q3 or maybe even up a little bit? Are we still expecting a little bit of decline there? And then lastly, you guys seem more and more optimistic about the routing cycle. I wonder if there's any more color you can give that on that. Are you seeing particular regional movement? Is it mostly in North America, do you see routing traction in Europe? Could you just give us some more on the routing cycle that you see come in the second part of the year?
Robyn M. Denholm: Okay. Thank you, Rod. In terms of the deferred revenue, the way I characterize that, the upside in the quarter for Q2 was half related to earlier-than-anticipated deferred revenue recognition and half from stronger demand from enterprise and service providers. So that's how I characterize it. As you can see from the balance sheet, the deferred revenue is only modestly down quarter-over-quarter, and so you can see that we're adding to the deferred revenue pool, as well as recognizing deferred revenue in the quarter. And the deferred revenue balances are healthy, the backlog is healthy and the bookings were healthy in the quarter. So our view is that in terms of the underlying strength of the business, even if you take out the deferred revenue recognition item, it was healthy. And so on the security side, I'll let Bob answer that question.
Robert L. Muglia: Yes, Rod. In terms of security and the expectations for the rest of the year, as we said we expect the security business to stabilize in the second half of this year with a return to growth next year. In terms of whether it will be flat or up or what over the next quarter, the variability here is perhaps associated with the split between the decline that we've had in the enterprise and the service provider. Q2 was just like Q1 in the sense that the decline was structured as 2/3 of service provider and 1/3 enterprise. And we have seen some good traction on the enterprise side. In the service provider, which, just the very nature of that business is fairly lumpy. So it's difficult for me to predict on a quarter-to-quarter basis exactly what we'll see, but overall, we do expect stability going forward for the rest of this year.
Robyn M. Denholm: And then routing, Rami, would you like to comment?
Rami Rahim: Yes, I'd be happy to. So just to provide a little bit of color, certainly, we've been saying for the last quarter or 2 that the majority of the drivers on routing have been in the Edge. That continues to remain true throughout Q2. And you have to understand that the drivers for investment in the Edge are just more diversified than that in the core. So people invest in the Edge provide new services, to keep up with capacity, to provide connectivity to various different types of customers. So we had a very good Q2 in terms of the Edge routing. From a geo standpoint, North America is definitely sort of a strong area for us, but we are continuing to see good signs in parts of Europe, both from a standpoint of just the market in general, but also in terms of the design wins that we have gotten over the last several quarter that we are now executing towards delivering for our customers. And then just from a segment standpoint, we saw a good balance of investment in routing, both in our cable operators, our content providers, our Web 2.0 and actually also our telco -- traditional telco. So cable operators are dealing with an influx of video traffic that they need to support, telcos, with the sort of trends of convergence and delivering on new services and content providers for data center interconnect, for peering and that sort of activity. So really nice balance of business across a large segment of our customers.
Operator: The next question is from Tal Liani of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Eric A. Ghernati - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: This is Eric Ghernati for Tal. Just a quick question on the enterprise again. I guess the strength came from federal financials with federal being due to deferred revenue recognition. These 2 verticals, if I recall, were excessively weak last quarter. I guess how should we think about the sustainability in the second half? Will these 2 verticals stay strong or will they -- other verticals or geos will strengthen? And then just, if I recall correctly, AT&T and Verizon were 10% customers. You said that you had no 10% customers. I assume that affected some degree core routing business, but you voiced your confidence that core routers would rebound in the second half. Are you seeing that in your bookings? What are your customers showing you, specifically the U.S. large telcos?
Kevin R. Johnson: Thanks, Tal. So the first question you had was on enterprise. And we posted an 8% growth in enterprise. Certainly, as Robyn mentioned, I think our product deferred revenue was down a net of $9 million sequentially. So certainly, there was some benefit to the U.S. enterprise business from the recognition of that deferred revenue in federal. But even net of that deferred revenue that was recognized in federal, we still saw improving -- improvements in the performance of federal. And so things seem to be stabilizing a bit more and actually getting on more of an approved footing in federal. And we expect that to continue into the second half. EMEA posted a good growth rate in enterprise as well, and the place that I think we're underperforming a bit is in Asia. And I think we've certainly seen some challenges in certain countries like China and certainly some others, but I think we have opportunity to improve our execution in Asia a bit. But I think we saw a good, strong enterprise performance in the Americas and EMEA. And certainly, I think the fact that switching was up 15% was a part of contributing to that enterprise performance. On the second question related to core routing, I commented that part of the analysis we do is we look at the total addressable market spend against core and Edge relative to the traffic growth that we're seeing on the networks. And from that, we can start to deduce how much of that was replacement equipment versus new capacity. And what we're seeing now on the Edge is it's now building out new capacity to handle what was networks that were running hotter and hotter. And we think that, that trend is going to continue for several quarters. We have seen the core of the network in our analysis has been running hotter and hotter, and we're just now starting to see the signs that investment will, in addition to being on the Edge, will start to kick in for the core. And we expect to see that start to unfold later this year. Rami, I'll let you comment further on the core routing side.
Rami Rahim: Sure, the drivers for core are really all around capacity. So customers will tend to defer that for us long as they can for they absolutely need to investment, and we've certainly seen some of that. I'll just add that, in addition to what Kevin said, I'll just add that I think that the strategy that we have been outlining, which is around the diversity of our products in addressing different types of core challenges, whether it be the T Series as a very seamless upgrade path to an existing Q Series network or the MX, especially now with the MX2020 and a denser line card or the PTX, where we've just introduced the PTX3000 -- or we've announced the PTX3000 to be shipped in the second half of the year is resonating with our customers. And as Kevin said, we are seeing early traction that this strategy is right in terms of what our customers require.
Operator: The next question is from Bill Choi of Janney Montgomery Scott.
William H. Choi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: First, on the clarification part here. Did I understand here, after the deferred rev recognition on fed, you're still looking for a sequential improvement into the second half, meaning that you will benefit from the potential fed budget flush specifically in the September quarter? And then secondly, I want to understand this reinvestment in OpEx for growth opportunity to, I guess, just 6 months ago, you guys were trying to cut cost; now you see some opportunities for additional growth. And I just want to understand where that's coming from. I mean, part of this improving demand certainly is that you already had the footprint, already had the relationships of those customers come back to spend. Those don't require incremental OpEx investment to capitalize. Is there a lot more opportunities that you're seeing in this current environment for new footprint growth and new projects that require investments? I'm sorry, and then how long will it take to get before you get some of the revenue momentum from the increment investment?
Robyn M. Denholm: Thanks, Bill. I think that last bit didn't make the buzzer, but anyway, in terms of the first part of the question, let me just clarify. What Kevin was talking about was in the second quarter, absent the federal revenue recognition items that we talked about, if you took that out of the numbers, we would have still been up in federal in the second quarter. And we are expecting a continuation of that trend. In other words, sequential increase in terms of what we saw between Q1 and Q2 on the base demand as continuing for the second half. So, and I might add that we also saw good financial services improvements in the second quarter as well. And Kevin also mentioned EMEA enterprise was stronger in the second quarter. So I think that in terms of that underlying business trend, we see enterprise demand strengthening. In terms of the investments, what I talked about in terms of OpEx, so for the full year, we will be down year-over-year $50 million in terms of operating expenses, 2013 over 2012. We have been very focused on continuing to drive cost reductions across the board, and we are still driving those. Having said that, I have reduced the total year-over-year decline from roughly $100 million to $50 million, and there are 2 major factors in that. The first is the continuation of the legal and variable expense increases that we've seen versus our expectations at the beginning of the year. And then the second is some modest investments that we are making in the second half to capture both the near-term and the longer-term revenue opportunities that we see. And so we think that's a very prudent thing to do from a company perspective to continue that revenue momentum as we go forward. Having said that, our OpEx as a percentage of revenue has come down dramatically from last year, and we're continuing to focus on that in line with our long-term model that we put out there this time last year. And I'll remind you that our long-term model for OpEx as a percentage of revenue is somewhere between 39% and 42% of revenue. We still have some ways to go to get to 42% being the upper end of that range, but we do expect to exit this year close to that upper end of the OpEx as a percentage of revenue range.
Operator: The next question is from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: So your service provider business in aggregate was up 2% sequentially, which was about $13 million. And I think you commented that MX Edge routing was up 19% sequentially, which is probably more than $50 million. So it seems like some of the other categories within service provider were down sequentially and I just wanted to see if you can provide some detail of how that will split between core routing and SRX within the service provider vertical, and specifically if core routing declined. And since I know you've commented on networks getting hotter in the core for the last 3 quarters, just wanted to get some specificity there on either bookings or backlog or any kind of customer activity that would suggest that, that is likely to improve.
Robyn M. Denholm: So I'll start the answer to that question, Simona, and then I'll hand it over to Rami to talk about some of the trends. So in terms of our SP business, it was up 2% sequentially, nicely up year-over-year. In terms of the trends there, yes, MX was up. As you know, we have some older Edge router products that have been declining and they continued to decline in the second quarter. The core revenue was down sequentially, but the bookings was strong in terms of core. And as Bob mentioned in the security area, that was -- the SRX was also down sequentially in terms of the security product into SP. And so in terms of the overall trends, Rami can focus on that as well.
Rami Rahim: Yes, not much more to add. I'll just say that on the Edge, certainly the MX had been very strong and the -- a component of the universal Edge strategy that we are executing towards actually involve that other Edge product -- or some of the older products that we were working on in the past will decline. So that's completely anticipated. As far as Edge versus core, I think we've outlined what we're seeing in terms of the drivers in the industry, and these are things that play out over multiple quarters. I don't anticipate any major changes any time soon. That said, we did say that we're starting to see early signs that the core investment cycle might be starting and bookings is one metric that we're using as a reflection of that.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And Rami, just as a follow-up to that, are there opportunities when you think you might be selling a PTX or an MX or MX2020 in place of what would have been a T4000 opportunity? And if that's the case, is that $0.50 or $0.80 on the dollar? And then along the same vein, with the new routers and core from Cisco and Alcatel, what is your early take on how that is impacting the marketplace, either from a market share or a pricing perspective?
Rami Rahim: Yes, to your first question, I mean, the way I look at this is we have a tool bag full of tools that are disposable, that we can leverage when we have the conversation and we go after an opportunity with our customers. So any core opportunity starts with a conversation between ourselves and our customers, trying to understand their business challenges, what they're trying to achieve. And then we can go, based on that understanding, reach into our bag to determine whether we're going to be satisfying their requirements with the T Series or an MX or a PTX. And that is a very positive thing because, quite frankly, our competitors don't necessarily have all of those options available for them. So that diversity of offering that we have, the strategy that we're executing towards I think is really a powerful one. The second question that you asked is around...
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Alcatel and Cisco.
Rami Rahim: Yes, competitive situation. I'll say sort of what I said in the last earnings call, which is that I'm not going to underestimate any of my competitors, Cisco or Alcatel. Certainly, Alcatel is trying to get into the core space. But that said, I have great confidence in the strategy that we're executing towards. I think the success that we've seen with the early products, for example, with the PTX as a very dense next-generation transport device that really our competitors do not have. The new multi-chassis offering that we just introduced for the T Series -- T4000, I should say, the early traction there, again, give me very good confidence. So we won't underestimate our competitors, but I think that the strategy that we're executing towards is a winning one.
Operator: The next question is from Kevin Dennean of Citi.
Kevin J. Dennean - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just going back to expectations for core routing, it's been asked a few different ways, you're obviously sounding more confident on the outlook. Rami or Kevin, I'm just wondering if you could talk about the expected duration of the core routing cycle. Is there any reason to believe that this is more than just a couple of quarter pickup, or is this going to be something more durable along the lines of a multi-year cycle?
Kevin R. Johnson: Yes, I guess I'll start, and then I'll let Rami complement with additional comments. In our analysis, it's been several quarters that core and Edge routing had been running hotter, and that's partly why the addressable market for routing declined 3 percentage points in 2012. It wasn't just a 1 quarter networks were running hotter, it was several quarters. And that really started mid-2011. So there was probably a 6-quarter period where, in our observation, core and Edge networks were running hotter. We started to see the pickup on Edge network investment in Q3 of last year. We saw the signs of it, and we talked about that and that led to the results that we delivered in Q4 and what we're seeing today. And we think that as Rami pointed out, the Edge investments go beyond just incremental capacity. It goes to enable new services and other things that our customers are trying to do. And so we believe that Edge cycle is going to continue for quite some time. And what we're now seeing is early signs that the core investment cycle is going to pick up, and that's got to pick up just to address capacity issues. As you build out more Edge, it's following more traffic in the core. And certainly things where a customer will build a metro packet core, basically a core within a metropolitan area to keep traffic within that area, we see projects in those areas that will, in some ways, they'd put in a core router in that metro -- in that metropolitan area. So the net is, I think the core -- the signs we're seeing will lead to increased CapEx on the core. You cannot exactly predict when it's going to occur, but the early signs based on what we're seeing in bookings in our discussions with customers on projects tell us that it's coming soon. And I would suspect it too will be multi-quarter, multi-year process as they build out for what would be 1.5 years to 2 years of running those networks hotter. It's going to take some capacity to catch up with it. Rami, I don't know if you have anything else to add or...
Rami Rahim: Not much more. It's very difficult to predict the timing and the duration of the timing. I think the thing that's in our control is to just make sure that we are best equipped to capture the opportunity when it comes about. That's exactly what I'm focused on, that's what my team is focused on. And I think things that we are going to be prepared, whether it's a solution to converge packet off, because I think we have a fantastic one, or a migration to it in a T Series capacity, I think we've got a great story there as well. So I think that's the thing that we're focused on right now.
Kevin J. Dennean - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: But Rami, just a follow-up, is there anything that you see structurally different in network architectures that would point towards a shorter cycle in core routing versus what we've seen historically?
Rami Rahim: One can always have an architectural discussion around capacity in the metro versus capacity in the core. And things could evolve over time. But I'd say, at this point, no. There's nothing that points to a radical change in the architecture that is going to change the balance of metro versus core. It might be the case that you'll see some of that happening in some customers and others, but there's no sort of obvious trend that I'd say at this point.
Operator: The next question is from Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer.
Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: I wanted to ask about going back to this CapEx routing cycle. In the past, you used to estimate the roughly the seasonal spending pattern as 45% in the first half of the year and 55% in the second. Is this something you subscribe to this year? And if this routing cycle does happen, is anything in that pattern going to be different from your standpoint?
Kevin R. Johnson: Well, I think the routing cycle is happening, and it's more focused on Edge and the core will kick in. And I think in 2013, we expect sort of typical seasonal patterns on routing CapEx. So we expect to see an uptick in the second half.
Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay. And lastly, regarding the switching business, good results on numbers there. I guess the question is on the EX9200, when you look at the 82 and the 92 together, was there growth in that business or most of that business was really a replacement factor of the 82? And second, regarding your QFabric business, it's been, although the mini is relatively new, the portfolio itself is a little bit longer in the tooth here and with Cisco introducing a lot of new products just a month ago, when do -- when would be the right time to think about an upgrade of your high-end data center switching portfolio?
Rami Rahim: Yes, so we're pleased with our switching performance in Q2 overall. Certainly, as we introduce a new product like the EX9200, the transition is a very important thing for us to think about as we get our customer sort of thinking about what's the right product for them. We're pleased with the way that, that transition had been rolling out, especially in the Q2 timeframe. And then the 9200 in and of itself is a very programmable device that's really ready for at the end. That message is really resonating with our customers. So I'm optimistic about the growth potential of that platform. And then on the QFabric, the QFabric remains -- I mean there are many that are talking about fabrics today, but the QFabric remains the single true converged fabric architecture for the data center, that provides us with thought leadership, it opens up doors for us all the time with our customers and again, the introduction of some of the smaller versions of the QFabric and the new features have provided us with some nice momentum. And last I'll say about -- when we think about the upgrade and we're always, at Juniper, thinking about next-generation upgrades and roadmaps in technology and so it's all the time.
Operator: The next question is from Mark Sue of RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Kevin, I hope we didn't wear you out over the past 5 years.
Kevin R. Johnson: No, no, not at all, Mark.
Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. So my question is at the peak of your historic routing cycles, I've seen over the last 15, 20 years, the revenue growth can exceed 20% and then at the bottom of the cycle, the revenues can actually be flat to slightly negative. So with that in mind, as we go forward, I mean there are things Juniper can do differently to kind of manage the business because it is cyclical, manage just kind of the mix and the cash flow of the margins. And then a question for you Bob. In security, I've been you've been -- Juniper has been trying to stabilize the business for some time. You have $2.8 billion in cash, which incidentally is the check that Cisco wrote this morning to acquire Sourcefire. So with that in mind, how do you accelerate change for the security division with the limited resources? And is the stability in the business worth all the investments that you're making or is it better to kind of reallocate those resources and refocus on wireless, core routers or PTX, which is your traditional areas of strength.
Robyn M. Denholm: Okay, so I think Kevin will start on the third question, and then I can add on that, and then we'll hand it over to Bob.
Kevin R. Johnson: Yes, in terms of -- Mark, in terms of your question of managing the mix, one of the strategies that we think helps us do that is customer diversification. So even within service providers, the fact that we focus on not only just carriers, which is our traditional customer base of wireline and wireless, but also cable and content providers, that helps us manage the mix. And then the fact that we've got strong enterprise business as well that has a wider base of customers and industry verticals. So if one industry vertical is maybe in a down cycle, there's another one that's in an up cycle. So that diversification of customers across service provider and enterprise is really a core part of our strategy to diversify that mix. Likewise then, focusing on 3 products or 3 business areas, routing, switching and security, is also a key part of what we do to try and manage that mix. And certainly, when you see cycles where we have good performance in 2 of those business areas and maybe weaker performance in a third, that helps balance things out. Certainly the challenge is when you run R&D and the type of projects that Bob and Rami oversee, many of those are certainly multi-quarter, but in many cases, multi-year projects. When we take decisions in terms of silicon roadmaps and major systems roadmaps and things we're doing, those become a longer cycle. And so the investment that you have to make has to endure both times when revenue is up and revenue is down. But at the core of it, we try and diversify the customer base, both in service provider and enterprise, to ensure that we don't have as much, I guess, variability in the overall op margins or profitability of the company.
Robyn M. Denholm: Yes, and I would also add, obviously, over this last cycle, we have not only learned a lot, but also ensured that we've taken the right actions from a cost perspective and made sure that we're continuing to focus on that side through even a spending cycle that we say with the service providers and also improved demand on the enterprise side, as well. So on the security side, would you want to comment, Rob?
Robert L. Muglia: Sure, I'll make a couple of comments, Mark. Thanks for your question. On the security side, we talked about accelerating change and when I think about that, first, we've been very open for some number of quarters that would have some challenges in our security business, in particular, the challenges as we executed the transition from the NetScreen product line to screen -- over to the SRX and some of the issues we've had with enterprise. When I think about accelerating changes, I sort of divide that into 3 sections. There's the side of organic things we can do inside our R&D organization, there's some inorganic things that one might do and then there's the go-to-market side. And we're really focused, at some level, on all 3. Most of our change over the last 18 months has been on our organic R&D where we've made major changes in our management team, in our engineering team and have really, really reinvigorated the work we're doing there. We are attracting talent and are continuing to attract talent in the security business, including in the last quarter where we've added some great new talent that we think will pay dividend in the long run. On the inorganic side, we haven't done anything at the $2.8 billion level and we don't really anticipate anything like that. But we have done some very strategic tuck-in acquisitions that have helped us to move into some new business areas and you saw that with Mykonos, you saw that with the work that we've done on DDoS Secure. We think those will pay dividends in the long run. And as I mentioned in my prepared scripts, we're doing some things in terms of our go-to-market efforts on the enterprise and in security to really help accelerate our ability to move forward in that business, so there's changes we're making there. In terms of your comments about is it worth it, we pretty strongly believe the answer to that is, yes, and I'll give you a couple of reasons for that. One is that when we look at the growth of sorts of businesses that are growing security, overall, we believe will continue to be a growing business in the years to come. When we see the challenges that our customers are facing with hackers attacking their data center environment and stealing their intellectual property, those threats are going to continue to increase, so the sophistication of the ability to defend against that is also going to increase, and we believe we're very well positioned to actually capitalize on that and actually have a leadership position there within WebApp Secure and Spotlight. The other thing I'll point out is just that we see great complements with our security business and our networking business. That's true in the systems side. It is also true as we move in the software side with SDN. And as I mentioned, quite a few of our trials of the SDN work we're doing brings together both our networking side as well as our security side, and we think that better positions us competitively in the market.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thank you. That is all the time we have today. We'd like to thank everyone for your great questions and for your participation on today's call. Thank you. Bye, bye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Juniper Networks First Quarter 2013 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Kathleen Nemeth, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Nemeth, you may begin.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Here on the call are: Kevin Johnson, Chief Executive Officer; Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial Officer; and Rami Rahim, Executive Vice President, Platform Systems Division. In addition, Bob Muglia, Executive Vice President, Software Solutions division, is on the call and will be available for Q&A. Before we continue, I would like to highlight changes to our reporting segments, which are reflected in today's press release. Juniper made changes to better align our business segment reporting to our current organizational structure. Security products previously reported in our Platform Systems Division, PSD segment, are now reported in our Software Solutions Division, SSD segment. Juniper believes this change will provide investors with increased financial reporting transparency and will enable better insight into the trends driving our business. A summary showing PSD and SSD quarterly revenues on a basis consistent with the new reporting structure is included in Appendix 1 of today's press release. Please remember when listening to today's call that statements concerning Juniper's business outlook, economic and market outlook, strategy, future financial operating results and overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including economic condition, generally or within the networking industry; changes in overall technology spending and spending by communication service providers and major customers; the network capacity requirements of service providers; the timing of orders and shipments; manufacturing and supply chain constraints; variation in the mix of products sold, customer perception and acceptance of our products; rapid technological and market change; litigation and other factors listed in our most recent 10-K filed with the SEC. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances change after the date of this call. In discussing the financial results, Robyn will first present results on a GAAP basis and, for the purposes of today's discussion, we'll also review non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why the management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult the press release furnished with our 8-K filed with the SEC today. For a detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results, please see the Investor Relations section of our website. In general, non-GAAP results exclude certain nonrecurring charges, amortization of purchased intangibles and other acquisition charges and expenses related to stock-based compensation. On today's call, Robyn will also be providing forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis other than that with respect to revenue and share count. All guidance is forward-looking, and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier. GAAP guidance measures are not available on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to certain charges, which are excluded from the non-GAAP guidance estimate. Please note that today's call is scheduled to last for 1 hour, and please limit your questions to one per firm. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin.
Kevin R. Johnson: Thanks, Kathleen, and welcome, everyone. Our results for the first quarter are in line with the guidance we shared with you on our January conference call. We are off to a good start to 2013, with strength in key markets and some signs of improving demand trends. To be sure, there are headwinds in certain areas of our business, but overall, we executed well against the priorities we outlined last quarter. I'll review the performance of our 2 market segments. Service provider was a good story for us in Q1, with our third consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Sequential results reflected anticipated first quarter seasonality. The U.S. market for routing continues to strengthen as we anticipated, while Verizon and AT&T were 10% customers for us in the quarter, and we continue to see good demand trends with Tier 1 service providers and other verticals, like content providers and cable. APAC and EMEA were weaker in the quarter, though we are seeing signs of modest improvement in demand in service providers in Europe. Enterprise is a more challenging market at present, with flat year-on-year performance. A lot of the challenge stems from weak public sector spending, in particular U.S. federal, along with softness in financial services. We have communicated steadily over the last several quarters about expected weakness in federal. We do not expect this pattern to improve in the near term. While the Enterprise market has seen challenges across several verticals in recent periods, we are committed to continue investment across our businesses of routing, switching and security, and we are confident in our products and our roadmap. I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing 3 specific areas of focus at Juniper: Service Provider routing, data center and security. Routing was a highlight in the quarter, with particular strength in U.S. carrier. The content and cable segments of U.S. Service Provider also showed good momentum. We are seeing continued signs that Service Provider CapEx is improving at a time when our portfolio of new routing products are being well-received by our customers. We continue to expand our reach in edge routing, and we are seeing good customer engagement in the core. We are building on our heritage in Service Provider innovation, delivering the most complete and differentiated portfolio in our history, most recently with the release of the MX2020. Data center. Our Switching business also performed well in the quarter. We continue to be confident in our opportunity, notwithstanding current macro challenges, particularly as we see the QFabric family of products gaining more traction. We're also introducing new products in our EX line, including the EX9200 launched earlier this month. The EX9200 is the industry's most advanced programmable core switch and will support future software-defined networking protocols in emerging applications, both in data center, as well as campus and branch environments. Security. Despite disappointing results in Security in Q1, we believe we are taking the right steps to improve the business. We recently released Security Director, which is being well-received by customers. In addition, there are 3 pillars to our security strategy. In Service Provider, it's about leveraging and extending what we believe is a strong position. We continue to scale the high-end SRX to handle a large number of concurrent sessions, which differentiates us in the Service Provider LTE deployments. In the data center, we just announced a refresh of features, including a new capability called Spotlight. We believe this provides us unique differentiation in the data center. We have strong engagements, and we are focused on turning those into customer wins. In Campus and Branch, we still have work to do, but we have a focused strategy for building an increasingly robust product in feature portfolio and regaining share. Wrapping up, we had a solid start to the year. Execution is improving and that shows in the results. We retain our strong conviction in our opportunity. We believe Juniper is well-positioned to address a very good long-term growth market. Near term, we are confident in our ability to return to growth in Service Provider and strengthen our Enterprise business. Our new products continue to gain traction, and we are committed to investing in innovation with a more robust portfolio that can be leveraged across both Service Provider and Enterprise markets. Overall, we are staying true to our 2013 operating principles and are focused on delivering great products, maintaining our focus on operational execution and managing costs carefully. The underlying trends driving network investment remain strong, and I'm confident of Juniper's position for future success. I'll turn it over now to Rami to discuss highlights from our Platform Systems Division. Rami?
Rami Rahim: Thanks, Kevin. It's a pleasure to join the earnings call this quarter. I took over as EVP/GM of the Platform Systems Division, PSD, in November of 2012. I'm responsible for driving strategy, development and business growth for Juniper's portfolio of routing, switching and wireless LAN products, as well as for the ongoing evolution of our silicon technology and the Junos operating system. Overall, I'm pleased with PSD's results in Q1 2013. Kevin covered the results at a high level, so what I'd like to do is walk through some of the drivers behind the quarter's results and put them in context. Our 5 key focus areas when it comes to our platforms are: core, Universal Edge and Universal Access on the Service Provider side; the campus on the Enterprise side; and the virtualized data center, which spans both Service Provider and Enterprise. In the Service Provider business, growth was driven by the business edge and broadband edge segment, where we're seeing wins around the world with large service providers driving broadband deployment. We also recently introduced the MX2020 in a 2 x 100 gb line cards, which we expect to begin ramping as we head through the year. While the overall market for the core declined during 2012, we have seen a solid ramp-up of the PTX product family and the recent introduction of T4000 multichassis in the segment. In the core, Juniper has always been a leader in performance. Today, we have a three-pronged innovation strategy to go after the market that plays out to our strength and gives us a unique opportunity to win. With the PTX, we've defined a new product category, which is a packet-oriented transport device that moves packets through the network more efficiently than any other system in the world. As an example of PTX's capability, consider that it has approximately 4x the power efficiency of its nearest competitor. In keeping with our goal to drive the benefits of the converged supercore to the broadest set of customers, last month, we introduced the PTX3000, which is well suited for smaller core than metro core because of its form factor. It's less than a foot deep. It fits in environments and locations where a traditional core router would not. It provides transport level resiliency and performance, an important first step towards full-packet optical conversion. Market recognition and customer feedback has been very enthusiastic, and we're on track to ship in the second half of this year. The second important element of our core strategy consists of the T series, which remains the best investment protection story in the industry. This platform started shipping a decade ago, but still has very high-density line cards today, roughly twice the density of our primary core competitor. And as I mentioned, the recent introduction of the T4000 multichassis product only strengthens this platform's value proposition. And the last weapon in our core arsenal is the MX. With the MX, we have the ability to introduce a core product that's very service-rich, and in so doing, we've blurred the lines between the traditional edge of the network and the traditional core layer of the network and provided a product that extends services through software deeper into the network. The MX continued to show strength in the year-over-year revenue growth. And with the MX2020 and high-performance line cards now shipping, I expect that, that momentum will continue. So I think the combination of these 3 core technologies really gives us the ability to set the agenda and go after a broader core market opportunity. In the Edge, I believe that we have a significantly differentiated Universal Edge platform. We've got significant traction in the business edge services, great traction in residential edge services and deployed mobile net software that's moving 4G packets in live networks today. The diversity of applications in use cases has and continues to be one of the biggest selling points of the MX product family. In fact, we are now seeing more operators leveraging the MX Universal Edge to converge their Edge network by running multiple services simultaneously. As an example, we're working with a Tier 1 operator to converge residential services, business services, aggregation and video delivery services onto a single MX network. The third area is in the access, which is a really important area and an opportunity for growth for Juniper. Our goal is quite simple: to extend the success that we've seen in the Universal Edge by pushing that concept into the access. Leading operators who have built access networks optimized for 3G and voice have recognized that 4G essentially changes everything, and a new approach to building their access network is fundamentally required. Juniper has built a cost-effective access product that provides the capacity that's necessary to converge business, residential and mobile services onto a common access infrastructure. With the ACX family that we introduced last year, we offered a system that provides leading price performance, market-leading timing technology and also some really interesting environmental hardening characteristics. In Q1 2013, we started shipping the ACX4000, which is optimized to enhance the mobile subscriber experience while significantly improving network monetization for service providers. Another area that I want to touch on is the data center, and this is really another very interesting area for us. SDN is all about introducing agility into the network to keep pace with the rate of change in the compute world. We recognized these trends early when we introduced fabric technologies like QFabric. We are seeing that the adoption of -- for QFabric has started to go up because customers are recognizing the values and because we've introduced a new version of the QFabric catering smaller data centers and data center pods. Gartner recently recognized our innovation by positioning Juniper as a visionary in their data center network infrastructure Magic Quadrant in February 2013. We are doing well in the campus where we saw good year-over-year wireless LAN growth, especially in Asia Pacific where we had our largest wireless LAN win ever. We continue to build our Enterprise portfolio with the launch of the EX9200 Programmable Switch shipping now. The new EX9200 is the industry's most programmable core switch, which offers the flexibility required to support current and future protocols, emerging applications and is optimized for both campus and data center environments. We also announced the JunosV wireless LAN controller, which is delivered as software within a virtual machine offering the same functionality as the appliance-based hardware wireless LAN controllers, contributing to a unified redundant platform and location-agnostic wireless control plan for the end-to-end Enterprise. And we announced Junos Space Network Director, a network management application that provides unified manageability for the campus, fixed and wireless. And we plan to extend that to data center later this year. So with all that said, I summarize as follows: we are not confused by the fact that innovation in this area depends on our ability to really move the needle in our silicon technology, our systems and in our software. All 3 are fundamental to managing the types of traffic, capacity increases and service increases that our customers need. I think we're well-positioned in the edge and core with our portfolio today. I think that we have an ability to really grow and expand our Universal Edge leadership position into the access layer, and finally, I do believe that we've got some great building blocks both on the Platform side and the Software side to build a truly compelling virtualized data center solution and continue our progress in the campus. Customer feedback around our solutions and especially recent innovations has been very positive. Many of our new products are in active customer engagements across all geographies resulting in trial, design wins and live deployment. The innovations we are bringing to market are designed in collaboration with our customers and in response to their needs. And as with any new architecture, implementation is a multistage process. Again, we are pleased with the progress that we are seeing and how we're delivering against our innovation agenda. At this point, I'm going to turn over to Robyn. Thank you very much.
Robyn M. Denholm: Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations and reflected our continued focus on disciplined operational execution. We saw broad strength in U.S. Service Provider this quarter. As anticipated, our Enterprise business showed a typical first quarter decline with additional expected weakness in federal. Our improved earnings reflect good revenue performance and cost reduction progress. Looking at our demand metrics for the quarter, book-to-bill was below 1, which is typical in the first quarter. Product backlog and product deferred revenue both increased year-over-year and are at healthy levels. And as a reminder, deferred product revenue can fluctuate based on the recognition and timing of specific project deployment. Total revenue was $1,059,000,000, down 7% sequentially and up 3% year-over-year. Overall, the sequential decline was in line with historical patterns. Sequentially and year-over-year, we saw strong performance in the Americas Service Provider sector. In the first quarter, both AT&T and Verizon each accounted for 10% of Juniper's total revenue, reflecting the momentum that we are seeing with U.S. service providers. These customers continue to be strategic to Juniper, deploying our routing, switching and security products across both the wired and wireless networks. For the first quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.18. This includes the $0.05 benefit related to a tax settlement, $0.03 for the renewal of the R&D tax credit and a $0.02 litigation charge, as well as a $0.01 restructuring charge associated with our ongoing productivity and efficiency action. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.24, down $0.04 sequentially and up $0.08 year-over-year. The year-over-year increase in EPS was due to a substantial improvement in operating margin, fueled by a combination of modest revenue growth, stronger gross margins and lower operating expenses. Now let me provide some color on revenue by region, market and business segments. Americas revenue was down 2% sequentially and up 11% year-over-year. We saw continued broad-based strength in the U.S. carriers, cable and content providers, which increased 1% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. Enterprise was down year-over-year by 2%, with the majority as the result of U.S. federal decline. Excluding federal, the rest of Enterprise increased 5% compared to the third quarter of last year. EMEA revenue was down 14% sequentially and 5% year-over-year. The sequential decline was primarily driven by lower Enterprise revenue. On a year-over-year basis, the decline was a result of Eastern Europe. Excluding this region, the rest of EMEA increased. We saw early indications of improving demand among some service providers across the region. APAC revenue was down 10% sequentially and 9% year-over-year. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to slower spending by certain large carriers in Japan and Australia, partially offset by gains with regional service providers across the theater.  Looking more closely at the markets we address, Service Provider revenue was $713 million, down 4% sequentially. Revenue was up 4% on a year-over-year basis, by increased U.S. Service Provider demand. Enterprise revenue was $346 million, down 14% sequentially and flat year-over-year, with a 25% decline in U.S. federal versus the first quarter of 2012. Now let me review our revenue by segment. Platform Systems Division revenue was $809 million, down 7% sequentially and up 6% year-over-year. Total router product revenue was down 4% sequentially to $514 million. We saw a good sequential increase in core routing and edge routing continues to be strong. Routing increased by 7% year-over-year, and we saw continued momentum from MX and PTX. As I noted last quarter, we will continue to closely manage our supply chain in response to increasing Service Provider edge routing demand. Total switching product revenue was $132 million, down 10% sequentially and up 6% year-over-year. The sequential change reflects good content Service Provider growth offset by a seasonal Enterprise decline. The year-over-year increase is primarily due to growth in the QFabric product family. SSD revenue in the first quarter was $250 million, down 9% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. Total security product revenue was $137 million, down 19% both sequentially and year-over-year. Of the $32 million year-over-year decline, $20 million was due to fluctuations in the timing of service provider deployment. Enterprise security decreased $12 million as the ScreenOS product declined more rapidly than the growth of SRX. We remain focused on stabilizing our Enterprise security share in 2013. We continue to see positive momentum with our new products and are on track toward achieving our goal of $150 million in revenues from new products in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter, revenue from these products were over $85 million. In order of magnitude, P4000, PTX and QFabric provided the bulk of the revenue. Also, we are seeing good customer interest in our ACX Universal backhaul products. Moving on to gross margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was 64.6% compared to 65.3% last quarter, reflecting the lower volume. The 2-percentage-point improvement year-over-year demonstrates the progress we've made on supply chain cost reduction, as well as greater efficiency in our delivery of services and customer support. Non-GAAP product gross margins were 65.5% and non-GAAP services gross margins were 62.1%. Non-GAAP operating expenses decreased $19 million or 4% sequentially and 1% year-over-year to $518 million. The OpEx declined as a result of the progress we've made in aligning our cost structure to our focused priority. Looking at headcount, we ended the quarter with 9,322 employees, a sequential increase of 88 as we continue to balance our geographic personnel mix to optimize our cost structure. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 15.7%. This reflects a substantial year-over-year improvement in financial metrics, including a 3% growth in revenue, a 2% expansion of our total gross margin and a 1% decrease in operating expenses. I'm pleased with our progress this quarter towards our long-term financial model. Turning to an explanation of our taxes this quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 19.8%, down 7 points versus the prior quarter due primarily to the $15 million one-time benefit of the 2012 R&D tax credit and the current effects of the 2013 R&D tax credit. The GAAP tax rate was a negative 18.3% for the quarter, primarily as a result of a tax settlement with the IRS. Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $2.7 billion of net cash and investments. For the quarter, we saw a net cash outflow from operations of $9 million due mainly to a sequential increase in the cash receivables, lower net income, annual payments for incentive compensation and the timing of payments to our supply chain. In Q2, we expect to return to our historical pattern of strong positive cash flow. DSO was at the high end of our historical range at 45 days in the quarter, up from 35 days last quarter due primarily to shipment linearity. Capital expenditures were $72 million, down 22% from the fourth quarter as we near the completion of our Sunnyvale campus. We repurchased 6.2 million shares for $130 million. We have $438 million remaining on our current authorization and expect to calibrate our buybacks in future quarters with market conditions. Now I will review our outlook. As a reminder, these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis, except for revenue and share count. Our outlook for the June quarter reflects our expectation of continued weakness in the Enterprise customer spending environment. In Service Provider, we expect to see a continuation of U.S. Service Provider capital spending and some modest improvement in demand emerging in EMEA. Our new products continue to build momentum, especially in routing, and we remain focused on disciplined operational execution while driving revenue growth. For the second quarter, we expect revenues to range from $1,070,000,000 to $1,100,000,000. Gross margins are expected to be in the range of 64% to 65%. Operating expenses are expected to be $510 million, plus or minus $5 million, and with this lower operating expense run rate, we remain on track to deliver on our cost reduction goals for the year. At the midpoint of guidance, operating margins are expected to be 17.5%. This is expected to result in non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $0.22 and $0.26 per share, assuming a flat share count and a tax rate of 29%, which is inclusive of the R&D tax credit. To summarize, we expect the near-term market conditions to remain uncertain, with modest growth in the markets we serve. Given that environment, we will continue to navigate with a disciplined approach, executing with agility, taking share in routing and switching and capitalizing on the market opportunities at stake. We are focused on driving year-over-year operating margin expansion, generating strong cash flows and prudently allocating capital. And we will maintain our focus on delivering innovation and revenue growth over the long term. I would like to thank our employees for their continued dedication and commitment to successfully executing our strategy. And now, let's open the call to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Rod Hall of JPMorgan.
Roderick B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just had a couple for you. I wanted to talk a little bit -- get you to talk a little bit more about the underlying trends in routing. I mean, Rami, it sounds like things are definitely starting to improve there. I wonder if you could give us any kind of regional commentary in terms of what you're expecting in Europe. And, for instance, do you expect Europe to actually grow significantly this year? Do you think it's just going to be more stable than it was last year? What kind of declines are you seeing there? And also on the T4000, if you could just clarify specifically what trends you're seeing there that give you guys more confidence. I wasn't sure I came away with a real clear picture of what you're saying about the T4000. And then also on routing, if you could talk a little bit about PTX trials. Can you give us any idea how many people are actually trialing the product right now and what the pipeline there looks like? And then the last thing is the EX9200 is not a QFabric switch. And I just wondered, Kevin, if maybe you could talk about the strategy in switching. Are you guys hedging your bets a little bit? Do you have now a two-pronged approach, one that's QFabric-oriented but also one that's going to be more on QFabric, SDN switching oriented?
Kathleen Nemeth: Rod, it's Kathleen. Do want to prioritize the top 2 of those?
Roderick B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. Why don't you talk about T4000 ramp and what's going on there, and then the switching strategy would be great.
Kathleen Nemeth: Okay, fantastic.
Kevin R. Johnson: Okay, let me -- so let me start. First of all, maybe just a couple of comments on some of the segments and how we characterize our routing business. I'd say that we were pleased with the balanced approach and the -- actually the success that we saw from the standpoint of the very segments that brought our routing products. So we saw good growth in cable operator space with traditional telcos and also in content providers. And each of these very different segments bought for different reasons. Clearly, cable operators are dealing with massive growth of video traffic, so this plays right to our strength from the standpoint of offering high-performance systems. The telcos, a lot of consolidation convergence, again, followed by the Universal Edge. The supercore product plays to that sort of trend that's happening in the industry. And last thing on the content providers, also known as Web 2.0, it's about peering and data centers and data center interconnect, again, all sort of trends that benefit from the high performance that we offer in many of our products and solutions. On the T4000, certainly what we saw, as Robyn mentioned, is that we saw sequential strength in our core overall. I will say that part of that strength came from the T4000 itself in the Q1 timeframe. I will say that still today, operators are more focused on the drivers in the edge of the network. So there is a greater demand, if you will, for keeping up with the capacity, the services and the connectivity at the edge of the network today. But sequentially, we're pleased with the trends that we saw in the core. You asked about the multichassis. We did announce and started to offer new multichassis products for the T4000. This is part of the natural evolution of the T series. We offered a multichassis solution for the T640, we did it again for the T1600, and now we're doing it for the T4000. It's not the global sort of customer base for the T series that are interested in this product, but clearly, this is a massively scalable solution that's very appealing to our largest customers that we're engaged with a number of Tier 1 operators around the world for that solution. The last thing I'll just mention on the switching side, there is no change in strategy here. In fact, we've always embarked on a two-pronged strategy for our switching solutions, both in the data center and in the campus. And the data center in particular, we know that there are -- is a subset of customers that want to go down a tiered approach so we have a 2-tier solution that consists of the EX product line. We've just strengthened the EX product line with the introduction of the EX9200, which preserves that architectural message of a 2-tier solution but brings in a level of programmability that I think is really going to help us, especially in this day and age where protocols are evolving, SDN is coming into play and our customers are trying to figure what that means for them from a solution standpoint. The other dimension to our strategy remains very consistent, which is that of the QFabric, a single-tier architecture. The QFabric, as you know, is our flagship data center product. And we did see again a bit more momentum there because of the fact that we introduced the MicroFabric, as well as some additional features that have been waiting -- that some of our customers have been waiting for.
Operator: The next question is from Kevin Dennean of Citi.
Kevin J. Dennean - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I guess, Robyn, quick one for you. Previously, you discussed about $150 million in cost savings split between cost of sales and OpEx. How should we think about the pace of those cost reductions through the year? You're guiding, I think, at the midpoint $510 million for the next quarter, which is a modest reduction year-over-year. But if you could talk a little bit about the trajectory and what we should expect in second half OpEx.
Robyn M. Denholm: Yes, so in terms of the cost targets that we put out there, $150 million between COGS and OpEx, and about 75%, 80% in the OpEx area. We are making very good progress against that. You saw the sequential decline from Q4 to Q1, where typically we see an increase in the Q1 spending given the factors that influence Q1 around salaries and that type of thing. So we've actually -- we believe we've made good progress in terms of the cost reductions. As I mentioned on the Q4 earning call, many of the reduction in force or the workforce sort of reductions have actually happened in terms of the Q4 timeframe. We are continuing to work on supply chain reductions, as well as the overall infrastructure in the company, facilities and that type of thing, and that will be ongoing throughout Q2 and Q3 especially. So my view is we're on track to meet the targets that we set out, and I'm pleased with the progress that we've made.
Kevin J. Dennean - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: So, Kathleen, just following up on that, should we expect the bulk of the remaining cost savings, particularly in OpEx, to be concentrated in the fourth quarter? Or do you expect it to be somewhat even between the third and fourth quarters?
Robyn M. Denholm: Yes, I would -- at this point, I think that we'll see it evenly between third and fourth quarter in terms of the reduction.
Operator: The next question is from Mark McKechnie of Evercore Partners.
Mark McKechnie - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: So my question is about the new products. So they were about $85 million this quarter towards your goal of $150 million. Maybe, Robyn, could you give us a sense for the margin profile of these new products relative to your corporate margins here?
Robyn M. Denholm: Yes, thanks, Mark. In terms of the new products, we're making good progress against the goal that we set for Q4 of 2013 of achieving a quarterly run rate of $150 million. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that's largely coming from the routing products and QFabric. So that's actually the bulk of the over $85 million in the first quarter that we saw. In terms of margin profile, if you go back to my SAM presentation, we actually put what was at or above the corporate average in terms of product gross margins. And clearly, the routing products are above the corporate average. ACX, the access product, which is in the 5 products in terms of the new product target, not a material revenue at this point but is in that number, they were below the corporate average. And switching and -- is sort of in the middle of that. So our view is we're well on track for the 150 for the fourth quarter.
Operator: The next question is from Amitabh Passi of UBS.
Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Kevin, I was wondering if you could shed some more light on your expectations for Asia Pac. It looks like that region continues to struggle. And then I had a follow-up for Robyn. Just in terms of your buyback capacity, if you could just remind us what's left in the program?
Kevin R. Johnson: Yes, Amitabh, thanks for the question. On Asia Pacific, when you look at the Service Provider business in Asia Pacific, you almost have to look at it country by country. It's not necessarily a homogenous region. So as Robyn commented, we'd saw some slowdowns in Japan and Australia. I think India, given the way that spectrum has been allocated and some of the unique challenges those service providers face, I think that's a unique market and yet it's one that I think has opportunity but not one on the Service Provider side that we've seen significant uptick in. We continue to compete well in certain opportunities in China and some of the partnership work that we've done there. So it really does vary on the Service Provider side. And then I think on the enterprise side, globally, certainly our largest verticals that we focus on in the Enterprise side would be financial services and federal, specifically U.S. federal. But I think relative to some of the work that we see or happening in the Enterprise side, I think Asia Pacific has had their share of challenges as well. But overall, I think you'd kind of have to look at it country by country. And it's mixed, and I think there's certain countries that I think we see opportunity or doing well and others that have been a little bit of a slowdown. Robyn?
Robyn M. Denholm: Yes, in terms of the buyback, in -- we have $438 million remaining on the current authorization of the buyback.
Operator: The next question is from Brian Marshall of ISI Group.
Stephen Patel - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: This is Stephen Patel for Brian. You've mentioned Service Provider starting to sound a little better, especially in the U.S. and even a little bit in EMEA as well. Can you talk more about what those customers are telling you and what kind of visibility you have on their plans for the rest of the year?
Kevin R. Johnson: Yes, I'll kick off the answer, Stephen, and then I'll let Rami add to it. Yes, I think we -- 2 quarters ago, I think started indicating that we saw some positive trends in terms of an uptick in North America Service Provider demand, and that was really driven by visibility to specific projects that we're involved in and that were unfolding. And now, we're starting to see those projects come to fruition and into implementation. I think this is a quarter, last couple of quarters, where we also now started to see a few of those types of projects start to emerge in Europe, with service providers in Europe. In addition, in the U.S., we saw specific strength in the content Service Providers, the Web 2.0 types of companies, as well as cable. And so that's a positive indicator. So, much of what we look for is, when we win a specific project, there's a certain amount of planning and configuration and architecture work that goes into it, and then you start into the deployment phases. And so when we just look at the portfolio of projects that are in progress that we've won and we're in progress and looked at sort of how the capital expenditures will then follow as they're aligned with those projects, we feel like we've got some positive trends in the U.S. and some good signals for some positive trends beginning to emerge in Europe. And, Rami, I'll let you comment further.
Rami Rahim: Yes, I think Kevin covered most of it. I'll just add a couple of things. In our discussions with customers around the world, it's clear that traffic is continuing to grow. And this forms, of course, the foundation of much of our business. So it just comes down now to how much of a risk operators want to take or how hot they want to run their network before they want to invest. Clearly, as long as that traffic continues to increase, which we see it increasing everywhere, that investment cycle, especially in cost centers like the core, will come eventually. It's just a matter of trying to predict when, and it's very difficult to do so. The other element of the discussion is around service generation, which is all around things like the Universal Edge, our SDN strategy, our service chaining approach and so forth. This discussion and these engagements are really happening everywhere. But as Kevin mentioned, the pickup that we're seeing, the early signs we're seeing, are most -- are mostly prominent in the U.S. and certain parts of EMEA.
Operator: The next question is from Tal Liani of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Tal Liani - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I think you just reported about 20% mix to the CapEx plan for the quarter. And on the other hand, you have strength with AT&T, specifically, you mentioned 10% customer. Can you discuss the nature of Service Provider revenues in this quarter? Are these related to specific projects that there is concentration in 1 or 2 projects or is it more broad-based? It's just that your commentary specifically is so different than what they said on CapEx, so I'm trying to understand the disconnect.
Kevin R. Johnson: Yes, Tal, this is Kevin. Thanks for the question. I'm going to stay away from commenting on specifics about any one individual customer, but I think that the broad answer is that clearly in our relationships with customers, we work to diversify not only the set of projects that we're working on but the depth of work that we're doing in each of those projects. And I think in some customer situations, it's new design wins, it's adding new projects, and in other customer situations, it's a balance of several projects. I think generally in the U.S. what we're seeing is a wider range of projects that we're getting involved in, and that's strategically what we've been driving to do with the Universal Edge. And I'll let Rami comment more. But the Universal Edge and the MX product family has really become a real workhorse for us and for our customers. And the fact that we're seeing the convergence of -- if it's just the consumer plus the business services and in a BNG type of implementation, that's creating opportunity for our customers to consolidate networks and get the economic benefits of doing that and leverage their investment in the MX to do that. So that's an example of one of the drivers that we've seen consistently around the world and customers in all 3 theaters. But I think the general answer is that in the U.S., it's probably a range of projects that we're involved in and certainly in a range of customers. And I think as we commented in Europe, what we're seeing now is the size of new projects being kicked off and launched in Europe, which is a signal that they're now starting to ramp with some new work. And, Rami, why don't I let you comment further on your perspective.
Rami Rahim: Yes, sure. I'll just say that it's not unusual, especially with our largest customers that we're engaging on a number of projects simultaneously. And as Kevin mentioned, even with a single platform like the MX, you can be participating in projects to solve various different challenges that our customers have with that platform being used in different applications. So that continues to happen. Increasingly, for example, we're not just having a conversation about wireline, but we're also talking about wireless projects and sort of solutions that our customers demand as they move their network from 2G, 3G to 4G. We mentioned, for example, in the last part of 2012, we introduced ACX. This is all about at bookend to solutions that takes many of our existing products and pushes them into the wireless side of the sort of the solutions base for our customers, we're having a lot of those discussions and they're happening in parallel to many other sort of discussions as well with a variety of different products.
Kevin R. Johnson: Yes, and Tal, just a final point on the comments that Rami and I made, we talked a lot about the Edge and what's happening on access. But in many of these cases, we're also doing work in the core. I mean, we saw a good uptake of PTX, as well as sequential increase in T series. So I mean that just sort of supports the fact, I think, and certainly in our North American service providers, it's a range of projects, it's a variety of projects, that's contributing.
Operator: The next question is from George Notter of Jefferies.
George C. Notter - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: I wanted to ask first for more commentary on your federal business. Obviously, it was weak this quarter. But I guess I'm trying to understand exactly what's driving that. Certainly, I would imagine the sequester is a big piece of the story here. But are you seeing smaller deal sizes? Are you seeing deal pushouts? Is the business just being canceled? I mean, any kind of flavor you could give us there would be great. And then also, I'd love to understand what you got baked into expectations for the federal business for Q2.
Kevin R. Johnson: I'll take the first part of your question, George, and I'll let Robyn comment on the Q2 guide. I think the answers in federal is all of the above. When they're trying to find ways to conserve capital and reduce investment or reduce cost, they're going to look every place they can. That's not to say there haven't been some orders and some projects that we've been engaged in, but in that, I think, is there's some areas that spending has been curtailed, others where projects have been cut back and yet some areas where projects are still going forward. And so the -- our federal team has worked very hard to navigate sort of the challenges that we know our federal customers is trying to deal with to make sure that we're focused in the right area. And I think Robyn commented on the decline that we saw year-on-year in our federal revenue. Do you want to comment on the guidance, Robyn?
Robyn M. Denholm: Yes. So, George, in terms of the second quarter, what I did say in terms of the guidance is we expect the same sort of trends in the second quarter. So we're expecting Enterprise to be soft in the second quarter given the ongoing challenges in the budget environment with Federal.
Operator: The next question is from Ehud Gelblum of Morgan Stanley.
Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: First, Rami, if you can just touch on some of the claims that Alcatel-Lucent has been making with the new 7950 they claim and going aggressive out there and taking share specifically from you guys. So can you just give a brief overview of what you are or not seeing from ALU in the market on routing? Then on security, it was down 20% last quarter. I think you said that branch SRX orders were up 17% and high-end SRX is off 19%. I didn't hear similar quarters -- at revenue, actually you spoke to those, I didn't hear similar numbers this quarter. So Robyn, if you can give some just color around what the 2 different types of SRX did in terms of revenue this quarter to get to the down 20%, give us some color there, and what you're expecting in guidance, that will be helpful. On switching, I was surprised it's down as much as it was down 10%, 11%, and orders, you said last quarter, were up 19% in switching. So I just want to make sure I'm comparing apples-to-apples, and it would be good to understand why the orders didn't necessarily translate into higher switching revenue, and how QFabric plays into that, because Kevin had sounded like QFabric got stronger again. Can you give us color on QFabric and then with customers and how that played into that? It's a lot of questions.
Kevin R. Johnson: Okay, let's -- Rami, I'll let you take the first one on ALU.
Rami Rahim: Okay. Yes, certainly. So what I'd say this is that first, I don't underestimate any of our competitors. So a lot of respect for all of our competitors. But that said, building the massively scalable ultra-large core systems that our customers demand is not an easy thing to do, and this is part of Juniper's strength and our DNA. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, I think that we have a three-pronged innovation strategy that, quite frankly, whether you talk about Alcatel or any other competitor, it's going to be difficult for them to match. Everything from the investment protection story that we offer with the T Series to the PTX, which is really a new breed of core transport supercore router that really nobody else has from the standpoint of efficiency, power efficiency, transport capability, optical integration. We just strengthened that with the announcement of the PTX3000. And last but not least, is the MX2020, which, again, we've just introduced along with denser line cards for the customer that wants to do more of a service-rich core. So the combination of these 3 products gives me confidence that I think we're going to do very well against incumbent competitors, as well as newer competitors that are trying to get into this space.
Kevin R. Johnson: Okay. Then on the question on security, maybe Robyn, why don't you start with the numbers and then I'll let Bob comment on sort of the focus that we have on the security business.
Robyn M. Denholm: Yes, so in terms of the security business, I talked about year-over-year that there was a $32 million decline year-over-year and $20 million of it was in the SP space. And that SP space is high-end SRX. On the Enterprise side, SRX did increase year-over-year. But the NetScreen OS products are declining at a faster rate than the rate of increase in SRX. And as you know, Ehud, that's what we've been focused on, if you like, turning the business around. And so Bob, do you want to comment on the Enterprise security?
Robert L. Muglia: Sure. Let me make a comment on both sectors, if I would. On the Service Provider, as you mentioned, we always see this revenue to be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. And right now, we're also in the middle of a product transition as we're bringing out a next generation of service play that increases our per session capacity to 100 million sessions and provides our Service Provider customers with the continued leading performance that they've come to expect out of the SRX. So that's one of the factors that we expect has had some implication of Service Provider space, although the deals just come in at different quarters and that has been true for some time. In the Enterprise -- in the data center space, which really is for both the Service Provider and the Enterprise, we have seen some increased interest certainly from our customers, and we have some confidence that this will lead to long-term strength in the business as we've introduced new products in this space, such as WebApp Secure and our recent introduction of Spotlight, which fingerprints hackers using technology that is unavailable from anyone else in the industry. And we've got some very, very strong positive conversations with leading CSOs of major Enterprise and Service Provider customers over the past quarter in this space. And we see the data center as an area where we are once again return to a very competitive position, and in fact, have some leading-edge technology. The other area where we have been -- have had more challenge, and this is consistent with the conversations we've been having for a year, is in the campus and branch space, which is really in the Enterprise. And there are still some areas of product deficiency that we're working to correct. We have introduced and have had -- and I've talked about in previous quarters, Security Director in the marketplace. We're seeing good acceptance of Security Director with customers such as Revlon, Ecopetrol in Colombia, a major Colombian oil and gas company, as well as Meyer, a Midwestern retailer, are 3 examples of reference customers who have successfully adopted Security Director and then using it to manage their systems. We have new buildings we need to do in that space still, particularly in the reporting area. But we are continuing to focus on all 3 areas of security and have a long-term confidence in the business.
Kevin R. Johnson: So then that third question, Ehud, was in the area of switching. And overall, the switching business grew 6% year-on-year, and certainly that even accounted for the declines that we saw in federal and other parts of Enterprise. And I think much of that was driven by -- part of that was driven by QFabric that continues to grow. And QFabric, a little color behind that, I think we -- that product is really oriented in many ways to large data center types of feeds. We saw, in this particular quarter, deployment of one of our large customers in a large data center that contributed to that. And in terms of the bridge between the orders in Q4, and do you want, Robyn, to make a comment?
Robyn M. Denholm: Yes. So -- and so in Q4, Ehud, we actually said that it was Service Provider demand that was in backlog if you like, and we did see that coming through in the results this quarter. We talked about switching being up in the Service Provider space in the quarter, even though we did see declines in the Enterprise space in the quarter.
Operator: The last question comes from Subu Subrahmanyan of The Juda Group.
Natarajan Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group, Research Division: My question was to follow up on security. I wanted to see if you could talk about if you feel like you're reaching a bottom in security, given the new product transitions you're seeing, as well as some of the new capabilities in the campus data center or if you expect to see that at some point, just given the quarterly revenue run rate, is that a kind of a multi-year low for the quarterly revenues?
Kevin R. Johnson: Yes, so let me sort of kick off and just reiterate a way that I think it's important for you to think about this, and then I'll let Bob comment. What Bob talked about is 3 different areas of our security business. The first one being Service Provider, and we feel we're in a very good position with Service Providers. The revenue is lumpy. This is a quarter that it was low, but we feel like with the R&D we've done and the ability to take the SRX to handle 100 million concurrent sessions, that value proposition for Service Providers as they're securing LTE traffic in the mobile Internet is and continues to be a strong value proposition. So that part of our security business, we feel very good about. Yes, revenue is lumpy, but we've got new design wins. Our largest customers are continuing to deploy. We've got new innovation that addresses their need of scale. Service Provider is in good shape in securing mobile Internet. The second bucket is data center, and I think -- as Bob highlighted, I think the new innovation that we delivered at data center combined with our SRX and SSL VPN technology, we feel good about our data center offerings. We've got good customer interest. We've got to work, make sure we'd convert that to revenue, so I think data center, we feel good about. And the area that we know we still have work to do is in that campus and branch area. So you net that out, I think -- and Robyn's comments that of the year-on-year decrease in security, $20 million of that roughly was Service Provider, and that's lumpy and we're confident that we've got the right set of solutions there. So it was $10 million that was related to Enterprise. And we think that we're -- we've got a good value proposition at data center and we've still got work to do in campus. So that's kind of the framework to think about it. So the question is we've shifted the bulk of our revenue now to the SRX, and so the older ScreenOS products will continue to decline and it's our ability to then offset that with faster growth on the SRX, and we feel stronger in Service Provider and data center than in campus and branch. I think that's kind of the net of what Bob outlined.
Robert L. Muglia: Right. That exactly right, Kevin. I think that we're in the products transition cycle and multi-quarter products transition cycle from the ScreenOS generation of products to the SRX. The SRX brings us strength in Service Provider, which we've never had before, and that is an area where, particularly as service providers do LTE buildouts, we see the ability to profit from that. Meanwhile, we need to ensure that we double down in the Enterprise segment. We feel like we've made good progress in the data center space with what we've introduced. We still have work to do in campus and branch, which is a large part of the Enterprise market, but that's an area of continued focus on the team. And this is a multi-quarter transition.
Kathleen Nemeth: Okay. Thank you very much. That is all the time we have today. We'd like to thank you again. We recognize that today is a very busy day in terms of companies reporting, and we appreciate your interest in Juniper Networks. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Juniper Networks Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Kathleen Nemeth, Vice President, Investor Relations for Juniper Networks. Thank you, Ms. Nemeth, you may begin.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Here on the call are Kevin Johnson, Chief Executive Officer; Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial Officer; Bob Muglia, Executive Vice President, Software Solutions Division; and Rami Rahim, Executive Vice President, Platform Systems division. Before we continue, I would like to highlight some planned changes to our earnings release format that will be implemented next quarter. Starting with our first quarter 2013 earnings, we will no longer be including certain financial tables within our earnings press release, but we will continue to make them available for download in Excel format on the Investor Relations section of Juniper's website. The financial tables are noted in the appendix of today's fourth quarter and full year 2012 earnings press release and include segment operating results, share-based compensation by category, share-based compensation related to tax by category and reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results related to the tables I just referenced. We believe this change will simplify and streamline the earnings press release format while continuing to make valuable information available to our shareholders. Please remember when listening to today's call that statements concerning Juniper's business outlook, economic and market outlook, strategy, future financial operating results and overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including economic conditions generally or within the networking industry; changes in overall technology spending and spending by communication service providers and major customers; the network capacity requirements of service providers; the timing of orders and shipments; manufacturing and supply chain constraints; variation in the mix of products sold, customer perception and acceptance of our products; rapid technological and market change; litigation and other factors listed in our most recent 10-Q filed with the SEC. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances change after the date of this call. In discussing the financial results, Robyn will first present results on a GAAP basis and for purposes of today's discussion will also review non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why the management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult our 8-K filed with the SEC today. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP, please see the Investor Relations section of our website. In general, non-GAAP results exclude certain non-recurring charges, amortization of purchased intangibles and other acquisition charges and expenses related to stock-based compensation. On today's call, Robyn will also be providing forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis other than that with respect to revenue and share count. All guidance is forward-looking, and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier. GAAP guidance measures are not available on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to certain charges, which are excluded from the non-GAAP guidance estimate. Please note that today's call is scheduled to last for 1 hour, and please limit your questions to 1 per firm. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin.
Kevin R. Johnson: Thanks, Kathleen, and welcome, everyone. Juniper finished the year on a good note, exceeding our Q4 guidance. Robyn will review the financial results shortly. Certainly, 2012 was a challenging year given the global macroenvironment, and we have focused on controlling the things that are within our control and improving execution. I think we've made solid progress in a number of key areas. First, we strengthened our product portfolio and introduced breakthrough technologies over the past year. We are gaining traction in the marketplace as we execute against a multiyear strategy that will help us embrace the ongoing transition in the networking industry towards flatter, more scalable network architectures. This is evident in the new products we have brought to market in routing, switching and security. In addition, we've also made important improvements to many of our existing products with new features, enhanced performance capabilities and quality improvements. This includes our security portfolio, where we have made and continue to make key advancements to strengthen our offerings and narrow competitive gaps. In addition, we have clearly stated a path for Juniper to leverage our assets and embrace the concept of software-defined networks. Bob Muglia will share some more details on security and SDN in a few moments. The second area of progress in 2012 was excellence in execution, focusing on our innovation strategy and on the things we can control. Last fall, we announced a set of restructuring efforts designed to sharpen our focus, drive efficiencies and enable agility throughout the organization. We're also well along the path where we've improved our sales pipeline and forecasting execution, R&D execution to deliver innovation and product quality, and customer service and support execution. We also strengthened our capabilities and business processes and key internal management systems, which will further improve our ability to execute. There's always more to do to drive continuous improvement, and this will continue to be a focus in 2013. From my perspective, Juniper is already executing at a higher level, and this adds to my confidence as we enter the new year. Third area of focus is around capital allocation. Juniper consistently delivers strong operating cash flows, and we're being very thoughtful about how we allocate these dollars across investment priorities that drive growth and opportunities to enhance shareholder returns. We will continue to be thoughtful in our capital allocation throughout 2013. The progress in each of these areas lays the foundation for improving performance in 2013. But before I get into our business outlook, I want to touch on the announcement we made last week around software-defined networking at our annual Global Partners Conference. I want to highlight a couple of points. There's been a lot of talk, and in many cases, a lot of hype around SDN. We were relatively quiet on the topic in 2012, but in the background, we were hard at work on our strategy and plans. We recognize this is an inflection point in the industry, and we share the view that SDN will play a transformational role in networking. Juniper has played a critical role in prior transformational moments in networking, and we see this as the next big transition. A couple of things are clear today. One, it's early. That's evident in the variety of approaches beginning to emerge in the industry. Two, the vision and strategy we laid out last week defines a comprehensive path that we believe leverages our heritage, is the innovation leader in high-performance networking and puts us in a good position to execute and create value, both for our customers and our shareholders. Bob will comment on this further in a minute. I'd like to focus the remainder of my remarks on how Juniper is positioning itself for 2013. The macro and spending environments remain mixed with the beginning signs of increased project activity in service providers, offset somewhat by weakness in U.S. federal and other parts of the enterprise. Macroenvironment in Europe remains challenging. That said, we are playing offense and we're focused on making solid progress against the targets in our long-term financial model. We enter the year in a good position. As I've discussed, we're stronger operationally. We're more focused and more agile. The company is well prepared for growth. In routing, innovative new products like PTX and ACX are gaining traction. This is evident in the fourth quarter. The flagship MX family of routers continues to gain widespread adoption, and we plan to take share in routing. In switching, we are continuing to take share in the market overall, and we continue to add customers for our data center switching offerings. We introduced the smaller version of the QFabric Interconnect, the QFX3000-M, in Q3. And this contributed to the addition of over 130 net new customers in Q4 and an acceleration in full fabric deployments. We continue to enhance the features and capabilities of our data center solutions. And finally in security, we continue to have good traction with service providers, while we have reenergized enterprise security strategy, and we are beginning to show results. This will be a big area of focus in 2013, and Bob will share more on this topic with you. Of course, for Juniper to generate good growth, we also need to see a healthy spending environment. We will continue to watch the macroenvironment carefully, and we think the steps we've taken to improve our execution will enable us to manage the business prudently and with agility. We continue to believe that the underlying trends driving network investment around the cloud and mobility are intact and remain strong. U.S. Tier 1 service provider spending in 2012 was healthy, and we think signs in our business point to some improved momentum in routing in 2013 from U.S. and European service providers. Enterprise continues to be challenging and difficult to predict, particularly in key sectors like federal, where the U.S. budget situation has clouded visibility and continues to weigh on the sector. But bigger picture, we are steadily improving our position in the data center, and we are making important strides toward restoring growth in security. We believe the long-term demand for high-performance networking continues to be positive as mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets proliferate and service providers increasingly rely on high-performance networks to support the demand for data. Wrapping up, we generated solid financial results in 2012 in a challenging macroenvironment. We focused on those things that we could control, and in the process, we strengthened our product offerings, improved our execution and allocated our capital thoughtfully. Looking ahead, Juniper is entering 2013 in a strong position with good opportunities to take share in routing and switching, and we expect to continue to make progress in security. We will play offense as we pursue our 3-year financial targets, and we will do this by staying true to our strategy, delivering great products, focusing on operational excellence and managing our costs carefully. Thanks again for joining us today, and now, I'll hand it over to Bob to share more details on software-defined networks and our activities in security. Bob?
Robert L. Muglia: Thank you, Kevin, and it's great to be joining the call with all of you today. Kevin has asked me to update you on a couple of items. The first of those is our strategy and vision for software-defined networking. We unveiled this as a part of our Global Partners Conference last week to an enthusiastic response. And today, I'll put some more context on why this announcement is important. The second item is our progress in security. We refined our security strategy, improved our products and delivered significant new capabilities over the past year. You'll be hearing more details on what we're up to over the coming weeks at events like RSA and Mobile World Congress, and I will offer a bit of a preview today. So let's start with our SDN announcement. I think we all appreciate that SDN is likely to represent a significant shift in networking. Yet for all the hype, the industry conversation has been pretty narrowly focused. We actually view SDN as a much broader opportunity than what's been defined to date by industry players and analysts. Although we've been fairly quiet up until now, we've been working hard behind the scenes for some time. And what we articulated last week is a clear vision for the industry, as well as a pathway for our customers, service providers, enterprise and cloud providers, to begin thinking about how they will embrace SDN in their networks. We intend to lead the shift to SDN. We started that conversation last week by defining 6 principles for SDN and providing customers with a 4-step road map, steps that will help enterprise and networks operators achieve the real promise of SDN, making their networks more agile and lowering their OpEx. We strongly believe that Juniper is ideally positioned to take this leadership role in SDN. The factors that are driving the SDN opportunity uniquely align with Juniper's strengths and track record of disruptive innovation. Our technology vision for SDN will embrace Juniper's focus on silicon systems and software. But the business model is just as important. Leveraging proven business software industry practices, we believe that the licensing model we introduced last week, Juniper Software Advantage, will deliver great value to our customers while driving incremental revenue growth for Juniper in the years ahead. So we think we're in an excellent position to succeed with our SDN strategy in business. Depending on where you sit in networking industry, SDN can be an opportunity or a threat. For Juniper, it's an incredible opportunity. We look forward to keeping you updated. Let's now turn to security. The SRX continues to gain traction with service providers, and we see more opportunity ahead as the international mobile market moves to LTE. We expect this to continue as SPs expand from large cell towers to small cells within shopping malls, stadiums and other high-traffic areas to provide better service and more effectively utilize their licensed spectrum. The combination of leading performance, together with well-established customer adoption, uniquely positions the SRX to capture these deployments. We are still turning the corner on enterprise security sales, but in Q4, we made major strides with our delivery of great security products that meet the needs of enterprise customers. As we committed earlier this year, in Q4, we released the production version of our integrated security management product, Security Director [ph]. This product has been in trial with 100-plus beta customers and has already been deployed by over 25 customers, cutting across enterprise vertical segments including financial services, healthcare and retail, as well as service providers. In addition, over the past 6 months, we engaged in many strategic security conversations with enterprise CSOs. Mykonos, Juniper's thought leadership intrusion deception technology, has garnered both significant interest, as well as new sales in the enterprise, and has provided us with a vehicle to discuss our overall security portfolio. At the upcoming RSA event in San Francisco, you'll be hearing more about our new security product offerings. We will also have some exciting news to share at Mobile World Congress around our security offerings in the 4G LTE environment. We're pretty excited about what's on tap at security in 2013. We've accomplished a lot in the past year from stabilizing the business to charting a strategy for resumed growth and now, the fun stuff, executing on that strategy and showing customers what we can do. As we've said many times, security is a growth market, and for Juniper, it's a core area. Despite our recent challenges, we have a double-digit share of this market. We are committed to growing that share and we are putting the pieces in place to do just that. And now, here's Robyn.
Robyn M. Denholm: Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. In the fourth quarter, Juniper improved operational execution and delivered good results. I'm pleased with our quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year revenue growth and our operating margin expansion. Looking at the year overall, in a challenging macro and market environment, we continued to make progress in 3 main areas: first, operational excellence, where we aligned our cost structure to sharpen our focus, enable agility and drive efficiencies; second, focus on innovation, where we strengthened our portfolio with disruptive new products and key enhancements to existing products, especially in the enterprise security and data center; and third, prudent capital allocation, where we are adding complementary technology through acquisition and increased our share buybacks. We have largely completed our announced headcount action. We've also made significant progress on the facility and other action. These are all intended to bring our cost structure more in line with our long-term model. As expected, these restructuring-related actions resulted in pretax charges for the fourth quarter of $11 million associated with severance, facilities and other restructuring costs. We also completed the acquisition of Contrail Systems for a total of $176 million of cash and equity. The total net cash outlay was $49 million, and the remainder of the consideration was in the form of equity awards. Looking at our demand metrics for the quarter, book to bill remained greater than 1. Product backlog increased sequentially for the third quarter in a row, reaching $410 million, up 17% sequentially and 37% from a year ago. As anticipated, product deferred revenue decreased sequentially and increased year-over-year. The sequential decrease was due to delivery of certain software features in the quarter. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $1,141,000,000, an increase of 2% both sequentially and year-over-year. The sequential increase was due primarily to growth in Americas service provider revenues and modest improvement in EMEA. The year-over-year increase is due to growth in U.S. service providers. Revenue for the full year was $4,365,000,000, down 2% year-over-year. During 2012, we strengthened our product portfolio with the rollout of new products and product enhancements. We also had good year-over-year growth in existing products. Compared to 2011, SRX grew 17%, EX grew 8% and MX grew 7%. Verizon accounted for over 10% of Juniper's total revenue, both in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Verizon continues to be a strategic customer and deploys many of our routing, switching and security products across both their wired and wireless networks. For the fourth quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.19. This includes the impact of the restructuring charges I noted earlier, which totaled $0.02 per share. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.28, up $0.06 sequentially and flat with the fourth quarter of last year. The sequential increase reflected the combination of revenue growth, good gross margins and lower operating expenses. For the full year, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.35 compared to $0.79 for the prior year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.85 versus $1.19 a year ago. Now let me provide some color on revenue by region, business segment and market. Americas revenue was up 8% sequentially and 16% year-over-year. The sequential and year-over-year increase was due to U.S. service provider growth. This was partially offset by a decrease in U.S. enterprise as a result of weakness in federal. EMEA revenue was up 5% sequentially and down 15% year-over-year. While EMEA remains challenged, we continue to see modest improvement in the demand environment, particularly in Western and Southern Europe. APAC revenue was down 18% sequentially due to a significant decline in China service provider. Now let me review our revenue by segment. Platform Systems division revenue for the fourth quarter was $930 million, up 4% both sequentially and year-over-year. PSD router product revenue was $514 million, up 5% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. The sequential increase was driven by record revenue for MX and good growth in PTX. Year-over-year, we saw significant growth in the MX product family driven by U.S. service provider and the Edge. This growth more than offset the anticipated decline in older M and E Series products. We will continue to closely manage our supply chain in response to increasing service provider Edge routing demand. Total router product revenue, including both PSD and SSD, increased 3% sequentially to $531 million. Total switching product revenue was $146 million, flat sequentially and down 6% year-over-year. It's important to note that orders grew 19% sequentially, and given the timing of these orders, we ended the quarter with a strong backlog. SSD revenue in the fourth quarter was $211 million, down 6% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. Total security product revenue was $170 million, down 4% sequentially and 8% year-over-year. The 8% year-over-year reduction in total security product revenue reflects the continued decline in our ScreenOS enterprise firewall business. And as Bob outlined, we have been taking steps to address this with enhanced functionality and management features. Consistent with the trend we have seen over the last year, service provider accounts for approximately 35% of our total security product revenue. High-end SRX product revenue declined 19%. We expect revenue for this product to continue to fluctuate based on the timing of service provider deployments. Branch SRX was up 17% sequentially and 18% year-over-year, demonstrating the early signs of progress we are seeing with our enterprise customers. I'd also like to provide some insight into demand for our new products. At SAM, we said we expected the combined revenue from ACX, QFabric, PTX, T4000 and MobileNext, that we would exit the fourth quarter of 2013 with a quarterly revenue run rate of $150 million. We have seen healthy bookings for the new products, and we believe that we are on track to achieve this level of revenue. For Q4 2012, we are pleased with our progress. The combined bookings in these 5 products are approximately 50% of our total 2013 year-end goal. Looking more closely at the markets we address, service provider revenue was $740 million, up 5% sequentially and 9% year-over-year. Both the sequential and year-over-year increases were attributable to broad strength in Americas service provider, where we've seen good breadth of demand across all verticals, carriers, both wireless and wireline, cable and content service providers. We've also benefited from modest improvement in demand in EMEA. Enterprise revenue was $401 million, down 3% sequentially and 10% year-over-year. The sequential decline reflects weakness in the Americas, primarily federal, which was offset by an increase in EMEA. The year-over-year decrease was also attributable to America's enterprise, with both federal and financial services declining compared to a strong Q4 2011. Our enterprise business in APAC has performed well this year. For 2012, our total revenues in the U.S. federal area accounted for approximately 4% of full year total revenue. Moving on to gross margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margins for the fourth quarter was 65.3% compared to 65.6% last quarter. This was slightly better than we expected due to favorable mix and a strong services margin performance. Non-GAAP product gross margins were 66% compared to 66.8% in the third quarter, and non-GAAP services gross margins were 63.2%, up 1 point from the prior quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were better than expected, decreasing 1% sequentially to $537 million as a result of cost reduction activities. Looking at headcount, we ended the quarter with 9,234 employees, down 350 from the third quarter. This headcount includes the employees from the Contrail acquisition. We are pleased with our activities on the cost structure and we are committed to achieving our targeted cost reductions. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 18.2%. I'm pleased with this result, which was due to a combination of higher revenue, higher gross margins and lower operating expenses. The non-GAAP tax rate was 26.8%. As a reminder, the fourth quarter tax rate does not reflect the renewal of the R&D tax credit, which came into effect in early 2013. Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $2.8 billion of net cash and investments. Cash flow from operations was $155 million, down sequentially as a result of an increase in working capital. DSO was 35 days in the quarter. Capital expenditures and depreciation were both up slightly from the prior quarter. We repurchased 14.5 million shares for $250 million at an average price of $17.24. We have $568 million remaining on our current authorization. And we expect to continue to calibrate our buybacks in future quarters with market conditions at the time. As we have done in the past, we kick off the year with an updated set of operating principles, which provide insight on how we are managing the business. For 2013, our 5 principles are: We expect the macroeconomic environment to remain uncertain. We expect overall modest growth in the markets we serve. We expect to take share in routing and switching and stabilize our share in enterprise security. We expect to expand 2013 operating margins over 2012. And we expect to continue to generate strong cash flows and prudently allocate capital. Now I will review our outlook for the first quarter. And as a reminder, these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis except for revenue and share count. Our outlook for the March quarter reflects our expectation of a typical seasonal decline, especially in the enterprise sector. This decline is consistent with the cautious approach our customers are taking to capital deployment. In service provider, we see a continuation of U.S. service provider capital spending and some signs of improvement emerging in EMEA. With that backdrop, for the first quarter, we expect revenues to range from $1,050,000,000 to $1,070,000,000. Gross margins are expected to be in the range of 64% plus or minus 0.5 point. Operating expenses are expected to be $515 million, plus or minus $5 million. We expect operating margins to range from 14% to 16%. This is expected to result in non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $0.18 and $0.22 per share. This assumes flat share count and a tax rate of 29%, which does reflect the Q1 impact of the R&D tax credit. Given the timing of the renewal of the tax credit and its retroactive application to 2012, we expect an additional benefit to the Tier 1 tax rate of approximately $15 million. This is not reflected in the 29% rate that I just mentioned. In summary, throughout 2012, we have focused on improved operational execution, continued innovation and prudent capital allocation. We finished the year with a good quarter. In 2013, we will navigate with the same disciplined approach, driving growth by taking share in routing and switching while stabilizing security. I'd like to thank our employees for their hard work and ongoing commitment to executing our strategy for driving revenue growth and disciplined operational execution. Now I will hand it back to the operator to open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jeff Kvaal of Barclays.
Jeffrey T. Kvaal - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I have a question, Kevin, for you and one for you, Robyn, as well. Kevin, you had spent some time during the quarter talking about the routing cycle and how you felt there was time for a recovery. Can you give us a bit of insight into how you are thinking about what that means for your 2013 growth rate? You talked about growth in your present press release as well. If you could give us some more thought behind that, that'd be wonderful.
Kevin R. Johnson: Yes. Go ahead with the second question you had for Robyn, Jeff?
Jeffrey T. Kvaal - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Yes. Robyn, I wanted to know on the OpEx side of things, if you could tell us, is that $515 million guidance for the March quarter, is that effectively where we should think about your OpEx plan as bringing the OpEx? Or is there another leg to go after that?
Kevin R. Johnson: Thanks for the question, Jeff. I'll take the first one then hand over to Robyn. 2012 year-to-date through Q3, the addressable -- total addressable market for routing had actually declined by about 3 percentage points. Yet at the same time, traffic continues to grow. And we had a service provider customer event in early December and just confirmed with our customers that certainly, traffic was continuing to grow through that period. And what that means then is overall, the service providers are running their networks hotter. And so it's a matter of time when they cycle through and say, "Okay, now it's time to make new capital investments in routing infrastructure either to, a, modernize those networks or, b, add capacity to them." And I think based on the set of projects that we're engaged in and have been awarded, combined with the uptick we saw in Q3 on service provider routing spending, I think that's an indicator that I think we're about to enter a better cycle for routing spend, which leads to our view that we think this is an opportunity for growth in 2013. I'll remind you, it's still early and it still varies by geography, but we had a very strong quarter with our U.S. Tier 1 service providers and we've got a good base of wins in both Europe and Asia Pacific. So we'll see how things play out. But I think if history repeats itself, it looks like we're on that kind of cycle. Let me ask Rami if he wants to add anything to that as well.
Rami Rahim: Sure. Yes, I would agree with that, Kevin. If you -- in talking to many of our customers throughout the quarter, I would say that a lot of the usual trends that we've been seeing are going to start to impact them in 2013 around just dealing with capacity, the results from video traffic, as well as convergence. I mean our operators are looking for ways to simplify their networks, to collapse networks and just reduce the OpEx of running those networks. And I do think that some of those investment cycles that Kevin talked about throughout 2013 are going to play out.
Robyn M. Denholm: Yes, and just let me talk about OpEx. So as I guided in the prepared remarks, OpEx is $515 million plus or minus $5 million for the Q1 period of time. I want to remind you that Q1 is where we see an increase typically in OpEx around FICO and variable compensation for employees. I also said in my prepared remarks that we are largely complete with our employee actions, but we are continuing in terms of facilities and the other actions that we have around cost structure. So my view is we're well on track to achieve the cost targets that we've talked about previously.
Operator: The next question is from Tal Liani of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Tal Liani - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I have 2 questions, the first one is on switching. Switching was down, as you said, about 6.5% year-over-year, I think, and flat sequentially. But you also said that the orders were up 19%. And I'm wondering what causes in switching, what causes the orders -- and I assume it's enterprise switching. So the question is what causes in switching the orders to go into the deferred and not into recognition? Is it just timing or there is more of a long-term contract, et cetera? So that's one question. The second question is about OpEx again. And the question is how much of your announced cost cuts was already implemented in the fourth quarter, third quarter, et cetera? You gave us very good guidance before about the amount and how it falls in the -- where it falls in the P&L. And I'm wondering if you can update us on what it was done already and what's going to be done in the next few quarters.
Kevin R. Johnson: Yes, thanks for your questions, Tal. I'll -- Rami and I will take the first one, and we'll hand over to Robyn for the second one. On your question on switching, in the quarter, enterprise switching grew sequentially. And the place that we had bookings that we're going to ship in Q1 was on the service provider side. And the way I interpret that is when I look at the spending patterns of service providers and the orders they place, they prioritize the CapEx around shipping the routing infrastructure and placed orders for some switching that's going to ship in Q1. So actually, our enterprise switching grew and the bookings that are shipping in Q1 were service providers. So it's not unusual for service providers to place orders for routing, switching, security and book those and say, "Okay, we want this to ship in Q1." And that's mainly the way that each one of them is prioritizing where they're putting their CapEx. Rami, do you want to add anything to that?
Rami Rahim: Sure. Yes, I mean that's essentially right. The service provider component of switching tends to be lumpy because it depends on fewer number of orders from fewer customers. So that's what we saw happening in Q4. The other thing that's just worthwhile reiterating is simply that we've been introducing new functionality to our QFabric product. In fact, we introduced a new version of our QFabric, which is the -- what we call the micro fabric, the smaller version which we've seen hit the sweet spot in the market. And as a result of that, we've seen an increase in the number of customers and greater adoption of that product in the switching market.
Robyn M. Denholm: Yes, and in terms of OpEx, Tal, I did talk about the overall targets that we have for the full year in terms of taking out OpEx. Those percentages still apply. I talked about 75%, 80% in OpEx and the rest of it in cost of goods sold. And I'll reiterate. You can see that the headcount is down net about 350 at the end of the year. That -- we did previously talk about notifying about 500 heads. So there are still some that were onboard at the end of December, so some will come out in the third quarter. But largely, the headcount action has been taken. Obviously, not all the cost savings are in there that's reflected in the $515 million guidance that I've given you for the first quarter. Things that we will see that actually will reduce OpEx as we move forward are some of the facilities and other related cost actions, some of which are in the COGS areas I've mentioned before around supply chain activities, that type of thing. But overall, we're very comfortable with actions we've taken. They're the right actions. They do help us with our agility, our focus and our state as a company, as well as taking out costs and aligning the cost structure to our long-term model.
Tal Liani - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: So Robyn, the -- is there a specific number how much cost cuts is left to be done?
Robyn M. Denholm: We -- I haven't called out that number in terms of what's left to be done. You can see by the guidance that there's a significant reduction. Typically, what we see in the first quarter is an increase in expenditure to do with variable comp and the FICO, et cetera. So you can expect some additional decline from the 15 -- $515 million number.
Operator: Our next question is from Ehud Gelblum of Morgan Stanley.
Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: A couple of questions. First of all, Robyn, thanks for that switching order number, 19%. Can you give us a sense as to what the routing orders looked like in the quarter to give us some kind of handle on what that looked like? And I think, Kevin, you talked -- you spoke about, I think 130 or 133. I didn't -- must not have got it correctly wrote down, new customers in Q4. I believe that was for, you said, data center switching. But if you can say that again or clarify, if that, in fact, was QFabric or that was all of switching. And how that compares to last quarter, when I don't think we had a number for that. Then I have a follow-up on tax rate.
Kevin R. Johnson: Yes, I'll take the second question and hand over to Robyn. What I said, Ehud, was we had over 130 net new QFabric customers in Q4. And that was a result of, I think in many ways, the release or introduction of the micro fabric. And Robyn, you want to take the other question?
Robyn M. Denholm: Yes. So in terms of...
Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Kevin, can I just ask -- clarify that? Is that for the top-of-rack the way it used to be in previous quarters or were those -- some of those taking the full solutions?
Kevin R. Johnson: Absolutely, they're taking the full solution. We also had -- I commented that we had over 130 net new incremental QFabric customers and a wave of full fabric deployments. So certainly, a portion of those were -- all of the lease were known customers and there's a wave of full fabric deployments as well.
Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: How many does that give us in total? Because you used to give a cumulative total.
Kevin R. Johnson: I don't have that number, Ehud. I -- we just looked at it sort of once at the release that micro fabric came out, what was the impact on that. So I apologize, I don't have that number in front of me.
Robyn M. Denholm: So in terms of the backlog, as I mentioned, the backlog was up again sequentially. That's the third quarter in a row it reached $410 million for the quarter, so it's up nicely at 17% sequentially and 37% year-over-year. And clearly, in any quarter, a significant proportion of our backlog is always routing. So we were happy with the bookings in the quarter. As Rami mentioned before, we talked about a very good MX quarter in terms of revenue. There are deployments happening on the Edge, and that's a good indicator for us in terms of the demand environment.
Operator: Our next question is from Rod Hall of JPMorgan.
Roderick B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just a couple of questions. I wanted to ask about PSD and SSD's contribution margins. Sequentially, PSD up quite a bit and then SSD down. I'm particularly interested in maybe getting more color on the PSD contribution margins, your trajectory. I think, Robyn, you said that MX and PTX were big contributors to the growth in there. Can you just talk to us a little bit about was it mostly MX driving the margin better? Or did -- if PTX maybe a little bit more than -- better margin, a lot of it's expected? And then I was curious, Robyn, why you guys didn't mention the T4000. So I just wondered if you could give a little update on what the latest status on T4000 refresh is.
Robyn M. Denholm: So in terms of the overall margin, Rod, let me talk about that. And then I'll let Rami talk about the T4000. So in terms of PSD margin and SSD, clearly, volume has a big amount to play with those overall contribution margins. We saw a surge in revenue as you saw from the numbers in terms of PSD, given that routing is up, et cetera. And obviously, with the high-end SRX decline quarter-over-quarter, which we were expecting because of the service provider deployment, that actually weighs on the overall revenue being down for SSD, and therefore, the contribution margin. So if I up-level the discussion, you talked about gross margins, the gross margins in the quarter were healthy. They were actually better than we expected, and I mentioned that in the prepared remarks. That was primarily the result of 2 factors. One was mix was better. We did see a good uptick in MX in the quarter. And then the second factor was the services gross margin. That was actually a very good gross margin for them given their execution in the quarter, and also the result of some of the cost reductions that we've been focused on in that area. So the 2 factors combined increased the gross margin from our guidance for the fourth quarter.
Rami Rahim: I can weigh in a bit on the T4000 question. We definitely saw in Q4 that there was a bias of investment by service providers towards the Edge. And this is -- if you look at the investment drivers in the Edge in the quarter, they differ somewhat. In the quarter, it's really all about capacity. So operators will tend to defer investment until they actually hit the capacity constraint. In the Edge, it's about capacity, but it's also about just connectivity, it's also about services. What we saw in Q4 that the Edge drivers were much stronger than the core driver. And for that reason, there was, in fact, a decline in T4000 upgrades overall. Now if you'll look out into 2013, we expect that because of the fact that networks are running hotter, and eventually, the constraint or the bottlenecks in the network will start to move from Edge to core, that will start to be a driver for upgrades in T4000 and also a driver for adoption of the PTX as well.
Operator: Our next question is from Brian Marshall of ISI Group.
Brian Marshall - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Considering the T4000 is probably the company's highest gross margin product family out there and you're guiding margins in March to be down about 130 basis points sequentially to 64%. Would that -- I guess that would imply that you still don't expect the T4K line cards to be deployed en masse in the March quarter? I guess that's question number one. And then second question is with respect to pre-configured systems gaining traction out there in the marketplace, and obviously, Juniper has a partnership with IBM Secure [ph], can you talk a little bit about how this is developing? And is this a focus for you? And are there, perhaps, other opportunities out there for the company to pursue from a partnership perspective?
Robyn M. Denholm: Okay. Thanks, Brian. I'll talk about gross margins. So in terms of the absolute gross margins between T and MX and routing, in particular, versus switching and security, go back to the SAM slide that I put on gross margins. We made good margins on routing and security. Obviously, switching is slightly lower, QFabric is higher. So it's not a reflection of our expected demand for T4000. We obviously, when I was talking about switching, I gave you the bookings mix versus the revenue mix. So the book, they obviously -- the overall mix of switching in the quarter for Q4 was lower than we've seen. So that had a positive impact, if you like, to mix in terms of the gross margin factors. But overall, the gross margins are healthy. We're happy with where we are in terms of our long-term model range. Obviously, we called that range out in June as well at 63% to 66%, and 2 quarters in a row, different factors, but we're in that 65% range, which we're comfortable with. In the next quarter, volume clearly plays a role in our gross margin. So given the revenues down quarter-over-quarter, you would expect to have an impact on the gross margins just related to that volume drop quarter-over-quarter.
Robert L. Muglia: And, Brian, the second question you asked was related to our partnership with IBM and some work we've done with IBM and a distribution partner, Arrow, that we both work with. Fundamentally, IBM has put together the PureFlex Systems, and we've worked with Arrow and IBM to now integrate QFabric nodes in the top-of-rack of those integrated systems. And that allows the systems to operate in a standard 2-tier Ethernet mode or in a QFabric mode. And we've gone through the testing and certification to make sure that we've got a fantastic solution for customers who look to have a fully integrated solution. I think that was announced last week in our Global Partner Conference. I mentioned, too, we continue to work very closely with a number of partners in the industry. I think we also announced in 2012, the second half of 2012, completing the interoperability testing with EMC and the EMC storage in QFabric. And so these are just examples of use cases and scenarios where we've been working with partners and we're pleased. It's early days with the IBM, Arrow work that we just announced last week, but we do feel good about the fact we've got a reconfigured, tested, certified solution from both IBM and Juniper that we can stand behind with our customers who want a fully integrated stack.
Operator: Our next question is from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I just had a clarification first for Robyn and then a question. When you commented, Robyn, that in the current deferred revenue decline, most of that was due to the recognition of some large software piece of revenue, can you just clarify which segment that was recognized in? Was it in routing or switching or security? And then when you highlighted a couple of the areas of weakness in Q4, namely one in a large China service provider and then also in the federal segment, for each of those, can you just comment on whether you expect those to come back either in the first quarter or in the full year 2013?
Robyn M. Denholm: So, Simona, in terms of the deferred revenue, it wasn't software that we recognized, it was actually systems. So it was in the PSD area, largely in routing. And that's -- the features that we're talking about were releases of Junos with the features that caused the deferral in the first place, if you like, in terms of commitments on those features. So thank you for the clarification. It was the systems revenue that actually the deferral came from.
Kevin R. Johnson: Yes, and on the second part of your question, Simona, let me address it. I think as Robyn mentioned, a large service provider in China, we had a big project that completed in Q3, and so that created a comparable from Q3, and we continue to drive opportunities in China. And service provider spending will be lumpy as it is in other customers as they start, stop projects, but the service provider sector overall, we think the trend of a more prude spending cycle will continue to unfold. In U.S. federal segment, I think that -- as U.S. federal has been a customer set that's been down in 2012, and certainly, was down in Q4. And given the situation that our U.S. government is dealing with whether it's the fiscal cliff, the debt ceiling, the budget, I don't anticipate that becoming more clear anytime soon. But we will all see.
Operator: Our next question is from Kevin Dennean of Citigroup.
Kevin J. Dennean - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: You clearly sound better on the service provider outlook, and you mentioned that you have plans to take share in routing in 2013. Can you discuss a little bit where you think the opportunity to take share in routing is? Is it core? Is it Edge? Is it the PTX ramping? And also maybe where you see the biggest opportunities to do that in terms of geographies.
Kevin R. Johnson: Let me just -- I'll just kick it off, but I'll let Rami add to this. I think if you just look at the Infonetics share data on routing, Q1 of 2012 was a bottom point. And sequentially, since Q1, Q2 and Q3, we've gained very modest amount of share, but we've been gaining share slightly. We'll see what the numbers play out for Q4. And Rami, I'll let you kind of share your perspective on the product side and the different areas of network that we feel we've got good strength and position to gain share.
Rami Rahim: Sure. So in routing, 2 primary areas, I would say, first is -- and both in the service provider, first in the Edge, the other one in the core. In the Edge, it's really all about execution towards our Universal Edge strategy that we have been working on for the last several years, in fact. We continually enhance the feature set of our MX product such that it delivers new and interesting offerings that satisfy our customers' requirements. So that puts it into different applications like business services, residential services and increasingly, mobile services. And as you also know in the Edge, one of the things that we did in 2012 was that we complemented our Edge offering with an end-to-end solution for mobile backhaul and Universal Access. So all of these, I think, are going to be big drivers for us in 2013. In the core as well, I would say that we have a very rich offering right now with the PTX sort of as a disruptive play for transport. T Series has a really nice investment protection play to increase the capacity of existing T Series deployments especially. And also the introduction of the MX 2020 that we are, this quarter, that will essentially give us a bit of a different approach of an all-out services approach for Edge, core and aggregation. So I think we've got a really rich set of offerings in the core as well.
Operator: Our next question is from Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer.
Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Robyn, I wanted to dig a little bit into the switching again. Can you tell us a little bit more color on the revenue in the quarter, splitting it between QFabric, the EX and your WiFi business? And the second question regarding the order figure, I just want to make sure that we're looking at this on an apples-to-apples basis. Clearly, you have a book to bill in this segment above 1, but can you tell us what was it from -- in the third quarter? I'm just trying to understand whether this 19% quarter-over-quarter is off a low number from the third quarter or off of solid strong number in the third as well.
Robyn M. Denholm: Yes. Thank you, Ittai. So in terms of the second question around the order patterns and that type of things, I called out the orders for switching because obviously, that was a different pattern to revenue, so I always want to give you insight into where those patterns are different. So in the fourth quarter, we did see strong orders as I mentioned before. In terms of the third quarter, there was nothing unusual about the third quarter, otherwise I would have called that out. And so our view is it is an important data point for you to have in terms of the bookings versus the revenue in the quarter. And as we've mentioned earlier in response to another question, it is different -- was different by enterprise versus service provider. We saw good sequential increase in enterprise revenue. So that is on that question. In terms of the split between the different product families within switching, we have not broken that out on the call and it's not the right time for us to do that. At some point in the future, we may do that, but not today.
Operator: Our next question is from Mark Sue of RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: If we look at the full year and consider the likelihood of a reacceleration in revenue growth on the second half, what would they -- would that mostly be market recovery of switching and routing? Or which state would be a better uptake of some of the new products and also the new SRX products? Can you just -- and your thoughts maybe on what Juniper might do to stimulate demand? And then separately, reading into your comments on capital allocations -- for capital allocation, it sounds like you're so close to announcing a dividend. Maybe if you can highlight your comfort with future cash flows.
Kevin R. Johnson: Well, I'll let you take the second one, Robyn. Thanks for your questions, Mark. Go ahead, Robyn.
Robyn M. Denholm: So, Mark, in terms of the dividend, we're not announcing a dividend. We would tell you if we were announcing a dividend. We're not doing that at some point. Obviously, our cash flows are strong, and we've had opportunistic repurchases over the last few quarters to bring the share count down and also obviously return capital to shareholders at the right time. So our point of view in terms of -- we have a prudent capital allocation strategy that balances our growth agenda, both organic and inorganic. And our M&A strategy has not changed. We'll continue to do technology tuck-ins over time, and then also our repurchase program. So the 3 things are our capital allocation program.
Kevin R. Johnson: Yes, and your first question, Mark, I think I would sort of highlight 4 things that I think are important and relevant in the question of how we stimulate demand, how we go about creating opportunities for us to grow share in a market that on the service provider side, should be improving throughout the year. The first is we've got to start with great products. And I think when we look at our routing portfolio, I think we feel like not only have we introduced great new products, but we've enhanced our existing product set, enhanced them with new features that Rami made, and fundamentally, we've improved quality of those products as well. So I think when we look at everything from what we're doing in core routing to Edge routing to the access and aggregation layers of routing, we feel like we've got a very, very compelling portfolio and one that is just stronger today than it was a year ago. And you look then across our switching fabric portfolio and with continued focus on that, we continue to see growth opportunities, and certainly in the areas of security, we have a very strong service provider security business. And we've acknowledged there were some gaps, competitive gaps in our enterprise security portfolio that we've been closing. So I think in all dimensions of the product setting, we've strengthened our product sets. So it's got to start with great products. Number two, we look at our key accounts, our largest customers. We've really focused on how we execute well and deepening those relationships with those key accounts. And that's where the work that we've been doing to win a number of these projects and really align the value that we're bringing to those accounts with the strategy that they're on. We think we've deepened those relationships, and it's been shown in our customer satisfaction surveys. We just finished our customer sat survey at the end of 2012, and overall satisfaction with Juniper is up; overall satisfaction with the quality of account management, up; product quality, up; service and support, up. So we've really engaged in a deeper way, and we're seeing good results from that. The third then is our partners. We just hosted our Global Partner Conference last week in Las Vegas. We has over 1,000 people live at the event and over 2,000 attending via webcast, and continuing to educate and arm our partners with the information they need to go grow their business and do it based on Juniper technology. I think we had a very, very, very good event and a lot of very positive energy there. And so when I look at it, those are kind of 3 examples of things that we're very focused on, and all those things come down to excellence and execution and how we're focused on both the innovation agenda and the go-to-market agenda and just executing better. And that's going to help us.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thank you. That is all the time we have for the call today. We'd like to thank everyone for joining us. And your IR team is hosting several events during the quarter, including one at Mobile World Congress. We hope you'll be able to join us via webcast and we'll be sending out details soon. Thanks, everyone, for joining us.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Juniper Networks Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Kathleen Nemeth, Vice President, Investor Relations for Juniper Networks. Thank you. Ms. Nemeth, you may begin.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Here on the call today are Kevin Johnson, Chief Executive Officer; Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial Officer; Stefan Dyckerhoff, Executive Vice President, Platform Systems Division; and Bob Muglia, Executive Vice President, Software Solutions Division. Please remember when listening to today's call that statements concerning Juniper's business outlook, economic and market outlook, future financial operating results and overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, and without limitation to, economic conditions, generally or within the networking industry; changes in overall technology spending; the network capacity requirements of service providers; the timing of orders and shipments; manufacturing and supply chain constraints; variation in the mix of products sold; customer perception and acceptance of our products; litigation; and other factors listed in our most recent 10-Q filed with the SEC. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event, facts or circumstances change after the date of this call. In discussing the financial results, Robyn will first present results on a GAAP basis and for purposes of today's discussion, will also review non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why the management team considers non-GAAP information, a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult our 8-K filed with the SEC today. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results, please see today's press release. In general, non-GAAP results exclude certain nonrecurring charges, amortization of purchased intangibles and other acquisition charges and expenses related to stock-based compensation. On today's call, Robyn will also be providing forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis, other than that with respect to revenue and share count. All guidance is forward-looking, and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier. GAAP guidance measures are not available on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to certain charges, which are excluded from the non-GAAP guidance estimates. Please note that today's call is scheduled to last for 1 hour. [Operator Instructions]. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin.
Kevin R. Johnson: Thank you, Kathleen, and welcome, everyone. All of our major financial metrics were in line or ahead of our guided ranges in what continues to be a challenging environment. We remain focused on those things that are within our control and on developing and delivering great solutions for our customers. During the third quarter, we began to implement some of the initiatives we outlined broadly in last quarter's conference call. We have streamlined our organization, consolidated functional overlap and clarified our priorities. These actions are designed to best align the company's resources with our strategic priorities. They will also allow us to sharpen our focus, enable agility and drive efficiencies. We do this with a clear recognition that it is the culture of innovation within our company that enables our customers' business success and creates value for all our stakeholders. I'll focus my comments today on how we are performing in the market, including our progress relative to our new products. I also want to address some of the questions I know many of you have on the increasing industry focus around network programmability and software-defined networks, referred to as SDN. These are areas where we are very active. Robyn will walk you through some of the specifics on our financials, and we will conclude with Q&A that will include Bob Muglia and Stefan Dyckerhoff. Our total revenue was up both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. We continue to see healthy performance in our Service Provider business, including improving demand by our largest U.S. customers and good results in the EMEA and APAC regions. The Enterprise story is mixed, with good quarter-over-quarter growth driven by EMEA and APAC, but offset somewhat by softness in the Americas. Our Service Provider revenue increased 4% quarter-over-quarter and 3% year-over-year. We continue to expect to see a more typical pattern of Service Provider spend within the industry, with second half investment levels higher than first. I'm pleased to note that the upgrade cycle relative to the T4000 core routers is underway and customer engagement around PTX is very strong. Our PTX product complements our T4000 core routers by collapsing multiple existing core networks into a single MPLS-based transport network, and we're seeing good customer feedback for both products. These innovations provide us competitive differentiation. With PTX in particular, we now have more than 15 customers, including recent strategic wins with companies like Optus in Australia and XO Communications here in the U.S. We believe we are off to a very promising start with PTX. We had a good quarter in Edge routing, and we continue to build on the success of our flagship MX platform. Earlier this month, we announced the industry's most powerful Edge routing platform, the MX2020, to enable rapid service creation and service delivery. It's the only Edge platform capable of delivering broadband, mobile and business services on one platform. In addition, we announced a series of software offerings that include our service delivery gateway and the JunosV App Engine, that offers a broad set of solutions on the MX. Switching revenue was up solidly both sequentially and year-over-year. We continue to take share with the EX with recent customer wins such as Suncor, the top 5 North American energy company. We also continue to win new customers with QFabric. Recent wins include the University of Frankfurt and in the APAC region, BOCI, a leading cross-border platform provider for diversified financial services firms in China. BOCI is one of several customers deploying our QFabric M as its new data center core. We're making good progress in rebuilding momentum in security. We grew in low-double digits on a percentage basis quarter-on-quarter. Demand for high-end SRX within the Service Provider sector was also strong this quarter, growing quarter-on-quarter. But we also saw gains across most of our product families, lending to our confidence that our security business is beginning to stabilize. We're making good progress towards the objective we laid out at the Analyst Meeting to exit 2013 with an annualized run rate of $600 million in new product revenue. QFabric, PTX and T4000 each posted good revenue in the third quarter. The ACX Universal Access product family began shipping in Q3 and MX2020 will begin shipping in Q4. MobileNext is now running production traffic with one of our mobility customers, and we continue to engage with additional customers on insertion opportunities with our mobile packet core solution. As we talk about new products and innovation, I want to address network programmability and what we're doing around software-defined networks. We have a few key pillars that define our SDN strategy. First, we continue to believe that a software-driven network platform will ultimately deliver maximum business value for our customers. This is the vision behind the new network that we laid out 3 years ago and continue to deliver upon. Junos is a key pillar of this programmability strategy. Next, we believe that the focus of SDN is initially around data center switching. The data center is where SDN solutions can drive the most business value for customers. Today, we have a data center fabric solution in market with QFabric. It was architected with some common principles of SDN. For example, our QFabric Director, at its essence, is a software-driven controller for the QFabric system. So we have this foundation to build on as we continue to evolve QFabric in our entire data center portfolio. We know that lots of people are building SDN controllers. What that means for us is that we need to make sure our network systems work with as many of those controllers as possible. Open standards have always been a core underpinning of our innovation strategy. That means our systems need to support SDN protocols, including OpenFlow, and that's exactly what we're delivering. We initially demonstrated OpenFlow on the MX in 2011, and this year we extended that to the EX. We will have a productized version of OpenFlow 1.3 on the MX, EX and QFabric next year, so that our data center solutions can inter-operate with these many SDN controllers that are being built. We are actively engaging with several customers on the use cases where we think SDN can deliver the most value. We have a solution that is architected with SDN principles in QFabric running in many customers' data centers today. We continue to gain traction with customers as we build out our feature sets. We are also building SDN APIs including OpenFlow into our systems. And as we do this throughout our product roadmap, we are continuing to evolve the portfolio. We think we're making pretty good progress. I'll wrap up my comments by reiterating that we executed well in the third quarter, and we took the necessary steps to restructure the company to sharpen our focus on the right priorities, enable agility and drive efficiencies across the company. The actions we are taking to align our resources with our strategic priorities are ahead of schedule and that further strengthens our position as we look to drive revenue growth in 2013. The macro environment probably isn't going to become any more certain in the near term, but we continue to focus on our own execution as we manage through this in line with our operating principles. We believe our traction is increasing across all 3 of our product areas; routing, switching and security, and that includes our new products as we move towards the expectation we set at our Analyst Meeting in June. Before I hand over to Robyn, I want to note that we also issued a press release today regarding our Platform Systems division. Stefan Dyckerhoff's role within Juniper will be changing. After many successful years as an operating executive, Stefan has made the decision to pursue a career as a venture capitalist. At the same time, Stefan will remain actively engaged with Juniper. Beginning in January 2013, he will transition to a new role as a staff consultant, supporting me and the executive team. In this role, he will continue to work with the executive team on strategy and some key customer engagements. As Stefan shifts into his new role, I'm pleased to note that Rami Rahim, a 15-year Juniper veteran and key architect of our routing portfolio, will succeed Stefan in the leadership role of PSD. Stefan will work closely with Rami to ensure a smooth transition. Stefan, would you like to add a few comments?
Stefan Dyckerhoff: Thank you, Kevin. My decision to change career path is driven by a long-standing personal aspiration to work with entrepreneurs as a venture capitalist with the goal of financing market defining companies. Juniper's product portfolio and our roadmaps are stronger than they have ever been, and we are starting to see the results of the work over the last years, with early signs of increased momentum on T4000, PTX, MX, ACX and QFX that will enable future growth for Juniper. I have worked with Rami for many years, and he has played a key role in Juniper's success to date. I'm confident that he is the right executive to lead the Platform Systems division, and I look forward to working with him, both during the transition phase and then throughout 2013 as an advisor. I want to add my personal thanks to the employees at Juniper for all of their support during my many years with the company, and look forward to staying connected with Juniper with my new role. Thank you. With that, I will hand it over to Robyn.
Robyn M. Denholm: Thank you, Stefan, and good afternoon, everyone. Juniper delivered third quarter revenue growth on both the quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis, and we improved our operational performance. While many customers remain cautious in an uncertain near-term environment, we continue to see positive long-term demand fundamentals for high-performance networking. We are focused on the things we can control. So let me update you on our progress with our cost structure initiatives. Last quarter, we announced that efforts were underway to bring our cost structure more in line with our long-term model. The team has initiated multiple actions, including a reduction in our workforce of approximately 500 positions, supply chain and procurement activities, as well as several facility consolidations and other cost saving measures. In the third quarter, these actions have resulted in pretax charges of $83 million, associated primarily with workforce reductions, inventory, facility and other asset write-downs. We expect to have additional charges in the next several quarters primarily related to facilities and other asset write-downs. Our employees remain focused on executing our strategy to drive revenue growth and disciplined operational execution, and I would like to thank them for their hard work and ongoing commitment during this turbulent time. Looking at our demand metrics for the quarter, the book-to-bill was greater than one, with product deferred revenue and product backlog increasing sequentially. Customer demand this quarter for T4000 and PTX reflected design wins with good adoption across all 3 geographies. Total revenue was $1,118,000,000, an increase of 4% sequentially and 1% year-over-year. The sequential increase was due to growth in APAC and EMEA across both the Service Provider and Enterprise sectors. The year-over-year increase was due to U.S. Service Provider and International Enterprise growth. For the third quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.03. This reflected the impact of the charges I noted earlier, which totaled $0.16 per share. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.22, up $0.03 sequentially and down $0.06 year-over-year. The sequential increase reflected our revenue growth and improved operational performance. Now, let me provide some color on revenue by region, business segment and market. Americas revenue was down 5% sequentially and up 1% year-over-year. The sequential decrease was due primarily to U.S. Enterprise. The year-over-year increase reflected Service Provider growth, particularly in large U.S. carriers. EMEA revenue was up 7% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. This increase over last quarter reflected improved Enterprise revenue and some new wins in Service Provider. While we did see revenue improvement this quarter, we still see a soft demand environment in the region. APAC revenue was up 26% sequentially and down 1% year-over-year, with sequential increases in both Service Provider and Enterprise. We saw good growth across the region, particularly in China. Now, let me review our revenue by segment. Platform Systems division revenue was $893 million, up 2% sequentially and 1% year-over-year. PSD router product revenue was $488 million, which was flat sequentially and down 7% year-over-year. Our new products continue to gain traction in the marketplace. We have seen good engagement in all 3 geographies on both T4000 and the PTX core products. Year-over-year, we saw good growth from the MX products and as anticipated, the older products of M&E were the main reason for the year-over-year decline in routing. Total router product revenue, including both PSD and SSD, increased 2% sequentially to $514 million. Total switching product revenue increased 4% sequentially and 19% year-over-year to $146 million. We continue to take share with our portfolio of EX and QFabric switching products. SSD revenue in the quarter was $225 million, up 11% sequentially and flat year-over-year. Total security product revenue was $178 million, up 12% sequentially and down 7% year-over-year. The sequential increase reflected gains across most product families. High end SRX product revenue increased 18% sequentially and was down slightly year-over-year, reflecting Service Provider deployment timing. And we expect continued revenue fluctuations for this product. Branch SRX, which is reported as part of PSD, continues to make good progress with Enterprise customers and was up 7% sequentially and 2% year-over-year. Looking more closely at the markets we address, Service Provider revenue was $705 million, up 4% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. The sequential growth was due to improved performance with large Service Providers globally and content service providers. Enterprise revenue was $413 million, up 5% sequentially and down 2% year-over-year. The increase was driven by new financial services and public sector account wins in EMEA and APAC. The year-over-year decline was due to lower revenue in the U.S. Federal and Financial Services sector compared to strong third quarter of last year. Moving onto gross margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margins for the third quarter increased to 65.6% compared to 63.4% last quarter. While the sequential increase reflected our continued supply chain efficiency improvements, approximately 100 basis points of the increase was due to items, which we do not expect to recur. Non-GAAP product gross margins were 66.8% versus 64.7% in the quarter. Non-GAAP services gross margins were 62.2%, up 2.8 points from the prior quarter, reflecting productivity improvement. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased sequentially to $544 million due to the timing of additional prototype costs, annual employee merit awards and higher variable expenses. Looking at headcount, we ended the quarter with 9,584 employees and this does not reflect the impact of our workforce reduction, which I discussed earlier. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 16.9%. This sequential increase of 1.9 points was driven by higher revenue and gross margins, with operating expenses flat as a percentage of revenue. The GAAP tax rate was 56.7% for the quarter. This is up sequentially due primarily to the effect of the restructuring and other associated charges. The non-GAAP tax rate was 34.4%. This is higher than the prior quarter, primarily due to the geographic mix of income. And as a reminder, the tax rates reflect no renewal of the R&D tax credit. Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $3 billion of net cash and investments. Cash flow from operations was $173 million. DSO was a healthy 32 days in the quarter. Compared to the prior quarter, capital expenditures were down slightly and depreciation was up slightly. We continue to move ahead with our build out of our Sunnyvale Campus. This enables our facility consolidation. We repurchased 13.9 million shares for $250 million at an average price of $18. We have $818 million remaining on our current authorization, and we will calibrate our buybacks in future quarters with market conditions at the time. Based on current trends, we clearly recognize the opportunity to continue to do more. Now, I will review our outlook for the fourth quarter. As a reminder, these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis, except for revenue and share count. At this point, there is no evidence of any indication of a significant improvement in the spending environment over the next few quarters. We expect customers to remain cautious with their investment decisions. We are pleased with the progress towards the new product revenue goal that we discussed at FAM of an annualized $600 million run rate for our new products exiting Q4 of 2013. As a company, we remain focused on driving revenue growth and disciplined operational execution. As an update on the cost reduction activities, we are on track to our cost savings goal. Since the end of the quarter, we have taken steps to reduce our workforce by approximately 500 positions. This essentially completes our planned workforce reduction. We have also made good progress on our supply chain and procurement activities, and we anticipate that the majority of the $150 million savings will be in operating expenses, and there will be some savings that will be realized in both product and services cost of goods sold. I'm pleased with the focus on efficiency within the company, and I'm confident that we will continue to make good progress towards our cost reduction objectives. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenues to range from $1,100,000,000 to $1,130,000,000. Gross margins are expected to be in the range of 63.5% to 64.5%. Operating expenses are expected to be roughly flat with the third quarter. The benefit of our cost reduction activities will largely offset the typical sequential increase in OpEx in the fourth quarter. We expect operating margin to range from 14% to 16%. This is expected to result in a non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $0.19 and $0.22 per share assuming a flat share count a tax rate of 32% and assumes no renewal of the R&D tax credit. In summary, we continue to drive improvements in our capital structure. We are driving top line revenue growth with our innovative products, and we are aligning our cost structure to sharpen our focus, enable agility and drive efficiencies. Now I will hand it over to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan.
Rod B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I just wanted to ask you a little bit about the revenues. The revenue report here in the quarter is pretty good, routing revenue is stable, yet you seem to be guiding for flattish revenues again next quarter, and I guess that implies pretty flat routing revenue. But I think the commentary, when you guys were talking about routing, suggests that things are getting a little bit better, you're starting to see the T4000 ramp. I just wanted to explore that a little bit because, clearly, in Q4, we normally would expect to see some seasonality even though the spending environment's weak. We ought to see some sort of pick up and just trying to understand whether you guys are discounting your sales funnel more aggressively because you think the environment has gotten more uncertain? Or are you just not seeing the sales funnel develop in the first place? Can you give us any more color on why you're giving us the kind of revenue guidance.
Robyn M. Denholm: Yes, thanks, Rod. In terms of the revenue guidance for the fourth quarter, our customers continue to be cautious in terms of their spending, but they're continuing. And clearly, what we take into account, when we're looking at our guidance for any period of time is we look at, not just the revenue for the quarter, but also our deferred revenue and our bookings in the quarter, as well as discussions with our customers, and we believe that over this next couple of quarters they will continue to be cautious in their spending pattern. And, Kevin, would you like to comment as well?
Kevin R. Johnson: Yes, thanks, Rod. I'll just add to Robyn's comments. In the U.S., I think we continue to see good demand from our service providers, and especially with the Tier 1 service providers were working with. Clearly, in the U.S., I think, this will be a year that we see a more typical first half versus second half capital expenditure plan, and we have to net that with the fact that we did have some large PTX projects that kicked off in the first half and how that balances. But in the U.S., we feel good. In Europe, I think there still some softness in Europe, and we're very cautious about the situation in Europe. In Asia Pacific, I would characterize this as stable. I think we had a good performance this quarter in China, and we'll stay focused on Asia. But we net that all together, and I think that came together in the guidance that we have for the quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Tal Liani with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Tal Liani - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I'm trying to understand the drivers for growth this quarter. Pretty good growth but it's kind of coming in the wrong places, in the sense that you had, going into this quarter, you had 3 new products, whether it's a PTX, the T and you also have a little bit older, but also newer Edge portfolio. And that's the flat part. And the growth part is in security, where you don't have actually new products. Same thing when it comes to geography. Europe, everyone else is reporting, on weakness in Europe, and you're showing very strong growth or relatively speaking, nice growth in Europe. So I'm trying to understand whether the growth we have seen this past quarter is related to spending or something you have done on your part getting to customers, specifically what have you done in Europe, et cetera, just to understand the trends.
Robyn M. Denholm: Thanks, Tal, I'll start and then I'll ask Kevin to come in as well. So if you look at -- the demand in the quarter is, obviously, a reflection of not just the revenue in the quarter but also the bookings and the deferred revenue in the quarter. And so to me, as we commented in the prepared remarks, we're seeing good demand for our core products, both in terms of PTX and, as Kevin mentioned, we had started to see the beginning of the upgrade cycle for the T4000 as well, which we are very pleased with. In terms of MX, you saw good sequential growth in that, and we're continuing to drive feature sets, not just on the MX itself but also in terms of the software that runs on top of the MX as well, and again Kevin mentioned that in terms of new product announcements that we've made as well. In security, it is -- on the Service Provider side, we continue to do well in terms of the demand environment out there. And that is what drove the sequential revenue growth, as we commented in the prepared remarks. Enterprise, we do believe we've stabilized. In terms of the demand environment, there's still work to be done there but that team is on top of that. So Kevin would you like to...
Kevin R. Johnson: Yes, I'll just add to Robyn's comments, Tal. I think if we look at MX, MX showed sequential and year-on-year growth. EX and QFabric showed sequential year-over-year growth. SRX showed sequential growth and flat year-on-year, and I think when we look at those combined with what we see happening with PTX and T, it gives us a positive sense on how product, value proposition of the product. When you look by sector, there's some variances there. Certainty the U.S., we're seeing stronger demand from service providers. When we look at the project, the project run rate and the set of projects that we're doing and that doesn't always translate to a specific revenue in that quarter, but the outlook on projects and the work that we're doing in the U.S., I would say, is positive. In Europe, we had a reasonable quarter on the Service Provider side, but we're very -- still a lot of softness, and we're very cautious on the outlook in Europe. In Asia Pacific, we had a good performance in China but were -- Asia Pacific, I would characterize this as very stable. On the Enterprise side, we saw good Enterprise performance in APAC and EMEA and some softness in the U.S. And the softness in the U.S. is primarily driven by Federal and Financial Services. So you net that together, I think, overall, when we look at product revenue and, as Robyn pointed out, backlog and deferred product revenue, we feel like we're making reasonable progress.
Tal Liani - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And maybe just one follow-up. If that's the case, why are you guiding so low? The quarter is great, and you're guiding much, I mean, lower than our expectations into a seasonally strong quarter. Why is there such conservatism?
Robyn M. Denholm: So, Tal, as I mentioned before, our customers continue to be cautious in terms of the near-term spending environment that they're actually participating in. We continue to have a good dialogue with customers around the world in terms of the product sets that we have. When we set our guidance, we take into account not only the revenue in the quarter, but also the bookings that we've received in the quarter and the deferred revenue. And now our point of view on the fourth quarter is that customers are going to continue to be cautious.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Marshall with ISI Group.
Stephen Patel - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: This is Stephen Patel for Brian Marshall. What do you see as the catalyst that sort of flipped the switch with respect to service providers migrating en masse to your new product platforms, which possess significantly better cost and performance metrics? It seems like carriers, in general, will have to make the investment in light of these quarters and trying to identify the drivers of the migration. Appreciate your thoughts.
Kevin R. Johnson: Thanks for the question, Stephen. I'll take that one, Robyn. I think first of all, with the PTX and the T4000, as those products were released, certainly, customers go through the process of certification and testing them in their labs before they begin deployment. And I think we commented, we now have 15 customers of PTX who are in various stages of that process. On the T4000, there's a process they go through, where they -- first, they upgrade the T Series chassis to be able to handle T4000 line cards. And what we've seen thus far is some good progress on the chassis upgrades and, yet, I think there's still a wave of line card upgrades to come and that's a function of as customers look at their investment priorities and they look at the network -- how hot their network is running and where they need to deploy their capital. Certainty, we think we're positioned for that. And then the MX continues to be a very solid product across the dimensions, the wireless, the wireline and the business services that our customers deliver. So I don't think there's any one specific thing, but it's a wide range of things. And maybe, Stefan, I'll ask if there's any additional color you want to add for Stephen.
Stefan Dyckerhoff: Sure. I think what we're seeing here is kind of the continuation execution of a strategy that we had outlined. So when our customers look at making buying decisions, they look at really fundamentally 2 things: Total cost of ownership and then the ability to generate revenue from new services from the network on the service provider side. So from a total cost of ownership point of view, certainly with the PTX, that's a great way to simplify the network drive down both CapEx, in terms of cost per bit and power usage; and then OpEx, as you simplify. Very similar on the T4000, where we give you a very simple way to upgrade the existing infrastructure to get to a lower cost per bit. At the Edge network, it's a combination of 2 things. It really is total cost of ownership. So certainly, the MX enhancements that we outlined that are shipping next quarter with the MX2000 series, those drive down the total cost of ownership and also give the customer great investment protection story. But then on top of that, this is where service providers generate revenue. So the ability of Junos to evolve support the JunosV App engine so you can have multiple services at the edge of the network reduces the time it takes for service provider to generate revenue. So, those 2 things really drive adoption and, as always, the service providers have a long-term view of these architectural transitions.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Ehud Gelblum with Morgan Stanley.
Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I actually have a litany of questions, so I'll try and put them all together. First of all, Robyn, can you give us a sense on the $150 million cost savings and the $600 million in new product revenue, both of which you plan to get to by the end of next year. Can you quantify those so we can actually track them each quarter? Are we on having taken care of $30 million of annualized cost savings and $165 million of the $600 million new product revenue, any sense you can give on that would be great. And then China being strong and Service Provider was interesting. Was that kind of a onetime deal or is that continuing thing? Is that a large deal that you won? Or is that may be a multi-quarter deal or is that something that you think is more continuous over time? And then finally, if you can give us any sense of about how large MX was, you said it was nice, it was good, just give us a sense of that.
Robyn M. Denholm: Thanks, Ehud. In terms of the revenue progress against the $150 million for the Q4 2013 exit point on $600 million annualized run rate, as I mentioned on the call, we're on track. We'll give you periodic updates in terms of where we are against that goal. And as we've mentioned before that is against all of the 5 new product areas that we talked about at FAM. In terms of the cost reduction activity, I am pleased where we are as well in terms of the cost reduction activity. We are on track to achieve the $150 million in terms of total cost reductions, both in terms of OpEx and COGS for next year. And we'll give you an update as to where we are against that as we move forward through the year.
Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Because I didn't get an answer, could I get -- could you give us a sense about the 100 bps of gross margin boost and where that came from?
Robyn M. Denholm: All right. So, in terms of the -- in the prepared remarks, I talked about 100 basis points of additional cost reduction in the quarter. So if I step back in terms of gross margins, we're pleased with performance in gross margins this quarter. We have seen some improvement in the quarter-over-quarter cost reduction and supply chain efficiencies that we're putting in place. What I also mentioned in the prepared remarks was we did see the onetime benefit of about 100 basis points that we don't expect to recur. And then there are credits and other things like that, that we saw in the quarter that, as I said, I don't expect to recur.
Stefan Dyckerhoff: This is Stefan, let me just briefly comment on the China Service Provider question that you had. I mean, traditionally, we've been strong in China, particularly in core routing with the major carriers. And this is really what we saw this quarter. They're running very large networks, experiencing very large growth and certainly the T Series benefited from that. And from that strength, we're obviously trying to break into other areas of the network, but that's really what drove the business in the near-term.
Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And it's sustainable going forward or it's not just a onetime?
Stefan Dyckerhoff: As always the SP business will be lumpy, right? But we feel good about our position in the architecture and as they see growth and they'll go through the investment cycles and we'll be able to benefit from that.
Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: If I can squeeze in one last one, the gross margin guidance for Q4 is down, yet it seems that a lot of your high-growth -- high-margin businesses, especially T4000, are increasing. I mean even taking into account the 100 bps of onetime boost. Just wondering why the gross margin guidance is down for next quarter?
Robyn M. Denholm: Yes, as I mentioned previously, Ehud, the 100 basis points is onetime. If you take that out of the gross margin performance in the third quarter, it's pretty in line with that. And yes, we did see good performance in terms of mix in the third quarter as well. And so we expect that to continue in the fourth quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I just had a couple of questions on a couple of the different product cycles. First, starting with the T4000, can you just give us a sense of how we can think about the length of that replacement cycle, perhaps by looking back at the T1600, over how many quarters did you see a bulge in sales before you saw that flatten out or decline? And then secondly, as it pertains to the PTX you mentioned that you have now over 15 customers deploying the PTX. Out of those, how many do you think you could have otherwise addressed with a T4000. So this was maybe replacing your own opportunity versus how many do you think were incremental, I mean, might have been competing against and displacing an optical alternative? And just the third product I wanted to touch on was the SRX, where you talked about the 18% sequential increase for the Service Provider segment, can you just expand on what drove that and, again, how broad-based it is and how sustainable it is?
Stefan Dyckerhoff: Hi, Simona, this is Stefan. So let me comment on the first 2. On the T4000, we're happy with the uptake. I would say, in terms of a number of upgrades, it's very consistent to the kind of uptake that we see with the T1600. As customers are more careful about their spend, which we do see, they might upgrade the chassis first and plug in one of the new denser line cards and then hold off on upgrading the rest. So, we think that this cycle might take a little bit longer and be a little bit more sort of flatter in terms of the uptake just because of the spending environment. But overall, in terms of number of T4000s out there, number of customers that's qualified it, very much in line with the T1600 experience. And so this will evolve over multiple years, right? And that's what we saw with the T1600 as well. And as all always, our customers will sort of apply the quarter-to-quarter spending discipline to how they upgrade the infrastructure. On the PTX, we've really seen it play out to where this is complementary to the T4000 upgrade. There are a number of customers that have both T4000 and PTX and working on both. The PTX helps us redefine the architecture and helps us take share in the core [ph] , I think, as we see that play out. There is an opportunity to merge networks into one like we saw from Verizon last quarter. So these are the kinds of opportunities that will drive our growth going forward, and that opens up growth for us in those networks.
Robert L. Muglia: Hi, Simona, this is Bob Muglia. In terms of the SRX and the growth we saw quarter-to-quarter on that in Service Provider, what we're seeing is a wave of deployments around emerging wireless networks, predominantly LTE, which have higher bandwidth requirements which the SRX is particularly well-suited for. So we see that as an area where we have a very good market position. It is the Service Provider market. So like everything with service providers, it is lumpy. And so that means the performance could vary quarter-to-quarter, but we do see this as a long-term trend, in which we remain very well-positioned. You didn't ask specifically about the Enterprise, but I'll comment a little bit more on that, while I'm at it. As we've described before, we are in a position of really driving forward and reengaging in the Enterprise space. We've had some areas there where we've not been as strong as we'd like to be, particularly around things like manageability, and we have a very strong program to bring out a new product set to dramatically improve our manageability and security design product. We've had a great deal of engagement with customers of all types with this, with very positive feedback from all of them. We have a very significant release of that coming out later this quarter, as well as incremental updates of that in the first half of next year where we expect to be very well-positioned. The other thing I'll say overall is about our engagement with Enterprise is, is that we are telling and talking to them about an end-to-end integrated security strategy, which they find very, very important and that is enabling us to have a different level of engagement with these Enterprise customers. And that does not translate into revenue immediately, but it does provide a good long-term potential.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal with Barclays.
Jeffrey T. Kvaal - Barclays Capital, Research Division: This is a bigger picture question, perhaps. I think we've seen 3 -- 4 or 5 quarters in a row of either flat or down year-over-year growth. Kevin, you spoke in your intro script about returning to revenue growth next year. What are you seeing that gives you confidence in that? The carriers seem to have managed okay the last 6 quarters or so, why are you confident there's going to be revenue growth next year and should we be thinking about low single-digit revenue growth or upper-single digit? Any comments around that will be very helpful.
Kevin R. Johnson: Yes, thanks for the question, Jeff. The answer from my perspective at a high level is 2 things: Number one, I think it's clear that on the Service Provider side, networks are running hotter, especially when you look at some of the capital expenditures in Europe, as an example, and even through the first half of this calendar year, the addressable market for routing had declined by about 3 percentage points. Yet network traffic, I believe, continues to increase in many cases and putting pressure on, or increasing the utilization of these networks. So number one factor is networks running hotter, which means at some point investment cycles need to kick in. And number two, it's our product cycle. I think I look at routing specifically for service providers, when you look at from the core what we've done with PTX and T4000, to the Edge and aggregation to what we've done with MX from even with this new release of the MX2000 family and the software assets on top of the MX. And then all the way to the access layer with the ACX. I think we have got a very rich portfolio of technology and solutions that is differentiated from competition, and that, combined with the fact that networks are running hotter, I think, positions us well for the future. And your second part of your question is can you quantify that, and I'm hesitant to do that because much of that is going to depend on factors as we go into 2013 that are going to have to do with the macro and investment cycles. So I think consistent with the comments Robyn made at the Analyst Meeting. Look, it's our intent to really focus on how we can run this company in a way that we're able to grow faster than the addressable markets. And I think with the things we've done from an innovation standpoint, from a product standpoint, when it comes to routing, I think we're very well-positioned, certainly with switching and what we've done in QFabric, I think we've continued to take share, and we're well-positioned going forward and Bob's comments on security are consistent with the view that we've got a strong value proposition in Service Provider, and we've been taking actions over this last year to strengthen our hand in Enterprise. I feel like those are all the right set of things for us to be doing.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.
Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: A couple of questions for me. First of all, in the weakness in Enterprise in the U.S., you've mentioned financials in public, but can you be a little bit more specific on how execution was in the region, just to make sure that there isn't anything else out there. Many other companies have actually posted good public numbers this quarter. I'm just trying to understand why you don't. And second regarding your Switching business. Kevin, I believe that you mentioned that both EX and QFabric were up quarter-over-quarter. So 2 questions related to that, if that is correct, if I got that right, does that mean about your wireless business was actually down quarter-over-quarter? And second can you give us a little more color on the customer count on QFabric and how many of them are full architecture versus just top-of-rack?
Robyn M. Denholm: Yes, Ittai, so let me start off with the public sector and financial services. So as we commented earlier, we did see strength internationally, sequentially, with our public sector and financial services business. In the U.S., we did have a strong quarter last quarter in terms of public sector, that this quarter was okay from a public sector perspective, but obviously, it was down quarter-over-quarter. So it's a timing perspective. Our public sector team is absolutely fabulous and they're continuing to drive market share wins in the public sector in the areas that we focus on, particularly in the U.S. area. So I'm confident with what they're doing there. In terms of financial services, again, we had a stronger quarter last quarter. We did see that decline quarter-over-quarter in the U.S. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the international business in both of those areas did better this quarter.
Kevin R. Johnson: The only other thing I'd add to Robyn's comments is our business in public sector is really Federal, Federal Government. We're not in state and local governments as much as many others are. So certainly, Robyn's comments are accurate. But when you say public sector, really be thoughtful of Federal. And the second part of your question then was on our switching business, which the comment was, with our switching business, we look at EX and QFabric being up, your question was wireless down. The wireless was not down. Wireless was flattish though. It was flat to up but not as significant as the increase that we're seeing in the switching and QFabric. And I think that's reflective. We've got a very strong focus on data center scenarios and a great solution for the campus and branch as well. But Stefan, you want to add to that one?
Stefan Dyckerhoff: Yes, I think on the wireless side, this is also a function of where we are on the product portfolio. We recently introduced a sort of new access point, a sort of new management capabilities that's coming out later this year and early next year. And that really will be the key for us to drive forward. But as Kevin mentioned, it was flat to slightly up quarter-over-quarter. So we continue to invest in that business.
Kevin R. Johnson: And then the final question you had was related to QFabric. I'll just comment, this was a quarter with QFabric where we saw much more activity on the interconnect and the directors. The full QFabric systems that were connecting together many of the nodes whereas in prior quarters, we're seeing more of the activity on the nodes or the top-of-rack side. So I think I attribute much of that to the fact that the release of the QFabric M interconnect has enabled an entry point for customers now that are now doing more of those deployments. I don't have specific numbers, I apologize on that, but the way I would characterize an answer to your question was this quarter was much more about the full QFabric systems, where in prior quarters, I think there was a lot of groundwork laid for QFabric nodes that are now being connected together into the full data center solution.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Kevin or Stefan, maybe just a thought on the need for the operators to upgrade their networks and where major carriers are with their utilization rates, and I ask because if I look at the performance improvements in your new products, your products get better every year and may now be exceeding network traffic growth. So can your product cycles actually extend the carrier investment cycles? We use the big spending flags every 4 years and we're wondering now if it goes to 5 or 6 years.
Kevin R. Johnson: Good question, Mark. I'll first comment then I'll hand over to Stefan. Look, the engineering work that we do and the innovation we drive is intended to continue to reduce the cost per bit of traffic carried through new innovation and technology in the silicon, in the systems, in the way that comes together with the software. So that's been true for the last 10 or 20 years, as we focused on continuing to innovate and drive down the cost per bit of traffic carried. The second part of your question then is, does that create value proposition for customers? I believe the answer is yes. And then certainly the third part is, if traffic -- if networks are -- if traffic isn't growing as rapidly and networks aren't running as hot, does that have implications in terms of the timing of investments? And certainly every network is different but it would have difference in timing. Customers are going to look to make -- to put their capital where it can make the most impact for them in their business and sometimes that's in the core, when the core gets running too hot. Sometimes that's in the edge. And as Stefan commented earlier on the edge of the network, it's not just about cost per bit carried but it's new services and the way they're monetizing those new services with their customers. So there's a variety of ways that we have to add value to our customers. So Stefan you want to add to that?
Stefan Dyckerhoff: Sure. I think from an overall demand picture, we still see -- when we talk to customers traffic increasing at a very good clip. And fundamentally, the growth of traffic, I mean, is still outstripping what Moore's Law gives you, right? So you how to really invest in the silicon, in the systems to keep up with that growth of traffic. And our customers always push us to build bigger and bigger systems to address this problem. In terms of how they run their networks, as Kevin mentioned, they upgrade their networks for multiple reasons in terms of how hot they run it, where they put capabilities in the network and they'll make those different trade-offs. But their fundamentally going to choose to upgrade if they can either reduce the total cost of ownership or generate new services in addition to the underlying demand curve that drives their business.
Robert L. Muglia: And if I could add one more thing to that, this is Bob Muglia. As we move forward, the opportunity for software is very, very significant in these networks and software is the component which will add significant value for our customers. And we've made some very significant announcements this last quarter in terms of the Universal Edge and the MX, in terms of our software portfolio. And that really is the beginning of what we'll be able to do in the months and years ahead to provide more value to our customers, more than just in terms of the performance that we can deliver, but in terms of their ability to monetize their networks.
Kathleen Nemeth: Operator, we have time for 1 for question.
Operator: Our last question comes from line of Brent Bracelin with Pacific Crest Securities.
Brent A. Bracelin - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: I wanted to go once more into kind of the growth drivers of the business. Obviously, 2 quarters in a row here, we saw 4% consequential rebound in the product revenue. And I think the really bigger question we're trying to ask here is, is this the beginning of a broader recovery where you're starting to see some of these operators that have run these networks hot for a while now, now look to upgrade or after kind of 2 years of revenue being in this $1 billion to $1.19 billion range for years now for Juniper, is this the new normal? And I was wondering if could give us sort of any sense of urgency that you've seen with customers around adding network capacity as you think about kind of the planning process that you're in right now, I imagine for next year. What's your general sense of your ability to capitalize on some of these network expansion plans, if there are any for these carriers over the next year or 2? And could you comment on your ability to kind of gain share. We really haven't seen an accelerated share gain out of Juniper over the last 2 years and just trying to rationalize the opportunity around is this a beginning of a bigger, broader recovery or is this the new normal we should expect for the next 2 years?
Kevin R. Johnson: Yes, let me comment briefly, Brent, and then I'll let Stefan add to it based on his observations. You used the word sense of urgency, do we see some certain of urgency on the spending pattern in service providers? I wouldn't characterize it as a sense of urgency. What I would characterize we are seeing is a very disciplined planning approach that is creating new projects and new need to do upgrades on networks. It's not a sense of urgency to react to adding capacity, but there's a lot of thoughtfulness and discipline in the planning and that planning results in very clear projects with very clear business objectives that customers are trying to achieve. And I feel like if I look over the last 6 months, I think we've secured a number of wins and commitments from these customers where we've competed for these projects, and we've been awarded these projects. Some of these projects have kicked off, some are going to kick off in 2013. But I think that is an indicator that there is clearly value in the investments that they're looking to make, those investments are aligned with key business outcomes they're looking to drive. And the technology footprint that we have and innovation we've delivered is aligning with their business need. I think that, combined with the product cycle that we're in, having strength with the T4000, PTX and the core routing footprint, strength in the Edge with what we've done with MX and expanding that systems platform along with the new software services that Bob highlighted, and then moving us even forward into the access layer, I think that makes us a more competitive, more relevant player that has a fuller portfolio to solve these problems. And so those 2 things, I think, are very positive indicators. Stefan, you want to add to that?
Stefan Dyckerhoff: Yes, maybe just to add a little bit from my many conversations with service providers, I think the one sense of urgency they feel is that they can't just build the network the same old way. So they are looking to reduce the total cost of ownership and their speed and cost to service by considering the right architectural transitions that they should make in the network. And that then coupled with what products can fulfill that, and certainly just like we saw on the MX a couple of years ago, we feel very good about those product cycles that are coming to market now. And that's always going to be a key driver for our business.
Kathleen Nemeth: Okay. We would like to thank everyone for joining us today. We do appreciate your time, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Juniper Networks Second Quarter 2012 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Kathleen Nemeth, Vice President, Investor Relations for Juniper Networks. Thank you, Ms. Nemeth, you may begin.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Here on the call today are Kevin Johnson, Chief Executive Officer; Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial Officer; and Bob Muglia, Executive Vice President, Software Solutions division. Please remember, when listening to today's call, that statement concerning Juniper's business outlook, economic and market outlook, future financial operating results and overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including economic conditions, generally or within the networking industry, changes in overall technology spending, the network capacity requirements for service providers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply chain constraints, variation in the mix of products sold, customer perception and acceptance of our products, litigation and other factors listed in our most recent 10-Q filed with the SEC. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances change after the date of this call. In discussing the financial results, Robyn will first present results on a GAAP basis and for purposes of today's discussion, will also review non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why the management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult our 8-K filed with the SEC today. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP to non-GAAP results, please see today's press release. In general, non-GAAP results exclude certain nonrecurring charges, amortization of purchased intangibles and other acquisition charges and expenses related to stock-based compensation. On today's call, Robyn will also be providing forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a GAAP basis other than that with respect to revenue and share count. All guidance is forward-looking and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier. GAAP guidance measures are not available on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to certain charges, which are excluded from the non-GAAP guidance estimate. Please note that today's call is scheduled to last for 1 hour. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kevin.
Kevin R. Johnson: Thanks, Kathleen, and welcome, everyone. All major financial metrics this quarter were in line or ahead of our guided ranges, and we believe we executed well in what continues to be a challenging environment. The go-forward macro outlook is mixed, but we are focused on what's in our control. We are seeing momentum building in routing, and we see continued growth from our switching portfolio. We are also making good progress on our path to improving the performance of our security business. On the cost side, we are taking steps to reduce ongoing OpEx through a series of targeted efficiency programs over the next several quarters, and Robyn will take you through this in more detail. Finally, we continue to maintain a strong cash position, and we intend to execute against our previously announced repurchase authorization of $1 billion. I'm going to focus my comments today on our key priorities in this near-term environment and how we are executing against them. I'll provide a brief update on the traction we are seeing in the market, including with our new products, and I've asked Bob Muglia, who heads our Software Solutions division, to join the call to talk about developments in security and software. Robyn will also take you through our financial review and our outlook, and then we will take your questions. Our second quarter showed some good performance in key areas, with routing and switching driving results. We believe we are doing well in these markets because we bring a portfolio of products and solutions that deliver outstanding value to our customers. Service providers and, increasingly, enterprises are embracing networks that are flatter, that reduce complexity and cost, while also delivering greater performance and scale. We are helping customers drive more efficient OpEx and greater productivity from their networks. The success of this approach we are taking with the customer can be seen in our expanding wireless footprint. There are 3 in the 4 areas we believe we are well positioned to continue to expand our position wireless. One is our MX Series, which provides customers with a single solution for convergence on the Edge. Second is our SRX offering in security. We have built a strong footprint in helping large service providers secure mobile Internet traffic. And third, our new routing solutions to support service providers as they drive efficiency by collapsing multiple networks in the core. Our PTX offering is off to a good start, and we're deeply engaged with Verizon and others with this solution. Our ACX Universal Access router is also shipping this quarter and is well positioned for the backhaul infrastructure necessary to carry rapidly increasing amounts of mobile traffic. As we look after the second half of the year, we continue to monitor the macro environment closely. We feel pretty good about the U.S. Tier 1 service providers based on our level of engagement and conversations with them. We believe the data points suggest that we can anticipate a modest increase in second half spend as compared to the first half. And as a result, the overall U.S. markets should continue to be an area of strength for us in the second half of the year. This is offset, however, by uncertainty in Europe and slowing growth in some emerging markets. On the Enterprise side, our switching portfolio, along with QFabric, drove strong performance in the Enterprise. I'm pleased to note that General Dynamics, a leading global systems integrator in the aerospace and defense industries, has deployed QFabric as part of its core network in 2 of its U.S. data centers. QFabric was chosen by General Dynamics for its ability to deliver scale, performance and flexibility needed to deliver critical applications in support of their mission. We have momentum in switching, and we believe we will continue to outgrow the market, despite the current mixed outlook for overall Enterprise spending. We believe the public sector market will be challenging in light of the austerity measures in a number of countries and budget constraints in the U.S. In security, we are very focused on improving our market position. SRX remains a strong product for customers where scale matters, both at service providers and large enterprises. And as we talked about at the Analyst Meeting, we have a clear path to strengthen other elements of our portfolio. The new security designer offering is one example, and we like how the solution is coming together. Bob will fill you in more in a moment. Looking out over the second half of the year, we are focused on execution near term, while positioning the company to deliver on its long-term growth objectives. To that end, we have 3 clear near-term priorities. First, continue to drive momentum of our new products with the right sales and marketing efforts. We're encouraged by our early progress, particularly with our routing and data center offerings. We set our revenue targets for new innovations at the Analyst Meeting, and we are very focused on those. Second, we are aligning our resources with focus on the right projects and activities that drive performance now and keep us on a path to deliver meaningful innovations to our customers. The priorities include revenue generation, customer satisfaction and the next wave of innovation at Juniper. Third, we are aligning our overall cost structure for efficiency and effectiveness. We are focused on driving operational excellence and productivity throughout the organization. We are committed to delivering against the long-term model we laid out at the Analyst Meeting. This includes ongoing initiatives across the company in areas like supply chain, procurement, systems and processes, shared services and more. We're also taking steps with respect to our cost structure and Robyn will take you through that in more detail shortly. So to wrap up, we had a good second quarter. We believe we have executed well in the first half of 2012 that has remained challenging. We're delivering good performance relative to the market in routing and switching, and we are on a defined path to strengthen our product set and security. Our new products are gaining traction in the market, and we will continue to ramp this year and next. As we look to the second half of the year, we are not planning for any improvement in the macro environment. To manage through this period, we've set clear priorities for how we run the business with revenue generation, resource allocation and careful cost management all top of mind. Thanks again for your time today, and I'll now turn the floor over to Bob Muglia. Bob?
Robert L. Muglia: Great. Thanks, Kevin. It's great to be on the call with everyone today. Last month at FAM, Stefan and I shared our view of the new network architecture, how we've aligned our 2 divisions around the domain-driven approach that syncs with our customers' view of their network and how we're approaching the marketplace from both the R&D and go-to-market perspectives. Just to recap that briefly, our business is organized around 2 divisions: Systems and Software. Within the Software Division at Juniper, our philosophy is that software complements our systems. So our 2 divisions work closely together. In each division, we target 3 businesses: routing, switching and security. And for those businesses, we focus around the 7 domains that comprise the major components of the network, whether we're talking to Service Provider or Enterprise customers. This approach, 2 customer segments, 3 businesses and 7 domains, or 2-3-7, enables Juniper to conduct business-focused conversations with our customers, leveraging our unique understanding of networking technology and innovation to help them address their most pressing business challenges. With that as a backdrop, what I'd like to do with my time here today is zero in a little more on our strategy and progress in security and how that relates to our broader activities in software development, as well as the Riverbed relationship that we announced earlier today. I'll start with security as that has been a major area of focus for me since I arrived at Juniper last year. We continue to be pleased with our leadership position for the high-end SRX within the Service Provider community. In Q2, we saw good high-end SRX sales to SPs based largely on the growth of LTE networks and the benefit the SRX provides to the solution. We recognized that we have work to do to regain our momentum in Enterprise security, but in Q2 we did see quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year growth in Enterprise security for the first time in quite a while. As we have commented recently, we are enhancing the features and capabilities of the SRX platform to meet the needs of all enterprises, from large customers to smaller deployments at the campus and branch level. In the short term, we are focused on management and the AppSecure portfolio, our application visibility and control solution. We are also building on our success in network security to deliver a next-generation content security services, including building on our recent acquisition of Mykonos, thus enabling security intelligence across the entire security ecosystem and transforming the customer experience. Our focus on network management starts with Security Design, which we talked about at FAM. This is an application hosted on the Junos Space platform. The interface is designed from the ground up to handle the breadth the security management challenges, including NextGen firewall, PoP firewall policy, IPS, network address translation policy and perhaps most importantly, VPN management. We've had 2 releases of the product thus far, and security design is now deployed in production within a Tier 1 service provider. We've collected a considerable amount of customer feedback from Enterprise accounts to whom we've given early access to the technology, and we are quite pleased with their response. We have put a significant investment in terms of both R&D and customer engagement into developing Security Design, and we believe it provides us with very capable security management. Further releases later this year of Security Design will reflect the feedback we have received, and we expect to see deployments beginning in Q4 continuing through 2013. Hopefully, you saw our press announcement today regarding our technology relationship with Riverbed. I wanted to spend a few minutes on this because it will also play into our broader software strategy, including security. This relationship recognizes the key role application acceleration plays as the network and application layers begin to converge. Both Juniper and Riverbed are focused on delivering high-performance security and scale in this environment. As a part of the Riverbed relationship, we are pleased that Riverbed has selected Junos Pulse as the mobile client for the delivery of their industry-leading application acceleration solution. A key part of the relationship is our licensing of Riverbed's Layer 7 application delivery controller technology. We plan to leverage this technology as a component in building out integrated solutions for scaling data center applications within the network. There will be multiple components to this integrated solution, existing Juniper systems and software capabilities, license technologies such as Riverbed's and new technologies that we are developing internally over time. The relationship with Riverbed is an important one as we think about our overall strategy for software within the context of market trends. We start with the premise that software is core to our innovation strategy. It complements our systems. Today, we have licensed strategic technology for application delivery that complements our existing platform and software assets. This is important for the long term. The Juniper products that we will build using the application delivery controller technology won't ship for some time. Yet it's clear, with the evolution of the new network, that software such as this will play a bigger and bigger role across the routing, switching and security businesses we serve. We're making foundational investments today that position us well as the new network becomes more software-defined. In summary, this is an important time for the industry and for Juniper. And software programmability will be key to the new network and -- of which software will play a major role. We have a history in this space, and we are investing today in building on our strengths, both organically and via acquisitions of key technology. We approach this opportunity that way we always approach innovation, with a strong focus on understanding the customer and their needs. Security plays a major role in these efforts and our business overall. While we have been clear about some of the challenges we have had in the Enterprise, we have made substantive progress and are positioned well for the future. We know where we need to be and how to get there. Security is a dynamic market, and it is changing rapidly, driven in particular by the impact of mobility. That creates the opportunity for us to grow in this market. With the strength of the SRX platform and the innovation underway with the Security Design, we're well positioned and focused on executing our plan. Thanks for your time, and I'll turn it now over to Robyn.
Robyn M. Denholm: Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Juniper's results in the second quarter were slightly higher than our guided ranges and reflected better operational performance. We remain focused on executing our strategy to drive revenue growth and disciplined operational execution. We believe the long-term demand fundamentals for high-performance networking are solid, yet the near-term environment continues to be uncertain and many customers remain cautious. Looking at our demand metrics for the quarter, book-to-bill was greater than 1, and product deferred revenue and product backlog increased sequentially. We saw good customer demand for our new products, including the PTX, T4000 and QFabric. Total revenue was $1,074,000,000, a 4% sequential increase and a decline of 4% year-over-year. As anticipated, the sequential increase was due to good Enterprise and Service Provider growth in the Americas, which offset weakness in the other regions. The year-over-year decline was mainly due to Service Provider weakness in EMEA and in APAC. In the second quarter, Verizon accounted for approximately 12% of Juniper's total revenue. This was driven by demand for our routers, switches, security solutions and services across Verizon's wired and wireless networks. It also reflects initial revenue from their recently announced deployment of PTX. For the second quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.11. This includes a $0.02 gain from equity investments. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.19, up $0.03 sequentially and down $0.12 year-over-year. The sequential increase was due to improved revenue and margin. Now let me provide some color on revenue by region, business segment and market. In the second quarter, the Americas were approximately 55% of total revenue; EMEA, 28%; and APAC, 17%. Americas revenue was up 11% sequentially and 1% year-over-year. The sequential increase was due to broad-based Enterprise strength with the exception of federal and financial services. In Service Provider, we saw higher revenue from cable, content and some wireless and wireline customers. On a year-over-year basis, the growth was driven by Service Provider. EMEA revenue was down 3% sequentially and 9% year-over-year, reflecting ongoing weakness in Service Providers. We see customers in EMEA continuing to take a cautious stance with their CapEx in response to the uncertain macro environment. APAC revenue was down 4% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. In Service Provider, APAC, excluding Japan, was up 10% sequentially. We continue to capture design wins with Service Providers in the region. Year-over-year, most of the region declined as a result of lower Service Provider demand. Now let me review our revenue by segment. Platforms Systems division revenue was $872 million, up 6% sequentially and down 5% year-over-year. PSD router product revenue was $488 million, up 7% sequentially and down 16% year-over-year. We had sequential increases in both Edge and core routing. Year-over-year, we saw a modest increase in core routing, which was more than offset by a decline in Edge routing. Total router product revenue, including both PSD and SSD, increased 6% from Q1 to $506 million. We saw a good sequential increase in revenue from both T4000 and PTX. Total switching product revenue increased 13% to $140 million. We are pleased with the momentum of EX, QFabric and wireless LAN, which all grew sequentially and year-over-year. SSD revenue in the second quarter was $202 million, down 3% sequentially and 1% year-over-year. Total security product revenue was $159 million, down 6% sequentially and flat year-over-year. The sequential decline was the result of slower demand in Service Provider and growth in Enterprise. As expected, high-end SRX product revenue declined sequentially and grew year-over-year as customer deployment timing continues to drive fluctuations in Service Provider revenues for this product. In the quarter, we did see a good sequential increase in Enterprise. We continue to see good customer traction with recent design wins with financial services and internet phones. Branch SRX, which is reported as part of PSD, was up both sequentially and year-over-year. Looking more closely at the markets we address, Service Provider revenue was $681 million, down 1% sequentially. Revenue was down 7% on a year-over-year basis as weakness in APAC and EMEA offset strength in the Americas. Enterprise revenue was $393 million, up 13% sequentially and flat year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, growth in EMEA and APAC offset a moderate decline in the Americas. For the quarter, Service Provider was 64% of total revenue and Enterprise was 36% of total revenue. Moving on to gross margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margins for the second quarter increased to 63.4% compared to 62.6% last quarter. Non-GAAP product gross margins were flat with the first quarter. A favorable routing mix was offset by a higher switching mix and some cost increases in security. Non-GAAP services gross margins were 59.4%, up 2.6 points from the prior quarter. This was a result of a higher revenue due to service contract renewals and lower costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses decreased sequentially to $520 million. Looking at headcount, we ended the quarter with 9,373 employees, a sequential increase of 155 as we continue to hire in sales and service with the goal of driving revenue growth. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 15%. This sequential increase of 3 points was due to higher revenue and improved gross margins and slightly lower operating expenses. Looking at segment contribution margins, PSD contribution margin was 40.3% of revenue, up sequentially on improved revenue and gross margins. For SSD, contribution margin was 36.8% of revenues, which is slightly lower sequentially due to decreased revenue and margins, partially offset by reduced operating expenses. The GAAP tax rate was 35.5% for the quarter. The non-GAAP tax rate was 30.7%, 4.9 points above the prior quarter due primarily to the geographic mix of income. As a reminder, the tax rate reflects the expiration of the R&D tax credits. Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $3.3 billion of net cash and investments. Cash flow from operations was $212 million. Cash flow was up sequentially, reflecting higher earnings and good working capital performance. DSO was 34 days in the quarter, down from 39 days last quarter and in the second quarter of last year. Capital expenditures and depreciation were up slightly from the prior quarter as we continue to build out our Sunnyvale campus. We repurchased approximately 5 million shares for $94 million, an increase of -- over the prior 2 quarters. Now I will review our outlook for the third quarter. And as a reminder, these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis except for revenue and share count. Looking ahead, we expect customers to remain cautious. We anticipate ongoing weakness in EMEA through the balance of the year, and that Enterprise markets globally will continue to invest carefully. We are making good progress on our new product introductions, and we remain focused on driving revenue growth and disciplined operational execution. For the third quarter, we expect revenues to range from $1,040,000,000 to $1,075,000,000. Gross margins are expected to be roughly flat sequentially at the high end of the revenue range. Operating expenses are expected to increase by approximately $10 million due to annual employee merit increases. We expect operating margins to range from 13% to 14%. This is expected to result in non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $0.15 and $0.18 per share, assuming a flat share count, a tax rate of 31% and no renewal of the R&D tax credits. Before we go to Q&A, I'd also like to update you on 2 topics we discussed at our Financial Analyst Meeting in June. First, we recently announced a $1 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization. Given the current market, we intend to be more opportunistic in the near term. Obviously, we will calibrate our buybacks in future quarters with market conditions at the time. But based on current trends, we clearly recognize the opportunity to do more. The second update is around our productivity and efficiency initiatives. As I outlined at FAM, actions are currently underway that will reduce ongoing operating expenses. In 2013, we anticipate an operating expense reduction of approximately $150 million over our estimated 2012 levels, with benefits beginning to be reflected in Q1 and the majority of the reduction occurring in the second half of 2013. In summary, given our view of the challenging near-term market conditions, we will continue to execute with agility and flexibility, while balancing the long-term needs of the business to deliver innovation and revenue growth. I would like to thank our dedicated employees for their hard work and commitment. They continue to be key to our success in delivering the new network. And now, I will hand it over to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ehud Gelblum with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney.
Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I actually have a couple. Kevin, just a clarification. When you're talking about wireless and a lot of opportunities you're getting in wireless, you didn't mention MobileNext so I was wondering if that was kind of a -- just a slip-up or intentionally that wasn't really maybe the emphasis on MobileNext. So that was just kind of a clarification. Robyn, you're talking about the gross margin mix, and you said that routing was a positive driver of gross margin, but then was offset by a negative gross margin mix in switching. I'm wondering, is that negative gross margin based on switching mix? In switching, it's hard to say, due to the entry of QFabric into the switching mix. And if so, can you give us a sense as to how large QFabric was and what you expect that to be in the next quarter and going forward and give us a sense as to how that grows? And if it doesn't, that gross margin [indiscernible]?
Kevin R. Johnson: Thanks for your question, Ehud, I'll take the first question on MobileNext. Certainly, MobileNext, we've made a lot of progress on MobileNext from a feature capability standpoint. And the key enabler that MobileNext drives for us, this gets the MX -- it's one of the services of that can run on the MX to make the MX an established footprint on the edge of the network in the wireless side. And we've seen a lot of adoption of the MX as it's engaged with customers on the wireless side, in the addition to the wireline side. MobileNext will continue to build out new sets of features. I'll let Bob talk a little bit about the new feature capabilities. We're making slow but steady progress on MobileNext. But the key for MobileNext is to establish the MX as a footprint in the wireless, and we're pleased with the progress we're seeing in the MX, and we continue to focus on the work that we're doing with MobileNext. Bob, do you want to comment just briefly on...
Robert L. Muglia: Yes, I'll add to that. We've shipped the EPC capabilities and GGSN capabilities of MobileNext and that is in production right now and running well at Elisa. And we're getting feedback from our customers that there are a set of additional features that they're interested in seeing from us. Consistent with what we set at FAM, these include things like the enforcement capabilities and DPI capabilities. All of these things, EPC, DPI, the PCEF enforcement capabilities are all part of the Universal Edge and the set of broad services that run on our MX platform. And the unique thing about that is that it provides these broad services for both wireline and wireless customers.
Robyn M. Denholm: And so Ehud, in terms of the mix comment on the call, yes, router mix was favorable in the quarter. The other thing I mentioned on the call was that it was offset by a few costs on the security side, which has to do with our deployments of some recently -- some recent wins in terms of the security side. So that's what I mentioned that was offsetting the favorable mix on the router side.
Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I was actually talking about QFabric. Can you give us a sense as to how large that was and has that impacted gross margin at all on the router side?
Robyn M. Denholm: Yes. So in terms of QFabric, we were pleased with the performance of all 3 lines of business in the switching area. Both EX, QFabric and wireless LAN were all up sequentially and year-over-year. And in terms of gross margin, that was a -- no impact on the gross margin average.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: The routing was better than expected in the quarter even though you highlighted some of the weakness in EMEA at Service Providers and also even though Verizon was down sequentially. So can you just give us a bit more detail on what drove the upside there? And also just as an update on the T4000, which I know you highlighted, the revenues in that product, are they still tied to qualification or are we seeing actual deployments? And if not, then when do you think we'll see the deployment revenue for that product?
Kevin R. Johnson: Thanks for the question, Simona. I'll take the second question and then we'll let Robyn comment on the overall router revenues for expectations. The T4000 is -- as we come out with that product, keep in mind, it's a seamless upgrade to the existing T Series chassis. And what we see customers doing now, we have a number of customers who have purchased and implemented the chassis kit that allows those chassis now to be provisioned to be able to accept both the older T Series line cards, as well as the new T Series, T4000 line cards. And then consistent with the way service providers go, a number of them are going through certification testing and -- in that process. But I think we're pleased with the level of engagement that we've gotten, both with PTX and T4000 in the core. And we're going to continue to stay focused as we work with customers through the certification process and then certainly as they do line card upgrades that presents more opportunity for us.
Robyn M. Denholm: Yes. And in terms of the overall mix of routing, both core and Edge were up quarter-over-quarter. Core was also up year-over-year, which is obviously a favorable trend for the quarter. So we were pleased with the routing mix in the quarter.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: But just as far as a little bit of additional detail, could you just highlight the source of that sequential increase? Because just by process of elimination, it sounds like it was not EMEA and it was not Verizon. So if you can just highlight a bit more, if any, incremental new wins or upgrades or what might be happening just with your other customers.
Kevin R. Johnson: Yes, thanks, Simona. I think -- it clearly was more U.S.-driven offset by some of the weakness in Europe. And certainty, within the U.S., our Tier 1 Service Provider business performed well in addition to that. So if you look at certain sectors of the U.S. like the cable customers that we engage with, cable did well. There was also a strong performance in U.S. cable providers and it's consistent with the value proposition and the messaging that we have overall in routing. But I'd say, net-wise, it was mainly driven by strength in the U.S. It's a combination of Tier 1, as well as our cable segment, and offset a little bit by some of the weakness in Europe.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan.
Rod B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just one clarification for Robyn and then a question. Clarification is on the gross margins in services. Robyn, you said that one of the drivers for the better margins were costs. I just wonder if you could elaborate on that a little bit in terms of what you guys have changed with respect to costs there that helped the gross margins? And then the question is on the Riverbed deal. I think I heard you guys say that it'd be some time before you'd ship products that would incorporate that Riverbed ADC software, which makes sense. I just wonder if, in the meantime, there's any opportunity to do joint deals or any kind of partnership out in the channel to serve customer needs?
Robyn M. Denholm: Yes, I'll talk about the gross margin and then I'll hand it over to Bob. So in terms of services gross margin, it was good sequential increase in terms of gross margins for services, driven by revenue growth quarter-over-quarter and also by cost, as you mentioned, Rod. So on the cost side, we've been talking about increased costs in the services space for a while due to architectural personnel and increased sparing and increased services capability to do with our new product introductions. So clearly, good cost management on an ongoing basis by the team in Services also helped this quarter with our gross margins.
Rod B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Did you -- Robyn, did you guys actually hold costs stable while revenues grew? Is that more what happened? Or did you actually reduced costs?
Robyn M. Denholm: We did reduce cost a little bit but also revenues increased in the quarter. So it's a combination of both, that's why I talked about both on the call.
Robert L. Muglia: So in the context of the Riverbed relationship, there are really 2 parts to the relationship. One part is working with Riverbed to incorporate their application acceleration technology into the Pulse mobile client. And we will not really be very able to do a lot of go to market work with them in that space until that technology is integrated in, but that is on its own schedule and we'll work with them to get ship dates at a little time. The second piece is really the ADC technology that we licensed from them, and we would anticipate that technology being built into Juniper products and being delivered to the market as a Juniper set of products. So we are not -- there's plans to resell the Riverbed technology in that space.
Rod B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Bob, I guess what I was wondering is that it sounds like the ADC will take a while to build into products. It's not going to happen overnight. So -- but I assume that that's driven by a customer need. Customers are wanting some ADC integration. Is there any -- and there's no opportunity to work with them to do joint solutions for customers or something like that?
Robert L. Muglia: Well, there's always an opportunity and it was not -- there's nothing specific to announce at this time on that. But we definitely see that this technology is very interesting. We see there's an opportunity for software to add value on top of the systems that we build. It is particularly interesting in the data center space. This is one of the good examples of software services that are very complementary. We also see long term that, that technology is beneficial in other domains such as the Edge in the Service Provider space.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Marshall with the ISI Group.
Brian Marshall - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: A question with respect to gross margins and then a follow-up on the financial model. But if you look at it, your revenues were up about 4% sequential in the quarter, but your gross margins were up almost roughly 100 basis points sequentially. So I think that would imply that you have an increasing richness of the revenue mix as not all that improvements came from increased volumes. I guess I'd love to hear the puts and takes there. And then also how that transitions with respect to the September quarter because I would expect that the new products will be ramping faster than the older products and some of them carry, obviously, higher gross margins associated with them. And so at the high end of the revenue guidance implies flat gross margins. I guess I would expect they would be actually a little bit higher than that, so would love some commentary there. And then a follow-up would be, can you talk a little bit about that 2% -- I'm sorry, $0.02 dilution hit at well? I apologize, I was -- actually missed the prepared remarks.
Robyn M. Denholm: So in terms of the mix in the quarter affecting gross margin, yes, routing mix was up in the quarter, and I mentioned in my prepared remarks that core was up both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. And as we've discussed, that does have a favorable impact in terms of gross margins. So we're pleased with the gross margin performance in the quarter and do see that, at the high end of guidance, continuing into the third quarter. In terms of the $0.02, we talked about a $0.02 favorable impact to the operating income due to a gain on investments. I think that was the question. Was that the question, Brian?
Brian Marshall - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Yes, I guess. A follow-up on the September gross margins. I mean, all things else being equal, if you're flat sequentially on the revenue side, I would anticipate that you have an increasing richness of the mix and so margins would be up. So I guess, can you talk a little bit about what the offsets are that will be pulling that down, if that would be the case?
Robyn M. Denholm: Yes. So in terms of our guidance for the third quarter, in terms of the trends that we see, we obviously see a continuing weakness in EMEA in Service Provider through the end of the year. Kevin mentioned that and so did I. We also see continued positive momentum with the U.S. Service Providers. And obviously, we also see some opportunities to increase revenue in terms of Enterprise. So in terms of mix, we're really calling it to be roughly flat going forward between Service Provider and Enterprise growth there.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Just a clarification. Just -- the Riverbed on the ADC side, does that mean your Radware partnership ends? And then the question is, with the assumption of a better second half, what sort of seasonality should we expect later in the year? Should we think of similar sequential growth levels from last year, or should we think of normal teen sequential growth rates? I ask since U.S. service providers are improving but the environment is still tough. And the European carriers, it's been so long since they've upgraded their networks. It seems like they are due for a big upgrade. So I'm just trying to get a sense of how you feel about the -- how we finish the balance of the year.
Robert L. Muglia: I'll take the regular question first. No, it does not mean that our Radware partnership ends. In fact, we continue to work closely with Radware and delivery of their technology on top of the MX platform to a variety of customers particularly focused on the service provider edge. And we'll be pleased, even after we have product in the market that does application -- that does ADC technology on our own. We'll be pleased to continue to work with Riverbed and service customers that want to use their technology.
Kevin R. Johnson: Yes. And Mark, I'll take the second part of your question on seasonality. What we see with U.S. Tier 1 service providers, seasonality first half versus second half is returning to sort of the more expected pattern that we saw with the exception of last year. We think second half spending by the Tier 1 service providers in the U.S. will be higher than first half. If you just look at their guided CapEx, something like 46% in the first half, 54% in the second half is what you look at. But if you just take the Tier 1 service providers, they only represent about 25% of the total CapEx globally, and I think the uptick in U.S., I think, is offset by the weakness that we see in Europe and other parts of Asia-Pacific. So the net is I think we're taking a cautious position given the macro environment in Europe and continue to play to our strength with our business in the U.S.
Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Kevin, just a quick thought. The networks -- a lot of the networks in Europe seem to be running above service-level agreements, which implies that they have to upgrade. What's the kind of feedback? Is it just still their -- the macro for them, their balance sheets or their CapEx? And do you think that we'll get to a point where they have to upgrade?
Kevin R. Johnson: Yes, it's a good question, Mark, and I think we've seen this pattern before. The long-term demand fundamentals of growth in network traffic continue. There's more devices, there's more video, there's more users, there's more data centers, there's just more traffic. So as traffic continues to grow and if there's a slowdown or pause in some of the capital expenditures for routing in the service provider sector, certainly that implies that customers are running their network hotter, and that will be consistent with our view and our engagement with customers. The question will be at what point do they either hit the point where they're running so hot that they need to make the investments, or at what point do the economic conditions for those customers hit the situation where they start to do upgrades and build more capacity in their networks? But the important point, I think, is the long-term demand fundamentals remain intact. Traffic continues to grow, and every customer situation is different. In certain cases, it may be a function of their revenue. In some cases, it's a function of their balance sheet. In some cases, they're being cautious given the economic situation in the country that they reside. But what we're doing is we're being very focused and very connected on -- with those customers to ensure that we're working proactively with them so that when they do start to spend and upgrade and launch new projects, that Juniper is there with a great value proposition and prepared to help them do that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal with Barclays Capital.
Jeffrey T. Kvaal - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Robyn, a question for you on the OpEx. The numbers that you're providing are for a full year comparison of 2012 to 2013? And then the second part of that is, why would it take so long for the reductions to filter into the financials?
Robyn M. Denholm: Yes. So in terms of what I talked about in the prepared remarks, the $150 million reduction in OpEx for 2013 is the full year-over-full year impact. What we're expecting to see is that impact really starts to come in, in Q1 of next year and increase over the full year. And so as I said in my prepared remarks, the second half of the year is where we see the majority of the reduction happening.
Jeffrey T. Kvaal - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Why not get started on that process a little sooner? And then furthermore, are there specific areas that we should be watching for the reductions?
Robyn M. Denholm: Yes, yes. As I outlined in FAM, I mean, we're working on productivity and efficiency initiatives across the company. So it's quite surgical. There are the things that we're actually targeting in terms of sort of long-standing cost reduction activity rather than just one set of being in one area. It's across the board, whether it's in streamlining things in the back-office function, as well as in the R&D area, as well as in sales and marketing as well.
Kevin R. Johnson: Yes, I'll just add, Jeff, we're not waiting for some of that. We're working on this, and we will get these -- the cost structure in place as soon as practical, and we're trying to be very thoughtful about how we do that, so that we maintain a focus on the priorities we have, which are driving the revenue, top-line revenue, continue to drive the wave of innovation. But gaining these efficiencies, a lot of what Robyn described is through efficiency gains which has to do with process change and underlying systems that get aligned with them. But we aren't waiting. We're moving, and we will get these as soon as practical.
James Kelleher - Argus Research Company: Okay. Kevin, can I just ask you, observations on VMware's move into the space with Nicira, what are your takeaways on that deal?
Kevin R. Johnson: Yes, thanks for the question, Jeff. I think at the Analyst Meeting in early June, Pradeep, Stefan and Bob, I think, shared our view of software-defined networks and our focus on this. We certainly are aligned with the goals and where software-defined network are going. We, I think, at the Analyst Meeting, outlined how we described that 3 years ago with our launch of the concept of the new network. We certainly have been very engaged with the industry and the community as it relates to software-defined networks, and we will continue to stay very engaged in it. I think if you look at the comments that Pradeep made, we're going to continue to be very thoughtful and balanced in terms of what we're doing on the R&D agenda to make sure that we're delivering the best possible solutions to our customers. And certainly, the work we're doing in our switching and fabric business as it relates to data centers is very applicable and very relevant to Nicira and very applicable and relevant to what VMware is doing. That said, we're going to continue to focus on how we can innovate and deliver the best possible solutions to customers in a world of software-defined networks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of George Notter with Jefferies.
George C. Notter - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Just expanding on that thought. I guess I'm wondering when Juniper might be able to deliver a product in the SDN area. Is there a set of timelines or dates that you guys have in mind? And then also on QFabric, I guess I was just hoping to get an update on customer count there and any more comments or tangible data points you have on traction with QFabric could be helpful.
Robert L. Muglia: Let me take the first question of when we'll be delivering products in the SDN space. We already have today a number of products that have many attributes of SDN, and I'll first point out that when the industry talks about SDN, there's a great deal of similarity to the programmable network, which we've been talking about for several years. SDN is really all about how applications in the infrastructure that support them can drive the network and get the network to do what it wants. And that's really precisely the same goal we outlined several years ago when we talked about the programmable network. So the work we've done to date in building the Junos SDK is really industry-leading work that is completely consistent with SDN. In specific areas of SDN, things like OpenFlow, we have today some open-source capabilities for people to build on top of our platforms, and we're in the process of building production capable OpenFlow technology across a wide variety of Juniper products going into 2013. So you're seeing -- what I would say is we have products today, and we're going to continue to enhance and expand those products, and we'll work very closely across the industry, including with partners like VMware, to ensure that Juniper Networks, the platforms and the software that we provide is the best complement to the software that they deliver.
Kevin R. Johnson: Yes, George, I'll give you sort of a quick update on QFabric. I think at the end of our last quarter call, we had mentioned, I think, we had 150 customers running QFabric nodes. In this quarter, in second quarter, we surpassed the 200 customer mark running QFabric nodes. And so we continue to see very good uptake of customers running QFabric nodes, and certainly, we're seeing a growing number of those customers also now purchase and either go through certification or deployment of the full QFabric systems. We announced the -- a new interconnect system called the QFX3000-M and this is important in a relevant point because it is a fixed interconnect that provides QFabric for up to 16 nodes. And so it provides a lower entry point for those customers who have purchased and deployed nodes who now want to try the full QFabric system. They can deploy the QFX3000-M, and it lowers the entry point and provides them flexibility in terms of how they want to deploy that in a fixed interconnect node. So we've got -- we've surpassed 200 customers in the quarter, continued to see good progress on the QFX3500 with the top-of-rack and the nodes and certainly, a subset of those customers purchasing continue to deploy the full QFabric system.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein with Credit Suisse.
Paul Silverstein - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: A couple of quick ones. First off, Kevin or Robyn, can you comment on linearity in the quarter as well as closed rates? Secondly, with respect to absolute run [ph] optimization, curious, Kevin, have you gone back and looked at -- what's different this time around relative to back in '05 when you purchased Redline and Peribit, which if I remember correctly, Peribit was the leader at the time it went up. Redline was a pretty decent private company as well. What's different about this initiative relative to that last go-around in terms of driving revenue and bottom line? And finally, Robyn, curious, the $150 million number for the OpEx savings for next year, it doesn't sound like you have a staff reduction target. This isn't coming from headcount reduction, maybe I misunderstood. If that's the case, how did you come up with $150 million?
Robyn M. Denholm: So Paul, let me tackle the first question and the last one. In terms of linearity, nothing unusual to comment on in terms of linearity for the quarter. You can see with the DSO that we had that it was a relatively linear quarter. So nothing unusual to comment there. In terms of the cost reductions, let me start by saying where our strategy is around driving revenue growth. We talked about that in the -- at the Analyst Day. We're very focused on doing that. We're also focused on driving operational execution across the board, whether it is to drive that revenue growth or reduce our percentage of OpEx to revenue. And as I outlined at FAM, we are targeted at 39% to 42% of revenue as our OpEx over the next 3 years. So these -- what I've announced today is that we've now -- at FAM I talked about -- we had identified opportunities in that range, now we've identified those cost savings, and we're in the process of implementing those as we speak. So we will talk more about those as we start to show the amounts in the P&L. But we're very focused on delivering both, both revenue growth and operating expense efficiencies.
Robert L. Muglia: So -- and with regards to the question about the previous acquisitions that Juniper did quite some time ago relative to the work that we'll be doing around, particularly the ADC space, I can't say too much about what happened a long time ago. I certainly wasn't here then. But I will say that today, as we sit here, we have a great deal of clarity across the 2 customer segments that we're targeting, the Service Provider and the Enterprise, the 3 businesses we're in, switching, security and routing, and then the 7 domains. And in particular, with the domains, it provides us a deep context of understanding of customers' business needs, and we see this technology as being critical to fulfill those needs, and that's why we've done the -- we've created the relationship that we have, and we think it's a good, sound financial decision, and we think it's a good business opportunity for us going forward.
Kevin R. Johnson: Yes. And Paul, this is Kevin. I'll just add to Bob's comments. I think we are in the switching fabric business in the data center today. We were not back then. And so there's clearly, in our opinion, a technology synergy related to the ADC and the systems. The fact that we built Layer 2, Layer 3, load balancing into our underlying systems and then complement that now with Layer 7 ADC in systems like MXs, SRX and QFabric allows us to bring this technology in form of a line card that now is tightly integrated into the systems. I think that's the fundamental difference in both footprint, technology capabilities and synergies in terms of how we go to market.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Tal Liani - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I have 2 questions. First is on the security part. Bob, you spoke about grade investments in security but revenues this quarter were down 6% sequentially. How do you -- or when do you see the new efforts contributing to revenues? And how do you see the rest of the year playing out in security? How are you -- if you can repeat a little bit, I think you highlighted how you're going to innovate -- differentiate versus competition? The second question is clarification about what you said on ADC. I don't understand why you're going to have 2 different pieces of software, one from Radware, one from Riverbed, and invest in both and try to integrate and try to educate the salespeople on both, and how does it work with your desire to lower costs, so where is the rationale in keeping both?
Robert L. Muglia: Okay. Let me take those one at a time. Thanks a lot for the question. The first one with regards to security, in terms of the quarter-to-quarter overall decline. I mean, what you're seeing there is somewhat the cyclic nature of Service Provider buying. As we mentioned, we saw growth, both quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year, in Enterprise, which tends to have a more consistent curve attached to it. In terms of when the time frames for when we see ourselves being able to have more consistent growth, we will see as the new products and technologies come out later this year and we see customer adoption. We do feel that going into 2013, our security business will be seeing very consistent recovery, and we've made a wide variety of steps within the security business to really address the challenges we have, including putting effectively an entirely new management team in place, which is well established now and has -- and is now executing very effectively on the initiatives in front of them. So I feel good about the steps that have been taken and the progress that we're making. I feel good about the feedback that we are seeing from customers and where we're heading with that business. With regards to the question about ADC and the 2 different packages, recognize that our relationship with Radware is one where they do development on top of the SDK that we provide and then we work together to deliver our solutions to particular customers. We do that quite a bit with a wide variety of different partners in the industry, and it's actually in our benefit to have an open ecosystem to allow others to build on top of our platforms. And so it makes sense for us to continue to do that. In terms of our R&D investment, it will be focused on the Riverbed technology. That's where we'll be putting our own investment. And in terms of bringing Juniper-based products to market, it will be based on that technology. But as I mentioned, that is still some time away, still a little while before we'll have the product to market.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thank you. That is all the time we have today. We appreciate your attending today's call, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Juniper Networks First Quarter 2012 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Kathleen Nemeth, Vice President, Investor Relations for Juniper Networks. Thank you, Ms. Nemeth, you may begin.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Here on the call today are Kevin Johnson, Chief Executive Officer; Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial Officer; and Stefan Dyckerhoff, Executive Vice President, Platform System. Before Kevin gets started, I would like to highlight changes to our financial reporting, which are reflected in today's earnings press release. As we have discussed previously, Juniper is aligning our business segment reporting to the company's organizational structure and focus on its platform and software strategy. We believe this change will provide investors with increased financial reporting transparency and will enable better insight into the market and performance trends driving the company's business. Juniper's 2 reportable segments are now the Platforms Systems Division, which will often be referred to as PSD, and Software Solutions Division, or SSD. Our press release provides a description of each segment including the products within each segment. There is a table included in Appendix 2, which identifies the specific products by segment within routings, switching and security. The PSD segment aligns primarily with the Infrastructure segment under the historical reporting approach and consists of routing, switching and security products and services. Note that security products, such as the branch SRX, branch firewall and J-Series product families, which are now in PSD were historically reported as part of our SLT segment. The SSD segment aligns primarily with the SLT segment under the historical reporting approach and consists of security and routing products and services. Note that routing products, such us routing services software, which are now in SSD were historically reported as part of our Infrastructure segment. Detailed information including 2011 and 2010 announced as they would have been reported under the new approach is included in the Appendix of today's press release and are provided in Excel tables on the Investor Relations page of our website. These include quarterly segment revenues with product detail, segment contribution margins and corporate unallocated expenses. Please remember when listening to today's that statements concerning Juniper's business outlook, economic and market outlook, future financial operating results and overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including economic conditions generally or within the networking industry, changes in overall technology spending, the network capacity requirements of service providers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply-chain constraints, variation in the mix of products sold, customer perception and acceptance of our products, litigation and other factors listed in our most recent 10-K filed with the SEC. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event, facts or circumstances change after the date of this call. In discussing the financial results, Robyn will first present results on a GAAP basis. And for purposes of today's discussion will also review non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why the management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult our 8-K filed with the SEC today. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results, please see today's press release. In general, non-GAAP results exclude certain nonrecurring charges, amortization of purchased intangibles and other acquisition charges and expenses related to stock-based compensation. On today's call, Robyn will also be providing forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis, other than that with respect to revenue and share count. All guidance is forward-looking, and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier. GAAP guidance measures are not available on a forward-looking basis, due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to certain charges, which are excluded from the non-GAAP guidance estimates. Please note that today's call is scheduled to last for one hour. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will now turn the call over to Kevin.
Kevin R. Johnson: Thanks, Kathleen, and welcome, everyone. Juniper executed well in the first quarter, delivering results that were better than forecast in a market environment that, as expected, continue to be dynamic by geography. I'll provide some detail on how we see business unfolding here in the first half of the year, including the solid traction we're seeing with our new products. I've also asked Stefan Dyckerhoff, who heads our Platforms Systems Division, to provide some further depth from the progress we are making on our innovation agenda. After Stefan's comments, Robyn will provide the financial review. First quarter results reflect demand from our large Service Provider customers and some declines in Enterprise routing. Geographically, we saw continued headwinds in EMEA, as expected. But we saw good wins and activity across all of our theaters. We're also seeing new products contribute to results, including a solid first full quarter of revenue from our recently introduced T4000 core router. Our switching performance remains solid in light of the market environment, and we're gaining traction with our QFabric offerings. In security, SRX posted good results in the first quarter. Customers have responded very positively to the recent update of the user interface of security configuration and device management software. We are continuing to manage prudently and carefully in this environment. Service providers continue to be thoughtful with their spending. Our largest customers have a clear focus on maximizing efficiency as measured by capital to spend to revenue. The focus on efficiencies supporting important architectural transitions, such as the convergence of the wireline and wireless Edge, which is a great opportunity for our MX Series of Edge routers. In fact, our recent MX capacity upgrades, coupled with the T4000 core router's powerful throughput, enables Juniper to leverage our install base on both the core and the Edge. These differentiated products are helping customers reduce their cost per bit of traffic, while driving operating efficiencies across their business. Service Providers drive for capital spending efficiency aligns with the strategic priority of the drive our innovation agenda. We are innovating in areas that are highly relevant to our customers, both in mobility and in the cloud. We're delivering differentiated solutions that change the economics and experience of networking for our customers. We are taking an architectural approach for solutions that enable our customers to address some of the most critical challenges they face. And it's important to keep in mind that architectural changes take time and close customer collaboration. We feel good about how our customers, both existing Juniper customers and new customers, are responding to our approach and our solution. The T4000 generated good revenue in the first quarter. We recorded our first PTX revenues and are pleased with the orders we are receiving. We continue to win new customers with QFabric, and we are enabling numerous production deployments. Within security, we continue to strengthen our portfolio with new features and improved usability. As we move forward, we will continue to focus on execution. Our new products are a result of good execution in R&D, and we continue to expand our go-to-market capabilities. Our innovation agenda is on track. We are confident in the value of the solutions we are delivering, and the customer traction and feedback we are seeing supports that confidence. We believe in the long-term fundamentals driving the new network. Our strategy for long-term value creation is clear, and it consists of 5 key elements. One, we are a pure play in high-performance networking, with an addressable market opportunity for Juniper that is large and growing; two, we are an innovation-driven company, which means we will continue to invest in R&D that delivers customer value; three, we are leveraging our R&D investment across both the Service Provider and Enterprise customer base; four, we are diversifying that customer base by broadening our Service Provider business and by expanding breadth and depth in both Service Provider and Enterprise; and five, we are complementing our systems strategy with the software business centered on the one Junos platform. Our long-term view is positive. Certainly, the near-term environment requires continued caution, and we're addressing that with a focus on execution and adherence to our operating principles. Trends of mobile Internet and cloud have created the potential for transformational opportunity for Juniper. With great innovation and great execution, we believe we are positioned very well to capitalize on the opportunity in front of us. With that, I'll hand off to Stefan.
Stefan Dyckerhoff: Thanks, Kevin. It's a pleasure to join the earnings call this quarter. In February, while attending the Mobile World Congress, Bob Muglia and I had the opportunity to present our strategy innovation agenda focused on systems and software. As we articulated, Juniper's strategy for the new network enables customers to improve economics and experiences of networking. We are doing this by offering a common network platform with powerful and programmable systems, on top of which, Juniper and our ecosystem partners can build software-driven solutions. We have aligned organizational structure to our new network strategy, with the platform -- with the formation of the Platforms Systems Division and the Software Solutions Divisions, which reflect how we manage our business. We have introduced the New Network Platform Architectures, which allow us to view our products, solutions and value propositions through the customer lens, segmented by network domain. We are an innovation-driven company, which partners closely with our customers to solve the hardest networking problems. A critical component of our strategy is our commitment to leveraging our R&D investment in order to develop solutions that span both Service Provider customers and our growing Enterprise customer base. The new products we have brought to market in the last year from QFabric to T4000 to PTX to MX upgrades and ACX were all designed and built to deliver differentiated value for both segments. We now have the strongest and most robust portfolio in the history of the company. The architectural approach we are taking with our innovation agenda requires patience and close work with our customers. We are in the midst of that, and we feel good about the progress we are making on our new products. I'll walk through this in more detail, starting with the core. Several customers have embraced our vision of the Converged Supercore, and we are seeing robust early demand for both of our new products, the T4000 and the PTX. We saw good initial revenue performance for T4000 in the first quarter, with recent buyers of the product including Australia-based, Telstra; and U.K.-based, Virgin Media. We have strong customer engagement for the PTX across all geographies, including orders from customers, such as the London Internet Exchange. We have been pleased with the customer reaction to the product. We also had important product news on the Edge in early 2012. In addition to the switch fabric upgrades, we started shipping in Q4 2011, which allow our customers to double the performance of their MX installed base, we also saw great traction for our 100-gig interfaces on MX, which started shipping in the first quarter. With the PTX, T1600 and T4000 also delivering 100-gig interfaces, we have a compelling 100-gig story from Converged Supercore to Edge. The MX product line has been the most successful product in the history of Juniper and combined with the ACX product line for access and navigation, which we will ship later this year, we see continued growth, opportunities across wireless and wireline applications. Now let's turn to the campus and data center and talk about switching and fabric. Our EX Series of product was our entry into the switching market. These products continue to be a key lever in our drive into the enterprise across campus and data center applications. The next step in our data center innovation agenda has been to simplify the next-generation data center networks to one layer, driving capital efficiencies and significant operational benefits for the virtual data center and emerging clouds. We believe our QFabric sets the industry standard for performance and simplicity, and we are satisfied with the customers' response to this technology since we introduced it last year. We now have over 150 customers for the QFX product line, and are seeing them embrace the solution in a variety of different configurations, ranging from top-of-rack installations to full fabric deployments. We are pleased to have the first full fabric deployments running in live production. Those deployments include Qihoo 360 in China and Australia-based Oracle. In Q1, we also had a QFabric win in Europe at Jan Yperman hospital in Belgium. Customer feedback overall is good, and we are encouraged with the pipeline we are building. So overall in switching and fabric, we are pleased with the progress. We are seeing success in data center and campus, and our architectural innovation is gaining customer traction. One of the main drivers behind the early success we are seeing has been very good execution in R&D. Our approach has always been about silicon, systems and software, and you're seeing all 3 coming together in our new products. Our Trio chipset is powering the MX and T4000, while our Express chipset, optimized for high-capacity transport, is the reason the PTX maintains 4x the density of any competing product. We have also done a tremendous amount of work in our Junos R&D program, delivering capabilities, which are key to the customer experience with our products. We are delivering a single network operating system to more easily integrate into customer workflow and provide an open, programmable platform for rapid service innovation. I'll conclude my comments by highlighting a few key takeaways. From silicon to systems to software, we are executing on our innovation agenda. Customer feedback around our solution has been very positive. All of our new products are in active customer engagements across all geographies, resulting in design wins, trials and live deployments. The innovations we are bringing to market are architecture-driven. They are designed in collaboration with our customers and in response to their needs. And as with any new architecture, implementation is a multistage process. Again, we are pleased with the progress we are seeing and how we are delivering against our innovation agenda. I will now turn the call over to Robyn.
Robyn M. Denholm: Thank you, Stefan, and good afternoon, everyone. Juniper's results in the March quarter reflect our focus on disciplined operational excellence, with revenue and earnings exceeding our guided ranges. We are pleased with the early customer demand for our new products, reflected in orders for PTX, T4000 and QFabric. While we are still in the early phases of these new product cycles, customer feedback on our disruptive innovation is highly encouraging. We saw a sequential increase in Service Provider revenue, driven primarily by large U.S. customers. As anticipated, the orders we received in the third quarter of 2011 contributed to this quarter's strength in Service Provider revenue. This was offset by an expected decline in Enterprise as a result of typical seasonality and our strong fourth quarter performance in Federal routing. While we believe the long-term demand fundamentals are intact, many customers continue to exercise care in the investment prioritization and project deployment. We are focused on executing our strategy, while prudently managing the near-term. Looking at our demand metrics for the quarter. Book-to-bill was slightly below 1. Product deferred revenue was roughly flat sequentially. Total revenue was $1,032,000,000, a decline of 8% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. Verizon continues to be a strategic customer, accounting for approximately 15% of total revenue this quarter. This was driven by demand for our routers, switches, security solutions and services across Verizon's wired and wireless networks. For the first quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.03. GAAP diluted earnings included $0.03 impact for charges associated with the write down of an equity investment, restructuring and other items. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.16, down $0.12 sequentially and down $0.16 from a year ago. The decline from the first quarter of 2011 was primarily due to lower revenue and gross margins. Now let me provide some color on revenue by region, business segment and market. In the first quarter, the Americas were approximately 51% of total revenue; EMEA, 30%; and APAC, 19%. Americas' revenue was up 2% sequentially and declined 9% year-over-year. The sequential growth was primarily due to the largest U.S. service providers, whilst the year-over-year decline was mainly due to regional and content service providers. EMEA revenue was down 23% sequentially and up 2% year-over-year. This sequential decline was primarily attributable to comparisons against the record Q4 and a decline in Service Provider revenue in Southern and parts of Central Europe. APAC revenue declined 3% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. While Japan showed sequential growth due to better performance in Service Provider, it was down compared to a strong quarter last year as we completed a large Service Provider deployment. We did see a slowdown in revenue across the rest of the region. Now let me review our revenue by segment. Platforms Systems Division revenue was $824 million, down 8% both sequentially and year-over-year. PSD router product revenue was $458 million, down 4% sequentially and 21% year-over-year. The sequential decline was due to a decrease in spending in Enterprise. The year-over-year decline was due to lower spending by international, U.S. regional and content service providers. Total router revenue, including both PSD and SSD, was $479 million. Total switching product revenue was $124 million, down 21% sequentially from a record level in the fourth quarter. On a year-over-year basis, switching was up strongly at 23%, driven by EX4500 and EX2200, as well as an increase in shipments of our QFabric solution. Software Solutions Division revenue in the first quarter was $208 million, down 9% sequentially and up 3% year-over-year. High-end SRX product revenue for the quarter remained strong. We saw increases sequentially and year-over-year driven by Service Provider demand. We expect high-end SRX revenues to continue to fluctuate with the timing of customer deployments. Enterprise security was down sequentially and year-over-year as we worked to improve the feature offering of our Enterprise security customers. Looking more closely at the markets we address, Service Provider revenue was $685 million, up 1% sequentially due to strength in routing and security. Revenue was down 8% on a year-over-year basis due to reduced demand in routing. Enterprise revenue was $347 million, down 22% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. The sequential decline was due to lower routing business coming off a strong Q4 in Federal and seasonality in switching and security. Year-over-year, the decline was due to lower Enterprise routing and security. For the quarter, Service Provider was 66% of total revenue and Enterprise was 34% of total revenue. Moving onto gross margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margins for the first quarter was 62.6% compared to 63.3% last quarter. Product gross margins were 64.6% of product revenue, up slightly on a sequential basis. As expected, our product gross margins continue to be negatively impacted by product and geographic mix, as well as inventory-related costs. Services gross margins were 56.8%, down nearly 4 points from the prior quarter. This was primarily the result of the reset of variable compensation and an increase in spare parts related to the new product introductions. While the pricing environment continues to be competitive, our strategy remains consistent, to differentiate on innovation and focus on cost improvements through our supply chain. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased sequentially as expected to $523 million, driven by typical Q1 increases in employee expenses. Looking at headcount, we ended the quarter with 9,218 employees, a sequential increase of 89 as we continue to hire strategically to support our long-term objectives. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 12% due to increased operating expenses and lower gross margins. Looking at segment contribution margins, which reflect revenues less expenses directly attributable to the segment organization. For PSD, the contribution margin was 37%; and for SSD, contribution margin was 39%. The sequential decline for both segments was primarily due to lower revenue and higher operating expenses. The GAAP tax rate was 30.1% for the quarter. The non-GAAP tax rate was 25.8%, up 2.1 points from the prior quarter. As a reminder, the tax rate shows a sequential and year-over-year increase due to the expiration of the R&D tax credit at the end of 2011. Looking at the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $4.2 billion of total cash and investment. This was a reduction of $77 million from the prior quarter is mainly the result of the acquisitions of both Mykonos and the assets of BitGravity. Our net cash and investment was $3.2 billion. Cash flow from operations was $102 million. Cash flow was lower sequentially due to the lower income generated this quarter and was impacted by the semi-annual bond interest payment. DSO was 39 days in the quarter, down from 46 days last quarter, but in line with 38 days in the first quarter of last year. CapEx and depreciation were consistent with prior quarters. We repurchased $51.6 million or 2.4 million shares at an average price of $21.75. Our policy remains consistent that over time we aim to offset the dilutive impact of our employee stock programs. Now I will review our outlook. As a reminder, these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis except for revenue and share count. Looking ahead, we will manage the business assuming the near-term environment requires continued caution. We will remain focused on executing our strategy, while maintaining a balanced approach to the near and long term. Given this view, we are expecting revenues to range from $1,030,000,000 to $1,060,000,000. Both gross margins and operating expenses for the second quarter are expected to be roughly in line with the first quarter. As a result, we expect operating margins for the second quarter to range from 12% to 14%. We anticipate that operating margins should improve from this level through the rest of the year. This is expected to result in a second quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $0.15 and $0.17 per share, and assumes a flat share count and a tax rate of 29%. This tax rate assumes that there is no renewal of the R&D tax credit. In summary, we will continue to navigate the near-term environment carefully. Our new products are gaining momentum as customers see the value of our disruptive innovations. We are focused on disciplined operational execution, driving progress on our new product trend introductions and investing in critical areas of our business. I want to thank our fabulous employees for their dedication and hard work. Their commitment to innovation is key to our success in delivering the new network. And with that, I'll hand it over to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal with Barclays Capital.
Jeffrey T. Kvaal - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Kevin, this one might be for you. I think that we have seen a loss in the overall carrier industry, about a slowdown over the last few quarters, according to their CapEx budgets, included the first quarter. You folks, though, seemed to have been able to manage through that with a seasonally up quarter. What can you tell us about the spending patterns for the rest of the year? Should we be expecting further improvements in your Service Provider revenues through the year? Or is this sort of where we are and caution from here?
Kevin R. Johnson: I think -- first of all, I think, it's perhaps a bit too early to outline what we think will happen for carrier capital expenditures for the full year. Obviously, we look at the guidance that our large customers provide for capital expenditures. And I think there's a couple of things that we observe, one is that with our large U.S. tier-1 Service Providers. In Q1, their capital expenditures were about 21% to 22% of what they've guided for full year, which does show that there's -- it's reverting back to a more seasonal pattern that we've seen several years ago, at least with that Q1 number. There's still are significant headwinds in Europe, and I think that's, that one that we've seen service providers be very cautious in their capital expenditures. And so I think it's still a fairly dynamic environment. I think our focus is going to be clearly on execution. Now as we've got these new products in market and we're engaging with customers for the architectural designing win and the trials to get these products deployed and drive revenue, that's going to be our primary focus. But overall, I'd say it's still a bit of a mixed bag and it's too early to call.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Brent Bracelin with Pacific Crest Securities.
Brent A. Bracelin - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: Kevin, I appreciate the innovation agenda and the message you've made here. But as I look at the expense structure, OpEx as a percentage of sales is now north of -- slightly north of 50% of revenue, that's actually the highest in 8 years. How should we think about getting a return on those investments? And is this just kind of the bottom, and we should start to see a more rationalization of R&D expenses going forward? Just trying to understand that disconnect between this rise in OpEx that we've seen here, again 8-year high, versus getting a good return, making sure we're getting a good return on that investment.
Kevin R. Johnson: Yes. I think it's a very valid question. Certainly, we're at an interesting point in the evolution of the company, in that, we've just released some very significant products. And so the R&D expenditures for those products are at the peak as we're releasing those, whether it's PTX, T4000, QFabric, as an example, and yet the revenue hasn't kicked in on those products. So as a result, we end up with an operating expense envelope that's higher as a percentage of revenue than we would like long term. So the key for us right now is drive execution on the go-to-market side and drive that top line revenue to get leverage on the R&D investment. Now clearly, the operating principles that we've stated for 2012 are clear that we view that Q1 to be the point that we're going to build some operating leverage throughout the year, and much of that's going to come from top line revenue. But clearly, it's up to us to really drive execution in market and translate the investment we've made in R&D to top line revenue and a return for shareholders.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Marshall with the ISI Group.
Brian Marshall - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Looking at the gross margins here, I think this is -- gross margins have been headed down 6 out of the last 7 quarters, I believe. And so I guess the trend is pretty clear. I'm wondering due to the comments with respect to operating margins coming up for the rest of the year, and you just -- commenting that, that's as far it's going to be, driven by revenue. Should we expect some margin on the gross margins side to expand as the new products ramp at higher margins than current existing product margins? Any color there will be helpful, throughout the year.
Robyn M. Denholm: In terms of the gross margins, what I said in my prepared remarks was that actually product revenue -- our product gross margins were up slightly quarter-over-quarter, and that was reflective of the slightly higher routing mix in the overall product revenue. So in terms of the headline gross margin number at 62.6%, it is a decline quarter-over-quarter, but it was mainly the result, in fact, primarily the result of the services gross margin. So what we've seen this quarter with services gross margin, they actually went to 56.8% as a result of the increase in employee expenses, typical of the first quarter but also an increase in spare parts costs because we are bringing the new products to market. So those costs were up quarter-over-quarter. So from an overall gross margin perspective, we expect them to be roughly flat in the second quarter, in line with revenue. As we improve or increase the proportion of routing revenue to total revenue for product, the gross margins will increase. And so yes, as Kevin said, we're expecting to drive leverage in the model through the top line, but we're also looking at improvements in the product gross margins as we move forward here with the new product introductions as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Maybe I'll just get Stefan into the mix here. Stefan, we missed you last week at the Open Networking Summit, so I just wanted to ask you some questions around that. In particular, how do you see QFabric now fitting in within the trend toward software-defined networking? And also it seems like some key customers like Google and Verizon are now embracing software-defined networking-type technologies as opposed to QFabric, and some of the customer wins you've pointed to seemed to be somewhat smaller types of enterprises or hospitals and things like that. So where do you see demand at this point shaping up for QFabric? And then just lastly, on that topic, of the 150 customers you talked about, roughly what percent are deploying the full fabric versus the top-of-rack solution?
Stefan Dyckerhoff: So let me start by talking a little bit about the Open Networking Summit where actually my team was well represented. Michael Beesly, our CTO, presented together with one of our customers on the data center side to talk about how we see the use of SDN type technology in the data center and for enterprises, specifically. So when I think about SDN, I see a lot of the goals that we've outlined for the new network in terms of improved economics, experiences and unleashing innovation on top of the network reflected in the industry movement that is SDN. And certainly we have been at the forefront of that movement through opening up APIs into our operating system with the Junos SDK, through supporting all of the various technologies that are parts of SDN, whether that be OpenFlow or BD [ph], BTE or PCE. We are going to continue to focus on the programmability as one of the key aspects that we can deliver with Junos. So when you then say, "Okay, what's the use of that technology in the data center?" One of the key things to realize is that virtualization drives the need to reconfigure the network but also drives performance in the network. So a flat, anything in connectivity between the services is very important for an SDN-type deployment. And certainly the customers that have adopted QFabric, whether that's a Thomson Reuters or whether that's a Deutsche Boers or more recently Qihoo 360, have all seen that benefit play out in the physical infrastructure. And then on top of that, they will make sure that they have the probability to actually deploy the services on top of that infrastructure. So we don't see that there's a choice between SDN or QFabric. QFabric is part of our new network strategy, and programmability is always going to be at the forefront of that strategy and SDN share some of those goals. Now lastly, to your point around the 150 customers, so we have a mix of deployments for the customers who have adopted the QFX product line. They range from top-of-rack to full fabric. The reason they adopt the product line is because we have strategic alignment with them on the architecture that they want to deploy going forward. And so the focus for us is to give them a great experience as they adopt the key pieces of technology and there's a good number of them that actually adopt the full fabric, and as I mentioned, the first 2 in live deployment as of the first quarter. So we're very happy with the progress that we're making there, and just continue to focus on execution with the customer engagements.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ehud Gelblum with Morgan Stanley.
Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: A couple of things, some you may not answer; others, hopefully you will. Robyn, any color you can give us in terms of the revenue totals in QFabric, now T4000 and PTX and/or any kind of bogies or targets you have for the full year for any of them? Would you be helpful for us to get a sense as to how they'll grow or how they'll -- what percentage they look like right now? And then when you have a QFabric sale, a full QFabric sale, like some of the customers you mentioned, can you give us a sense as to what percentage of that is top-of-rack versus what percentage is the interconnect part, the other parts? So what I'm trying to get at is if someone is actually buying a bunch of top-of-rack switches, but hasn't fully committed yet to the interconnect, had they but 70% of the solution already? Or is it only 20 or 30%, and that's much more to go if you have the interconnect? And then finally, on the Edge securities side, you said you were working on some features, and I think a lot of third parties out there say that you've been losing some share on the Edge and the security side. If you can talk to us about that business and what you can do to restore your position on the Edge and security would be great.
Robyn M. Denholm: In terms of the T4000, PTX revenue and QFabric revenue, we haven't disclosed those, and we're not going to now. They're modest amounts of revenue. Obviously QFabric is growing a couple of quarters now revenue that is growing nicely. PTX, it was the first quarter of revenue, and we're very pleased with the revenue that we recorded in the quarter, and as Stefan mentioned, the orders that we received for that. In terms of T4000, the same thing. Obviously we started shipping late in the fourth quarter. Again, first full quarter of revenue, and we're pleased with the customer engagement that we have on that front. In terms of the ramp of those products, it's too early to call that at this point. We will talk a little bit more about that at the Analyst Meeting in a few weeks here.
Stefan Dyckerhoff: So Ehud, this is Stefan. If I can just expand on the QFabric part of your question. As we look at the QFabric product line, all of our customers, it's an architectural discussion, and we start with whatever they want to start with, whether the top-of-rack that they need to deploy, has to deploy 10-gig service, they can leverage their investment through taking the on-ramp to the QFabric, so it's a gradual approach that they can take in order to deploy their capital more efficiently going forward. Certainly with the distributive nature of top-of-racks, you made a good step forward in adopting the full system, if you have deployed the top-of-racks, and it will make it significantly simpler. And as their businesses dictate that additional performance of a data center, they're going to go do that. But we're very happy with the kind of architectural alignment we have with the customers and the road that they're on.
Kevin R. Johnson: Yes. I'll comment on the third part of your question, specifically on security. I think it was a -- this was a strong quarter for us with the SRX. I think it was roughly within $1 million of the highest quarter we've had of SRX revenue. And I mean it reflects the strength that we're seeing in the scenarios for Service Provider, and I think we've been very transparent that the work we're doing around our security designer software, which is basically software that is the user interface for configuring and managing these security devices in the enterprise, we had an initial release -- or a release of that software in Q1. We've got some further releases coming throughout the year. We've been very open with our customers. And so the focus that we have in many ways on our security agenda is to really address the opportunity to improve the user interface and user experience for enterprise customers as they configure and manage these security devices, and we're seeing good response thus far in the quarter from the work that we've done, and we've got a good road map, and I think at the Financial Analyst Meeting, we'll provide a deeper dive on the overall end-to-end security strategy.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan.
Rod B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I just wanted to -- Robyn, just to clarify your comment on operating margins just to make sure I got it. You're saying that operating margin will increase sequentially each quarter going forward, or that it will just be higher in future quarters than it is now? I just wanted to clarify that. The second thing I wanted to ask was on the APAC revenue decline. If you guys could give any color on that, I thought it was down 12% year-over-year, so just any color on what's happening there, anything specific. And then circling back to that comment on revenue proportions and so on, the T4000, I'm just curious if you could give us any kind of idea whether that -- would that be the majority of routing revenue as you exit the quarter -- or core routing revenue that is, as you exit the year I mean? Or is that more of a 2013 event when that becomes the majority of core routing revenue?
Robyn M. Denholm: Okay. So in terms of operating margin, what I said in the prepared remarks is that Q2 will be somewhere between 12% and 14%, reflective of the flat to up revenue, with similar gross margins and similar OpEx to the first quarter. Our operating principle is to expand operating margins through the year, and so we're very focused on that, as Kevin mentioned and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, in terms of continuing to drive revenue growth and continuing to drive operational efficiencies across the company as well. So in terms of APAC, what I talked about in my prepared remarks, and then maybe Kevin would like to comment as well, was that we did see year-over-year declines. The primary reason for that is Q1 of last year, which was pre-tsunami, if you remember tsunami was 03/11. We actually had completed in the first quarter a large service provider deployment in Japan. We talked about that at the time. And so our year-over-year comparisons were very high for Q1 of last year, and so that was the year-over-year decline story in Japan. We did see a sequential increase in Service Provider demand in Japan, which we were pleased about.
Kevin R. Johnson: And I'll just add to that, I think we saw an opportunity in China that pushed out of Q1 that we're still focused on, and I think as Robyn said, we've got a very good Service Provider business in Japan and relationship in Japan. But we have an opportunity in Japan to diversify our customer base and expand beyond the set of service providers into other service providers and into more enterprise customers through our partners in Japan. And so I look at the emerging market opportunities that we have and China and India and how we continue to drive execution and diversifying the customer base in Japan.
Stefan Dyckerhoff: And let me finally comment on some of the new products. So with our newest release of Junos, we support the T4K, the MX upgrade, as well as the PTX. So as we look at customer qualifications for those, the PTX have contributed minimal revenue in the quarter, and we see a qualification time that is in the 9- to 12-month range typically for such a new system. And then from there our customers, we'll move to deployment. On the T4000, had a slightly higher revenue contribution in the quarter, and we would expect the qualification times to be in the 6- to 9-month range with that type of upgrade. And again, customers will deploy the capital prudently as they move through the year once they have the system qualified. And then last but not least on the MX, we saw good uptake on the MX upgrades in the quarter as we enable those with our new release of Junos, and we're optimistic about the traction of those upgrades as we move through the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nikos Theodosopoulos from UBS.
Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Two quick questions. Stefan, the Service Provider router market last year grew below 10% after many years of growing stronger double digits. Do you think we're in a new secular growth rate in routing? Or do you think we can recover back to that double-digit -- strong double-digit growth rate? And then, Kevin, a question for you. The company goals had been 20% revenue growth, 25% operating margin. Do you see those goals as still achievable? Obviously this year wouldn't be the case, but do you still see those as targets? Or do you feel new targets need to be established for the company?
Stefan Dyckerhoff: So on router growth, I think what we saw -- what we are seeing overall is that certainly IP technology is a bigger, bigger portion of what drives the business for Service Provider. However, as Kevin mentioned, we think service are going -- service providers are going to continue to be cautious with their CapEx, and that applies to all areas of the business. So I think it's a little bit too early to call the market growth for the rest of the year. Certainly as we work with our Service Provider customers, and we see their plans for deployment of capital towards the markets we address, I think we're in a very good position. But the overall environment for our Service Provider CapEx is something that will remain somewhat uncertain throughout the rest of the year as we stated.
Kevin R. Johnson: Yes. Nikos, I'll take your second question and refer back to the operating principles that we've stated for 2012, and I think -- your first question on what will addressable market do in growth, is a relevant question, because one of the operating principles we have is we got to drive to grow faster than the market. And so when markets expand faster, that gives us more opportunity to grow and when they expand slower. We do think we're in a growth market, but frankly the focus is going to be as the operating principle states, which is growing faster than the market. And then the second part of your question is the way to drive operating leverage on the op margin is to drive the top line revenue by monetizing this great set of new products that we've just released in the marketplace. And we've been working hard for a number of years on these products, the silicon that goes into these products, the systems and the software, put together with an architectural approach. And now that we have these products in market, it's up to us to really drive execution and monetize that investment that we've made in R&D. And so the operating principle that states growing and expanding the operating margin from Q1, combined with the operating principle about growing faster than the market, would be sort of the guiding principle. So, Robyn, anything else you want to add.
Robyn M. Denholm: No, I think that's good. In terms of absolute numbers and that type of thing in terms of the model, we're obviously not putting out a new model at this point. We're talking about the operating principles and growing faster than the market in this environment.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Kevin, can you share your observations of the Service Provider orders on a month-to-month basis? And I ask since Verizon was one of the first carriers to fall off and is now one of the first to return. Does your order flow point to a return to a cycle? I recognized that some Europeans are still weak, if their deterioration or just caution, which implies that time frame for a return. And then, Robyn, just a quick question. Routers, if we do -- return to a cycle, can we still get to 68% gross margins? I understand a lot of that is mix related, but do you feel that there's a structural drop in margins for the router market?
Kevin R. Johnson: I'll take the first one and then hand it over to Robyn. Look, in the Service Provider marketplace, the observation that I would have is there's -- certainly in Europe, there's a geographic commonality that's sort of impacted by the macro situation in Europe that creates a certain pattern of cautiousness on those service providers. Then on other service providers, it's on a case-by-case basis. It sort of depends on where they are in the project cycle and how they prioritize things. In some cases, as they're growing their mobile Internet business, they may have one set of priorities and then shift to other priorities. So there's not a common pattern that you see across all of them. But the one thing that is common is certainly they've built their business around delivering value to their customers in the form of networks, and those networks are transitioning to IP packet-switched network, which creates opportunity for us. So that is the one commonality that I see in Service Providers. But there's not some common pattern -- your question was kind of month-to-month. There wasn't some common pattern that I would say fit all service providers. There's some geographic and then it's kind of case-by-case, depending on the customer's situation.
Robyn M. Denholm: Yes. Mark, in terms of the gross margins, I mean in the near-term, as I said before, we do expect the gross margins to stay in this range. So for Q2, we believe that they'll be roughly flat with the first quarter, reflective of some modest increase at the high end and in terms of revenue, but the gross margins will be roughly the same. In terms of competition and pricing and that type of thing in the marketplace, we obviously are in a competitive market. We have been for a long period of time. Our strategy is very clear though. We deliver innovation to the market, which drives tremendous efficiencies in CapEx and also in OpEx for our customers. And so that is our main focus in terms of delivering the innovation to market. And we will continue to work on the gross margin structure both in terms of the cost side but also as the mix of products increases, particularly with the new products. We'll see gross margins increase as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein with Credit Suisse.
Paul Silverstein - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: A couple of questions, if I may. Robyn, can you comment on pricing environment relative to what you've seen in the past? And secondly, in terms of your guidance, we're looking flat to up $30 million depending upon if you were to come in within the range, Kevin or Robyn, can you comment on what the different drivers of that guidance in terms of ramping the new products? And I recognize -- we're talking about very small base business at this point for those new products, but if you could comment, your expectations of the existing business in terms of growth or decline versus the growth in the new products to get you that guidance, that will be appreciated.
Robyn M. Denholm: Yes. In terms of the revenue guidance for the second quarter, we are looking at flat to slightly up in terms of revenue overall. And in terms of the sectors, what we're anticipating is obviously flat to slightly up from a Service Provider perspective and also from an Enterprise perspective, just given the current environment. In terms of the overall gross margins, I think you talked about -- I'm sorry, it was pricing, I miswrote that. So the pricing environment, as I mentioned, in the last question on gross margins, it's obviously a competitive environment. It has been, for quite some time, in terms of the market dynamics. But it hasn't changed our philosophy in terms of delivering innovation to the market and total cost of ownership for our customers. I mean clearly, as Kevin has mentioned before on the earnings call, we will compete on price to win new customers on a selective basis. And so we will continue to do that on a selective basis, particularly as it relates to extending our reach into certain customers and certain markets and geographies. But overall, the market environment is pretty consistent with what it's been over the last number of quarters.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America.
Tal Liani - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Two questions, first is just a clarification on gross margin. If revenues go back to date, this quarter then would have been back at their historical levels, let's say, of last quarter -- last year's first quarter. Would margins be in the same level? Or is there an impact of pricing and the aggressiveness of competitors, I just couldn't understand this part. So that's the first question.
Robyn M. Denholm: Yes, if the mix of product with similar to the mix of product of Q1 of last year, the gross margins would have been similar to what they were a year ago. There wouldn't be that big a difference in terms of the line items of gross margins on the individual products are pretty consistent with were they were a year ago. So that's why in terms of my discussion on the call, it is still mainly the result of product mix with our routing proportion of revenue being relatively low compared to historical averages.
Operator: We have time for one last question, and it comes from the line of Tim Long with Bank of Montréal.
Tim Long - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Just a question on visibility, if we could. Maybe if we just go back to the March quarter, pretty meaningful beat there, and I know, Robyn, it's a tough environment and also you mentioned the orders from Q3 hitting. Could you just kind of give us a sense as to how much of that -- whether it was $50 million, $60 million of revenue beat was due to previous orders and how much of that was in the quarter? And then secondly, when you look into the second quarter, has the visibility improved or not? And is there any deals that had been previously signed that will continue to contribute into the second quarter like they did in the first quarter?
Robyn M. Denholm: In terms of Q1, Q1 pretty much unfolded as we were expecting. Obviously slightly better with our U.S. -- largely with Service Provider customers. So slightly better. But basically the quarter unfolded as we expected it to unfold. In terms of our visibility as we go into Q2, it's about the same. We have obviously -- our product book-to-bill for Q1 was just under 1. We exit Q1 with slightly less backlog then we entered the quarter, but that's typical of the first quarter. And actually we are pretty pleased with the backlogs that we have going into the second quarter. Our deferred revenue from a product perspective is essentially flat sequentially, so we've got visibility to the balance sheet as well. And we also, obviously, continue our dialogues with customers not just about the new product but existing products and design wins that we work with them on and other customer opportunities. So in terms of visibility, it's about the same as it was coming into the first quarter. No better, no worse than 90 days ago.
Operator: I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thank you, operator. And we'd like to once again thank you all for joining us today, and we hope to see many of you at our Financial Analysts Meeting here in Sunnyvale in June.
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Juniper Networks Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Kathleen Nemeth, Vice President of Investor Relations for Juniper Networks. Thank you. Ms. Nemeth, you may begin.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Here on the call today are Kevin Johnson, Chief Executive Officer; and Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial Officer. Kevin is joining us from Davos, where he is participating in the World Economic Forum. Before we continue, I would like to highlight the reporting change that we are preparing to implement. As we discussed early last year, we are aligning our resources with our platforms and software strategy. In 2012 we will conform our financial reporting to these business segments. Under the new segment structure, we expect certain product families to be reported under new segments. We will provide you 2 years of recast quarterly history, and we'll continue to provide key product category data.  Please remember when listening to today's call that statements concerning Juniper's business outlook, economic and market outlook, future financial operating results and overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including economic conditions generally or in the networking industry, changes in overall technology spending, the network capacity requirements of service providers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply chain constraints, variation in the mix of products sold, customer perception and acceptance of our products, litigation and other factors listed in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances change after the date of this call. In discussing the financial results, Robyn will first present results on a GAAP basis. And for purposes of today's discussion, we'll also review non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why the management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult our 8-K filed with the SEC today. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results, please see today's press release. In general, non-GAAP results exclude certain non-recurring charges, amortization of purchased intangibles and other acquisition-related charges and expenses related to stock-based compensation. On today's call, Robyn will also be providing forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis, other than that with respect to revenue and share count. All guidance is forward-looking, and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier. GAAP guidance measures are not available on a forward-looking basis, due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to certain charges, which are excluded from the non-GAAP guidance estimates. Please note that today's call is scheduled to last for one hour. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will now turn the call over to Kevin.
Kevin R. Johnson: Thanks, Kathleen, and welcome, everyone. Our results for Q4 are in line with the updated outlook we provided earlier this month, and Robyn will cover the details after my remarks. I'd like to spend a few minutes providing some insights on our 2011 performance, the near-term macro environment and industry dynamics, as well as our strategic approach, which is centered on innovation and customer value. I'll wrap up by sharing our operating principles for 2012, and update you on our innovation pipeline.  Juniper's revenue growth was 9% for 2011. Annual revenue for 2011 represented a new record for the company. Profitability was solid, though lower than expected. Our Q4 results felt the effect of increased macro volatility that escalated over the second half of the year due to the sovereign debt concerns in Europe and slowing recoveries in APAC countries as well as the U.S.  Here on our U.S. business, we saw a number of our largest customers reduce their spend within the quarter, including Tier 1 service providers and financial services. Though on other sectors like Federal, we saw stronger spending than expected. Another factor that played into recent results is the fact that we're entering what is surely the most exciting new product cycle in our history. As we move through the launch phase on these products, we've seen some short-term effects, particularly in core routing as customers awaited the T4000. This product is now shipping, and we are seeing very good early response. Our PTX transport core product line is also on track to release later this quarter.  There are also some significant positives in our results, particularly in Enterprise. Even with the macro headwinds and product transitions I described, Enterprise sales were up 9% year-on-year for Q4 and 11% for the full year. This growth reflects good performance in both routing and switching, with the latter category up 28% in 2011. We are taking share in the Enterprise consistent with our stated objectives. Enterprise growth is one of several proof points that validate our strategy and reinforce the strength of our value proposition to customers. We are firmly grounded in our strategic direction, and we will continue to play offense, while managing through the current pressures in our industry. As we begin a very active 2012 here at Juniper, I think it's a good time to refresh on the 5 key components of our strategy.  One, we are pure play in high-performance networking. All of our world-class talent is focused 100% on expanding our leadership in this category, which we firmly believe will encompass most of the networking market as the 2 megatrends of mobility and Cloud computing accelerate.  Two, we are recognized around the world as the innovation leader in networking. We are committed to investing in R&D at a level that drives our innovation agenda, enabling us to deliver highly differentiated products and outstanding value to our customers.  Three, we are committed to leveraging our R&D investment to develop products and solutions that span both our Service Provider customer base and our growing Enterprise customer base. Again, the trends of mobility and Cloud computing make it easier for us to harness the strategy across the 2 sectors.  Four, we are diversifying our customer base. We have significantly broadened our Service Provider business over the last several years, adding 155 net new Service Provider customers in 2011. We're also expanding our presence in the Enterprise, and we continue to take share.  And five, we are complementing our system strategy with the Junos Space software solutions. These solutions leverage the one Junos platform and are highly synergistic toward systems business. We believe this strategy aligns very well with the powerful forces that are driving the new network. Innovation is what will drive long-term value creation in the networking industry, as customers abandon the complexity and unnecessary costs that plague old architectures and embrace open systems that can scale across multiple dimensions of network growth. As our innovation takes hold in the market, we are seeing competition become more aggressive. This only reinforces that we are on the right track, and we need to maintain our investments and continue to innovate faster than the competition. We will stay the course with our organic R&D investment. 2012 is a major new product year for Juniper. We will be very focused on making investments that best monetize our innovations, while remaining thoughtful about spending levels across the business. It is important to recognize that Juniper's R&D commitment has rewarded the company time and time again. Five years ago we began investing in the MX 3D Edge routing platform. We maintained our investment, and MX has established Juniper as a key player to Service Provider Edge.  Our EX switching portfolio is another example. Over a 3- to 5-year arc, the EX has further expanded our portfolio and has translated, as we predicted, into a share-taking position for Juniper in switching. We fully expect our new line of next generation data center fabric will enable us to take that position to a new level. Of course, there are some implications as we release new innovation into the market. For example, we've just started shipping the T4000 as planned, and this may have slowed T Series orders over the last 6 months as customers awaited the new product. These customers know that we are updating the performance that we deliver in the core.  In Security, our customers are continuing to adopt Junos Space SRX offerings. While our SRX portfolio for service providers is strong, there are some product features that we are focusing on for our Enterprise customers. You'll hear more about our action plan for Security and other innovation development in a special technology discussion with Stefan Dyckerhoff and Bob Muglia at Mobile World Congress at the end of February.  So we are confident in our strategy, our innovation pipeline and the deeper penetration we are achieving in both Service Provider and the Enterprise, but the near-term environment remains challenging. As we have done in the past few years, we have established a set of operating principles by which we are managing through the year. For 2012, those principles are: first, we are assuming continued uncertainty in the near-term macro environment; second, we plan to grow faster than the markets we serve, focusing on new product introductions to accelerate growth as we exit the year; third, we will maintain investments that deliver innovation in our product roadmap; fourth, we are focused on prudent cost management; and fifth, we expect to generate solid cash flows to support our strategic needs, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. As we operate the business within these principles, we are maximizing the success and accelerating the adoption of our new innovations coming to market.  I'm pleased with the progress we are making and the customer feedback we are hearing. I'd like to share a few examples. Our T4000 router is now shipping, and 2 major Service Provider customers, Telefonica and Comcast, placed initial orders in Q4. Our PTX trial process is going well, and we received customer orders for this product, which will ship as planned later this quarter. QFabric had its first full quarter of revenue contribution, which exceeded our expectations. Most important at this stage, however, is securing early adopters for deploying QFabric and will serve as references to other interested customers. This creates and accelerates the demand cycle. We are pleased with the progress in this area as we now have a number of key customers in various stages of deployment across all 3 theaters. These wins, combined with the growing pipeline of opportunity, is also generating more and more partner attention on this important product.  In the quarter, we released the next wave of Mobile Next features, including the S-gateway, as planned. Customers trial and third-party tests are showing that MobileNext evolved packet core software running on an MX 3D delivers breakthrough performance results for customers. And that success is supported by an increased interest we are seeing with Service Providers. As an example is Elisa Corporation, the Finnish telecoms and ICT services company, which has selected the Juniper Networks MobileNext portfolio as a unique mobile packet core solution in its network.  To wrap up, we are aligned strategically to address what we firmly believe is a vibrant long-term growth opportunity in networking. There are some near-term challenges, but as we have demonstrated in the past, we are committed to investing in an innovation roadmap that best positions us to capture the long-term opportunity ahead. The 2 key trends of mobility and Cloud are fully intact and, in fact, are accelerating demand for the differentiated products we offer. Customers increasingly recognize that legacy networks are plagued by complexity, unnecessary cost and inadequate performance. And customers around the world are embracing flatter networks that reduce complexity and cost, while delivering dramatic improvements in performance and scale. We are the one of the very few companies delivering breakthrough technology in the networking category, and we fully embrace that position. We look forward to seeing you at our upcoming meeting at Mobile World Congress. In the meantime, thank you for joining us today, and I'll turn it over now to Robyn to cover the results.
Robyn M. Denholm: Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. The December quarter was an atypical and unexpectedly weak finish to the 2011 fiscal year. These results are consistent with the revised ranges we provided on January 9. With the backdrop of continuing uncertainty in the macro environment, 2 main factors contributed to the weakness. Firstly, our largest Service Provider customers reduced their spending intentions within the quarter. And secondly, while our Enterprise business did well, the growth was driven primarily by Federal, with a softer finish than expected in other areas.  Looking at our demand metrics, book-to-bill was 1.0 and product deferred revenue was up slightly sequentially and relatively flat year-over-year. While we believe that the long-term demand fundamentals remain intact and the near-term outlook remains uncertain, in this environment a careful approach is appropriate as we anticipate the effect on customer demand and the prioritization of their investment and project deployment. We will continue to execute our strategy, whilst remaining focused on prudent expense management.  Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $1,121,000,000, up 1% sequentially and down 6% year-over-year. Revenue for the full year was $4,449,000,000, up 9% year-over-year. There were no customers who accounted for more than 10% of total revenue in the quarter or for the full year. For the fourth quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.18. Included in the GAAP diluted earnings was a $0.02 impact for restructuring and other charges. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.28, which is unchanged sequentially, and a $0.14 year-over-year decrease. As a reminder, last year's non-GAAP diluted earnings included a $0.03 favorable impact related to the renewal of the full year R&D tax credit in the quarter.  For the full year, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.79 compared to $1.15 from the prior year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.19 versus $1.32 a year ago. Now let me provide you some color on revenue by region, business segment and market.  In the fourth quarter, the Americas were approximately 46% of total revenue, EMEA was 36% and APAC was 18%. Americas revenue was down 6% sequentially and 10% year-over-year, primarily due to the reduction in demand by some of our largest Service Providers. This year-over-year decline was partially offset by good Enterprise growth. EMEA revenue was up 28% sequentially and 11% year-over-year, with both Service Provider and Enterprise gains. We saw good growth in Eastern Europe and The Netherlands. In addition, we saw the first revenue from a significant new win with a top Service Provider in Eastern Europe, which spans a broad range of our product portfolio. APAC revenue decreased 16% sequentially and 20% year-over-year. This was primarily due to continued weakness in Japan and the push out of some demand in China.  Now looking at the revenue by segment. Infrastructure revenue was $849 million, up 2% sequentially and down 6% year-over-year. Within this segment, total router product revenue was $507 million, down 8% sequentially and 21% year-over-year. Total MX product revenue was $255 million, up 11% sequentially and 8% year-over-year. This reflects the healthy competitive position and incremental wins we've secured in the Edge. T Series products were down sequentially as a result of weaker overall demand from Service Providers, coupled with unexpected pause as we introduced the T4000. As planned, we shipped the first T4000 units this quarter and expect first revenue in Q1. We also anticipate the first PTX shipments in Q1, and both products are generating excellent customer interest.  Total switching revenue was a record $168 million, up 28% sequentially and 36% year-over-year. Product revenue, which includes QFabric and wireless LAN, was $157 million, up 29% sequentially and 33% year-over-year. This was driven by a strength in our EX product, both in data center and campus deployment. We also recorded the initial revenues from the first deployment of our full QFabric solution. We are very encouraged by the strong customer interest in this disruptive technology.  For the full year, Infrastructure revenue was $3.4 billion, up 12% from the prior year. This was comprised primarily of router product revenue of $2.3 billion, up 7%; and switching product revenue of $493 million, up 31%.  Moving on to the SLT segment. Revenue for the quarter was $272 million, which was flat sequentially and down 4% year-on-year. For the full year, SLT revenue was just over $1 billion, down 2% from a year ago. SRX product revenue for the quarter was $81 million, down 12% from a strong third quarter. As we have noted in the past, SRX revenues will vary by quarter, influenced by the timing of high-end SRX Service Provider deployment.  In the Enterprise, we have seen positive customer traction with the branch SRX, but the revenue growth from these products has not offset the decline of the older Enterprise security products. The Q4 release of the security design application in Junos Space, and the product roadmap are promising steps as we stabilize and ultimately regain growth in the Enterprise segment of the security market. We continue to see good adoption of Junos Pulse and had our first revenue from the new mobile security suite. Also, we began our first customer deployment of MobileNext and had new video optimization design wins, both of which will yield revenue this year.  Looking more closely at the markets we address. Service Provider revenue was $677 million, down 1% sequentially and 14% on a year-over-year basis. Lower routing revenue was partially offset by strength in switching, both sequentially and year-over-year. We also saw strength in sales to cable providers and T2 carriers. Enterprise revenue was $444 million, up 6% sequentially, due primarily to strength in switching. We also saw strength in sales to Federal and several European countries.  Revenue was up 9% year-over-year as routing and switching growth offset a slight decline in security. For the quarter, Service Provider was 60% of total revenue and Enterprise was 40% of total revenue. For the full year, Service Provider was 64% of total revenue and Enterprise was 36% of total revenue. Our increasingly diversified revenue base, both in Service Provider and in Enterprise, helped offset some of the weakness with our top customers.  Now moving on to our margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP margins for the fourth quarter were 63.3% compared to 65.3% last quarter. Product gross margins were 64.2% of product revenue, down 3.3% sequentially and 5.1 points year-over-year. Gross margins for the quarter were negatively impacted by 3 mix-related factors: firstly, a lower proportion of router sales; secondly, a shift in the geographic mix of revenue from the Americas to EMEA; and lastly, a higher percentage of services in our total revenue. Performance for the year was impacted by these same factors, as well as increased fixed overhead and inventory-related costs. Whilst we recognize competitors are positioning themselves aggressively, we've not seen any discernible difference in our discounting or in our win-loss ratio.  Our strategy is to continue to differentiate our products through innovation and total cost of ownership. Services gross margin were 60.6%, up 3.2 points from the prior quarter and 2 points compared to the prior year. This was a result of higher overall services revenue and good cost management. Non-GAAP operating expenses were flat sequentially at $501 million, driven by lower variable compensation, offset by higher prototype and development costs, and very good cost management.  R&D expenses were down 1% from both the prior quarter and last year's fourth quarter. Sales and marketing expenses were flat sequentially and down 2% year-over-year. G&A expenses remained about 3% of sales at $38 million.  Looking at headcount. We ended the year at 9,129 employees, a slight sequential decrease and a net increase of 357 heads or 4% from last year. We have slowed our hiring and are focused on the most strategic requirements as we address the near-term environment. Non-GAAP operating margins for the quarter was 18.6%, down 1.4 points sequentially and down 5.9 points year-over-year.  Looking at operating margins by segment. Infrastructure operating margin decreased 1.5 points sequentially and 9 points lower year-over-year. This was primarily due to lower revenue and product gross margins. For the full year, Infrastructure operating margin was 21% of sales, 4.4 points lower than last year. As a reminder, the results of the infrastructure segment include routers, switchers, MobileNext and QFabric.  SLT operating margin was 23.4%, 1.1 points lower sequentially and 3.7 points above last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, SLT operating margin was 19.4% of sales, 0.5 point lower than last year.  The GAAP tax rate was 21.5% for the quarter. The non-GAAP tax rate was 23.7%, down 3.7 points from the prior quarter. This was due to our geographic mix of earnings and a onetime impact from the favorable resolution of certain state income tax matters.  Looking at the balance sheet. We ended the year with $4.3 billion of total cash and investment with approximately 50% on shore. Our net cash and investment was $3.3 billion. DSO was 46 days in the quarter, up from 36 days last quarter, but in line with Q4 last year. Cash from operations was a strong $244 million this quarter, up $58 million sequentially and down $127 million from the prior year.  For the full year, we generated strong cash flows at $987 million from operations. Q4 CapEx totaled $78 million. For the full year, CapEx was $266 million, an increase of $81 million over the prior year. This was driven primarily by the cost for our Sunnyvale camp -- corporate campus.  Depreciation and amortization was flat with last quarter at approximately $43 million. Our weighted average shares on a diluted basis for the quarter were 533 million shares, a decrease of approximately 3 million from the third quarter. On a full year basis, we bought back $541 million of shares, which largely offset stock issued through our employee equity program.  Now I will review our outlook. As a reminder, these metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis, except for revenue and share count. Looking ahead, we believe the long-term demand fundamentals remain intact, and we are confident about the growth potential of our new product portfolio. However, we are concerned by the near-term uncertainty in the macro environment and the effect it may have on the level, timing and prioritization of customer demand. Given this view, we expect Q1 2012 to be challenging. We are expecting revenues to range between $960 million and $990 million. This reflects seasonally lower Enterprise spending and continued caution by Service Providers. Gross margins for the first quarter are expected to be in the range of 63% to 64%. We expect the first quarter's revenue mix to have similar characteristics to last quarter's, but should see progress from our continued focus on cost improvement. Operating expenses are expected to increase in Q1 as we incorporate the typical increases in employee expenses such as FICA and the reset of variable compensation.  As we have done before, we will continue to make the strategic R&D and go-to-market investments that are necessary to successfully execute our strategies and capitalize on the new product cycles, while carefully managing costs. And as a result of lower revenue, similar gross margins and higher operating expenses for the first quarter, we expect operating margins for the first quarter to range from 11% to 13%. This is expected to result in first quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $0.11 and $0.14 per share. This assumes a flat share count and a tax rate of 29%. The tax rate includes an estimated $0.01 quarterly impact on EPS, and assumes no renewal of the R&D tax credit.  In summary, we are confident of our strategy of disruptive innovation, and our operating principles for the year position us very well going forward. In the near term, we anticipate the revenue environment will remain challenging. For the full year, we expect to grow faster than the markets we serve based on the new product cycles and the conversion of current design wins. We also anticipate that we will improve our operating margin from the Q1 level throughout the year. We will navigate this near-term uncertain demand environment as we have in the past, remaining focused on prudent expense management, investing in critical areas of the business to drive growth and continuing to bring value to our customers as they address the market demands of mobile Internet and Cloud computing. I want to thank our employees for their continued support. Their dedication, innovation and commitment to delivering the new network are keys to our success. With that, I will hand it over to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Marshall with ISI group.
Brian Marshall - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: A question with respect to Service Provider CapEx outlook. Obviously very difficult to ascertain, but I was wondering -- and obviously you're not talking about things from a quantitative perspective, but more qualitatively, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about, kind of, your best guess with respect to when things might start to pick up from an industry standpoint from a wireline CapEx perspective. Historically, it seems like these things happen, kind of, in 4 quarters, and it seems like that we're kind of halfway through, if that's the case, implying a bottom in the, sort of, summer time frame this year. Would you, kind of, agree with that?
Kevin R. Johnson: I'll go ahead and take that, Robyn. Let me just comment on some of the trends, Brian, that we see unfolding. First, I think clearly, there's a shift of CapEx from wireline to wireless. And when we look at that shift, fundamentally, that plays into the architectural approach that we put together. Architecturally, when we look at that shift from wireline to wireless, we believe customers -- certainly, there'll be a wave of investment around radio access networks, but then as things come to the packet-switched network, we believe in Fixed Mobile Convergence, so the unified Edge, which basically is what we architected the MX 3D to do -- was to be able to handle both the wireline and wireless side. And so with that shift from wireline to wireless, we think that starts to play into the architectural value proposition that we have about helping customers collapse multiple networks into a single unified Edge, which gives them better economics in terms of carrying that traffic.  In addition to that shift, there's also the trend that I think you see with Service Providers where they're much more closely looking at the level of CapEx relative to revenue generation. And this is something, too, that over the last 3 years we've predicted as customers look at their revenues streams and start to map the level of investment required to drive that revenue, they're looking for efficiencies and efficient use of capital. We believe that, too, plays to our value proposition, whether it's on the Edge with the unified Edge or whether it's in the core or whether it's in the Converged Supercore. And so with that market shift, we think it plays to several things that have been a core part of our strategy over the last few years, as we've built these architectures and products. Now the question is, if you think about going through the year, when and how will CapEx unfold?  First, I'll just remind you that the packet-switched networking component of CapEx is a small percentage of the total Service Provider CapEx. I do believe that in talking to many customers, certainly a combination of the uncertainty related to the European sovereign debt situation, and the implication that has on financial services and the implication that has on access to capital is one of the reasons, I think, that Service Providers are being somewhat perhaps more cautious in the levels of capital expenditures, but they're also being more mindful of how those capital expenditures are aligned behind their revenue generation. So I think we're going to have to wait and see how the macroeconomic situation unfolds, and our approach is going to be consistent with what we've done in the past, is to remain very agile as we see that unfold, yet staying true to our strategy. Because we believe we have the right strategy that plays to the value proposition these customers need and are looking for, and we're going to have to just be agile as we work through the time period and see how these things start to pick up.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ehud Gelblum from Morgan Stanley.
Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: A couple of things. When you look at -- Robyn, you're talking about the T Series and the T4000 stalling a little bit on the router side. At what point did you see that happen? And since PTX is also somewhat of a core router type of product, are you seeing any mix of customer base? Perhaps -- PTX perhaps cannibalizes some of your T Series or core, or you're seeing anything happening there in the dynamic?  Then a clarification in the Enterprise side. If you can you just give us what the wireless LAN revenues did, that will be helpful also.  And then finally, on the MX, that did very well this quarter. How do you see that? If you can give us a sense as to, kind of, how that plays out through the rest of 2012. Does it start weak and then go up every quarter throughout or you're, kind of, still waiting to see what carriers do before you kind of call what the MX is going to do?
Robyn M. Denholm: I'll start answering the question, and then Kevin can elaborate as well. So in terms of routing, as Kevin mentioned before, we are very confident in the strategies that we have both on the core and on the Edge in terms of the Universal Edge and the core. In terms of customers pausing for the T4000, we were expecting that in the quarter. If you recall back to last quarter's call, we had a surprisingly strong quarter in T in Q3, and we called that out. We actually were expecting it to decline in the quarter and it did. In terms of the overall commentary about routing, we obviously did see that come down during the quarter as service providers changed their spending intentions within the quarter. With respect to wireless LAN, I talked about the total switching growth in the quarter. We saw growth in all 3 areas of the switching of EX, as well as wireless LAN as well as QFabric quarter-over-quarter. So we are pleased with the progress across the board for the switching portfolio.  And with respect to MX, the strength in the quarter, we did see that come back up as we called out on the third quarter's earnings call. That's a result of both new design wins and continued deployment of existing design wins that we have on the MX side. And our view is that, that platform is very strong in the Universal Edge. Strategically, as Kevin commented, there is a convergence from the Edge, and we believe that MX is very well positioned for that. Kevin, anything you'd like to add?
Kevin R. Johnson: Yes, I'll just add on the question you had about the PTX, Ehud. Look most of the PTX deals that we're working on, fundamentally the PTX and Converged Supercore, it collapses multiple layers of the network. It doesn't replace the core. And so most of the deals we're working on have T Series for the core MX and the PTX, as we're working with customers. So I don't anticipate that the PTX is a product line the cannibalizes the core. What it does is it now extends the core and allows that core network to be able to collapse multiple networks into a single point with the PTX.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani from Bank of America.
Tal Liani - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I wanted to ask about margins of core routing and Edge routing. First, do you see any pricing pressure in the market within -- when you look at like-to-like, kind of, customers outside of geographical mix? And then how is pricing different between core and Edge? I'm asking this just because Cisco mentioned repeatedly in the last 6 months about declining margins in routing, and I want to correlate it with your declining margins.
Robyn M. Denholm: Yes. So I'll answer that question, Tal. So firstly, as we've stated strategically, our -- the way we work with customers is on total cost of ownership in terms of delivering products into the market that would reduce their cost of ownership both in terms of CapEx and OpEx. And so we've been focused on that across all the product areas that we're in, with both Service Provider customers and with Enterprise customers. That is our core way of operating within the marketplace. And we continue to deliver the innovation that customers need in order to do that.  In terms of our pricing, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're not seeing any discernible difference in our discounting practices or in the win-loss ratios versus any other period of time. So there is obviously -- the competitive environment is intense, but it's always been intense. So our view is that, that hasn't changed. I think what has [Audio Gap] we are delivering innovation to the market that directly drives total cost of ownership difference for our customers, and they are seeing that translate to value for them. So, Kevin, anything else you'd like to add?
Kevin R. Johnson: I'll just sort of punctuate that point, Robyn. First of all, the innovation agenda we're driving creates differentiation, which our strategy is to sell the value in the differentiation we have. That said, we are very aware of the competitive dynamics, and our sales teams are very focused on customer situations. And if we see areas where competitors are getting more aggressive on price, we may decide to be surgical in a certain customer deal or two. But I think as Robyn commented this quarter, we didn't see broad levels of discounting taking place. But I just want to comment that from a competitive standpoint, we will sell our value, and we're going to be very focused on the customer and the competitive dynamics in that account. And if we need to use price surgically, we will consider and be thoughtful about how to do that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Sue from RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Kevin, I'm trying to reconcile the promising market trends against declining revenues, customer delays and lower operating margins. Why do you think the challenges are temporary in nature? And if the competitive action sort of increasing, do you subscribe to that notion that your large and growing target markets are now just large markets and now there's a structural change to margins for everyone?
Kevin R. Johnson: Well, first of all, I think the market trends -- long-term market trends that we start with would be those of mobile Internet and Cloud computing. In fact, the traffic driven by those market trends continues to grow. That's point number one. Point number two is the transition of how to carry that traffic to packet-switched networking. So the packet-switched networking is a subset of the total capital expenditures of these customers. And then number three, you look at the fact that customers are trying to get more efficiency out of the investment in CapEx, which in order to get that efficiency, we believe very strongly it's a combination of the architectural approach that we've taken with the new network and the innovation that we put into our products. So we think that, number one, the long-term demand trends remain strong; number two, the customer trend and desire to get CapEx more aligned with their revenue is going to make the architectural approach and innovation we're delivering more valuable to them; and number three, I think it's going to come down to how well we compete in the market to earn those opportunities. I do think that there will be places where there will be surgical action taken on price, but I think overall, we feel like we've got differentiation in technology, and that comes from our investment in R&D. And so we've got to lead with that value. And then at the same time, look, we're very aware of the market situation. We're very aware of customers, and we are playing offense. So we'll see how things unfold.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold from Morgan Keegan and Company.
Simon M. Leopold - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division: A couple of things. One is probably a tricky question to answer, but needs to be asked anyway is -- in light of a couple of disappointing quarters, I'm trying to figure out how much of your forecast is an effort to be super conservative and cautious, so that you've got a number you're very comfortable meeting, versus how much of this guidance is truly some change in the fundamental demand for your product in the quarter. And maybe you can even tie that to the commentary we've gotten from at least the major Service Providers in the U.S. suggesting that their capital spending would be roughly flat year-over-year, which certainly doesn't align with this first quarter guidance.
Robyn M. Denholm: I'll start with that question and, Kevin, if you want to add anything, please feel free to do so. So in terms of the guidance, we've taken the same approach to our guidance for the first quarter as we typically do. Obviously we always look to refine the approach and improve it and make sure that we're looking at different things from a process perspective, but the philosophy and the approach to the first quarter guidance is consistent with what we've done previously. In terms of how we're looking at things, as we said in the prepared remarks, the demand fundamentals for the markets that we serve are absolutely intact. We continue to see progress in terms of things that are driving the demand for the new network. Our view is that for the first quarter, Service Providers are going to continue to be cautious in their CapEx spending, and we also typically see a seasonal decline from the fourth quarter to the first quarter in our Enterprise business as well. So that is what we're projecting for the first quarter in terms of guidance.
Kevin R. Johnson: Yes. Just to add to that, the macroeconomic situation, I think, in the Enterprise has some implications in financial services. And I think if you look at the financial services sector, you see some of the implications there. And we saw some of those customers push some of the deals out of Q4 into Q1, so there's some question of will they push again from Q1 to Q2, depending on how things unfold in Europe. So there's a little bit of factoring that into the seasonal decline that we normally see in Enterprise from a Q4 to Q1.  The other factor is in Q4 of 2011, we had a very strong quarter in Federal, which was very unusual. Typically in U.S. Federal, you have your bigger quarter in Q3 and then things decline in Q4, so we had a big federal quarter in Q4, which question is, is that repeatable then in Q1? So there's a couple other things that I think were factored in as we looked at the Q4 to Q1 guide. And then for the Service Providers, as they're shifting to wireless, oftentimes -- it depends customer by customer, but oftentimes, they put a lot of capital first into the radio access network in the access side. And as they do that, that's part of what then allows them to start to generate more traffic from smartphones, tablets, and as they go to LTE even significantly more traffic. And then as that cycle works through, then it puts more traffic demands on the Edge and core of the networks, and that's where we play. So some of this is timing as the wireless investments are made and as that traffic pattern builds up. So those are a couple other factors that were part of the thinking on the guidance.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal from Barclays Capital.
Jeffrey T. Kvaal - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I have 2 questions. And, Kevin, one might be more for you, and then, Robyn, one more for you. I guess question is your revenue levels now are at levels that you might have reached 2 or 3, 3 or 4 years ago, and yet your OpEx is significantly higher. I'm wondering if this revenue level persists, what might trigger you to reconsider where your OpEx levels are?  And then my second question is, Robyn, if I'm not doing it wrong, I got the DSOs up sequentially, and I would have thought if you had a weak close to the quarter that those might not have been up all that much.
Kevin R. Johnson: I'll take the first one, Robyn, and then let you handle the second one. Yes, Jeff, the approach we're taking is very consistent to the approach we've taken over the last 3.5 years or so as we work through the economic ups and downs of the situations we've managed through over this 3.5-year period. Certainly, our view is this becomes, after Q1, an opportunity for us to continue to grow and, as Robyn commented, improve on operating margins from Q1. And so certainly if we continue to see lower revenue levels, then that's going to prompt us to be much -- to continue to be very thoughtful about what we're doing on the operating expense side. But I think when we look at the product portfolio and when we look at the full year, I think we're going to -- I think we're set up in the right way. We're delivering on the set of products that we've had in the pipeline. But certainly as we see how Q1 unfolds and as we move into Q2, we're going to be very agile and thoughtful in our cost allocation.
Robyn M. Denholm: Yes. And in terms of the DSO. The DSO was very consistent with last year in terms of the Q4 DSO. It was up sequentially in terms of the third to fourth quarter, but very consistent with what we've seen in prior Q4 DSO trends.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Brent Bracelin from Pacific Crest Securities.
Brent A. Bracelin - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: I guess, Kevin -- a question for Kevin here. And really taking a step back from Q4 and looking at the trends within the Service Provider business over the last year. Service Provider segment revenue declined sequentially in each quarter during 2011. Your outlook would imply another sequential decline in the Service Provider business in Q1. We've really never seen this 5-quarter, kind of, consecutive decline in the business, and I went back 10 years. So I guess the question is what gives you confidence this is just an industry issue and not some share loss or competitive issue? And then obviously given the strong balance sheet with $4 billion in cash and investments, why would you not consider getting more aggressive on the acquisitions front and try to further diversify away from, kind of, Service Provider environment that continues to be pretty weak here?
Kevin R. Johnson: Let me first comment on your question about market share. And the data point I look at -- we had very, very strong Q1 and Q2 on our router business. In fact, if you look at year-to-date through Q3 -- year-to-date through Q3, our router business was up year-on-year about 19%, and the Infonetics data showed that addressable market was up about 11%. Now certainly we have to see how all the router market gets reported for Q4 and factor that in, but year-to-date through Q3, we were -- routing business was up 19% and addressable market up 11%. So we'll see how that unfolds for Q4, but that's part of -- the thesis is we're watching -- as we're watching this unfold, we had a big cycle, some big deployments in Q1, Q2, then certainly midyear 2011, the concerns about European sovereign debt and some of the other thing started to, perhaps, have some implications in the industry, and we'll see as the data comes out for Q4.  Second part of your question is around M&A, and I think clearly we continue to drive a strategy that organic R&D is our primary value-creation strategy. We will continue to complement that with acquisitions. And we wanted to focus on acquisitions that are complementary to the R&D strategy, that give us some how synergies in terms of the solution or the technology, the value that we're delivering to customers. And I think over the last 2 years, we've done 6 or 7 different acquisitions that would be characterized probably more as tuck-ins, things that were smaller that had intellectual property and some number of headcount and talent in a certain area. And it was intellectual property that was very complementary to things that we were doing in our overall organic R&D strategy.  So I think we feel good about the architectural approach that we're taking to market and the different domains of networking that we're participating in. We feel good about this wave of new products. And we're going to always be mindful of what M&A we could do to complement our organic R&D. But I still think that the focus we have is driving an innovation agenda that comes from the talented people that are inventing new architectures and new ways to solve complex problems for our customers.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski from Goldman Sachs.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just 2 questions. The first one is, you didn't have any 10% customer last year, which is not typical for you. So I was just curious if you look out into this year based on the pipeline of your design wins if you would expect to have a 10% customer again at some point this year. And then the second question was, in the fourth quarter, switching did better than we had expected, and you said, in particular, that QFabric is seeing an excellent response. And so I was just curious if you can just give us some categorical examples of the kinds of customers that are the early adopters of QFabric, whether it's the Federal segment or Internet companies or large enterprises, et cetera.
Kevin R. Johnson: I think the -- on the 10% customer, one of the strategies we articulate is that we are diversifying the customer base. And that's a strategy as much about Service Providers as it is about Enterprise. And we've expanded our go-to-market model in the Service Provider sector, where we are now reaching out to -- with our partners and others to a larger number of Service Providers -- smaller Service Providers, the Tier 3 Service Providers that still make a significant amount of investments in our technology. And so that customer diversification and Service Provider, combined with our growth in the Enterprise and our diversification in the Enterprise, is the reason we have not seen a 10% customer last year. And it's possible we would have a 10% customer this year, but it's probably not a likely scenario. But we'll see how that unfolds.  In terms of QFabric, and your question about the strong results that we had in switching and fabric, I'll give you a little perspective. We released the QFabric nodes in Q2 -- or in late Q1, basically, and started selling in Q2, and then we released the QFabric Interconnect and Director in Q3, late Q3. So Q4 was the first full quarter that we had the nodes Interconnect and Director available for customer and customers. And that roadmap was all as planned and what we communicated when we announced QFabric. So through Q4 and Q4, we had over 100 customers of QFabric that, at a minimum, had purchased QFabric nodes. And a certain subset of those customers have purchased and are deploying the full QFabric systems. We are very focused on working with those customers to ensure that they have a great customer experience and great early success as they adopt QFabric.  And strategically, that's important because those customers that have great success, they certainly are willing and enjoy talking to other customers, and it's having those customer references where we can take a customer to go see another customer's implementation of QFabric, hear directly from them, the success that they're having and the good results that they're getting from it, that is in turn creating more interest and more pipeline. The increased pipeline in interest is generating now a lot of energy from our partners. We hosted our Global Partner Conference last week, and we had record attendance at the Global Partner Conference. And in many cases, these are partners that -- some of them are new partners to Juniper and some of them have a significant business and networking today. And one of the big areas of interest for them is being able to grow their business and expand their business with new innovation like QFabric. So we're in the cycle right now where, I think, the demand in the pipeline is growing. And right now we're having to focus on how to build skills. I think now the pipeline and demand is growing at a rate, at a pace where the concern is, are we now building enough skills and capabilities in our partner channel and certainly with the teams in the field that are working with customers to be able to continue to service that demand? So that gives you a little bit of color, a little bit of background on what we're seeing with QFabric.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nikos Theodosopoulos from UBS.
Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I had 2 questions. The first one, can you discuss the conversion of orders and backlog to revenue? If I think about the 1.2 book-to-bill and the 1 book-to-bill this quarter, my rough calculations are backlog grew 30% this year. And the revenues don't seem to be converting, so I'm having a hard time understanding that, especially going into the next quarter's guidance.  And then the second question would be, I know it's early, but based on your discussions with your carrier customers, what do you see the carrier routing market growing this year? Your total router revenue growth about 7% in the full year of 2011. Do you think that's a reasonable target for this year based on your discussions, or do you see that being higher or lower than that?
Robyn M. Denholm: I'll answer the first part of the question, and then Kevin can add to that. In terms of the conversion of book-to-bill, yes, the book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.0, so equal to revenue for product book-to-bill. We did have a sequential increase in product-deferred revenue, a slight increase of about 3%. We have grown the backlog. The same phenomena that we had last quarter in terms of the proportion being out. One quarter did not occur in the fourth quarter, so it was a one-quarter phenomenon in the third quarter. So we left the fiscal year of 2011 with a more normal proportion for the first quarter than we would have had if the year was ending at the end of Q3. So the backlog is healthy in terms of our first quarter, the deferred revenue balances are essentially flat year-over-year, and a slight sequential increase from the third to fourth quarter. So in terms of the Q1 demand environment, as we said in our prepared remarks, we are expecting the cautious nature of the Service Provider orders to continue into the first quarter. Obviously with the book-to-bill of 1, you can calculate how many orders we got in the fourth quarter for products. So our view is that continues through the first quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Rod Hall from JPMorgan Chase.
Rod B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I guess the big question is on routing share. And in the data we're presented with, I think, most people on this call would conclude that you're actually losing share in Q4 on carrier routing and that, that probably continues into Q1. Just because the last 2 times we've seen carrier routing, the market declined, as Brent indicated, in 2008 and 2001, so those are pretty tough years. It doesn't feel like it's anything like as bad as that this year, and yet your routing revenues are down. So I guess the question is, do you agree with that? And is that your opinion? You must have an opinion on your routing share. And do you think that it would make sense to get more aggressive on the pricing going forward to preserve your position in routing? And the other thing I'll just toss in there is Cisco clearly indicated more aggression starting back in September. And maybe that happened early in the market, so it seems like they have been putting more pressure on routing in Q4. So just address that for everyone that I think is going to leave this call otherwise concluding that you're losing share, that would be great.
Kevin R. Johnson: Let me take your question, Rod. First of all, I'll just remind you the comment I made on the earlier question. Year-to-date through Q3, our routing revenue had grown 19% versus Infonetics' estimate of the addressable market growing 11%. We'll have to see what the Q4 numbers come out. I do suspect that with the T4000 releasing and the decline that we had in T Series, we may see in the quarter that there was some share loss short-term in the quarter on T Series as we are preparing to ship the T4000.  On the MX, the MX grew, and so I think on the Edge, I think, we probably are in a different situation on the Edge relative to the core. So we'll have to wait and see how those numbers come out. But I think, overall, we feel good about the product portfolio. We feel good about the value proposition. And the earlier comment I made, we are being very aware of pricing actions and what competitors are doing in specific accounts. And with the big router business and specific accounts, it's an account-by-account opportunity for us to be thoughtful about the value proposition and the set of things we're doing in that account. If we need to be surgical on price for certain things, we certainly are open, and we'll be very thoughtful about doing that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jess Lubert from Wells Fargo Securities.
Jess L. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: First, is it your expectation to grow the overall business in 2012? And then secondly, you're clearly investing to support the launch of a number of new products despite the lower revenue. So given that scenario, I was hoping you could help us understand how you're thinking about the progression of operating margins in 2012 and help us understand where you think the operating margins may get to by the end of the year.
Robyn M. Denholm: In terms of the question, Jess, thanks for the question, obviously one of our operating principles for the 2012 year is that we expect to grow faster than the markets that we serve. So clearly, we are expecting growth in terms of growing faster than the market. In terms of the operating margin question, we will make progress from the operating margins from the first quarter that I put out in guidance throughout the year, and again that we said in terms of our overall principles for the year. So, Kevin, would you like to add to that?
Kevin R. Johnson: Yes, I'll just -- a couple of thoughts, and it kind of links back to routers as well. Certainly with the T4000, I think, we said there'll be some revenue recognition late Q1, most likely Q2 with the PTX shipping late in Q1. I think with -- when it comes to core routing and the Converged Supercore, that's really a Q2 through Q4 revenue opportunity for us, which we believe allows us to continue to build on our Q1 revenue streams. And the second point that Robyn made, I think, is very important, which is we look to expand operating margins from our Q1 -- this Q1 base as we go throughout the year, which is a function of a view that we are going to see growth improving as we go forward. And if the volatility in the market or some other reasons indicate that that's not happening, we're going to be very thoughtful and agile on our operating expenses as we've done in the past.
Operator: We have time for one last question. Our last question comes from the line of Sanjiv Wadhwani from Stifel, Nicolaus.
Sanjiv Wadhwani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Two questions. One, Robyn, I'm just trying to reconcile understanding the fact that Q1 is seasonally weak. However, you obviously had a pretty good book-to-bill of 1.2 coming out of Q3 with some of the shipments that will, actually, come out in the March quarter. So if anything, I think, despite, sort of, negative seasonality, you should have a little bit of a better Q1 outlook.  And then second question is just taking up a previous question on, sort of, the growth for 2012. I know you are suggesting that you're going to grow faster than the market. I'm just curious to get your take on what you're thinking about the growth rate for the overall market. I mean, are you thinking the market grows 10% north of that, south of that? Any color would be helpful.
Robyn M. Denholm: Yes, let me just talk about Q1. In terms of our Q1, we obviously have backlog coming into the first quarter. We did have some of those orders, actually, in the third quarter, as we talked about on the third quarter call. All of those orders are going forward. There isn't any change in that. The booking rate in the fourth quarter as it relates to the book-to-bill for product being 1 was obviously slower than the third quarter. So -- and our view is the rate of orders from the Service Providers are going to continue in terms of their cautious view around CapEx for the first quarter. That is principally the reason for the reduction in terms of the guidance that we put out there on the Service Provider side.  On the Enterprise side, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we typically see a sequential decline between the fourth and first quarters each year. We're expecting that for the first quarter. And so when you combine a sequential decline for Service Provider and a sequential decline for Enterprise, we get the guidance that we've put out there.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Juniper Networks Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Kathleen Nemeth, Vice President of Investor Relations for Juniper Networks. Thank you, Ms. Nemeth. You may begin.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Here on the call today are Kevin Johnson, Chief Executive Officer; and Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial Officer. Kevin is joining us today from Hong Kong where he is meeting with customers and partners and attending the All Saints' Day conference. Please remember when listening to today's call that statements made during this call concerning Juniper's business outlook, economic and market outlook, future financial operating results and overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including economic conditions generally or in the networking industry, changes in overall technology spending, the network capacity requirements of service providers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply chain constraints, variation in the mix of products sold, customer perception and acceptance of our products, litigation and other factors listed in our most recent report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. All statements made during this call today are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances subsequently change after the date of this call. In discussing the financial results today, Robyn will first present results on a GAAP basis and, for purposes of today's discussion, will also review non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why the management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult our 8-K filed with the SEC today. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results, please see today's press release. In general, non-GAAP results exclude certain non-recurring charges, amortization of purchased intangibles and other acquisition-related charges and expenses related to stock-based compensation. On today's call, Robyn will also be providing forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis, other than that with respect to revenue and share count. All guidance is forward-looking and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier. GAAP guidance measures are not available on a forward-looking basis, due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to certain charges, which are excluded from the non-GAAP guidance estimates. Please note that today's call is scheduled to last for one hour. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will now turn the call over to Kevin.
Kevin R. Johnson: Thank you, Kathleen. And welcome, everyone. We delivered third quarter results that were in line with our expectations and the performance benchmarks we articulated on our last conference call. We remain confident in our strategy and our momentum with customers as we execute on the fourth quarter and prepare for 2012.  We achieved solid bookings in the quarter and secured important design wins that support the pipeline of new solutions we are bringing to market. The macro environment remains challenging with many economic indicators becoming more volatile in the recent weeks. In the near term, this environment may make certain customers more cautious in their CapEx spending. However, we believe our broader market opportunity continues to be strong, driven by the 2 key trends of mobile Internet and cloud computing.  In this environment, as we did in 2009, we remained focused on being agile and flexible, while making the right investments for the long-term. Looking at the customer environment, service providers continue to invest in their infrastructure. In Q3, our service provider business grew 8% year-on-year. Year-to-date through Q3, our service provider business has grown 17% year-on-year. The fact that we had solid bookings this quarter, including a number of multi-quarter orders, reflects well on the wins that we have secured for new projects.  We are seeing service providers sequencing these projects over the next few quarters, based on their individual priorities, and we have also been notified of design wins that have not yet translated to bookings. So order flow and investment posture has been pretty healthy, but the timing of spending is being managed closely.  On our Q2 call, we shared the view that large service provider spending for 2011 will be weighted closer to 50% in half 1 and 50% in half 2. That deviates a bit from the normal seasonal trend of higher second half spending that we've talked about in the past. Given the current macroeconomic volatility, we expect that service providers will continue to closely manage their Q4 CapEx investments with an eye on their priorities and financials for 2011 versus 2012.  On the enterprise side, we grew 11% year-on-year. That's a pretty good result, given that the verticals of financial services and public sector, 2 of our largest enterprise sectors, have slowed the pace of new projects as they work through either economic challenges, or in the case of the public sector, a constrained budget environment.  The growth, in spite of these factors, demonstrates the strength of solutions like the EX portfolio and improved performance from SRX. We're also seeing good contributions from our key partners. That said, we expect the near term macro uncertainty to prompt enterprise customers to take a cautious posture on capital spending in the near term.  As we think about Juniper's position and how we manage through near-term uncertainty, we think it's important to keep 3 things in mind. First, beginning 3 years ago, we increased our investment in R&D. 2011 has been a pivotal year in delivering the strongest product portfolio in the history of the company. We remained focused on our strategy of innovation around the market trends of mobile Internet and cloud computing. Second, since 2009, we've managed the company to a set of operating principles that we update annually. A key underpinning of those principles is to remain agile, to invest in our growth and innovation agenda, while prudently managing our operating expense structure. We continue to remain agile through volatile economic periods, while driving our innovation and growth agendas. Third, as we position for the next fiscal year, 2012 is all about converting that innovation to revenue as we move throughout the year. To enable this, we have been prudently investing in our sales and marketing capabilities, within our guiding principle of managing operating expenses carefully.  With the wave of new products coming to market, we continue to be thoughtful about investments in quota-carrying sales professionals, with a focus on near-term return on investment for each new sales headcount we add. As we look at the third quarter results and think about the months ahead, we are executing well. We have built backlog in our current offerings, showing particular strength in the MX and SRX Series. We also continue to create demand and generate design wins that will begin to drive revenue from our new offerings in the data center, enterprise mobility and our Converged Supercore routing technology in 2012 and beyond.  We have met milestones in shipment schedules for our new products. The QFabric Interconnect and Director have been released. The T4000 is scheduled to ship later this quarter, with Comcast placing one of the first orders. And PTX routers are on the way. At the same time, we've been putting the right organizational structure in place to effectively drive our innovation roadmap and support our customers' next generation networking requirements.  As we announced in July, we have implemented the Platform Systems division and the Software Solutions division. Many of you have gotten to know Stefan Dyckerhoff who heads the platform's Systems division, and oversees our efforts in the data center and core and Edge routing. Bob Muglia officially joined us on October 4 as Executive Vice President of software, responsible for shaping and driving our end-to-end software strategy. I'm confident that Bob's vision, management strength and technical expertise will bring significant value to Juniper.  We are sharpening our focus on systems and software as the 2 core engines of growth for the company. Our software business is already a key differentiator that drives customer adoption of our solutions, including our SRX and virtual gateway security offerings, our MobileNext core for mobile operators, the Junos Pulse mobile security suite for managing devices, and the Junos Space platform for developing and deploying network applications. I'm pleased to welcome Bob to Juniper.  So to wrap up, while we are mindful of the macroeconomic backdrop, our strategy has not changed. We had a strong bookings quarter, we're building backlog, we're driving market interest in our products and we're poised to begin delivering revenue from our innovation roadmap next year.  We have set up 2012 as the year when we will have the strongest product and solutions portfolio in the history of the company. We are being thoughtful as we build the go-to-market capability to drive the success of our new innovations. At the same time, we remain strongly committed to R&D. We're doing all of this with an eye on agility to ensure our approach to spending remains consistent with our stated operating principles. And finally, we're putting a strong organizational structure in place that is aligned with our vision and strategy for success. We look forward to keeping you posted on our progress. Now I'll turn it over to Robyn, for her review of the quarter and our outlook. Robyn?
Robyn M. Denholm: Thank you, Kevin. And good afternoon, everyone. In the September quarter, we achieved our financial objectives and delivered 9% year-over-year revenue growth, an EPS of $0.28, which was in line with our guidance.  While our business in the third quarter unfolded consistent with our view in July, concerns about the macro environment have since increased. We've seen lengthening project cycles and extended delivery of request timelines from some of our customers. Given the volatile economic conditions and the effect they may have on our customers' spending, we continue to balance our investments with careful cost management as we have done in the past.  The underlying fundamentals of our business remain healthy, and we are focused on executing our strategy to address the market trends of mobile Internet and cloud computing. In the coming year, we expect to drive the deployment of our innovative portfolio of new products. Looking at the demand metrics for the quarter, book-to-bill of 1.2 reflects healthy demand for our products. We ended the quarter with strong product backlog, driven primarily by router orders.  Total deferred revenue was $886 million, up $101 million year-over-year. Deferred revenue declined sequentially by $44 million. This included a $29 million decrease in deferred services revenue due to typical seasonality for service contract renewals and a $15 million decrease in product deferrals related to delivery of committed features.  Whilst these metrics demonstrate healthy fundamental demand for our product, we continue to be very cautious in the near term. Total revenues for the third quarter was $1.106 billion, down 1% sequentially and up 9% year-over-year. In the quarter, there were no customers who accounted for more than 10% of total revenue. For the third quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.16. Included in the GAAP diluted earnings was a $0.02 charge associated with restructuring actions we took during the quarter.  Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.28, which reflects a $0.03 sequential and $0.04 year-over-year decrease. Now let me provide some color on revenue by region, business segment and market. In the third quarter, the Americas were approximately 50% of total revenue. EMEA was 28% and APAC was 22%. Americas revenue was down 4% from the second quarter, with the decline in service provider partially offset by good sequential and year-over-year growth in enterprise.  On a year-over-year basis, Americas was up 4%. EMEA revenue was down 5% sequentially, due to declines in Southern and Eastern Europe, partially offset by strength from service providers in Germany and the U.K. Year-over-year, EMEA grew 13%. APAC revenue increased 12% sequentially and 17% year-over-year, primarily due to the recognition of deferred product revenue. We continue to see a challenging demand environment in Japan, and apart from Greater China and Australia, indications of softness elsewhere in the region.  Now looking at revenue by segment, infrastructure revenue was $835 million, down 6% sequentially and up 12% year-over-year. Within this segment, total router revenue was $703 million, down 8% sequentially. Growth of 9% year-over-year was driven by the strength in MX and T Series. Total MX product revenue was $229 million, down 18% sequentially, but up 30% year-over-year. We had very good MX bookings, which are reflected in the strong book-to-bill. We had a strong sequential increase for the T Series, and as planned, we expect to strengthen our core routing offerings with first shipment of the T4000 in fourth quarter of 2011, and the PTX in the first quarter of next year.  Total switching revenue was $132 million, up 7% sequentially and 30% year-over-year. Product revenue, which includes QFabric, was $110 million. This was up 6% sequentially and 13% year-over-year, driven by strength in EX2200 and EX8200 products. In addition, revenue from our wireless LAN portfolio was $12 million.  Moving on to the SLT segment, revenue for the quarter was $271 million, an increase of 15% sequentially and 1% year-over-year. SRX product revenue was strong at $92 million, up $30 million for the second quarter. This was primarily due to growth in our high-end SRX, reflecting our commitment to helping our service provider customers secure their mobile traffic. We are also pleased with the branch SRX growth, which reflects the progress of our channel initiatives in the enterprise market. Pulse continues to expand its success with design wins globally. We expect deployments of these design wins to generate revenue in 2012.  Looking more closely at the markets we address, service provider revenue was $685 million, down 6% sequentially due to declines in routing, partially offset by strength in security. Service provider revenue was up 8% year-over-year. Enterprise revenue was $421 million, up 8% sequentially, due to the strength in routing and switching, and improvement in security. Enterprise revenue was up 11% year-over-year.  For the quarter, service provider was 62% of total revenue and enterprise was 38% of total revenue. Now moving on to our margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margins declined slightly from the second quarter to 65.3%, impacted by product mix and higher product costs. Product gross margins were 67.5% of product revenue, down 60 basis points sequentially and 200 basis points year-over-year. Relative to the prior quarter, product gross margin was impacted by a relatively lower volume of routing, partially offset by improved volume of security products.  On the cost side, there were increased inventory carrying costs. Services gross margins were 57.4%, up 170 basis points from the prior quarter, and 270 basis points lower than the prior year. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter were $501 million, an increase of $8 million from the prior quarter. This reflects our prudent operating expense management as we continue to fund our R&D agenda and increase sales coverage for our new products.  Year-over-year operating expenses increased by 14%. R&D expenses were flat with the prior quarter, and up 9% from last year's third quarter. Sales and marketing expenses were 3% higher on a sequential basis and up 23% year-over-year. G&A expenses remained about 3% of sales and were in line with the prior period at $36 million.  Looking at headcount. We ended the quarter with 9,187 employees, a net decrease of 121 from the second quarter. This includes the impact of actions that we took late this quarter, as reflected in the restructuring charge of $16.8 million. This rebalancing is part of our discipline to ensure that we manage our resources to address the macro environment over the near-term, and the market opportunity to support our growth over the long-term.  Non-GAAP operating margins for the quarter were 20%, down 1.6 points sequentially and down 4.1 points year-over-year. Looking at the operating margin by segment, infrastructure operating margin was 18.5%, 5.2 points lower compared to the prior quarter, and 5.7 points lower compared to the third quarter of last year. Infrastructure operating margin was impacted by the reduced revenue in the quarter, and as a reminder, the results for infrastructure segment includes routers, switchers, MobileNext and QFabric.  SLT operating margin was strong at 24.5%, which was 11 points higher sequentially, and 40 basis points above last year's third quarter. Operating margins in SLT benefited from the strong sequential revenue growth. The GAAP tax rate was 30.9% for the quarter. The non-GAAP tax rate was 27.4%, up slightly from the prior quarter, due to the geographic mix of income.  Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with net cash and investments of $3.1 billion. DSO was 36 days in the quarter, compared to 39 in the prior quarter, due to better shipment linearity. Q3 cash from operations was a solid $185 million, up $54 million from last year, but down $133 million sequentially. As you may recall, last quarter benefited by the timing of a tax refund related to the 2010 R&D credit.  I am pleased with our strong cash generation again this quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 8.9 million shares at a weighted average cost of $21.47 per share or approximately $191 million. Our weighted average shares on a diluted basis for the quarter were 536.6 million shares, a decline of almost 10 million shares from the second quarter. CapEx totaled $72 million, up $10 million from the second quarter. And this includes our continued construction costs for our corporate campus here in Sunnyvale -- those buildings are expected to be completed in 2013.  Depreciation and amortization was approximately $43 million, up slightly from last quarter. Now let's discuss our guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis, except for revenue and share count. As I highlighted in my opening comments, we believe the long-term fundamentals of our business remain healthy. Demand indicators in the quarter were mixed. Bookings was strong, but the mix of orders requesting delivery beyond Q4, was higher than anticipated. Given this unusual backlog timing, as well as the continued volatility in the macroeconomic environment and its impact on customer CapEx, we remain cautious.  Our guidance for the fourth quarter of 2011 is as follows: we are expecting revenues to range between $1.160 billion and $1.220 billion; gross margins for the fourth quarter are expected to continue in the range of 65% to 67%; operating margins for the fourth quarter is expected to be in the range of 21% to 23%; operating expenses are expected to be up sequentially and lower as a percentage of revenue.  We will continue to focus on balancing the longer-term needs of the business, whilst remaining agile and prudent with our spending in the short term. This is expected to result in fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $0.32 and $0.36 per share, and assumes a flat share count, a tax rate of 27.5%.  In summary, while we continue to see a challenging environment ahead, we remain focused on executing our strategy to capitalize on the market trends of mobile Internet and cloud computing. The underlying fundamentals of our business remain healthy as we bring our innovative products to market in the coming quarters. I want to thank our employees for their continued support, their dedication, innovation and commitment to delivering the new networks, are key to our success. And with that, I'll hand it over to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just wanted to reconcile a few of the moving pieces as it pertains to your guidance. In particular, as you mentioned, deferred revenue declined by 5% sequentially. That actually was the biggest sequential decline since Q3 of '08, which preceded a couple of subsequent misses. Yet you also commented that book-to-bill was at 1.2, which seems pretty strong, but then at the same time, your guidance is now 10% lower than what we had expected a quarter ago. So can you just kind of put together those moving pieces? And then relative to that lower guidance, can you just be a bit more granular about what drove it relative to either verticals or geographic regions?
Robyn M. Denholm: In terms of the current quarter and the impact on the guidance for Q4, it's actually quite simple. The movement between Q3 and Q4, in terms of the guidance for the full year, is really the backlog situation, and the unusual nature of that, with a high proportion of the backlog due to delivery in the first quarter of 2012. So that is the sequential change in the guidance. From our perspective, in terms of the deferred revenue, that was anticipated in our guidance for the third quarter. So that was as expected. And in terms of the book-to-bill, we were anticipating a strong book-to-bill, which is what we recorded of about 1.2 for the quarter. So in terms of all of those factors that we've looked at for the guidance as we move forward, clearly we have more visibility to close the closer EMEA for the next quarter. And obviously we take that into account as we're setting guidance. We also take into account the fact that we do have deferred revenue that relates to features that are specified for delivery in terms of the R&D cycles that we have and the features that we're delivering to that R&D cycle. And we also take into account the backlog that we have and our discussions with customers globally.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And just a quick follow-up there on the weakness incrementally in terms of either EMEA or financial services or public sector. Are you able to allocate how much of the weakness in the guidance versus expectations came from any of those segments?
Robyn M. Denholm: In terms of the weakness in those areas, we actually, as we said in the prepared remarks, had a good quarter in terms of growth rate sequentially on the enterprise side, despite the fact that there is obviously softness in the budgets in the government sector, and also the constraints from the financial services sector. So in terms of the forward-looking part of the enterprise market, we are continuing to see good wins across the board. And that is factored into our guidance. But be assured, we're also taking a cautious view in terms of the market conditions for the fourth quarter as well.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Tal Liani from Bank of America.
Tal Liani - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I have a question -- first of all, about the evolution. How should we expect the evolution of revenues for let's say the next few quarters? You have a few products that are kicking in between next quarter and the following 4 quarters. Can you discuss timing? And internal expectations or discuss what should we have for expectations when it comes to timing where the new projects -- or new products -- are hitting the numbers?
Robyn M. Denholm: In terms of the products and revenue and roll out over the next few quarters, obviously we've already released the QFabric products. They shipped in second half of September, so they’re actually already out there. We saw very minimal revenue as expected in the third quarter. And we don't anticipate significant revenue in the fourth quarter either. So we're very pleased with the design wins and Kevin can talk a little bit more about that in a minute. In terms of the evolution of the product roadmap from there, the T4000, as I said in the prepared remarks, is expected to ship in the fourth quarter. We're not expecting revenue in the fourth quarter, that revenue release will start to happen in the first quarter of 2012. We're very pleased with the trials and, as Kevin mentioned, we actually have our first order for the T4000. In terms of PTX, the Converged Supercore, that's scheduled to release in the first quarter of 2012, and obviously revenue will follow that. So, in terms of the progress and the customers' acceptance in terms of the early trials that we've had, I'll let Kevin talk about that.
Kevin R. Johnson: Yes, thanks for the question Tal, just to add to Robyn's remarks, QFabric as Robyn mentioned, we shipped the nodes, QFabric nodes, back in February and, as committed to our customers, we've released the QFabric Interconnect and Director. And we're seeing a lot of very good interest from customers. In fact, we have customers that have selected QFabric, and are in various stages of implementation of their QFabric projects, including customers like Thomson Reuters, Deutsche Boers, Bell Canada. And whether it's large service providers that are building managed services data centers based on QFabric, such as Bell Canada, or it's financial services institutions that are looking at their high-frequency, low-latency trading systems, we're seeing some very good uptick on QFabric. I'll also mention, ACG Research published a white paper where they benchmarked QFabric versus the legacy approach to switching in data centers. And their results show that QFabric was 58% to 75% lower capital expenditures, because we have better scaling and reduced numbers of Chassis and racks. And with reduced number of Chassis and racks, they also found that QFabric consumes 68% to 89% less power. And when you think about the power consumption in these big data centers, that's a huge element of operating expenses. So we're very enthusiastic about QFabric and the implications in the marketplace. And I think as Robyn said, look there's a long sell cycle with these big data centers, but we've got a pipeline, we're getting wins, and we're getting deployments and we're engaged. Certainly as the T4000 releases and the PTX Converged Supercore, I think we're in a position where we've got the strongest product portfolio we've had in the history of this company. And so in many ways we've been engaged with customers already in the discussion around the T4000, and we started taking orders, including the orders from Comcast that we have for the first T4000, and I would expect that as we go into 2012, we will see some early orders for the PTX Converged Supercore as well. But I think both Robyn and I will defer talking about 2012 guidance or expectations until we complete Q4.
Tal Liani - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Kevin, Cisco recently has been talking about lower growth rates in routing markets driven by pricing pressure, certain geographies. Can you discuss pricing environment, not only current pricing environment, how you see the environment shaping up for the next few years?
Kevin R. Johnson: Yes, I think, first of all, our router product revenue year-to-date has grown 19%. And I think that statement of the momentum that we've gained, whether it's around EMX or T Series or the work that we've done innovating around our routing platforms, I do think that we continue to manage to have our healthy gross margins around those products because they are differentiated. And I think for us, the key is, are we getting the return on investment from R&D to create a differentiated product set in routing. And thus far, I feel very confident that our engineering teams have done a phenomenal job in building fantastic products that deliver great value to customers. So we don't see significant pricing pressure. I will say on the competitive front, there are certain accounts or certain scenarios where, at times, the competition gets intense, and there'll be times where we'll look at surgically focusing on offerings and things that might be more aggressive on price. And then the second comment is 3 weeks ago I was in India and spent a lot of time in India. I'm here in China this week. And so certainly in some of the emerging markets, I think there is potentially different expectations around the pricing. But at a macro level, I don't see that necessarily changing our strategy. Our strategy is to differentiate our product through innovation and ensure that, that innovation translates to customer value.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Brian Marshall with ISI.
Brian Marshall - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: It looks like we saw some pretty nice improvement on the SRX line. I was wondering if you could talk about, yes, what were the key drivers of this? Was there any lumpy orders there? Do you think this is sustainable going forward? And if it is, looks like that line of business will be 10% of revenues in the not-too-distant future.
Robyn M. Denholm: In terms of the SRX this quarter, we did see good performance on the service provider side, and as I've outlined in previous calls, that revenue will tend to be lumpy as the design wins that we have deployed in the marketplace. So we're pretty pleased with the performance this quarter. As I also mentioned in the prepared remarks, we also saw an improvement in the branch SRX, which is focused at the enterprise side. And we saw that last quarter as well, so I'm very encouraged by that in terms of the go-to-market activities that we're driving around our enterprise security offering as well.
Brian Marshall - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, so just for clarification, Robyn, so it sounds like these -- this improvement that we saw this quarter, is going to be sustainable going forward in your view?
Robyn M. Denholm: So from our perspective, we're expecting a sequential decline from our SP SRX performance in the fourth quarter, only because of the fact that as I said, we've got other design wins but the deployments of both tend to be lumpy over time.
Brian Marshall - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then with respect to going forward, is it the company's view that we'll continue to see enterprise grow faster than service provider into the new year?
Robyn M. Denholm: So in terms of the guidance from a fourth quarter perspective, we are expecting to see sequential increase in service provider from the third quarter levels. And we're also expecting to see an increase in terms of the enterprise sector as well. So we are expecting growth sequentially in both areas.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Sanjiv Wadhwani with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Sanjiv Wadhwani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Robyn, on the backlog, which is really healthy and where you're seeing shipment requests now out into Q1, can you talk about whether that is broad-based? Is it specific to 1 or 2 carriers? And if you can give some geographical information on that, that would be helpful. And then second question on gross margins, you said you had increased inventory carrying costs. Is that related to your backlog? Is that totally unrelated and any clarity on that would be helpful.
Robyn M. Denholm: Yes, let me answer, Sanjiv, the last question first. In terms of the carrying cost, it's totally unrelated to the backlog situation. It is a period cost obviously for the third quarter. We did see some of it in the second quarter as well. And I talked about increased costs in the second quarter. We expect to work that off over the next quarter or so in terms of that increased inventory cost, carrying cost. In terms of the backlog, as I said in my prepared remarks, it is unusual for us to have this higher proportion of backlog that is deliverable outside of the next quarter. We always have some that is deliverable outside of the next quarter, but for this quarter, the proportion is quite high. Having said that, in terms of specificity about customers, it's a handful of customers that are our most strategic customers. And we're embedded in the most strategic projects that they have going forward and in which case that’s how they’ve placed the orders on us. And so we're pretty pleased with that. It obviously gives us some forward visibility. So from my perspective, it's a positive thing.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with Pacific Crest Securities.
Brent A. Bracelin - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: I also wanted to follow up here around this backlog timing and I guess my take here is going to be a little different. As you think about the timing issues here, is this tied to some timing issues relative to internal future deliveries on when you plan on delivering some features and products to these customers? Or is this kind of externally driven by kind of spending plans and maybe architectural implementation by your partners? Again I'm trying to understand, is this your customers that are driving kind of this unusual backlog timing or is it some specific features that you're not going to have until kind of Q1 that's driving the timing here on the backlog?
Robyn M. Denholm: In terms of the timing of the backlog, it's totally unrelated to new product. It is all existing product where we've already -- both for new projects as well as existing projects in the service provider, very strategic service provider customers that we have, so it's not related to future product.
Brent A. Bracelin - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: So would be tied to the -- your strategic partners' planning schedule for the delivery of when they expect this, they want this equipment installed then?
Robyn M. Denholm: Yes, I don't think it's fair to us to talk to our customers' intentions, but I think it's fair enough to draw that latter conclusion that it's more related to the timing of CapEx and the timing of deployments on the service provider side.
Operator: Our next question is from Nikos Theodosopoulos with UBS.
Jack Monti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: This is Jack Monti for Nikos. We were curious about 1Q seasonality with strong backlog in bookings and weaker than normal quarter-over-quarter growth in 4Q, we were curious if 1Q will show above-normal seasonality?
Robyn M. Denholm: If I understood your question right, do you mean that because we're calling midpoint of guidance as the represent growth year-over-year for the fourth quarter, is that the question?
Jack Monti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Yes, that's exactly right, kind of weaker than normal we would call it, 4Q growth, and then with the backlog and the bookings being so strong, it seems like that visibility going to the first quarter will be stronger or pretty strong, is that the right way to think about it?
Robyn M. Denholm: I think at this point, it's far too early to talk about the first quarter. We'll give you some insight into the first quarter, what we're expecting for Q1 on the fourth quarter earnings call.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo Securities.
Jess L. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Question is for Robyn. It sounds like you're continuing to invest in OpEx heading into Q4, despite some signs that end market demand might be slowing. So I guess I was hoping you might be able to help us understand if there is some base level of operating margin you would be looking to maintain if things continue to deteriorate from an end market demand perspective. And then SLT operating margins were pretty strong in the quarter. What drove the strength here? And is this a sustainable level of SLT operating margin going forward?
Robyn M. Denholm: In terms of SLT, the biggest single factor in terms of the sequential strength of the operating margin for SLT was the revenue growth. So the strong sequential increase in SLT's revenue actually translated into a nice improvement on the bottom line. In terms of OpEx overall of the company, we've shown in the past, as we've shown in this quarter in the Q3 OpEx, we are very fiscally responsible in terms of what we're doing from an OpEx management perspective. We’re investing in the things that matter for the long-term, both in terms of R&D as well as sales -- sales and marketing. And we're continuing to be very surgical in how we're placing those investments. And at the same time, we're getting more effective and more efficient across the board from a company perspective. Hence, the rebalancing, restructuring activity that we do in the quarter. And so our view is that we will continue to be as focused on OpEx management as we had in the past. And I think you can see good evidence of that in the quarter.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Ehud Gelblum with Morgan Stanley.
Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: A couple of questions. First of all, on the -- Robyn,you talked a lot about this large backlog, giving you visibility into Q1, or that's kind of why we're having a below seasonal Q4 and more into Q1 in addition to the macro things Kevin talked about. But 3 months ago when you guided to 12% to 14% for the year versus the 5% to 10% you're guiding now, you clearly thought this backlog was going to land in Q4. And now it's sort of landing in Q1, and turning to backlog in October. What changed or did you always expect it to land in Q1 and you expected other revenue to come in, in Q4? I'm just trying to understand that delta between 3 months ago and now as to what your thought was on -- thought process was on Q4 and what I understood it to be was this backlog, which sounds like it's generally MX bookings. And so what really changed in either carrier plans or carrier thought process or carrier CapEx budgets or whatever between, I guess July and today, to make those MX deals go into Q1 versus Q4?
Robyn M. Denholm: Yes, in terms of the difference, it -- we were anticipating the bookings in the quarter, in the third quarter. But we were anticipating more of them to be deliverable in the fourth quarter. And so that is simply the difference between the 2 metrics from a Q4 perspective. And you can tell by the size of the book-to-bill that it was a significant increase in backlog in the quarter. And I do think that that's reflective of our Q4 guidance. So Kevin, do you want to comment on that as well?
Kevin R. Johnson: Yes, let me just add to Robyn's comments, I think Ehud, the thing that I see has changed slightly from 90 days ago primarily is the implications of the macro level uncertainty or volatility and the implications then on service provider CapEx spending, and how they're being thoughtful about how they're sequencing things on the quarterly boundary. I think the attention that service providers are placing on monitoring their CapEx expenditures quarter by quarter has increased in the last 90 days, relative to what we saw in July.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Next year if the macro environment doesn't improve, should we take your 10% to 11% revenue growth from this year and then add all the new products? Does that get us back to 20% potentially? Mathematically new products have to contribute about $900 million next year. Is that sort of what you're targeting? And then, Robyn, on gross margins, do these new products carry lower gross margins before the volumes improve and can we potentially get back to 66% to 68%?
Robyn M. Denholm: In terms of the first question, let me go through our process in terms of setting the targets for the fiscal year. So at the beginning of each year, obviously the end of the prior year as we're finalizing our planning, we set up a financial model as well as a set of operating principles on how we plan to manage the company throughout that fiscal year. And that's what we generally share with you at the beginning of each year, and we will do that again for 2012. We started obviously the current year expecting the macro environment to be significantly better by the end of the year. And therefore, how that impacts our end markets, our target markets, obviously routing and switching and security across the service provider and enterprise markets. As Kevin mentioned in terms of our year-to-date growth and how that relates to the market conditions out there, we do think that we're growing faster than the market today. Our view is with the new products that we plan to release, not just the ones that came out in the third quarter, but also those in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of next year, they will enable us to capture again more market share, grow faster than the market over next year. And so that is our approach. We will outline more of the specifics in terms of next year on the call in January. And Kevin did you want to comment on the markets as well?
Kevin R. Johnson: No, I think that you've handled it well, Robyn.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Rod Hall with JP Morgan.
Rod B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I just had a couple. One is, on the MX backlog again or the backlog you guys have talked about. Can you tell us anything about the regional split of that, I mean, is it mostly in Europe or is it spread across all the regions, just be curious to know that. And then I also was wondering about the 0% growth in Q4, the year-over-year growth. Is that -- should we be interpreting that as kind of a negative service provider growth and then low single-digit enterprise growth, can you just give us some idea of what the trajectory of the 2 business types is looking like in Q4? And it'd also be nice to know kind of what sort of visibility you think you got. I mean, have you been seeing order cancellations? Or is it just a push out of orders at this point?
Robyn M. Denholm: In terms of order cancellations and push outs of existing orders, we have not seen that activity. There may have been a small amount of it, but nothing unusual in terms of either canceled orders or any existing orders pushed out. In terms of the backlog itself, we're obviously, that's -- sorry, the geographic split of backlog is obviously with our, as I mentioned before, with our largest, our most strategic service providers that we have. In terms of the growth rate quarter-over-quarter, we're expecting obviously at the midpoint of guidance to grow 7.6% quarter-over-quarter. And we are expecting that to be an increase in service providers, slightly more in terms of percentage terms quarter-over-quarter than enterprise. So we're pretty pleased with the performance in terms of the design wins in both. We're pleased with the year-to-date performance in both sectors.
Operator: Our next question is from Simon Leopold with Morgan Keegan.
Simon M. Leopold - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division: A couple of things I just wanted to drill down on. If we could get an update of the MobileNext product in terms of where you are, trial activity, and your thoughts on how revenue might ramp for the product for the evolved packet core.
Robyn M. Denholm: Kevin, do you want to handle that question?
Kevin R. Johnson: Yes, I'm happy to handle that question. MobileNext is, as you recall, is a software solution that we have created that runs on top of the MX 3D Edge router. And MobileNext, we released the first software offering a little over a year ago called -- something called Traffic Direct, which was the first wave of offering that helped customers redirect bulk Internet traffic around the expensive service complex that some of the mobile traffic -- and allowed them to offload that traffic. We've released the first set of gateways around mobile packet core earlier this year. I think it was in Q2, as we committed to customers, we released that software. And we have a few design wins of some customers -- more of the Tier 2-type customers that we're engaging to now work on the deployment plans and convert those design wins into revenue. We also have a product roadmap where we're continuing to enhance the products set around MobileNext. And so I would expect, as we go into this quarter and into 2012, we'll start seeing some public references of customers that are running MobileNext as their packet core on the MX 3D. In addition, I would also highlight that we continue to have a very strong partnership with Ericsson when it comes to packet core. And the Ericsson packet core solution runs on our M Series router. And they have a market-leading position in packet core and we continue to work very closely with them to ensure that their packet core solution is highly competitive on top of the M Series. And I think this is -- the packet core is one element on the overall end-to-end solution that we're delivering to service providers as they shift from 2G to 3G to LTE. And the timing of these transitions vary by customer, and frankly they vary by geography. And I think from a solution standpoint, we've got a very good platform and a very good solution that we're taking to market. But it’s one that I think will take some time for these design wins and the deployments and to help these customers take advantage of that offering, but I think we're making some very good progress.
Operator: Our next question is from Jeff Kvaal with Barclays Capital.
Jeffrey T. Kvaal - Barclays Capital, Research Division: A couple of clarification, if I may. I think number one, I think, Robyn, you said during your remarks that the MX was down 18% sequentially. Could you talk us through that a little bit?
Robyn M. Denholm: Yes, in terms of the MX, it was down sequentially 18%. But I did note as well that much of the backlog, or the increase in backlog, was primarily routing backlog. So there is a high proportion of that in MX.
Operator: The next question is from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.
Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: I wanted to drill into the switching business. Robyn, correct me if I'm wrong. You've talked about revenues of $110 million in products. But that would imply, stripping out the wireless LAN business, that your EX business actually declined quarter-over-quarter. Do I have that correctly? And if so, what's still the challenge over there? And also can you give us some color as to how much of QFabric did you book this quarter? How much do you think you will book next quarter?
Robyn M. Denholm: So let me just clarify EX. So EX was actually up in the quarter sequentially. And the $12 million is on top of the $110 million. So the $110 million was EX and QFabric, and there was a very minimal amount of QFabric in the quarter. In terms of the total revenue, it's $110 million for EX and QFabric, plus $12 million for wireless LAN, and then there's services on top of that to get to the $132 million.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Ryan Hutchinson with Lazard Capital.
Ryan Hutchinson - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: I guess I'm going to ask it a different way. I’m trying to understand the various buckets that drove the midpoint of the guidance down to the levels of about 7.5%, and I understand macro clearly played a role here. But as you dig into the service provider orders maybe, Robyn, if you could just help us quantify how large the orders are, any color around backlog would be helpful. And then what gives you confidence that they'll actually close in Q1? And I know you said there's a number of customers within that, but it seems to be concentrated perhaps in 1 or 2 carriers and if that's the case, just help us understand that as well. And then finally, as relates to seasonality, it was asked, but why wouldn't this positively impact you on seasonality, in the event that these orders were recognized as revenue?
Robyn M. Denholm: Yes, in terms of the backlog affecting Q1, it absolutely could impact positively Q1, but at this point I'm not prepared to call that. It's far too early to call Q1 revenue. They will be delivered in Q1. In terms of the fourth quarter guidance, the movement between our implied guidance for the first -- sorry, for the fourth quarter that we talked about in Q3 earnings -- sorry, on the Q2 earnings call early this quarter, it's primarily that one movement in terms of the small number of customers that have placed orders for -- with us today for delivery in Q1.
Operator: The next question is from Jason Ader with William Blair.
Jason Ader - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: I want to follow up on Ittai's question. On the switch business, the growth has decelerated pretty substantially over the last few quarters there. I'm just wondering, is this due to competition from a rejuvenated Cisco? And then I was hoping maybe, Kevin, you could comment on Cisco's new product introduction today where they say they can double your fabric for scalability?
Kevin R. Johnson: Yes, let me take that question. Thanks for the question. First of all, the total -- our total switching product revenue, including the wireless LAN, I'll throw that in, has grown -- year-to-date, it's grown 30% year-on-year. And if you look at the analyst reports, just take through Q2, take the Dell'Oro report through Q2, the addressable market for ethernet switching declined by 6% year-to-date through Q2, and we'll see what happens in Q3, but year-to-date, through Q3 we've grown 30%. So we've grown 30% in a market, that addressable market that has declined by 6%. Now your question should be that, "Okay. Well, why has that addressable market declined by 6%?" Well, if you dig into that, you'll actually see the number of ports through Q2 have increased, but the revenue per port or ASP per port has declined. And so then you say, "Okay. Well, there must be some pricing action that's taking place in the switching addressable market." And what we see happening is really a bifurcation of that ethernet switching market. And I'll say in the campus and branch areas, where some customers will look and say, "Okay. Well, a good enough type of switch might be acceptable to them, and you have competitors like an HP or Huawei entering the market with a lower gross margin, lower price. And you see the incumbent having to follow them in terms of price, in a good enough segment of ethernet switching market there is some pricing action that is taking place. Now the second part though is that bifurcation though is the higher end segment of the market where innovation really is differentiated. And that's the segment that we play in. And so when we look at our growth, we've grown in data center, we've grown in campus and branch, but we've grown our business around a value proposition that's enabled by our innovation, whether it's the EX Virtual Chassis feature set, that allowed us to collapse layers in the data center from 3 to 2, or QFabric that allows us to collapse the layers to a single layer of fabric within the data center. Now just remind you, QFabric and that innovation, according to this ACG Research note, allows customers to implement that data center with 58 to 75 lower CapEx and 68% to 89% less power consumption. That's because we changed the architecture. We have a new architecture, new network architecture for QFabric. So at a macro level, I think we've grown quite well with a 30% year-to-date growth in an addressable market that's actually declined. We've grown in the segments of the market where innovation matters and where we have strong differentiation, versus those that I think are fighting more of a commodity battle. We're fighting and really focused on an innovation agenda. Then the second part of your question is around the announcements today. It's early in Hong Kong so I haven't had a lot of time to read them. But what I have read -- fundamentally what they have announced is, products that still utilize the old network architecture. Layers and layers of switches. And what we've done with QFabric is a new network architecture. So I think when it comes to QFabric, certainly Juniper is driving the bus that Cisco is running to catch. And I don't think necessarily what they've announced changes the architecture that they've had at all. It's an old network architecture relative to our new network architecture. That said, I have a lot of respect for Cisco and I think in many ways, this is a competition about old network versus new network. And we're going to continue to play our game and focus on the things that we do well, which is innovate in ways that matter for customers.
Operator: And our final question comes from the line of Alex Henderson with Miller Tabak + Co.
Alex B. Henderson - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the trajectory into the fourth quarter on a seasonal basis between enterprise and service provider, whether you're expecting a budget plush in the enterprise, within your guidance, or whether the enterprise piece is also going to see a less-than-normal budget plush. What are your assumptions along that piece of the parameter of the guidance?
Robyn M. Denholm: Alex, in terms of the guidance split between service provider and enterprise, we are expecting growth in both sectors, sequentially. And we are expecting service provider growth to be slightly higher than enterprise growth. In terms of normal seasonality, we are not expecting a typical end-of-year spend from either sectors in our guidance so -- that are above the normal purchases within normal quarter as opposed to the end of year quarter. So that's incorporated in our guidance. So Kevin, do you want to add to that?
Kevin R. Johnson: Yes, Robyn. And I would just add a comment, that given the macro level volatility and uncertainty, our expectation is there's much less of any kind of budget surge that you potentially have seen in prior years. I think the pattern that we've seen, whether it's financial services and the enterprise, federal government or service providers, it's much more of a cautionary focus on their CapEx spending in which [indiscernible] of the quarter that's going to happen on and I expect to see that again in Q4. And I think that sets the tone because of the macro environment, I think there should be an expectation that there is less of what I would call a budget surge in Q4.
Operator: Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. I'll just turn the floor back over to management for any closing comments.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thank you, Manny. This concludes our Q3 financial results conference call. Thank you very much for joining us today.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Juniper Networks Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Kathleen Nemeth, Vice President of Investor Relations for Juniper Networks. Thank you, Ms. Nemeth, you may now begin.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and thank you everyone for joining us today. Here on the call today are Kevin Johnson, Chief Executive Officer; and Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial Officer.  Please remember when listening to today's call that statements made during this call concerning Juniper's business outlook, economic and market outlooks, future financial operating results and overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including economic conditions generally or in the networking industry, changes in overall technology spending, the network capacity requirements of service providers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply chain constraints, variation in the mix of products sold, customer perception and acceptance of our products, litigation and other factors listed in our most recent report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances subsequently change after the date of this call. In discussing the financial results today, Robyn will first present results on a GAAP basis and for purposes of today's discussion, will also review non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why the management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult our 8-K filed with the SEC today. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results, please see today's press release. In general, non-GAAP results exclude certain non-recurring charges, amortization of purchased intangibles, and other acquisition-related charges and expenses related to stock-based compensation. On today's call, Robyn will also be providing forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis other than that with respect to revenue and share count. All guidance is forward-looking, and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier. GAAP guidance measures are not available on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to certain charges which are excluded from the non-GAAP guidance estimates. Please note that today's call is scheduled to last for one hour, and please limit your questions to one per firm.  With that, I will now turn the call over to Kevin.
Kevin Johnson: Thank you, Kathleen, and welcome, everyone. For the first half of 2011, Juniper has delivered strong year-on-year growth of 18%, with solid year-on-year growth of 15% in the June quarter. And though it did fall short of our expectations, we delivered EPS at the low end of our guidance range.  There were many highlights in the quarter. Our service provider business grew 18% year-on-year. We saw solid growth in our routing and switching lineup. Our Enterprise business grew 9% sequentially, even with the decline in our SLT business.  We continue to focus on the market trends at the mobile Internet and cloud computing. And during today's discussion, I'll comment on the current environment and why we are cautious about the second half, yet very optimistic about 2012 and beyond. I will also provide an update on key strategic innovation projects, design win momentum and an organizational announcement we made yesterday.  In early June, I spoke at an investor conference and commented on some macro signals that we were seeing in the market. With continued news coverage of topics including the sovereign debt situation in Europe, rising unemployment in the U.S., softness in consumer confidence, the impact of the disaster in Japan and lower GDP expectations in many parts of the world, it is evident that people are trying to digest the macroeconomic signals and understand what impact they are having on the buying patterns of customers. These macro signals don't change the long-term demand equation for networking. The market trends of mobile Internet and cloud computing are strong and continue to drive demand. On a global basis, more people and businesses are connecting to the network and consuming more digital content. These market trends are consistent and are core to our growth agenda.  Having delivered 18% year-on-year growth through the first half, I want to highlight some factors that make us cautious about the second half, yet optimistic as we enter 2012. As we look to the second half, there are 4 reasons to be cautious. First, service provider CapEx guidance for the second half is lower than historical seasonal patterns. The historical seasonal pattern for Tier 1 U.S. service provider CapEx has been 43% to 45% invested in the first half and 55% to 57% invested in the second half. Tier 1 service providers in the U.S. have guided 2011 CapEx at approximately 50% of spending in the first half and 50% in the second half, with a forecasted year-on-year growth of approximately 1%. This is a change to historical pattern. We see similar trends with the top 15 service providers globally.  Second, the macroeconomic signals may impact enterprise and public sector spending near term. As governments and certain sectors of the enterprise look to reduce spending, there is a risk that this will impact IT budgets.  Third, as Japan continues to recover from the March 11 disaster, there are questions on how quickly the focus will shift to capital investments in new projects. In our June quarter, we saw revenue from Japan decline by 24% from a year ago.  Fourth, we had 2 very large customer deployments at the SRX a year ago, which created some lumpiness in growth for our SLT business. We're building a pipeline of new design wins to get SLT back on a growth path.  There are also several reasons why we are optimistic as we enter the second half and set up for 2012. First, the market trends of mobile Internet and cloud computing are intact. The continued growth of smartphones, tablets and connected devices consuming more digital content, including video, is creating demand for network innovation. Service providers and enterprise customers continue to focus on large virtualized data centers to deliver both private and public cloud computing, and we are focused on the right market trends.  Second, our innovation agenda is on a path to release a phenomenal wave of new products. During the quarter, QFabric successfully completed several proof-of-concept tests with key customers. We have now entered the formal beta process with 5 customers up and running the end-to-end QFabric system on premise. We have also secured our first significant QFabric design win, and we are on track to release QFabric sometime around the end of this quarter. In addition, our T4000 core router is on track to release later this year. This is a significant step forward in our core routing platform, and we have already secured at least 4 major design wins for the T4000.  The PTX Converged Supercore has experienced very positive response from customers. We are now in the beta process with 6 customers and have already secured our first design win. The PTX is expected to release in Q1 of 2012.  During the quarter, we also released the MobileNext broadband gateway offering, which includes our GGSN, an evolved packet core gateway running on the MX 3D. We have a growing pipeline of opportunities, traction with customer trials and we secured our first design win. We have additional features that are being developed on the MobileNext product roadmap. We're very optimistic about the direction of the product family.  Third, the number and size of design wins and partner buying shares are going. We have a portfolio of design wins in both service provider and enterprise that represent strategic projects that will unfold over the next 24 months. Robyn will share a bit more on the implications of these design wins in her comments. In addition to the examples I just provided, we have also secured several key Junos Pulse design wins that will expand our software footprint and contribute to our growth agenda. With products like QFabric, Converged Supercore, T4000 and MobileNext coming to market, we're gaining more attention and mind share from both our partners and our customers.  Fourth, growth in our routing and switching platforms. This quarter, switching revenue grew 33% year-on-year and routing revenue grew 21% year-on-year. Growing these core businesses is creating momentum ahead of new product introductions, which sets us up well for the future. With 18% year-on-year growth through the first half of this year, we continue to drive hard against our multiyear growth agenda.  We are aware of the macro signals that our customers see, yet we are optimistic about our position going into 2012. We are making very good progress on the strategic innovation agenda. We are generating strong customer interest in securing key design wins. We also announced some key management changes yesterday in alignment with our strategy. In February this year, we aligned our systems division under the leadership of Stefan Dyckerhoff. Yesterday, we announced the creation of the software division, which will be led by Bob Muglia. Bob joins Juniper from Microsoft, where he was most recently the president of the server tools division. Stefan leading the systems division and Bob leading software division enables us to drive our innovation strategy to expand both our systems portfolio and to move up the stack with software. In addition, we made some tuning of executive assignments with Gerri Elliott now leading sales, John Morris leading strategic alliances and Mark Bauhaus leading services. These changes leverage the unique talent of each of our executives in alignment with our strategic objectives.  In summary, we delivered year-on-year growth of 15% in the second quarter and an 18% growth for the first half. We are cautious about the second half, yet very optimistic about our position going into 2012. We look to grow faster than the market in 2011, while strengthening the innovation portfolio as we set up for 2012.  I'll now hand off to Robyn.
Robyn Denholm: Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. In the June quarter, we delivered 2% sequential and 15% year-over-year revenue growth, which was short of our expectations. Through the collective efforts of our employees, we diligently controlled expenses and posted EPS at the low end of our expectations.  At a high level, our business in the second quarter was impacted by the following factors: First, the macroeconomic environment is not improving at the pace we expected when we outlined our operating principles for the year. Second, demand for our SLT products was lower than we expected. Third, demand from service provider customers, while strong, was not as robust as we anticipated. And fourth and as expected, we saw some impact from Japan.  Looking at the demand metrics for the quarter, book to bill came in above the first quarter, but slightly under 1 at 0.98. This was due primarily to weaker than expected service provider bookings. Total deferred revenue decreased by $20 million to $930 million. This decrease was evenly split between services and products. Whilst these metrics point to continued difficult conditions in the near term, we had many design wins this quarter, some of which will start deployment late in the fiscal year. Total deferred revenue is up over 21% year-over-year.  We are confident that our strategy and our solutions portfolio position us well going forward. We will continue to aggressively control expenses, while preserving the investments that support our long-term growth agenda. Coupled with a strong focus on execution across our business operation, we believe this is the right approach to properly address the current environment.  Now, a review of the numbers. Total revenue for the second quarter was $1,121,000,000, up 2% sequentially and 15% year-over-year. As I mentioned earlier, revenue growth was below our expectations due to the relative weakness in enterprise security demand and lower than expected demand from our U.S. service providers. This was partially offset by strength in enterprise switching, including our wireless LAN products and routing. In the quarter, there were no customers who accounted for more than 10% of total revenue.  For the second quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.21, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.31. Both results were an outcome of the combination of revenue and gross margins being lower than expected, and this was offset slightly by prudent OpEx controls. Included in both the GAAP and the non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter is a $0.02 dilutive impact from debt-related net interest expense.  Now let me provide you with some color on revenue by region, business segment and market. In the second quarter, the Americas were approximately 52% of total revenue, EMEA was 29% and APAC was 19%. Americas revenue was roughly flat with the first quarter, as service provider softness was offset by strength in enterprise routing and switching. On a year-over-year basis, Americas was up 17%.  EMEA revenue was up 10% sequentially, with particular strength this quarter in Spain and Russia and up 14% year-over-year. Design wins in routing earlier in the year are beginning to gain traction and add to our results.  In APAC, revenue declined 3% sequentially but rose 9% year-over-year. The sequential decline was primarily due to Japan, which declined 34% sequentially and 24% year-over-year. However, we did see strength in China and Korea during the quarter.  Now looking at revenue by segment, infrastructure revenue was $884 million, 3% higher than the first quarter and up 23% year-over-year. Within the segment, total router revenue was $762 million, up 2% sequentially and 21% year-over-year. This was driven by strength in Edge, offset by some softness in core. Total MX product revenue was $279 million, slightly below Q1, but up 87% year-over-year. T Series was down sequentially in the quarter, as customers await our T4000 and PTX products. Our T4000 products, as Kevin mentioned, are on track to begin shipping late this year and we've increased the number of PTX beta trials due to strong customer interest.  Total switch revenue was $122 million, up 16% sequentially and 33% year-over-year. EX product revenue was $104 million, up 15% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. This was driven by strong sequential growth of the EX42 [EX42000] and EX4500 products. Wireless LAN product revenue was $12 million, up 35% sequentially.  Moving on to the SLT segment. Revenue for the quarter was $237 million, a 4% decline from the first quarter and an 8% year-over-year decline. We saw sequential and year-over-year growth in the branch SRX, but saw softness in enterprise security, primarily in the financial services sector. The year-over-year decline was primarily attributable to high-end firewall and high-end SRX product. SRX products revenue in total was $62 million, up $1 million from the first quarter, and this was driven by the increase in our branch SRX product family. Year-over-year, SRX declined $13 million, primarily due to lower service provider revenue.  This quarter, we had good design wins with both Media Flow and Pulse products. We're seeing solid traction with customers and won a significant multiyear Pulse deal and a Media Flow deal with a major U.S. Tier 1 service provider.  Our global pipeline is strong. We expect to see further wins in upcoming quarters and revenues later in the year as the deployments of these design wins start to roll out. We continue to build momentum from our Trapeze, SMobile, Ankeen and Altor acquisitions. As we integrate them into our solution offerings, we are seeing good design wins that are contributing to our financial and strategic goals.  Looking more closely at the markets we address, service provider revenue was $730 million, down 2% sequentially due to the anticipated impact of Japan and lower than expected demand from our Americas service providers. Service provider revenue increased 18% on a year-over-year basis due to broad strength in the Americas, EMEA and APAC. Enterprise revenue was $391 million, up 9% sequentially as well as year-over-year. This was due to strength in routing and switching and it was offset by weakness in SLT. For the quarter, service provider was 65% of total revenue and enterprise was 35% of total revenue.  Now moving on to our margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margins declined to 65.6%, which is below our guidance range. This was due to unfavorable product and services margins. Product gross margins were 68.1% of product revenue, or 2.5 percentage points lower than the first quarter and about 2 percentage points lower versus a year ago. Product margins was negatively impacted by mix, due to the lower volumes of SLT and T Series products and also due to higher overhead costs.  Services gross margins were 55.7%, down 1.8 points from the prior quarter and 3.6 points lower than the second quarter of the prior year. Service margin performance was impacted by increased maintenance and support resources, as well as increased professional services personnel dedicated to design wins and our large service provider customers.  Non-GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter were $493 million, which was slightly lower than the first quarter and were favorably impacted by cost reduction measures including lower variable compensation. Year-over-year operating expenses increased by 14%. R&D expenses were down 3% from the prior quarter. The teams have controlled expenses very well as we continue to focus on getting the next wave of strategic products to market.  Sales and marketing expenses were 1% lower on a sequential basis. However, we continue to invest in building our sales force in order to enhance our go-to-market capability. G&A expenses were almost flat sequentially and were 6% lower than the 2010 second quarter.  Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 21.6%, down 70 basis points sequentially. We remain agile in our ability to curtail spending in any given quarter, enabling us to balance the short-term trends with the longer-term strategic needs of the business.  Looking at operating margins by segment, infrastructure operating margin was 23.7%, down 80 basis points compared to last quarter and down 150 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year. Infrastructure operating margins were affected by lower gross margins, and these were partially offset by lower operating expenses. And as a reminder, the Infrastructure segment includes routers, switches, MobileNext and QFabric. SLT operating margin was 13.8% compared to 14.7% in the prior quarter and 20.4% in the second quarter of 2010. Operating margins in SLT were impacted by lower revenue and lower gross margins, due primarily to mix.  The GAAP tax rate was 26.5% for the quarter and the non-GAAP tax rate was 26.8%, and both were consistent with our expectations.  Looking at the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with total cash and investments of approximately $4.2 billion. DSO was 39 days in the quarter compared to 38 days in the prior quarter, and this was on strong collections. Cash flow from operations was $318 million, up substantially from the prior quarter. This has benefited from the timing of cash collections, as well as the refund relating to the timing of last year's R&D tax credit. We expect to continue our organizational focus on strong cash flow generation, complemented by the prudent deployment of capital.  During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 3.9 million shares at an average price of $38.94 per share or approximately $150 million. Our weighted average shares on a diluted basis for the quarter were 546 million shares, a decline of 2 million from the prior quarter.  CapEx totaled $62 million, up $8 million from the first quarter as we continue to build out our corporate campus here in Sunnyvale. Depreciation and amortization was approximately $42 million and consistent with prior quarters.  We ended the quarter with approximately 9,300 employees, an increase of over 200 from the prior quarter. While cognizant of the realities of the near-term environment, we continued to move forward on the priority investments in sales, customer service and engineering headcount.  Now let's discuss our guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis except for revenue and share count. As I highlighted in my opening comments, we believe the long-term fundamentals of our business remain healthy. However, the economic recovery has not progressed as we anticipated at the beginning of the year and the near-term environment warrants a careful approach. While we have many design wins in the first half of this year and our overall pipeline is healthy, many of these opportunities will not begin deployment until late this year or early next year. And as a result, we are lowering our outlook for the full year. Our guidance for the third quarter of 2011 is as follows:  We're expecting revenues to range between $1,070,000,000 and $1,120,000,000. Gross margins for the third quarter are expected to range between 65% and 67%, which is slightly below our long-term range, primarily due to product mix. Operating margins for the third quarter are expected to be in the range of 19% to 21%.  We will continue to be diligent in our expense controls, but we expect a slight increase in operating expenses for the third quarter. This would result in third quarter non-GAAP EPS of between $0.26 and $0.30 per share and assumes a flat share count, a tax rate of 27% and includes a dilutive impact of approximately $0.02 due to the net interest expense from our Q1 debt issuance. Given the changes in the environment we discussed earlier, the timing of design wins translating to revenue and the fact that we do not expect a recovery in demand from our customers in Japan until late in the fiscal year, we expect revenue for the full year of 2011 to grow in the range of between 12% and 14%.  In summary, while we're not satisfied with our Q2 performance, we still generated solid year-over-year growth. We took decisive actions to reduce expenses, and we delivered good profitability. We believe our strategy, as well as our solutions portfolio continue to position us well for the future. And I want to thank our fantastic employees for their dedication and hard work. And with that, I will hand it over to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nikos Theodosopoulos from UBS.
Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS Investment Bank: I wanted to ask about the gross margin. You gave some good color on how the mix impacted it, but I wanted to go into that a little bit more. On a sequential basis, can you elaborate on what happened in the routing and switching components of gross margin? And if there were declines there, are those kind of temporary or would you see them as reoccurring? Can you provide some insight?
Robyn Denholm: Yes, Nikos. In terms of the gross margin, what we saw quarter-over-quarter in routing, it was all to do with mix. As I said in my prepared remarks, we had a soft quarter in terms of T-Series for routing. Having said that, the overall routing quarter was relatively strong, so we had a good edge quarter in routing. The gross margins relative to their normal levels were quite high in their individual categories or quite reasonable in their individual categories. In terms of switching, there was no discernible difference in the gross margins for switching across the board. They were within the normal range.
Operator: Our next question comes from Simona Jankowski from Goldman Sachs.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: I just wanted to understand some of the commentary around weaker demand in U.S. service providers. And it sounds like that was related to core routing and also to SRX. Why do you think of that weakness was related to the macro as opposed to your particular market share or design wins? And in particular, it sounds like there's a pause ahead of the T4000 and PTX. But if you haven't yet won the design wins for those 2 products within North America Tier 1 service providers, then how do you know that the weakness in the core routers is not just a share loss there as opposed to either timing or macro?
Kevin Johnson: I guess I'll make a couple of comments. First of all, as the Tier 1 service providers have commented in their earnings calls, a lot of their focus in their capital investments went into things like radio access networks, cell towers and mobile backhaul. And as they make those investments, that then drives the traffic growth into the Edge and into the core. So part of this as a little bit of timing on where it puts pressure on Edge and core, which creates demand for us. That's number one. Number 2, we had, in the SLT business, a significant deployment of SRX, high-end SRX, with a large Tier 1 U.S. service provider a year ago, which created a very high comparable for the SLT business looking year-on-year. And so that certainly had impact in our SLT growth. And then number 3, the guidance that Tier 1 U.S. service providers have given for second half capital expenditures starts to change the historical pattern of what we've seen over the last several years. I think if you look at their first half actuals plus second half guidance, I think it shows about a 1% year-on-year growth in total CapEx. And it shows the distribution is about 50% in the first half and 50% invested in the second half. And as a difference in the historical pattern of typically 43% to 45% in the first half, and then back in second half of 55% to 57%. So that's prompted us to be more cautious about the second half. Yet as we commented, we had a good Q2 growth of our Service Provider business at 18%.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ehud Gelblum from Morgan Stanley.
Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley: Robyn, you said that full year guidance of 12% to 14% for the top line. You've also spoken in the past about guidance in the operating margin line of being up this year over last year. My guess is that's not really going to happen anymore. But as you now see the world, if you can give us a range on what operating margin looks like now under your new revenue assumption, what kind of maybe a range? Is it 22% to 23%? Is it 20% to 21%? How does that work out for this full year? And then I noticed the MX was down, which I couldn't quite put the MX into being down into the categories that you've put them in. I mean, you talked about them; I'm guessing maybe it was the U.S. service provider weakness that caused the MX to be down. But I'm wondering if you think that's a little bit more on the competition side now that Alcatel-Lucent's coming in with another Edge router? Or if you think it has more to do with these CapEx types of issues you were talking about?
Robyn Denholm: Yes, so in terms of the full year at 12% to 14%, I think the factors that we've talked about in terms of being cautious in the near term all apply. In terms of the full year operating margin guidance, our operating principle was that we would expand operating margin for the full fiscal year. We do not believe that, that will happen now. So the answer to that is we will not expand operating margins for the full fiscal year. In terms of the third quarter, I gave you the range of 19% to 21%. We expect improvement in the fourth quarter from that point, and we'll give you more color on that as we move forward here. In terms of the MX, we're very confident with our MX portfolio. We know the product is very competitive out there. We've got lots of design wins, some of which have not started to deploy yet and the quarter-over-quarter sequential was relatively modest in terms of the decline. So I put that more down to timing of the deployments that we still have in terms of the commencement of those starting as we move forward throughout the year.
Kevin Johnson: Just to add to that, I think year-on-year, the MX growth is something like 83% -- 87%, Robyn says. So we've seen MX growth year-on-year 87%. The other comment I would add, Ehud, is that in our partnership with Ericsson, with Ericsson's GGSN that runs on our M Series, we saw a very strong quarter of our M Series in the partnership with Ericsson. And we view that as a positive thing, and that's why I think we've seen good growth on the Edge market overall.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Sue from RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Maybe if you can talk about linearity and linearity going forward, are you starting to see longer evaluation cycles? Are deal sizes getting smaller? Is the increased competition delaying some closure rates, and just kind of dynamics on how the business is now being done as versus before? And Robyn, I don't think we got a sense of kind of your long-term operating margin targets.
Kevin Johnson: Let me take the first one, and then I'll hand off to Robyn, Mark. First of all in terms of changes in sort of the selling dynamic, we're not seeing longer sales cycles. We've got -- in many of these large projects, they are a long sale cycle anyway, and I don't see that being extended. I do see that as part of these design wins, certainly, several of these design wins include products that are on the roadmap to ship. For example, in the area of the PTX, the design wins around PTX typically have the combination of the PTX plus T Series, plus the MX, and so it's an architectural solution. And so part of that is getting to the point where we're -- you're shipping the T4000, shipping the PTX. But I view that as positive because we are solving customer problems in very unique ways. So I don't see the sales cycle being elongated. I see that some of these design wins have the products that are in the roadmap to ship here over next couple of quarters. And so that might have some implications on how our timing of when these big deployments hit. The one thing that we did observe in Q2, certainly at the very end of the quarter, we had line of sight to a set of opportunities that we felt some percentage of those would close in Q2. And a portion, certainly, there was a number of those opportunities that did not close in Q2, but they did close very early, a percentage closed -- a high percentage closed very early in Q3, which is a signal to me that customers are being very aware of the macro situation and deciding which side of the quarterly boundary they want to land their capital expenditures on. And certainly, it's nowhere near extreme as it was in 2009, but I saw similar types of behavior in 2009 and I saw a little bit of that in Q2. Robyn, I'll let you comment on the second question.
Robyn Denholm: Yes, so on the operating margin, obviously for the full fiscal year of 2011, we don't think we will achieve our operating principle of expanding the operating margins for the full year. Having said that, we believe that 25% in terms of the operating margin or higher is definitely still the target from a long-term perspective. And there are many things that we're optimistic about in terms of revenue growth. I think if you sit back, we're focused on driving revenue growth, which then yields the 25% operating margins that we've been targeting the company at. And many of those products and many of those solution sets are nearing coming to market. So we feel very good about that.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Marchetti from Cowen and Company.
John Marchetti - Cowen and Company, LLC: I just wanted to ask Robyn, in terms of sort of the full year guidance that you gave of the 12% to 24% -- excuse me, the 12% to 14%, that obviously implies a fairly significant quarter-over-quarter ramp as we go into 4Q. Just curious and sort of embedded in that guide, how much is related to the design wins that you're referring to? How much is related to Japan coming back? And how much is just related sort of to the overall macro piece improving, as we get a little bit further into the year?
Robyn Denholm: In terms of the 12% to 14%, at the midpoint of guidance at 13%, we are expecting many of the -- well, a lot of the design wins that I talked about starting in the last part of the year or later in the year to commence deployment in the fourth quarter. We're not expecting a return to demand in Japan to normal levels in the fourth quarter. We think that's more likely the first part of next year. So it's really a commencement of the design wins that we have, as well as switching growth as we move forward as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer & Co.
Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: I did want to follow up on that. Robyn, if you look at the midpoint of your September quarter, it is sequentially down from June. Can you give us some color as to what product areas you expect would be declining sequentially from June to September versus rising? And as we think into December quarter, also where do you expect most of the recovery to happen versus still seeing some challenges?
Robyn Denholm: So Ittai, I think in terms of routing, we are expecting a low single-digit decline in routing overall, primarily the service provider sector there, as these design wins still are not coming to fruition in terms of the timing of those. We expect most of those to happen in the fourth quarter as I've sort of alluded to before. So sequentially down low single digits for routing. Enterprise growth primarily all related to switching, we expect flat to slightly down in terms of SLT for the third quarter in enterprise. And so that actually at the midpoint has us down at 2% quarter-over-quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Marshall from Gleacher & Company.
Brian Marshall - Gleacher & Company, Inc.: Just a follow-up on the 2 previous questions, I'm calculating 19% implied sequential guidance for the December quarter. I think over the last 5 years, your average for sequential growth in December has been about 8%, so obviously a pretty big bump up there. Can you talk a little bit about some of the key factors within service providers as well as enterprise which are really going to drive that revenue to get it up to that level? And kind of what gives you the confidence around that?
Robyn Denholm: I think if you look at the midpoint of guidance, 12% to 14%, obviously the midpoint is 13%. And at the midpoint for the third quarter, it's a sequential 2% decline. So the fourth quarter, we have the midpoint at 18% quarter-over-quarter increase. If you look at last year, we actually did about 18.5%. So our sequential increase from third quarter to fourth quarter over the last few years has been in that sort of range of 18% to 20%. And the factors that will influence that is routing deployments in the fourth quarter, as well as enterprise revenue growth in switching between the third and fourth quarter as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tal Liani from of America Merrill Lynch.
Tal Liani - BofA Merrill Lynch: Just a follow-up before, just a clarification. Last year, I know you just quoted the numbers for last year 4Q sequential growth, but it included an accounting change. And if we remove the accounting change, the growth was 12%.
Robyn Denholm: Tal, the accounting change was a year ago. It was the beginning of Q1 of 2010.
Tal Liani - BofA Merrill Lynch: Right, but you provided in the K, you provided the accounting change for each and every quarter, and there was a major increase in the accounting impact in the fourth quarter. It was basically half of the annual change. So if I remove the accounting change from both 3Q and 4Q and recalculate the growth, I'm getting -- I just don't want to apply growth to the accounting. I'm getting a much lower growth. And the question here is whether on one hand, 3Q is down sequentially. On the other hand, which is abnormal kind of on the other hand, 4Q seems to be above normal trends. Does it mean that there were some push-outs or something that leads you to believe that fourth quarter should, in addition to regular seasonality, should compensate for the decline in 3Q. That was my question.
Robyn Denholm: So I think at a high level, the first thing in terms of the third quarter, we do view that as a sideways-to-down quarter in terms of revenue from the second quarter. And that's not our normal seasonal pattern, as Kevin mentioned before. Normally, we have a sequential increase. And so there is some timing related to design wins deploying later in the year. I would actually go back and have a look at the calculations, the year-over-year growth, because the third quarter last year, there is no impact from the accounting. The accounting actually started at the beginning of the fiscal year. So all the way through last year, there were new deals that were accounted under the new revenue recognition. They're not old deals that have changed their accounting treatment. So they were new deals in the third quarter. So the real way to look at year-over-year growth for the third to fourth quarter for last year is 18.5%.
Operator: Our next question comes from Simon Leopold from Morgan Keegan & Co.
Simon Leopold - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.: I wanted to see if you could touch on your OEM partnerships, in particular IBM and Dell, and if you could give us a little bit of color on your thoughts regarding Dell specifically, given their plan to acquire an Ethernet switch vendor.
Kevin Johnson: First of all, the partnerships we have with our alliance partners continue to grow and continue to do well. And that includes Nokia Siemens Networks, Ericsson, IBM and Dell. And certainly you said the OEM relationships, we have OEM relationships with certainly Ericsson; that's doing very well. Their GGSN on our M Series, we commented on the growth there. The relationship with IBM has an OEM component. And the piece that's been growing has been IBM reselling Juniper-branded equipment. So our growth is really on the resell components of Juniper-branded equipment, and the same with Dell. The growth has been in the Dell partnership, it's been reselling Juniper-branded equipment versus the OEM version. So the partnerships are good. The OEM-branded version is not where the growth is coming. It's coming from those partners reselling, IBM and Dell specifically reselling Juniper-branded equipment. The second part of your question is related to Dell's announcement to acquire Force10. I spoke with Michael Dell before that came out. He gave me a call, and we had a discussion around both of our -- and have an intent to expand or to continue this partnership. And look, I acknowledge it will make it more complicated because there's more overlap in the product line. But the fact is that we also have products that go into the solution that are complementary to what Dell would be doing with Force10 and their other products. And it's our intent to continue to focus on how to create a good partnership with Dell built on the foundation that we have established thus far.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian White from Ticonderoga Securities.
Brian White - Ticonderoga Securities LLC: I'm just wondering, how should we think about revenue recognition for QFabric, MobileNext and in T4000 this year? And what type of a ramp can we expect in the first half of next year?
Robyn Denholm: So in terms of QFabric, we'll get some revenue this year, but as we said consistently, it will be relatively modest this year. In terms of T4000 and PTX, the T4000 will start shipping this year. We're expecting revenue in the first quarter of next year. In terms of PTX, it will start shipping in the first quarter of next year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Kvaal from Barclays Capital.
Jeffrey Kvaal - Barclays Capital: Kevin, I was wondering if you could spend a little bit more time talking about the migration from EX to QFabric? How that's coming along? Just off the top of my head, 5 beta trials seems like a fairly modest ramp, relatively speaking.
Kevin Johnson: Sorry, Jeff, you're breaking up a bit. Could you repeat the question please?
Jeffrey Kvaal - Barclays Capital: I was wondering if you wouldn't mind going into the migration from the EX to QFabric; how that is progressing and how comfortable you are with the QFabric trajectory.
Kevin Johnson: First of all, EX and QFabric can coexist. So customers who have implemented an EX environment configuration can now install QFabric and have the 2 coexist, as they decide what portion of their data center they want to run in Fabric mode versus what portion they want to run in our 2-tier architecture based on the EX. So I think from that standpoint the way we've architected the product in the roadmap for customers, there's a very smooth way for customers to decide how fast or how slow they want to go in the migration from an EX environment to a QFabric or from a competitive switching environment to QFabric for that matter. We've made it very easy for customers to do that migration, and I feel very good about the approach that our engineering and services teams have taken. The second part of your question might be how we feel about the progress that we're making with QFabric. And I think given the fact that in Q2 we successfully completed the 3 proof-of-concept tests with customers and we're now in the beta process, which we just started about 2 weeks ago and we're now running the end-to-end system with our 5 beta customers and we're on path to look to ship that product around the end of this quarter. So we feel good about the progress we're making. We feel good about the pipeline. We feel good about the fact that we've now got even our first significant design around QFabric. That's been result of the proof of concept and these betas. So I think we're setting the foundation to have a very highly differentiated solution for data centers for both private, public clouds. As we go into 2012, that solution can interoperate with our EX and with our competitive -- our competitors' switching environments. So we've got -- I think we've got a good opportunity as we look forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Notter from Jefferies & Co.
George Notter - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: I was hoping to ask about the PTX specifically. Any evidence in your conversations with customers or activities that you're able to put the PTX into core routing networks that are based on Cisco core routers?
Kevin Johnson: Certainly, the way the PTX is architected is to interoperate with industry standards. And so there's nothing that would prevent it from going into an environment where there is a competitive install of a core router. The early design wins that we've seen, however, are typically solutions that involve the PTX plus the T4000 plus the MX targeted some very unique scenarios. So there's nothing that would prevent us technically or from a go-to-market standpoint to selling PTX to customers that have non-Juniper technology in the core. Yet what we're finding is that there is great value that we have in synergy across the product line in these early design wins.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Slack from Citigroup.
John Slack - Citigroup Inc: Robyn, you reiterated your 25% or higher operating margin target. I'm wondering where you feel you shake out in the longer-term growth target. Is still greater than 20%? And then maybe you left out the color on the MX 3D. Maybe we can get a little color on how the MX 3D is doing this quarter.
Robyn Denholm: So in terms of the long-term model, I mean we talked about it on the call. We feel really good about the long-term in terms of the growth opportunities that we have ahead of us with the product cycles that we have. In terms of specific color about next year's growth, we will do that late in this year or early next year as we get ready for setting up for the 2012. But I think if you look at the model, the model is about optimizing the top line growth with the market opportunities that we see ahead of us, as well as being efficient and effective with our use of resources to drive that 25% operating margin. In terms of MX 3D, I did give the number. The total MX was down slightly quarter-over-quarter and up significantly year-over-year. And it was really around the timing and deployment of the design wins that we have. So it was a normal type of thing that you have with deployments of a fast ramping product.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jayson Noland from Robert W. Baird.
Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Kevin, a question on SRX and your thoughts on your high-end SRX pipeline and recent weakness. Is that a function of competitive pressure or maybe mis-execution versus micro related issues?
Kevin Johnson: Yes, I think first at the high-end SRX, the most significant factor in that was the very significant comparable we had from a year ago of a very large Tier 1 service provider in the U.S. doing a massive deployment of SRX. And so that large deployment created a very high comparable, which was the biggest impact on the overall SLT business. Second to that, I would comment that the branch SRX has done very well, and that leads then in enterprise data centers. In enterprise data centers, I think that we're seeing more competition. And I think, frankly, there's opportunity for us as we release QFabric to show the whole end-to-end solution that we have in these data centers that combines with what we've done with SRX then with the virtual gateway that runs in VMware and Junos Pulse on the client. So I think more competition related to data center. I think we've got a good path forward with what we're doing with QFabric and our data center architecture. We feel very good about the high-end value proposition for service providers. And even as they move to LTE, there's new technology that we're building into the SRX to enable that architecture for LTE as they switch from 3G to LTE. So we feel good about where we are in high-end SRX. The service providers feel good about where we are with branch SRX and branch and campus. Acknowledge we're seeing more competition in enterprise. But I think with what we're coming to market with QFabric and how we stitched together the end-to-end story of what we're doing to secure the client, secure the network and secure within the VMware servers, why we think we've got a very good competitive story.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rod Hall from JPMorgan Chase.
Rod Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co: I just had one clarification and quick question. The clarification is on the 5 beta trial for QFabric. I wonder if you can say how many those were web services type companies and how many are type B compute applications like exchanges and universities, just to give us some idea what the spread of those trials look like? And then my question is on EMEA, I guess it was counterintuitive to see the revenues there up as much as they were, even though I guess you guys did call out a good pipeline in Q1. So I guess that was coming through in Q2. Can you talk a little bit, though, about what the distribution of revenue across regions might look like in Q3 and Q4? So you think EMEA will be weaker and the other 2 regions stronger? Or any color you can give us on that would be interesting.
Kevin Johnson: I'll take your first question on the QFabric betas, and then I'll hand off to Robyn to comment on EMEA. On the QFabric, the 5 betas that we have, I would characterize it as a mix of large service providers and large enterprise customers. These are going to be the types of data centers and the types of demand that QFabric is very well suited for. It's not -- I frame it that way, is high-end enterprise customers that have demand for that and as well as service providers that are moving into the business of managed services and providing cloud-based computing services. And it's a very good mix. On the EMEA question, I'll hand off to Robyn.
Robyn Denholm: On the EMEA question, Rod, you're right. We actually saw strength in the quarter, and they're related to the design wins that we had late last year, early this year. And so we do have EMEA as one of the areas for caution as we move forward, just given the entire macro perspective there. Having said that, we are doing well with service providers in EMEA, and we do have other design wins that will start rolling out later in the year. But in terms of enterprise, we are cautious on enterprise in EMEA pretty much across the board.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Silverstein from Crédit Suisse.
Paul Silverstein - Crédit Suisse AG: If I could ask a question or clarification. The question is, given that the relatively weak service provider CapEx environment that you called out, Kevin, it seems like it's unlikely to change on a global basis, on an annual basis, given the tight revenue environment, given the tight margin environment all these carriers find themselves in. And historically, I thought it was fairly decent divorce from your revenue relative to the overall macros related to carrier. I'm trying to reconcile your comments about design wins versus the macro headwinds you're seeing at the service provider level. The clarification, did you mention how many MobileNext trials design wins you have?
Kevin Johnson: Yes, let me take the question, Paul. In terms of the service provider, I'm not sure -- there are certainly macro things going on. For service providers, they're growing subscribers and they've got more smartphones, more tablets, more devices connected to the network. Independent of macro, there is more network traffic demand, and the focus that service providers have had, especially in the U.S., has been implementing more of the RAN or the radio access network components, the cell towers and the mobile backhaul. As that gets implemented then, there will be a phase that, that puts, brings that demand traffic into the Edge and core, which will then drive an upgrade cycle on Edge and core. So I think part of it is timing of where the build-outs are taking place. That said, your question about the fundamentals for growth in network traffic are unchanged. And that is what's driving continued demand for innovation in the area of network. And that's where innovation like PTX and T4000 and what we're doing with MobileNext and MX 3D comes into play. On the second part of your question around MobileNext, I commented on the fact that we've secured our first design win and that we have a number of customer trials in place. So the only comment that I made was on that first design win, and we just released that software here in the last 2, 3 weeks.
Operator: We have time for one further question. Our last question comes from the line of Bill Choi from Janney Capital Markets. [Janney Montgomery Scott]
William Choi: So back on SLT here. Can you address what looks to be a continual drag on the non-SRX products, the screen OS-based product? It seems to be accelerating on the downward trend and I'm not sure what the game plan is to really transition that base and create a scenario several quarters down the road where the overall SLT business revenue will go up. I guess you haven't had a screen OS upgrade since 2 years ago.
Robyn Denholm: So in terms of the strategy around the SLT products, the idea is to transition them over time from the net screen product, screen OS-based products to the Junos-based products. And so that transition has started. We have a very loyal customer base on the older products, and that's why that hasn't declined as much as you might think. And branch in terms of SRX, this quarter is a proof point of that. We actually did see a good sequential and year-over-year increase in branch as we start to make sure that the features and functionality are there for customers to adopt those going forward as their new platform.
Operator: I'll now turn the call back over to Ms. Nemeth for closing comments.
Kathleen Nemeth: We'd like to thank everyone once again for joining us this afternoon. This does conclude our conference call, and we look forward to speaking with you again in the future. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Juniper Networks First Quarter 2011 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Kathleen Nemeth, Vice President, Investor Relations for Juniper Networks. Thank you. You may begin.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thank you, Joe. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Here on the call today are Kevin Johnson, Chief Executive Officer; and Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial Officer.   A couple of housekeeping items before we begin. First, as a reminder there is a slide deck that accompanies today's conference call. To access the slides, please go to the IR section of our website at juniper.net.   Second, beginning with today's press release, you will note that the financial table includes a breakout of routing and switching within our IPG segment. This is consistent with our prior disclosures and earnings call.  Please remember when listening to today's call that statements made during this call, concerning Juniper's business outlook, economic and market outlooks, future financial operating results and overall future prospects, are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including economic conditions generally or in the networking industry, changes in overall technology spending, the network capacity requirements of service providers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply chain constraints, variation in the mix of products sold, customer perception and acceptance of our products, litigation and other factors listed in our most recent report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event, facts or circumstances subsequently changed after the date of this call.   In discussing the financial results today, Robyn will first present results on a GAAP basis. And for purposes of today's discussion, we will also review non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why the management team considers non-GAAP information, a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult our 8-K filed with the SEC today. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results, please see today's press release. In general, non-GAAP results exclude certain non-recurring charges, amortization of purchased intangibles, other acquisition-related charges and expenses related to stock-based compensation.   In today's call, Robyn will also be providing forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis other than that with respect to revenue and share count. All guidance is forward-looking, and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier. GAAP guidance measures are not available on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to certain charges, which are excluded from the non-GAAP guidance estimates.   Please note that today's call is scheduled to last for one hour, and please limit your questions to one per firm. With that, I will now turn the call over to Kevin.
Kevin Johnson: Thank you, Kathleen, and welcome, everyone. Juniper delivered a strong first quarter for 2011 with solid financial performance and the introduction of several important new innovations that define our vision of the new network. Revenue growth of 21% year-over-year came in ahead of our 20%-plus long-term target. And our earnings performance was in line with expectations. It was a good start to 2011 as we continue to execute on a multiyear growth agenda.  Overall, our markets remain strong, and we've got good momentum in the business. However, I'd like to comment on two recent events in the market and how we are managing the business in light of these events. I'll comment first on Japan and then on the recent consolidation activity in the service provider sector.   The tragedy in Japan has affected the lives of many people. Juniper and our employees have contributed to relief efforts, including the Red Cross, and we are committed to helping the people of Japan recover from this tragic event. While our business saw a very limited impact from this tragedy during the March quarter, we believe a measure of caution is warranted as we monitor business conditions in the region. Over the past two years, Japan has accounted for approximately 5% to 8% of our revenue. We have a very solid enterprise business there as well as strong positions with leading service providers. Again, very limited impact in the March quarter, but we will continue to assess conditions carefully as we progress through the June quarter.  With regards to consolidation, we are seeing in the service provider sector, while we expect our customers to review their capital expenditure plans consistent with typical processes, we do not believe we will see any impact in the near-term demand as a result of recent announcements in the sector. We've been in close contact with these customers, and we feel very good about their conviction and their overall spending plans with Juniper for the year. As I've noted in prior calls, we are accustomed to typical investment patterns by our service provider customers that favor a stronger second half. We expect that pattern to continue again this year. The guidance we've issued today indicates a bright outlook and takes account of the current environment. Robyn will talk more about that and some of the specific plans we are implementing to manage through this period in a few moments.  Over the past two years, we have aligned the Juniper organization around a common vision for the new network. We are clear on our strategy. We are focused on the domain of networking. And across the company, we are 100% focused on innovation to meet the challenges facing customers as they grapple with the shortcomings of legacy networks.   Based on that vision and clarity of focus, we are aggressively driving new solutions into the marketplace. Execution is key. I've been consistent in my view that the market trends of mobile, Internet and cloud computing are creating demand for a new approach to networking. These market trends play directly to our core strength at Juniper. During the quarter, we unveiled several new innovations that position us to capitalize on these trends as they accelerate. First in February at the Mobile World Congress, we introduced our MobileNext suite of secure software solutions. The MobileNext software runs on our popular MX 3D platform and delivers the promise of the evolved packet core. We are very pleased with the pace of new beta customers and trials, and we expect this solution to be available in Q3 of this year.  Later in February, we introduced our QFabric solution, our architecture and technology for the data center that will enable customers to scale their networks faster and achieve significant leaps in performance. Our QFabric solution is performing well in beta testing. And in the final week of the March quarter, we began shipping the QFX 3500 node, our on ramp to the QFabric solution. We continue to expect QFabric Interconnect and Director to be available in Q3 of this year.  Finally in early March, we announced a new suite of products designed to deliver the networking industry's first Converged Supercore solution, an integrated packet transport system that enables service and content providers to accommodate new levels of peak bandwidth demand. This creates a new product category for the industry, integrating optoelectronics and MPLS switching technology for the very first time. Customer interest in this new product set is high, and we are selectively targeting high impact beta opportunities.  Overall, we are encouraged with the customer discussions we're having around our new innovations. We're seeing strong service provider interest in our Converged Supercore and MobileNext offerings and positive enterprise and service provider reaction to our QFabric approach in the data center.   As we deliver on our innovation road map, we are also expanding our Go to Market capability, especially in the enterprise. We increased our sales force in Q1 and invested in training and professional services capabilities as we ready our newly announced products and solutions for launch throughout the course of 2011. We are focused on equipping our sales teams and partners with specialized capabilities needed to sell a broader product portfolio, encompassing data centers, switching and enterprise security. These investments are critical to driving revenue growth in the years ahead.  Looking a bit deeper into customer demand trends and tone of the business, we entered this year with market momentum, and we believe that momentum continued through Q1. As we have seen in recent periods, growth was broad-based across customer sets, product lines and geographies. We produced a very strong quarter in the service provider segment. A migration to IP packet switch networking is solemnly under way. And our results show that we're positioning ourselves well for this opportunity. Typically, the first quarter is a period when service providers finalize their CapEx budgets for the year. And I commented earlier on the consolidation we are seeing in the sector. We've been clear in saying that our goal is to generate above market rate growth in service provider, both by taking share and by capitalizing on expanded addressable markets with solutions like MobileNext, Media Flow and our Converged Supercore. We've been engaged closely with customers on our new architectural innovations and products. And we feel good about Juniper's position for 2011 and beyond.   In the enterprise, we saw a good year-over-year growth and we have even higher aspirations. Our EX switching line generated 25% year-over-year growth. And as I noted earlier, we began shipping our QFX 3500 node late in the quarter. Enterprise customers see this product as the on-ramp to our QFabric architecture, and there has been a lot of excitement around it. As a result, we think there is some near-term pause in Q1 at the EX4500, our 10-gig top-of-rack switch as customers waited for the QFX 3500. With the new product now shipping, we believe this effect was a short-term anomaly. And we've made good progress integrating our recently acquired solutions into our overall Go to Market portfolio for the enterprise. Our acquisition of Trapeze Networks gave us an immediate position in wireless LAN market for enterprise campus and branch, and we saw good revenue traction this quarter. Our Altor acquisition is also now fully integrated with our existing security offerings for the data center. And we delivered several wins as we are demonstrating Altor's ability to extend our solutions into the virtual machine infrastructure.  Additionally, we are seeing traction with our Junos Pulse platform, as enterprises respond favorably to our mobile security suite and secure remote connections via employees' smartphones and tablets. Service provider interest in Junos Pulse is also ramping up. And we're pleased to announce that TELUS has selected Junos Pulse to provide their customers a secure mobile experience. Service providers, such as TELUS, enable us to reach both enterprise and consumer markets for mobile security in this era of smartphones and tablets. These initiatives provide clear evidence that our business is growing quickly, not just in revenue, but in scope. We are building a broad portfolio of offerings that enable customers to embrace the new network and scale quickly to meet demands for anytime, anywhere secure network access. We're also investing in the Go to Market capability to support our growth. That's a key element of our operating principles for 2011.  As we look out beyond Q1, we believe that Juniper is in a strong competitive position. We have momentum in both service provider and enterprise markets. We're delivering on our innovation road map. Our addressable markets are growing, while our design wins in existing markets are expanding. As we play offense in going after these opportunities, we are also exercising operating prudence as we assess the market situations.   To wrap up, our performance and our innovation announcements in Q1 underscore that the new network is here. We're executing on the initiatives that will drive our multiyear growth agenda. We have momentum in the market. We are staying on the offensive as we seek new design wins driven by our innovation road map. And we are doing all of these while delivering strong near-term results that adhere to our core operating principles and track to our long-term financial model.   With that, I'll turn it over to Robyn for the financial review. Robyn?
Robyn Denholm: Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. We continued our momentum from last year into the first quarter of 2011 and delivered good year-over-year revenue and earnings growth. Given typical seasonality in Q1, we are pleased with our overall revenue growth, especially in routing. While we are not satisfied with the Q1 performance of our Security and Switch business, the pipeline looks good, and we are confident of executing to our growth objectives.  We are all aware of the recent tragic events in Japan. At this time, all Juniper employees that's based in our offices in Tokyo and Osaka are reporting stable conditions. We've been in close contact with our employees, customers and suppliers. And we saw a small disruption to our business in the quarter. However, there is some level of uncertainty in the demand environment in Japan over the next couple of quarters, and we've calibrated the potential risk to our business. I will discuss this further in a minute.  Looking at the overall demand metrics for the quarter, book-to-bill was slightly under 1. We exited the quarter with record deferred total revenue and healthy product backlog. During the quarter, we successfully raised $1 billion through our senior note issuance at very competitive rates. And we also acquired the intellectual property and other assets from Brilliant that enhances our mobile backhaul solutions.   In addition, we acquired certain ASIC technologies and licensed intellectual property from OPNET to complement our work in the next generation packet optical solutions. We also made good progress integrating Trapeze into our Switching business. Our innovation engine was in high gear. And in the quarter as we unveiled three new product lines, MobileNext, QFabric and the Converged Supercore, the initial customer response has been very encouraging. And as we outlined at our Financial Analysts Meeting last month, these new products, along with those under development, will drive growth in our current market, expand our team and help us achieve our long-term growth targets.  Now a review of the numbers. On a GAAP basis, total revenue for the first quarter was $1,002,000,000, -- sorry, $1,102,000,000, down 7% sequentially and an increase of 21% year-over-year. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.24 for the first quarter compared to $0.35 for the fourth quarter of 2010 and $0.30 per share in the prior year first quarter. GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter includes $0.005 dilutive impact from the net interest expense related to the senior notes that we issued during the quarter. And GAAP earnings a year ago had a favorable onetime tax benefit of approximately $0.10.  The non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the first quarter was $0.32 compared to $0.42 in Q4 of 2010 and $0.27 in the prior year first quarter. Included in the non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the first quarter is $0.005 dilutive impact from the debt related to net interest expense.  Now let me provide you with some color on revenue by region, business segment and market. For the quarter, the Americas were approximately 53% of total revenue, EMEA was 27% and APAC was 20%. Americas' revenue was flat sequentially from a seasonally strong Q4, and we saw good year-over-year revenue growth of 19%, driven primarily by U.S. service providers. EMEA revenue was down 17% sequentially from a very strong Q4 and up 14% year-over-year. We saw good growth in the U.K., Ireland and Switzerland. And whilst the EMEA team got off to a slower start than the other two theaters in Q1, they've had many good design wins in the quarter, which bodes well for their results later in the year.  APAC revenue was down 12% sequentially but was up strongly 38% year-over-year. Due to the timing of the earthquake in Japan, there was only a small disruption to our business in Q1 as many of the orders were fulfilled prior to March 11. Japan constitutes about 5% to 8% of our revenue. And in Q1, we saw very strong sequential and year-over-year growth driven by service providers. We also saw solid growth in other parts of APAC, including Australia, Indonesia and India.   On a segment basis, total infrastructure revenue was $855 million, down 6% sequentially and up 26% year-over-year. Total router revenue was $749 million, down 4% sequentially and up 25% year-over-year. During the quarter, we saw some good design wins with our T1600 Core Routers, including a top U.S. content service provider and global Tier 1 service provider. As we look ahead, we are confident of continuing our strong competitive position in the core, given the high level of customer interest in our next generation T4000 that ships later this year and in PTX, our Converged Supercore solution which ships in 2012.  MX had another record quarter with product revenue of $283 million, up 20% sequentially and 103% year-over-year. MX 3D continues to ramp very well and had record revenue of $152 million, up 57% sequentially. And this was driven by a strong demand from top content service providers and cable customers.  In the content delivery network market, we are seeing good traction. And during the quarter, we secured an important win at SingTel with our Media Flow content caching solution. You may recall that our Media Flow product offering is based on technology from our acquisition of Ankeena Networks.   Total switch revenue, which includes EX and WLAN, was $106 million, down 14% sequentially and up 37% year-over-year. EX revenue was $96 million, down 21% sequentially and up 25% year-over-year. This was due in part to seasonality related to enterprise customers. And we also saw an anticipated slowdown in EX4500 orders, given the launch of QFX 3500, our fabric ready 10-gig top-of-rack node that started shipping in the last weeks of the quarter. We recorded our first revenue and are seeing very strong customer interest in this product.   During the quarter, we made good progress integrating the Trapeze Networks acquisition, and we are pleased with the solid execution by the team. WLAN revenue for the quarter was $9.5 million and our pipeline looks strong.  Moving on to SLT, revenue for the quarter was $247 million, down 13% sequentially and up 6% year-over-year. Some of this sequential decline was due to typical seasonality for our Security business in the first quarter. However, for the quarter, SRX product revenue was $61 million, which was lower than our expectations, especially in the service provider sector. Our early design wins with the high-end SRX are in deployment now. The pipeline looks healthy as we continue to add more top-tier service provider customers and new enterprise customers.  The Junos Pulse suite of products had a good quarter with some nice design wins with both service provider and enterprise customers. Looking more closely at the markets that we address, service provider revenue was down 5% sequentially and up 25% year-over-year. While Q1 tends to start up slowly, as service provider budgets are being finalized, we are pleased with our strong year-over-year growth, especially with our Edge product portfolio. Global Tier 1 service provider customers remain key contributors to our growth while we continue to diversify our base. In Q1, we added 54 new Tier 2 and Tier 3 customers to our existing 640 service provider customers globally.  Enterprise revenue was down 11% sequentially and up 13% year-over-year. The sequential decline was due to seasonality and some softness in EMEA. Year-over-year, enterprise switching and security grew at 21% and 15%, respectively, while enterprise routing grew 3%. This was mainly due to the timing of federal orders in the U.S. For the quarter, service provider was 67%, and enterprise was 33% of total revenue. And there were no customers greater than 10% of total revenue.   On a non-GAAP basis, total gross margins for the quarter was 67.9% of revenue, near the high end of our long-term model range of 66% to 68%. Product gross margins were a healthy 70.6% of revenue, up from 69.3% both in the prior quarter and prior year Q1. This was primarily due to mix and reductions in the manufacturing overhead costs.  Service gross margins was 57.5% of revenue, down from 58.6% in the prior quarter and down from 61% of revenue in the first quarter of the prior year. This was due to investments in services related headcount, including professional services architecture personnel and spares as we prepare to support the recent launch of many new products.  Moving on to our operating expenses. For the first quarter, non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $502 million or 45.6% of revenue. Relative to the fourth quarter, operating expenses decreased $6 million due to a reduction in variable compensation, including commissions, and in marketing related expenses. This more than offsets the typical increase in fringe-related employee expenses, such as FICA. Year-over-year, operating expenses were up $97 million or 24% due to an increase in investments in sales and marketing head count, new product development and acquisitions. R&D expenses were $237 million or 21.5% of revenue, up 3% sequentially. Sales and marketing expenses totaled $230 million or 20.8% of revenue, down 5% sequentially. G&A expenses totaled $36 million or 3.3% of revenue, down 2% sequentially.   Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 22.3%, in line with our expectations. We continue to execute against our operating principle of balancing investments in key strategic areas while carefully managing our operating expenses.  Looking at our operating margins by segment. Infrastructure operating margin was 24.5% compared to 26% in the prior quarter as well as that of Q1 of last year. As a reminder, the Infrastructure segment includes routers, switches, MobileNext and QFabric. SLT operating margin was 14.7% compared to 19.7% in the prior quarter and 15% in Q1 of last year. This sequential decline is consistent with the seasonal dip in revenue for the first quarter for SLT. It also represents an increase in expenses due to increased headcount and the SMobile and Altor acquisitions.  Turning to the bottom line. Juniper posted non-GAAP net income of $178 million for the quarter, down 22% sequentially and up 21% year-over-year. The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 24.1%. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 25.9%, slightly lower than we expected due to a greater benefit from the R&D tax credit and a favorable geographic mix of operating income for the quarter.  Looking at the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a total net cash and investments of $3.1 billion. DSO was 38 days in the quarter compared to 45 days in the prior quarter, and this is due to strong cash collections typical of the first quarter. Cash flow from operations was $240 million, down from $370 million from the prior quarter, but I'm very pleased with our strong cash flow generation.   During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.8 million shares at an average price of $42.14 per share or approximately $200 million worth. Our weighted average shares outstanding for the quarter was 548.8 million shares, up 7.4 million shares from the prior quarter.   CapEx totaled $54 million, up $6 million from the prior quarter. Depreciation and amortization was approximately $41 million, consistent with prior quarters. Total deferred revenue was a record $950 million, up 7% sequentially. Product deferred revenue was up 5% sequentially or $13 million. Services deferred revenue increased sequentially by 9% or $53 million. Q1 tends to be a seasonally strong services booking quarter given the renewal of our ongoing service contracts.  We ended the quarter with 9,087 employees, an increase of 315 from the prior quarter. This increase consisted of targeted investments in sales, in customer service and in engineering.  Now let's turn to our guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis except for revenue and share count, and guidance includes the full quarter impact of net interest expense from our debt issuance.  We are confident in the long-term fundamentals that are driving the strong growth of our business. The underlying strengths in the markets that we serve and the great innovation that we are bringing to market enables us to grow in our traditional markets while we expand into new markets and take share. We have begun 2011 with a good first quarter and expect to continue our momentum in Q2 as we execute on our operating principles for the year and drive towards our long-term model. The overall demand environment for both service provider and enterprise market looks healthy across all geographies. However, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, there is some level of uncertainty related to Japan. Based on conversations with our top customers there, we believe there is some risk to revenue in Japan over the next couple of quarters. We view this is as a timing issue rather than any sustained impact on longer term demand.  With that in mind, for the second quarter of 2011, we are expecting revenue to range between $1,130,000,000 and $1,180,000,000. Gross margins for the second quarter are expected to range between 66% and 68%. Given our view that any impact to revenue for Japan will be a temporary one, we will continue to invest in sales and marketing to capture the revenue opportunity ahead of us. We therefore expect operating expenses to be lower as a percentage of revenue but increase on a dollar basis sequentially.   Operating margins for the second quarter is expected to be 22.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points. This would result in second quarter non-GAAP EPS of between $0.31 and $0.34 and assumes a slight increase in share count, a tax rate of 26.5% and includes a dilutive impact of approximately $0.015 due to net interest expense from our debt issuance.  In summary, I am pleased with our performance in Q1 of 2011. As we look ahead, our pipeline and demand indicators look healthy. Our product portfolio has never been stronger. And we are focused on continuing our momentum across all markets and product sets. I want to thank our fantastic employees for their continued dedication to innovation and our growth agenda.   And with that, I'll hand it over to the operator for questions.
Kathleen Nemeth: Operator, can you give the instructions for the Q&A segment, please?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from John Slack with Citigroup.
John Slack - Citigroup Inc: Great. Thank a lot guys. Really impressive on the MX 3D, the ramp there. I'm wondering if you could maybe quantify or have any visibility into the what percent of the MX 3D volumes are going into competitive displacements. Or what percent are just pick replacements in new existing MX chassis?
Kevin Johnson: Yes, thanks for the question, John. This is Kevin. We don't have the mix of percentage of what MX 3D is going in for existing MX installs versus competitive replacements. But I can say that we are securing design wins that are competitive design wins. And so there certainly is an element of us winning a new business because of the MX 3D. I just can't quantify it for you.
Operator: The next question is from George Notter with Jefferies.
George Notter - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Thanks very much, guys. My question has to do with the Japan impact. I appreciate the commentary about the mixture of business coming from Japan. But I guess I was wondering if I could get a sense for how much impact in revenue terms do you think you might be experiencing here in Q2 and then in Q3 going forward. You think it's half of your Japanese business, or 1/3 of it, 3/4? I mean, any framework for it would be great.
Robyn Denholm: Yes. So in our guidance, as I've said, we've contemplated the risk to the Japan business. In any one quarter, our revenues vary between 5% and 8% of our total revenue. At the low end of guidance, that percentage is far less than that forward guidance that I've put out there. So it does contemplate a significant pause in the business for Q2.
Operator: The next question is from Brent Bracelin with Pacific Crest.
Brent Bracelin - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc.: Thank you. From a high-level perspective, a big change here as -- in the service provider side, it looks like the highest growth rate in serv provider in two-plus years, first time in two years, serv provider growth is actually up pace the enterprise business. My question goes back to the first question around share gains. How much of the improvement in serv provider would you attribute to Edge share gains, your iVox, your adding some Tier 2s, Tier 3s versus an improvement in the overall health of the serv provider market as a whole?
Robyn Denholm: Yes. So in terms of what we're seeing on the macroenvironment with the service provider, we were actually quite pleased with our business in the first quarter in service provider, up 25% year-over-year. We are actually seeing good design wins across the board in all three geographies in the Edge, in that ethernet services Edge and the network services Edge. We're also seeing it with content service provider and cable companies as well. And we're -- and they are design wins. And we're actually starting to see some of that obviously translate to revenue, given the health of the business in the quarter. We're also seeing design wins in the core and also in security. We have design wins with the high end SRX in geographies, in all three geographies, around the world in all three product areas. So we are pleased with the momentum in the service provider business.
Kevin Johnson: Yes, just -- I'll just add to Robyn's comments, Brent. I think, certainly, we're seeing market expansion of routing and service providers. And in many cases where service providers are focused on implementing mobile backhaul solution, that's been putting, bringing more traffic and more demand into the Edge and aggregation, where the MX 3D plays in a very strong way. So part of that is market expansion. Certainly, part of that is the fact that we've broadened the customer base. And so we're selling now into more customers. And then certainly, I think there's an element of it that is related to competitive design wins that we've been able to secure. And unfortunately, I can't quantify each of those mixes for you. But I think there's an element of all three of those factors at play here.
Operator: The next question is from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Thank you so much. I wanted to follow up a little bit in more detail on both the EX and the SRX, which seemed to disappoint this quarter. And you did give us a reason there on the EX as far as the pause ahead of the new product there. When we think about how that comes back into Q2, should we think of growth resuming off of the new lower base of Q1? Or would you think that you go back to your original trajectory? In other words, you kind of make up some of that hole and benefit from the pent-up demand, which will put you maybe more in the mid-100? And then on the SRX, I don't think, or maybe I missed it, but what was the reason for the decline there again?
Robyn Denholm: So let me talk about the SRX first, and then we'll cover the EX as well. So on the SRX side, in SLT, in general, we saw a good enterprise growth for Q1. It was higher than the overall enterprise growth, which was 13% for the quarter, and that actually sort of continued the momentum that we have there. The decline quarter-over-quarter was actually on the service provider side. So many of the deployments that we won early in the cycle of SRX, particularly high-end SRX, are nearing their completion in terms of deployment. We had new design wins that are -- was about to be deployed here, but they weren't being deployed in a large way in Q1. So that was the reason for the decline in quarter-over-quarter SRX. On the EX side, we're very happy with the year-over-year growth that we had of 25%. And I think that's the way of looking at it as you move forward here, that year-over-year, we expect to have good revenue growth, including the QFX products as well.
Kevin Johnson: Yes. I'll just add to that, Simona. I think that -- what we'll see how Q2 unfolds. But certainly, there's been very high level of customer interest in QFabric starting at our launch event. And I think in many of the workshops sessions that we're doing with some of our largest partners, the customer attended at those workshops is what they would characterize as standing room only. And so my experience is that when you introduce a new technology and new architecture like that and customers have a high level of interest in it, certainly, there may be some implications near term on existing products that, as they evaluate, we get those design wins. So key for us is to secure design wins for QFabric. And the speed at which we secure those design wins and now that we're shipping the QFX 3500, we have a solution for customers that is the on ramp to fabric. And with the QFabric Interconnect and Director in Q3, I certainly think that's also an element of the equation that we should see that kick in, in Q3 as well. So we're going to have to see. But certainly, we have big aspirations in the growth agenda that we're driving in switching and QFabric plus our EX Switch business plus our wireless LAN through the acquisition of Trapeze are all elements of that.
Operator: Our next question is from Brian Marshall with Gleacher & Co.
Stephen Patel - Gleacher & Company, Inc.: This is Stephen Patel for Brian Marshall. Can you talk more about the customer feedback you've had on the Converged Supercore architecture? Or obviously, collapsing the optical and packet layers is good for service provider costs. But does Juniper help the optical know how to fully integrate and deliver on the approach?
Kevin Johnson: Yes. Well certainly, we appreciate your question, Steven. And your question on customer -- kind of two questions all parsed there. Customer feedback or reaction, I think to what we introduced with the Converged Supercore, has been very strong. Certainly, those service providers, whether they're content service providers or wireless/wireline service providers, when you look at the core of their networks, this is a very interesting architecture and a very interesting technology. And so I think that customer action to this, in response to this has been very positive, very favorable in the target set of customers that we think this is applicable for. Now certainly, we've been doing R&D and working on this architecture, this product for sometime. So we have hired and acquired optical expertise and optical intellectual property with a focus on the element of optical that we refer to as the optoelectronics, which is right on the boundary of where optical is translated into electronics and is right on that boundary of what we believe create unique value for customers by blending that with the MPLS switching. So I'm very confident in our R&D execution around this. We've been very focused on this for some time in building skills, capabilities and intellectual property. And we're very optimistic about the customer early reaction. Thanks for your question.
Operator: The next question is from Tal Liani with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Tal Liani - BofA Merrill Lynch: I have a question. It's about the guidance for next quarter and also for the year perhaps. Robyn, you say that there is a risk in Japan, but the numbers you gave are quite positive. Even if I take your low-end estimates for the quarter, it's only 1% increase sequentially versus last year or kind of normally about 3%, 4%. So it's not that low. And the question is how much risk do you see in Japan beyond your numbers? What's Japan exposure? If you can give us a little bit more details about it. Second, related to the same topic, is, Kevin, your allies say, recently, you said that you think you could grow into 20% this year. Given that you grew about 16% last year, if I remove the accounting impact, and given that we have some Japan here, do you think you need to update this after this quarter, after what just happened?
Robyn Denholm: Yes. Let me talk about guidance for a minute. In terms of the midpoint of the guidance range, what we're expecting is just under a 5% sequential increase, which is not atypical for the first to second quarter. It was slightly stronger than that last year in terms of first to second quarter growth. But that's what we are expecting at the midpoint. At the higher end, we expect service providers to keep skin slightly higher than at the midpoint. So that would be the delta between midpoint and higher end. And obviously, enterprise to grow in the low to mid-teens in terms of the midpoint or maybe even slightly higher at the high end of that equation. At the lower end -- from the midpoint to the low end, basically, all of that is, or the majority of that delta is a direct result of what we see in terms of variability for Japan. And as I said before, Japan typically is about 5% to 8% of the quarter's revenue. And for the first quarter, we saw strong growth year-over-year and sequentially in Japan as we were deploying product in our service provider in particular but also in enterprise. So we have modeled or we've guided the low end to reduce that percentage from 5% to a much lower number. So the risk is fully accounted for or baked in at that lower end.
Tal Liani - BofA Merrill Lynch: [Audio Gap] about the annual side?
Robyn Denholm: On the annual side? So we -- obviously, we've talked about our model in terms of 20% or higher for revenue growth. And we were at 21% for the first quarter at the high end of guidance it gets again, very close to 21% midpoint is about 18.3% year-over-year growth. So in terms of our full year expectations, we believe that revenue will be in line with our long-term model.
Operator: The next question is from Jeff Kvaal with Barclays Capital.
Jeffrey Kvaal - Barclays Capital: Yes. Thanks very much. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the book-to-bill and what's driving that below 1. If it's Japan, is it possible to give us a book-to-bill number excluding the Japan? And federal obviously was also a question that had come up through the quarter. So any thoughts on that would be helpful, too.
Robyn Denholm: Yes. Thanks for your question, Jeff. In terms of the book-to-bill, it was very slightly below 1. In fact, the number was 0.96:1. So I wanted to make sure you knew it was just slightly lower than 1. That is not atypical for the first quarter. Last year, if you remember, it was around the same sort of number. So -- and as I said in my prepared remarks, our deferred revenue, total deferred revenues at record high, the product backlog as well as the product deferred revenue are at very healthy levels. So there was very minimal impact to Japan or limited impact to Japan overall for the quarter and including the backlog.
Operator: The next question is form Rod Hall with JP Morgan.
Rod Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co: A couple of questions for you quickly. One is there's been a lot of talk about pricing aggression in the enterprise and switching. And I just wonder if you guys could just let us know what you're seeing out there in that market. And also, I'd be very curious to know what your own strategy is in coping with that kind of pricing aggression. Do you want to protect share in the enterprise? Are you willing to ease some share? Can you just kind of walk us through how you're thinking about that whole situation?
Kevin Johnson: Yes. Thanks for your question. The way -- and I'll interpret in your question, the pricing -- what's happening with pricing of ethernet switching in the enterprise. And here's how we see this and here's how I think about it. I think there are two profit pools within ethernet switching in the enterprise. I think there's one profit pool that I'll characterize as lower end switching, fewer features, more related to branch campus that is probably much more prone to pricing pressures and of course towards more of a commoditization and which will put downward pressure on that aspect of the pricing pool in ethernet switching. And then there's a second profit pool that is related to a higher end, more highly differentiated scenarios that typically, for the most part, are data center related. And strategically, we are focused on the profit pools that are related to areas that are more highly differentiated, that are more data center oriented, which is why we invest in R&D to innovate, to build something like QFabric. I don't anticipate that the competitive landscape for QFabric is going to be one that is focused on the price of the capital. It's going to be more around the value that's delivered to the customer in these cloud computing centers. So for us, we have an opportunity to grow a significant amount of market share and a portion of the profit pool that I still think is highly differentiated and able to maintain margins. And yet, I think if you look at the whole industry, there will be a set of competitors that I think are focused on the other aspect of the profit pool and there'll be pricing pressure there. So certainly, we do see pricing pressure in the areas of switching that is lower end, lower function, but not -- certainly not as much when you get into the higher end data center scenarios that we're focused on.
Robyn Denholm: With a question, I think, Jeff Kvaal asked before that I didn't answer, which was around federal impact in the quarter. So in my prepared remarks, I talked about the federal business in relation to enterprise growth rate being moderated at 13%. And that was particularly the case on the routing side. So in Q1 of last year, we had a good piece of federal business in routing in the Americas. What we've seen this year is, as you know, we had some good business in routing last quarter, Q4, and not so much in the Q1 time frame. So it's really a timing issue between Q4 and Q1. And so that was my comment as it pertains to federal around the routing side. And so routing and enterprise in total grew 3% year-over-year, and that was impacted by federal routing.
Operator: The next question is from Ehud Gelblum with Morgan Stanley.
Kimberly Watkins - Morgan Stanley: It's actually Kim Watkins in for Ehud today. I just had two questions around margins. First on gross margin, it looks like service provider, excuse me, services gross margins took another step down this quarter. I think last quarter, you had invested in some spares. In this quarter, it was headcount. I have -- we've reached a low water mark at this point. And should we expect that to go down again, or flat or up? And then secondly, operating margin, the target for the year has been 25% or more. We're clearly under that level in the first half of the year. I just want to take your temperature on the confidence in seeing an increase, pretty substantial increase, for the second half of the year. And if you could just highlight then the drivers for that, that would be helpful.
Robyn Denholm: Yes. In terms of services gross margins, you're right. Last quarter, we did have spares investments. We did have some spares investments this quarter but less than last quarter. We have been adding headcount in services, on the support side continuously. But in this quarter, we also have been adding some professional services, what we call architecture headcount that actually will -- are working with the sales team to win some of these design wins, particularly around new products and the new architectures that we're leading with in the new product areas. And so in terms of the services margin, yes, it's historically have been a much higher gross margin, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. We do expect it to improve from here in terms of the services margin modestly by the end of the year in terms of that improvement. In terms of operating margins, we've been very clear. We are focused on expanding operating margins for the full fiscal year of 2011 over the operating margins for 2010. So we finished the full year for 2010 at 24%. And so our commitment is to be focused on actually delivering expansion over and above the 24%.
Operator: The next question is from Jason Ader with William Blair.
Jason Ader - William Blair & Company L.L.C.: Yes. Thank you. Hey guys, I wanted to ask on the enterprise business. I think your long-term guidance there was something like 25%. Is that correct, Robyn?
Robyn Denholm: Yes, between 25% and 30% in the enterprise.
Jason Ader - William Blair & Company L.L.C.: Okay. And this quarter, it was up 13% year-over-year. And obviously, you've mentioned the EX pause. But I mean, that's way below the long-term guidance. What's going to get it back to the 25% to 30%? And what would the specific catalysts that we should think about over the next few quarters?
Robyn Denholm: Yes. In terms of enterprise, 25% to 30%, that is the model that we've had out there in terms of driving to 20% or higher. And we're still committed to that. If you look at the factors in the quarter, there are some -- there's typical seasonality in the first quarter in terms of Q4 to Q1. The total percentage increase year-over-year was 13% in terms of enterprise. And it was 25% on the -- sorry, 21% on the switching line up and 15% on the security area. What actually dragged the average down for the quarter was the routing. And as I mentioned before, that was influenced by the timing of our federal enterprise wins. We actually had a big win in the Q4 time frame, which we talked about last quarter. So that was not in this quarter's revenue. But in terms of the long-term growth rates, we're absolutely focused on achieving that 25% to 30%.
Jason Ader - William Blair & Company L.L.C.: Yes. But the seasonality shouldn't factor in to the year-over-year, correct? I mean, that's why it's year-over-year.
Robyn Denholm: Yes. That's true. But as I said, in terms of the enterprise routing, that isn't a year-over-year factor. It only grew 3% year-over-year. If you take that out, the average was higher than the 13% for enterprise. It was closer to 15% to 16% in terms of total. Actually, it's a little bit higher than that, maybe even 7%, 8% in terms of year-over-year enterprise growth between switching and security. In terms of the switching side, 21% is lower than we've been growing. But I think that's explained by the pause that we did see in terms of the QFX launch.
Operator: The next question is from Paul Silverstein with Crédit Suisse.
Paul Silverstein - Crédit Suisse AG: Thank you. Robyn, maybe I missed it. But just a couple of explanations of some stuff you said before. Enterprise routing, how big a piece of your businesses is that?
Robyn Denholm: We haven't called the number out. But just in terms of growth rate, what I talked about was the year-over-year growth rate.
Operator: The next question is from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird.
Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: I wanted to ask about QFabric, given you've had some reaction from the field and it sounds positive. I wonder about if you could differentiate, given the reaction to the channel. It just doesn't seem like it's as much of a channel product as EX and maybe something more high end, but if you could talk about that a little bit, please?
Kevin Johnson: Yes. Thanks for the great question, Jayson. I participated in the Americas Partner Summit that was held last week with our field team and our partners from the Americas. And so that's one way that I had to gauge that. And certainly, with our broad base of partners, there's a subset of those partners who are very focused on data center scenarios and selling into the data center. And I think it's that set of partners that have been successful selling EX switching into the data center will also be successful selling QFabric into the data center. And then certainly, at our strategic alliances' level, the relationships that we have with IBM and with Dell, I think those continue to progress. And I think they certainly have a degree of interest as well in what we're doing together. So I think it will be a subset of our broad partner base that's focused on data centers scenarios and then our large partners that we continue to work with.
Operator: The next question is from Paul Mansky with Canaccord Genuity.
Paul Mansky - Canaccord Genuity: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. There's been a number of questions on...  [Technical Difficulty]
Paul Mansky - Canaccord Genuity: Thanks for the question. A number of questions on the call here around the enterprise side. Obviously, there's some discomfort on the deceleration. You did offer some qualifiers there. But I -- certainly, I and I think a number of my peers have heard about possibly higher than optimal turnover still in the enterprise sales force. And specifically for you, Kevin, can you talk about whether or not that is a concern of yours, and if so, what you're doing from an incentivization perspective? And then finally, maybe what you view as the expected time to productivity on new hires?
Kevin Johnson: Yes. That's a great question, Paul, thanks. Look, in terms of some turnover in our field sales force, I'll characterize two pieces of it. One is in 2010, I think there was some turnover earlier in the year and some of that was not desirable turnover. I think there were some things in our compensation plans in 2010 that John Morris and the sales team took some action on and made some changes going into 2011. So there's some aspect of that that I think occurred in 2010. As we went into 2011, though, I feel very good about the incentive structure that we had. We held a global sales conference, brought our target field sales force together. I had a chance to interact with a lot of them, and they were pretty jazzed up about the compensation incentive plans that we have in 2011. So any issues that I think we experienced in 2010 in that regard were addressed as we went into 2011. The second part of it is I think certainly as we are upping our game in enterprise selling, there are certain aspect of transitions that we are making and we're being intentional about. And certainly, there's a cost whenever you make change in the field. But we believe that for us to raise our game and really drive towards our aspirations, we've been making some changes in the theater positions and some other things that we think are enabling us or positioning us to fulfill those aspirations. So there's that aspect of the changes that have been made as well. So some of it, I think in 2010, was not necessarily planned or desirable. But I think we corrected that. And as we go into 2011, I think much of what you are seeing is we're being very thoughtful and disciplined and intentional about how we're sequencing those changes. Thanks for the question.
Kathleen Nemeth: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference call. On behalf of the management team here at Juniper, we very much appreciate your participation in the call today and look forward to speaking with you again soon. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes the teleconference. You may disconnect your lines. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Juniper Networks Fourth Quarter 2010 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Kathleen Bela, Vice President, Investor Relations for Juniper Networks. Thank you. You may begin.
Kathleen Bela: Thank you, Joe. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Here on the call today are Kevin Johnson, Chief Executive Officer; and Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial Officer. Kevin is joining us from Davos where he is participating in the World Economic Forum. A couple of housekeeping items before we begin. First, as a reminder, there is a slide deck that accompanies today's conference call. To access the slides, please go to the IR section of our website at juniper.net. Second, beginning with today's financial press release, we are including next quarter's outlook in our release. We believe this aligns to best practices in support of disclosure and transparency. And finally, I want to remind everyone that this call will be available to download as a podcast for you to replay at your convenience. For details, please visit our website.  Please remember when listening to today's call that statements made during this call concerning Juniper's business outlook, economic and market outlook, future financial operating results and overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including economic conditions generally or in the networking industry, changes in overall technology spending, the network capacity requirements of service providers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply chain constraints, variation in the mix of products sold, customer perception and acceptance of our products, litigation and other factors listed in our most recent report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances subsequently change after the date of this call.  In discussing the financial results today, Robyn will first present results on a GAAP basis and, for purposes of today's discussion, will also review non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why the management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult our 8-K filed with the SEC today. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results, please see today's press release. In general, non-GAAP results exclude certain non-recurring charges, amortization of purchased intangibles, other acquisition-related charges and expenses related to stock-based compensation. In today's call, Robyn will also be providing forward-looking guidance.  As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis, other than that with respect to revenue and share count. All guidance is forward-looking, and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier. GAAP guidance measures are not available on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to certain charges, which are excluded from the non-GAAP guidance estimates.  Please note that today's call is scheduled to last for one hour, and please limit your questions to one per firm. With that, I will now turn the call over to Kevin.
Kevin Johnson: Thank you, Kathleen, and welcome, everyone.  Juniper had a strong close to 2010 with record revenue and growing market momentum. Our Q4 results represent a record quarter for the company with year-on-year growth of 26%. On an annual basis, we delivered 23% growth, and we are positioned both strategically and operationally to continue driving our multiyear growth agenda. 2011 is an important next step as we prepare for the introduction of innovative new products that focus on the mobile Internet and cloud computing in unique and compelling ways for our customers. Fourth quarter bookings were strong, and backlog continues to build. You'll recall that in Q3, we experienced a number of orders late in the quarter for our rapidly growing MX 3D product line, which put pressure on our supply chain and constrained our Q3 growth. The actions taken by management to improve our process in Q4 had a positive impact on shipment linearity and supply chain management. These new processes will carry forward into 2011 as we drive for continuous improvement in operational execution. With a growing number of customers and the large volume of orders this quarter, we did increase investment in spares to stock our depots and ensure that we deliver great support to our customers. This is reflected in our services gross margin numbers.  We are also increasing sales and marketing head count as we enter 2011. And due to a strong quarter, we paid higher sales commissions, which is reflected in our operating expenses.  Overall, it was a year of strong growth and operating margin expansion. Driving top line growth enables expansion of operating margins as stated in our long-term financial plan. It is important to note that we expanded 2010 non-GAAP operating margins by over 3.5 points over the prior year.  It was also a very busy quarter strategically. Our growth agenda is focused on two significant market trends: mobile Internet and cloud computing. The three acquisitions we announced in the quarter complemented our organic R&D and strengthened our offerings in these two key areas. We completed several major R&D milestones. We shipped the first beta version of our Project Stratus data center fabric to a major customer and delivered the first beta release of code for Project Falcon. We introduced our next-generation core router, the T4000, and demonstrated its ability to deliver 100G traffic from the core to the edge in tandem with our MX 3D Universal Edge router. We launched the Junos Pulse App for the iPhone, iPad and Android platforms, which enables enterprises to adopt phone and tablet with secure remote access to their corporate networks. Another key strategic initiative well underway in Q4 is advancing our Go to Market capability. Within our sales organization, we increased head count, and we aligned sales and marketing leadership going into 2011. We expanded partner relationships, and we have built marketing muscle. We held our global sales conference two weeks ago, and our Go to Market machine is in execution mode for 2011.  Our multiyear growth strategy focused on mobile Internet and cloud computing trends is driven by our organic R&D combined with targeted, thoughtful M&A and enabled through excellence in execution across our Go to Market model.  The economic climate we're operating in also appears to be increasingly constructive. The global economic recovery has been a long, slow process with varying intensity by region. Expectations for GDP growth in the U.S. appear relatively robust. There are still concerns over the sovereign debt situation in some European countries, and Asia continues to show positive growth indicators.  With the rapid growth of smartphones and tablets, combined with more video over the Net, the demand fundamentals driving service provider investment in advanced wireless networks and next-gen networking appears to be intact.  The enterprise outlook is also very healthy as businesses upgrade networks to deliver anytime, anywhere access and also seek to consolidate data centers and move increasingly toward the cloud. These dynamics were reflected in our Q4 results with year-on-year enterprise growth of 34% and service provider growth of 23%. As the economic situation continues to improve, we believe the market trends of mobile Internet and cloud computing will accelerate. These market trends are at the core of our innovation strategy. As I mentioned, we hit key milestones with both our Falcon and Stratus projects in Q4.  Falcon strengthens our offerings for the mobile Internet. For the past year, we've been building a strong and solid base with our MX 3D edge routing platform, which carries large volumes of network traffic for our service provider customers. The Falcon project delivers software that runs on the MX 3D platform and enables the evolved packet core capability to deliver services for a mobile network with scale. We delivered the first beta release of Falcon code to a major service provider customer during the quarter, fulfilling our goal of entering limited customer testing for evolved packet core software in 2010. Cloud computing is creating a need for customers to connect thousands of servers and storage devices together in very large data centers. Project Stratus, our data center fabric offering, will change the economics and performance of data centers with a single-tier data center fabric solution. Our growing list of design wins in the data center with EX product line for data center switching, the SRX product line for security and the MX product line for data center-to-data center connectivity are all complementary to the innovation coming from the Stratus project.  We are also leveraging targeted M&A to accelerate our strategy in mobile Internet and cloud computing. We announced three acquisitions this quarter. Altor Networks complements our current security offerings in data center security and expands our capability by taking us into the virtual machine infrastructure. Trapeze Networks immediately establishes wireless LAN infrastructure as a key part of Juniper's portfolio, strengthening our position in mobile networking solutions. Finally, we acquired the advanced video delivery IP of Blackwave. This technology, when integrated with our Media Flow Controller, will enable significant scale, performance and efficiency benefits to customers who are dealing with the rapid growth of video and other rich media content.  Before turning the call over to Robyn, I'd like to share our perspective on how we intend to operate the business in 2011. 2010 was a year of solid growth, and we've exited the year with terrific momentum in the market. We expect much of the same in 2011 as we introduce fantastic new products. For each of the past two years, we've laid out a set of operating principles. For 2011, there are five operating principles to guide us. First, our assumption is that the macroeconomic situation continues to improve. Second, we plan to drive another year of growth as part of our multiyear growth agenda. Three, we plan to increase our sales and marketing investment as a percent of revenue with intent to drive top line growth. Four, we intend to expand operating margins year-over-year on our path to achieve sustainable operating margins of 25% or higher. And fifth, we will leverage our balance sheet to complement organic R&D with acquisitions that align with our strategy. These are the operating principles that will guide us in 2011. We'll talk more specific about the strategies we're executing against these principles we hold our Analyst Day in a few weeks.  We certainly have great competitors and a lot of work to do. But coming out of 2010, I believe we have the clarity, focus and momentum to drive on our multiyear growth agenda. We look forward to sharing more with you of how we plan to do that at our Analyst Day. And in the meantime, I'll hand over to Robyn to cover the financials and our outlook in more detail. Robyn?
Robyn Denholm: Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone.  We ended 2010 on a very strong note. In Q4, we accelerated our momentum and delivered record revenue, operating income and operating cash flow. The quarter capped a year in which we executed against our operating principles, played offense and capitalized on a market opportunity. We are on a multiyear growth agenda in line with our long-term model and are confident of building on our momentum in 2011. Entering the new fiscal year, we have good underlying market fundamentals, a strong balance sheet and a solid operating model. We are excited about our growing product portfolio and upcoming launches this year and will continue to maintain our discipline and drive execution based on our operating principles laid out for the new year. The first quarter of the year begins with strong demand metrics for our products. Our book-to-bill in Q4 was above one, and we entered the quarter with strong product backlogs and deferred revenue balance. During the quarter, as expected, we addressed the MX 3D supply constraints that we faced in Q3. As well, we secured the Federal business that has slipped over into Q4. We added virtualized security technology in our portfolio via the Altor acquisition, which closed on December 6, and wireless LAN expertise through the acquisition of Trapeze, which closed on December 16. We also purchased advanced video delivery IP from Blackwave. As a reminder, all results for the fourth quarter include a small financial impact from these three acquisitions.  Now a review of the numbers. On a GAAP basis, total revenue for the fourth quarter was a record $1,190,000,000, up 18% sequentially and 26% year-over-year. Included in total revenue is approximately $1 million of revenue recognized since the closing of the Trapeze acquisition. For the full year, total revenue was $4,093,000,000, an increase of 23% year-over-year.  GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.35 for the fourth quarter compared to $0.25 for the third quarter of 2010 and $0.04 per share in the prior year fourth quarter. GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter included approximately $0.01 diluted impact from operating, integrating, restructuring and legal costs related to the acquisition. For the full year, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.15 compared to $0.22 for 2009. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $0.42, an increase of $0.10 both sequentially and year-over-year. Included in the non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter is a favorable impact of $0.04 related to the tax rate. Of this, $0.03 is due to the extension of the R&D tax credit and $0.01 from a favorable geographic mix of operating income. Based on the timing of the acquisitions, there is also a nominal diluted impact from Altor and Trapeze. For the full year, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.32 compared to $0.92 for 2009.  Now let me provide you with some color on revenue by region, business segment and market. We had a strong sequential as well as year-over-year growth across all regions in the fourth quarter. For the quarter, Americas was approximately 49% of total revenue; EMEA was 30%; and APAC was 21%. Americas revenue saw good growth and increased 9% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. This sequential growth was driven primarily by U.S. service providers. EMEA recorded its best revenue growth rate of the year and was up 30% sequentially and up 41% year-over-year. You saw strength in Western Europe, especially Germany, France, the Netherlands and Sweden.  APAC closed out a good year with Q4 revenue up 23% sequentially and 45% year-over-year, driven by China, Japan, Malaysia and Australia.  On a segment basis, total IPG revenue was a record $907 million, up 22% sequentially and 30% year-over-year. Our T Series core router products had a very strong quarter, growing 47% sequentially and 39% year-over-year. This reflects recent core wins with global Tier 1 service providers.  During the quarter, we shipped the industry's first 100GigE line card and announced the next generation of T4000 core router. With these new products and our ongoing innovation road map, we are confident of maintaining our technological leadership in this market. MX had another record quarter with product revenue of $235 million, up 33% sequentially and 94% year-over-year. MX 3D is gaining solid momentum with our customers and had another very strong quarter with revenue of $97 million, up 54% sequentially. It is interesting to note that some of our key wins with MX 3D have been with top content service providers and social media customers. Total Ethernet switching revenue was a record $123 million, up 22% sequentially and 66% year-over-year. This includes EX product revenue of $117 million. Both EX4500 and EX8200 fueled the momentum in data center switching with 88% and 35% sequential growth, respectively. During the quarter, we had some good wins, including a managed services win with a major U.S. service provider.  Moving on to SLT. We had another record revenue quarter of $283 million, up 5% sequentially and 15% year-over-year. This was driven by significant wins in the enterprise market, especially in the data center with our SRX and high-end firewall products.  We are seeing good traction in the financial services vertical, including a key win at Westpac. In the quarter, SRX product revenue grew 3% sequentially and 102% year-over-year to a record $87 million.  Junos Pulse, our secure mobility solution, is gaining good traction, especially with service providers as we work on building out our distribution network for this offering. And during the quarter, we deployed the Pulse network client at Terra Networks, a leading Brazilian online media provider.  Overall, we are very pleased with the innovation that we brought to market to our customers. For the quarter, EX, MX and SRX product families generated a record combined product revenue of $439 million, up 23% sequentially and 86% year-over-year. For the full year, these three product families combined generated a record revenue of $1.4 billion, up 97% year-over-year. Looking more closely at the markets we address, service provider revenue grew strongly, up 24% sequentially and 23% year-over-year. This was due to strong growth in global Tier 1 carriers and large cable customers. We also saw continued momentum with top U.S. content and social media customers. As we shared with you in the past, we continue to diversify our service provider customer space as well as [indiscernible] [27:54] our existing strong relationships with global Tier 1s. As an example, we have been expanding our footprint with Verizon through our portfolio of routing, security and switching products, the network buildout as well as managed services. Verizon accounted for more than 10% of our revenue for the quarter and for the year. Enterprise revenue was up 7% sequentially and 34% year-over-year. We saw continued penetration in the enterprise switching market and growth in our Security business. This was led by good wins in the financial services and government verticals.  For the quarter, service provider was 66% and enterprise was 34% of total revenue. We had a good growth year for both markets. For the full year, our service provider revenue grew 20% year-over-year, and enterprise revenue grew 31%.  Service provider comprised 64% of total revenue for the year while enterprise was 36%. This illustrates our strategy of diversification across the two markets. On a non-GAAP basis, total gross margins for the quarter was 67.2% of revenue, slightly above the midpoint of our long-term model range of 66% to 68%. Product gross margin was 69.3% of revenues, down slightly from 69.5% in the prior quarter. This was primarily due to mix. But we were up from 68.5% in the fourth quarter of the prior year. Service gross margins were 58.6% of revenue, down from 60.1% in the prior quarter and down from 64.1% of revenue in the fourth quarter of the prior year. This was due to investments in professional services and spares, the new products as well as the new service contracts. And it's consistent with our strategy of investing to capture the market opportunity ahead. For the full year, non-GAAP total gross margins was 67.5% compared to 66.4% in the prior year. Moving to our operating expenses. For the fourth quarter, non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $508 million or 42.7% of revenue. Relative to the third quarter, operating expenses increased by $59 million, a decrease as a percentage of revenue. Year-over-year operating expenses were up $102 million or 25% due to an increase in investments in sales and marketing, new product development, variable compensation and acquisitions. As a percentage of revenue, however, operating expenses were down 50 basis points from 43.2% for the fourth quarter of the prior year. R&D expenses were $231 million or 19.4% of revenue, up 9% sequentially. Sales and marketing expenses totaled $241 million or 20.2% of revenue, up 26% sequentially.  G&A expenses totaled $37 million or 3.1% of revenue, up 1% sequentially from the prior quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 24.5%, up 40 basis points sequentially. We continue to execute against our operating principle of balancing investments in key strategic areas while carefully managing operating expenses. We are making good progress towards our long-term operating model goal of 25% or higher on a sustained basis. Looking at operating margins by segment. IPG operating margin was 26% compared to 24.2% in the prior quarter. This was primarily due to the strong revenue growth.  As a reminder, our investments in EX, Project Stratus, Falcon and the Trapeze acquisition are included in the IPG segment. SLT operating margin was at 19.7% compared to the 24.1% in the prior quarter. This is a result of the investments in sales and marketing and variable compensation. The acquisition of Altor is included in the SLT segment. Turning to the bottom line. Juniper posted non-GAAP net income of $229 million for the quarter, up 33% sequentially and up 32% year-over-year. For the full year, non-GAAP operating margin was 24% compared to 20.2% in the prior year. Non-GAAP net income for the year was $710 million, an increase of 45% year-over-year. The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 17.9%. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 21.6% compared to 30% in the prior quarter. This was due to the extension of the R&D tax credit and the geographic mix of operating income for the quarter.  Looking at the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.8 billion in total cash and investments, up $123 million sequentially. During the quarter, we paid $240 million of net cash in connection with the acquisitions. DSO was 45 days in the quarter compared to 42 in the prior quarter and within our long-term target range. This increase was due to normal seasonality and the timing of the service renewals. Cash flow from operations was a record $371 million, up from $131 million from the prior quarter. This was due primarily to the better shipment linearity.  From the full year, we generated $812 million of operating cash flows. And I'm very pleased with our continued focus on delivering strong cash flows.  During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 5.4 million shares at an average price of $32.88 per share or approximately $177 million. Our weighted average shares outstanding for the quarter were 541.5 million shares, up 6.6 million shares from the prior quarter.  CapEx totaled $48 million, down $7 million from the prior quarter. Depreciation and amortization was approximately $43 million, consistent with prior quarters.  Total deferred revenue was a record $884 million. Product deferred revenue was up 12% sequentially or $30 million. Services deferred revenue increased sequentially by 13% or $69 million. We ended the quarter with head count of 8,772 employees, an increase of 668 from the third quarter. This increase includes the 158 employees from the Altor and Trapeze acquisitions. We also continued to make target investments in sales and marketing and customer services head count.  Now let's turn to our guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis except for revenue and share count. I've also included the full quarter impact of the Altor and Trapeze acquisitions that we completed in the fourth quarter.  In 2010, we delivered against our operating principles. We grew revenue 23% year-over-year, and we expanded operating margins to 24% for the full year. We delivered on our innovation road map to enable our multiyear growth agenda, and we are confident in delivering our long-term model of 20% or higher revenue growth and 25% or higher operating margin. As we begin the new fiscal year, we are focused on our operating principles as outlined by Kevin. And we will execute to these during 2011. For the first quarter of 2011, and in line with seasonal patterns especially in our enterprise business, we are expecting revenues to range between $1,060,000,000 and $1,110,000,000. Gross margins for the first quarter are expected to range between 66% and 68%. We expect operating expenses to be higher as a percentage of revenue but approximately flat on a dollar basis. Operating margins for the first quarter are expected to be between 22% plus or minus half a percent. This would result in first quarter non-GAAP EPS of between $0.30 and $0.33. And this assumes a flat share count -- tax rate of 28.5% and includes a dilutive impact from our recent acquisitions of approximately $0.02. We expect the financial impact from our acquisitions to be accretive within two to four quarters.  In summary, I'm very pleased with our performance in 2010. As we enter 2011, our demand indicators are strong, our product portfolio is robust and we are focused on executing to the growing market opportunity ahead of us.  I want to thank our fantastic employees for their continued dedication to innovation and our growth agenda.  And with that, I'll hand it over to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.
Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Robyn, can you give us a little bit more color? You said that the strength in the switching came from the 4000 and the 8000 series switches. But can you talk specifically about the 8000? For three quarters in a row, that business has been somewhat flattish. How much traction are you seeing in there and how should they expect that momentum to continue into the next year?
Robyn Denholm: In terms of the EX performance overall, we were pleased with the growth rate of 22% sequentially and 66% year-over-year. In terms of the growth drivers this quarter, it was the EX4500 and the 8200, and they both fit [ph] [40:11] into the data center. So we actually do see good growth there with 88% and 35% on a sequential basis as those platforms gain traction in the data center.
Kevin Johnson: Yes, Ittai, let me just add a couple of thoughts to Robyn's comments. I think this is reflective of our strategy and our focus on these mega data centers. The 4500 and the 8200 solution is really addressing these large data center that have to connect large numbers of servers and storage devices. And I think that's where our sales force and where we've got the 3-2-1 data center solution and with the Stratus project making progress. We feel like we've got a very strong proposition in that area. And I think the growth that you saw in 8200 is reflective of the hard work that the sales teams have been doing to get some significant design wins in the data center.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Paul Mansky with Canaccord Genuity.
Paul Mansky - Canaccord Genuity: As we kind of look at some of the commentary around operating expense last quarter, I mean, I put that relative to some of the stuff I heard compared to MARS. It just sounds like we've gone from the feathers situation, feathering down R&D, feathering up sales and marketing or something a little bit more than that, ignoring obviously the commissions in Q4. Obviously, you've had a couple of acquisitions. But are we supposed to walk away from the call this afternoon, indicating there might be a bit more of a step function approach to sales and marketing spending during 2011?
Kevin Johnson: Let me take that first part, Robyn, and then I'll hand off to you. Look, I think we intend to continue to -- I'll call it feather-up in our sales and marketing head count as we increase and expand our Go to Market capabilities. This quarter, frankly, the sales were so strong that we had significant amount of commissions to pay, which I think, as Robyn mentioned, was part of our variable cost. But I think the overall macro message is, we're going to continue to be very thoughtful about managing the entire OpEx envelope against the principles that we outlined. And I think this quarter, certainly with the strong sales, we've paid strong sales commissions as part of that variable cost. But going into 2011, we're going to continue to be very disciplined in how we manage the overall OpEx envelope. Robyn, you want to add to that?
Robyn Denholm: Yes. No, I think in terms of the operating expenses, obviously, we did have an increase in the quarter. We are very disciplined in terms of our operating expenses and in terms of committed to the expanding our operating margins to the long-term model of 25% or higher. In terms of feathering up, Kevin talked about that last quarter. As a percentage of revenue, we have feathered up the percentage of revenue that we're spending on sales and marketing and feathered down in the quarter the R&D. So actually, the dollars are up in both cases, but as a percentage of revenue, they have actually started to cross in the quarter, which was what we actually talked about last quarter.
Paul Mansky - Canaccord Genuity: Is there any way that -- just to kind of add some context to that, is there any way you can share with us what the head count plans roughly are for the current year?
Robyn Denholm: In terms of head count plans for the full year, our operating principle of expanding operating margins for the full fiscal year of 2011 is one of our five operating principles that Kevin outlined at the beginning of the call. And clearly, head count is included in that. Having said that, we also have an operating principle of increasing as a percentage of our total revenue our sales and marketing expenses, and head count is associated with that as well.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Mark Sue with RBC.
Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Kevin, if the environment is better and you have new products such as Falcon and Stratus, is it reasonable to assume your top line growth rate will be higher this year versus last year? And Robyn, historically, you usually start the year with conservative operating margin guidance and it improved year-over-year but also improves quarter-over-quarter. Should we anticipate a similar trajectory? And as we move along, it does seem like you will be above your target by the end of 2011.
Kevin Johnson: Yes, let me take your first question, Mark, and then I'll let Robyn take the second one. First of all, top line growth. I think at the analyst meeting last year, we outlined our long-term model to drive 20% plus top line revenue growth. And we were offering quarterly guidance. I think at the midpoint, it gives us about a 19% growth. And given the product set and the moment we have, I believe this is a year -- in 2011, we can continue to deliver against that long-term model in the top line. I think Paul's question also has to do with this, that we're at the point now where as we start building that momentum, we're going to have to be very thoughtful about how we're allocating resources on sales and marketing. If we can drive top line faster with a little bit more sales and marketing resource, we'll do that. If we have to be a little more balanced and thoughtful as we watch revenue unfold throughout the year, we're going to be disciplined and do that as well. But don't be confused. We are playing offense, and we are going to drive top line revenue growth in 2011.
Robyn Denholm: And Mark, in terms of the operating margin, for the first quarter, the guidance is 22% plus or minus 0.5%. I'm very pleased with our operating margin performance over the last two years plus. We've expanded operating margins in each of the years from the beginning point in Q1. So we do expect for the full fiscal year of 2011 to actually expand operating margins over 2010. And that's inclusive of the investments that Kevin outlined in the operating principles.
Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Robyn, are you leaning towards increasing your operating margin target at Analyst Day?
Robyn Denholm: No, we'd like you to come to Analyst Day and hear about everything that we have lined up for the year and the next few years in terms of our long-term multiyear growth agenda.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of you Ehud Gelblum with Morgan Stanley.
Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley: On the top line, looking at the growth products, SRX strong again at $87 million, but it was only up a little bit sequentially. I had it as, I think, $84 million the quarter before. What is the seasonality in that? Was there any seasonality or any geographic kind of mix that would make the SRX go up in a different pattern to the MX and EX that seem to be on fire? And how should we be looking at that going into Q1 and 2011? And I have a follow-up.
Robyn Denholm: So in terms of -- I'll start on that question. In terms of the SRX in the quarter, we had a very good enterprise quarter in Q4 for SRX. If you'll remember, back to third quarter and actually also the second quarter, we had a high proportion of that total SRX going into our service provider. So in the fourth quarter, we had a good, strong enterprise quarter for SRX overall. And we're pleased with that performance. In terms of MX, and Kevin can comment as well, in terms of what we're seeing with the performance of MX 3D, we have actually seen very good design wins across the board in terms of our wireless and wireline carriers as well as with our content and our social media customers as well. It's getting good reception across the board. So we're happy with it ramp of our MX 3D platform as well.
Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley: Ok [indiscernible], if we're looking kind of the OpEx and then the margins, SLT margin obviously was down to 20%, 19.7% from the 24% you had before. Robyn, do you attribute that to sales and marketing head count from both Trapeze and Altor in SLT or just one of them? I kind of feel that as being a $15 million drag from both of them on the SLT margins. But, let's say, if we were to take Altor out of there, can you give us a sense as to what the margins are there and how we should look at that OpEx going forward? Should that operating margin rebound us revenue comes back by Q2 let's say?
Robyn Denholm: Yes, in terms of SLT, the operating margin performance and actually the top line growth performance for the full year was very good. Good year-over-year growth and also good year-over-year expansion in the operating margin for the full year of 2010. In the fourth quarter, what we saw was a sequential revenue growth of about 5% Q4 over Q3, and an increase in the expenses related to the variable sales and other variable expenses in terms of compensation. And then also, in terms of the sales and marketing head count particularly as it relates to the enterprise sector, the SLT business wears it's fair share of that. So expenses increased ahead of revenue in the quarter for SLT. But overall, I'm very pleased with the operating margin that they achieved for the full year, which is just about 20% for the full year for SLT.
Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley: Then finally, you actually gave a bookings number last quarter for the MX 3D. Can you give us an update on that bookings number just to see how the trend is going?
Robyn Denholm: So I don't have the bookings number. It was ahead of revenue. So it was slightly above the revenue number that I gave in the script of 97. So there is some backlog in terms of MX 3D, as you would expect, as is normal at the end of any quarter.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Your deferred revenue was up quite significantly sequentially. Can you just give us a little visibility into what drove that in terms of both products and customer types? And then I don't know if this was the question you were just answering, but you gave us the product backlog last quarter. Is that a number you have available again this quarter?
Robyn Denholm: So let me start with a backlog number. The backlog is up sequentially modestly. So the number we had last quarter was around $325 million. It's just up single digits from there. And you'll get the number in the K as we publish that. But as I've said, the book-to-bill was above one. So the backlog is up slightly from the end of Q3. In terms of deferred revenue, we had a strong deferred revenue balance in total. It was up for the quarter. It was also up, and it's normally up at the end of fourth quarter in terms of services renewals. Q4, we do have a large services renewal quarter. We also had an increase quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year in the product deferred revenue as well. And the future feature piece is up both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And then a question on the Falcon opportunity. Can you just give us a rough sense -- and I understand it might be preliminary, but what attach rate do you think you might have for the MX 3D install base that you're building? And then also, how should we think about the incremental license content as far as a percent of the overall ASP of the MX 3D? So would it be something like 5% or 10% or something in that range as far as incremental dollar amount per platform sold?
Kevin Johnson: Let me try to address that. First of all, I think we're continuing to execute against the R&D milestones for Falcon. In this quarter, we shipped the first release of software code for beta testing at one of our large service provider customers. We're very excited about that. That was on our road map and our plan, and the team worked very hard to deliver that. And so I would expect that here, certainly in the first half of 2011, we'll be communicating more information publicly about Falcon, including pricing and where that's going. But we see that as significant because it leverages what today is a significant install base and a significant investment that customers are making on MX 3D. And many customers are looking at this trend of fixed mobile convergence, where they're looking and having a single network that's carrying IP packet switch traffic across both their wireline and their wireless. And so it's going to be interesting to see then how many design wins we get when we first come out with the product and how we build the ramp of an install base for Falcon as it comes out. But I think we're super excited about it. I think we're in the beta process right now, testing with some customers. And we expect to share more information publicly with customers, including pricing. So it's a bit premature for me to outline how that is as a percent of the MX 3D. And a typical pricing of all packet core is either based on the max number of concurrent sessions that are being driven by wireless subscribers or the number of wireless subscribers. And then the underlying platform obviously has to scale to meet the demand. And so I think we'll see that relationship unfold between Falcon revenue that has a slightly different license model and then how that's related to the MX 3D platform.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America.
Tal Liani - BofA Merrill Lynch: I want to go back just to get verification on the questions Simona asked. The backhaul [ph] (55:24) was up strongly, and then I think what she meant to -- and if she didn't mean, I'll ask the question again. Where is it coming from in terms of -- is the product -- the growth in product revenues, is it -- sorry, product deferred revenues, I mean. Is it generated by the service provider side or the enterprise side? Is there any common theme around the growth? Is it coming from a few big contracts or is it across the board? Trying to get some color on the growth.  Going to my question, I wanted to just get a color on EX sales on the channels. Can you discuss -- when you look back on the year 2010 and particularly last quarter, can you discuss the various channels you're selling it through, IBM and Dell maybe, versus direct channel versus distributors? And I have one other question.
Robyn Denholm: I will answer the first half on the deferred revenue and I'll hand over on the channel side on EX to Kevin. So in terms of total deferred revenue, it was a record of $884 million, up 12% sequentially or $30 million sequentially. In terms of the product deferred revenue, that was up $30 million. So the overall deferred revenue was up a lot more than $30 million because the services side was also up by $69 million. So in total, it's up about $100 million, $30 million relating to product and $69 million related to services. In terms of the color around the product deferred revenue, it's a result of many design wins across the board and some of them starting to ship. And as I've mentioned previously, the future feature portion of the product deferred revenue is up quarter-over-quarter as well.
Kevin Johnson: Yes, Tal, let me take the second half of your question then on EX sales and channels. Let me to start with our four large strategic alliance partners: IBM, Dell, Ericsson and NSN. Those four partners, in total, we've really made a lot of good progress over the year. In fact, on an annual basis, the revenue driven from those four partners has slightly more than doubled the growth rate of the company. And so we've put resources in, and those relationships are kicking in. And so in this quarter, for example, we had significant big design wins with our partner, IBM, and customers like Westpac and Hess Oil. And those design wins oftentimes include the portfolio and a solution, whether it's big SRX wins for security or EX switching wins in a data center or MX 3D wins to connect data centers. And so we're very optimistic about the progress we're making with those large partners. But we're also very optimistic about the expansion of the broad channel that we have selling EX specifically. And we're seeing it -- some of those channel partners are some of the large service providers as well, that are delivering solutions to enterprise customers as well as their managed services. And I think part of our Go to Market strategy here is continuing to invest and grow the relationships with our large strategic partners while at the same time continuing to expand our channel capabilities on a global basis.
Tal Liani - BofA Merrill Lynch: Just to understand the breakdown, is one group much more significant contributor than the other group?
Kevin Johnson: Well, they're all important. The big design wins in enterprise, certainly, the partners that we see helping drive those are IBM and Dell and even our large service providers. You look at the work that Verizon is doing, for example, to drive big design wins in the enterprise. And so the range of channel partners that are kicking in and helping drive EX revenue continues to grow. And the thing, I think, that we're especially excited about is twofold. Number one, the channel partners represent a very broad set of partners, and our strategic alliance partners are very big partners. And we're going deep with those partners to go get these big design wins.
Tal Liani - BofA Merrill Lynch: Last question, quick one. Falcon and Stratus, Robyn, when should we start baking in some contribution from these projects or products?
Robyn Denholm: Yes. So again, Kevin talked about having the beta release in terms of both Falcon and actually delivering the first beta systems in the fourth quarter of our 2010. And we're looking forward to a revenue event to both of those sometime in 2011.
Tal Liani - BofA Merrill Lynch: And Stratus is already revenue this year?
Kevin Johnson: Yes, both Stratus and Falcon, we should expect some potential revenue in the second half of 2011.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Nikos Theodosopoulos with UBS.
Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS Investment Bank: Robyn, on the gross margin product, you mentioned mix impacted product gross margin a little bit sequentially with a real strong core routing business. I'm trying to see, what was the mix that actually caused the slight tweak down in that?
Robyn Denholm: Actually, in terms of the product gross margin, it was a strong product gross margin overall, and we did have a very good key quarter. So the mix that I was referring to is actually the Chassis versus peak mix. As you can imagine, with new design wins, we actually have a lot of Chassis out there that were shipped in the quarter as well. So very small impact, but it was a slight tick down in terms of the product gross margin.
Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS Investment Bank: And then I think you gave a commentary that you expect operating margin percentage in 2011 to be higher or at least -- maybe not guidance, but you're shooting for that. If I look at the first quarter, the 22% guidance last year, the first quarter was 23%. So that would imply to get better than 24% for the full year, you're going to need to see meaningful uptick above 25% over the course of the year. Did I hear that right? Is that the right way to look at that?
Robyn Denholm: Yes. So in terms of our operating principle for the year, we are committed to expanding operating margins year-over-year. And in terms of our Q1, I did guide to 22%, plus or minus 0.5%. And that does have a full quarter impact of our recent two acquisitions of Altor and Trapeze. That in itself is between one and 1.5 points of operating margin for the first quarter. And I also stated our financial principle or restated our principle around our acquisitions where expect them to be accretive within two to four quarters. So that would imply operating margins improvements in the second half of the year related specifically to the acquisitions.
Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS Investment Bank: And Kevin, just a question for you. I heard on this call several times content and social media customers. I guess a two-part question. Is there anything unique about the MX 3D that would favor that product in that segment or is this just a very strong spending segment right now? And then just how big is that the whole segment for Juniper?
Kevin Johnson: I actually think the answer is it's a little bit of both, the fact that the MX 3D has this Trio Chipset, and the Trio Chipset scales on three dimensions. Not just traffic, but the number of subscribers or users and the number of services you're delivering. And so that flexibility to tune the MX 3D for this scenario, I think, really is uniquely positioned to address the needs of content and social media, and then you combine that with the fact that I think it's a growing market segment. So I think it's actually a little bit of both.
Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS Investment Bank: But is that whole group 10% of the business now or is it still, I mean, just how big is it?
Kevin Johnson: That whole group of what? The content and social media?
Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS Investment Bank: Yes.
Kevin Johnson: 10% of -- So I don't have that number off the top of my head. But it's a growing subsegment within the service provider community.
Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS Investment Bank: Maybe you can give us an update on the Analyst Day on how big that is.
Kevin Johnson: Yes, we'll take that feedback. I just don't have it off the top of my head. But we'll take that feedback for the analyst meeting.
Operator: Our next question is from Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo.
Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: First, on the guidance. You're looking for roughly an 8% to 11% sequential decline in Q1, which is below normal seasonality despite what seems to be pretty positive trend entering the period. So I guess I was hoping to provide some additional details regarding what's causing you to predict such a big sequential decrease during the quarter. Is it just a matter of being conservative or is there something else going on there? Because it sounds like overall business is pretty good here.
Kevin Johnson: Let me take a kind of at a macro-level perspective. First of all, the last two years, at least since I've been in this role, we have seen seasonal decline from Q4 to Q1. And I think that's driven by a couple of things. Certainly, service providers. If they make some significant expenditures in Q4, it takes some little bit of Q1 to digest those. And so Q1 is seasonally down a bit. And then on the enterprise, I think clearly, our EX business is growing. But I think we were expecting some traditional seasonal Q4 to Q1 in the SRX product line into the enterprise. It would bring the enterprise down perhaps slightly. And then I think when you look at our Q4 that we're coming off of, clearly in Q3, there were some federal deals that shifted from Q3 to Q4, which I think we had a very strong Q4. But some of that revenue in Q4 was probably some revenue that had shifted from Q3 to Q4. So I think if you factor all those things in, you end about at the guidance that we're at. And I think it's just also important to note that Robyn and I, we've been very consistent in how we do guidance. And so we use the same methodology and the same approach, and that's where it netted out for Q1. Robyn, anything you want to say to complement that?
Robyn Denholm: No, I think you covered all the main points, Kevin. The one thing, Jess, that I would add is, at the midpoint of guidance, that's a 9%, 10% year-over-year growth rate, which if you look back at last year, that is about where we ended up in terms of growth rate year-over-year for the third quarter. So I think it's a good guidance for the first quarter.
Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: And then from a geographic basis, it looks like the business was actually quite strong across the board. Can you maybe comment on how you're thinking about the different geographies heading into 2011, where you see the most opportunity and perhaps where things are still a little bit challenging?
Kevin Johnson: Yes, let me take that one. On a global basis, I think clearly we see the macroeconomic situation continuing to improve. And then there are certainly pockets where things vary. But we think that the Americas, the view is GDP growth outlook looks good going into 2011. And so we see an optimistic view there. EMEA, we think, is also improving, although Southern Europe still has challenges. But, as I think Robyn mentioned in her comments, France, Germany, the Nordic countries, I think, are all strong. And then in Asia-Pacific, I think overall we had very good performance in Japan, India, Malaysia, Australia, some of the countries that Robyn mentioned. And I think that the macro perspective that I have is, number one, Internet traffic is growing, and the long-term demand fundamentals of this industry are good. And so that's generating opportunity. Number two, the mobile Internet trend continues. And so more smartphones, more tablets, more digital devices. That, too, is creating significant opportunity for us. And the fact that we have focused our innovation agenda and the acquisitions that we've done and our Go to Market focus on the trend of mobile Internet, that's paying off for us in the service provider sector. On the enterprise side, I think globally the latest forecast of enterprise IT spend shows IT spend growing 2011 from 2010 mid-single digits, 5% to 7%. And the fact that we've got this significant addressable market of Ethernet switching, and we're still a 2% to 3% share player and taking share and we've got data center fabric just around corner, we feel very good about the range of products in the portfolio for us to keep taking market share in a very large addressable market in the enterprise. And so I think there's a little color, I guess, on geographies and then how we think about the product portfolio and the focus that we have on mobile Internet and cloud computing.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Rod Hall with J.P. Morgan.
Rod Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co: I just had a couple. One, we noticed Verizon popped up as a 10% customer in the quarter. I wonder if you can comment on maybe just how big they were and also what kind of products they were purchasing from you in the quarter? And then I also wonder if you could talk a little bit about the -- in Q3, you talked about government spending that's slipped into Q4 from Q3. Robyn, would you able catch us up on how much that impacted Q3 revenues and what the revenue trajectory from Q4 on into Q1 looks like as a result of that? And the final question I had was just on the total dilution in 2011 from the acquisition. It sounds like -- I don't know if you commented on this, but it sounds like we could end up with no dilution as these things come through accretion in the back end of the year. So I just wonder if that is in your mind the possible scenario.
Kevin Johnson: Yes, I'll take the first one and then I'll let you take the second, too, Robyn, if that's okay.
Robyn Denholm: Yes.
Kevin Johnson: Yes, Verizon. First of all, we're very pleased with the breadth and the depths of our relationship with Verizon. And as we disclosed, Verizon was a 10% customer in this quarter. They were also a 10% customer in Q1 of 2010 and a 10% customer for the first half. So we've got a very broad and deep relationship with Verizon, and we're involved in multiple projects across both wireline and wireless. And we've also done a significant amount of work in partnership with Verizon around their managed services, especially with the EX Switch portfolio. And so Verizon Wireless with our SRX products, we're securing mobile Internet traffic. Certainly, we've got a relationship with them on files, with the edge routing and MX products. They began utilizing our newest T Series router and the public and private IP backbone. So we're very appreciative of the partnership that we have with Verizon, and we're very focused on delivering great solutions as they build their business. Robyn, you want to take the question on government Q3 and the total diluted outlook for 2011?
Robyn Denholm: Yes. So in terms of government, I'll just go back to Q3 for a minute. There were two things, one of which impacted revenue. So MX 3D where actually our demand outstripped supply, that amount that was in backlog at the end of Q3 was around $20 million to $25 million. In terms of the government deals that moved into the fourth quarter, on the Q3 call, we saw that it's about the same, that we had opportunities of about $20 million that moved into the fourth quarter. And as Kevin and I noted in the prepared remarks, we closed, as expected, those deals. So in terms of acquisitions, our financial principles are very clear. We expect to have our acquisitions, our technology tuck-in acquisitions that we've done to-date to be accretive within two to four quarters. And so given that we closed Trapeze and Altor in the fourth quarter, we do expect at the very least that they'll be accretive by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.
Rod Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co: And then on total dilution for the year or accretion, when you add it all up, does it end up with kind of no impact? Or what should we be thinking about that?
Robyn Denholm: No. I think in terms of the operating principle of expanding operating margins, overall it incorporates the acquisitions as well.
Operator: And our final question is from the line of Sanjiv Wadhwani with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Sanjiv Wadhwani - Stifel Nicolaus: Two questions. Robyn, on AT&T, which was your largest customer in 2009, obviously it didn't come in as a 10% customer in 2010. I'm just curious if you could comment on whether it was up or down year-over-year. And then secondly, in terms of guidance for Q1, I'm curious whether Trapeze is going to be a couple of million dollars. Any sort of color on that would be helpful.
Robyn Denholm: So in terms of AT&T, we're very pleased with our relationship with AT&T. They're a very strong customer for us for the year as well as for the quarter. In terms of Trapeze and the guidance around Trapeze, at the midpoint of guidance, at the $1,085,000,000 mark, we have incorporated about $6 million for the Trapeze acquisition, for the first full quarter of revenue to them.
Sanjiv Wadhwani - Stifel Nicolaus: And just following up on AT&T. I'm just curious, was it up year-over-year or generally flat or down? Any color over there?
Robyn Denholm: So Sanjiv, in terms of color on particular customers, we don't actually do that on the earnings call other than those that are above 10%.
Operator: We have no further questions at this time. I'll just turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.
Kathleen Bela: We'd like to thank everyone for joining us today, and we hope to see many of you on March 3 in San Francisco when we host our 2011 Financial Analyst Meeting. Thanks again. Bye-bye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2010 Q3  (2010-10-19 16:45:00) =====
Executives: Kathleen Bela - VP, IR Kevin Johnson - CEO Robyn Denholm - CFO
Analysts: Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Simon Leopold - Morgan Keegan Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets Jeff Kvall - Barclays Capital Michael Genovese - Soleil Securities Richard Gardner - Citigroup William Choi - Jefferies Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer
Operator: Welcome to the Juniper Networks Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Kathleen Bela, Vice President, Investor Relations for Juniper Networks. Thank you. You may begin.
Kathleen Bela: Here today are Kevin Johnson, Chief Executive Officer; and Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial Officer. A couple of housekeeping items before we begin. First, as a reminder, there is a slide deck that accompanies today's conference call. To access the slides, please go to the “IR” section of our website at juniper.net. This call will also be available to download as a podcast. For details, visit our website. With that, I would like to remind everyone that statements made during this call concerning Juniper's business outlook, economic and market outlook, future financial operating results, and overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, as a result of certain factors including economic conditions generally or in the networking industry, changes in overall technology spending; the network capacity requirements of service providers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply chain constraints, variation in the mix of products sold, customer perception and acceptance of our products, litigation and other factors listed in our most recent reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances subsequently change after the date of this call. In discussing the financial results today, Robyn will first present results on a GAAP basis and for purposes of today's discussion; we will also review non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why the management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult our 8-K filed with the SEC today. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results, please see today's press release. In general, non-GAAP results excludes certain non-recurring charges, amortization of purchased intangibles, other acquisition-related charges, and expenses related to stock-based compensation. In today's call, Robyn will also be providing forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis with the exception of revenue and share count. All guidance is forward-looking and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier. GAAP guidance measures are not available on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to certain charges, which are excluded from the non-GAAP guidance estimate. Please note that today's call is scheduled to last for one hour and please limit your questions to one per firm. With that, I will turn the call over to Kevin.
Kevin Johnson: Juniper delivered another quarter with greater than 20% year-on-year growth. We ended the quarter with record revenue of just over $1 billion, exceptionally strong bookings and substantial growth in backlog. Frankly, because of the robust overall demand environment and the strength in bookings, we could have done better from a revenue perspective. The third quarter is typically one in which orders come in very late in the quarter and this was certainly the case. In addition, our latest MX 3D offering ramped faster than expected this quarter, and it took us longer than it should have to adequately support the supply requirements in light of the order mix. Robyn will add some insights on the order linearity and how the December quarter is shaping up in a few moments. From a macroeconomic perspective, we have been consistent in our view that while we see a recovery underway the pace and trajectory of the recovery is likely to vary by geography. Our view has not changed. Over the past few months there have been a level of uncertainty about the strength of the economy given certain economic indicators. We continue to expect the economic recovery will be slow. The near-term signals we are getting from economic data, whether it is GDP growth, consumer spending, manufacturing data or job growth all support a view that there will be bumps along the way. While we won't be immune to all of them, we are highly confident in our strategy and our ability to strengthen our position in an industry with solid long-term fundamentals. From a customer segment perspective, I am very encouraged by the conversations I am having with our large service provider customers. It is clear that their visibility and their confidence are high as they move towards the end of the year, and that's reflected in our outlook. As I have said a number of times recently, history shows that US service providers typically spend over half their CapEx budgets in the second half of the calendar year, we expect that to be the case again in 2010 and we have significant opportunities in each of the markets we address. As I have noted on past calls, we continue to make net new inroads in many of our traditional service provider markets and continue to increase our relevance by expanding our total presence within their networks. Outside the US, service provider customers are also increasing investment as they build out their current and next-generation networks. We are very pleased to have been awarded a significant contract with China Mobile to supply our T Series Core Routers for their IP network. This was a major win for us during the quarter and underscores our strong market position within core routing. Also in Q3, we shipped the industry's first 100 gig Ethernet interfaces that are IP/MPLS capable. Our enterprise business continues to grow. Our focus on solutions for the virtualized data center is paying off with more design wins. Our enterprise business grew year-on-year in all three theaters. Our US Federal business is typically strong in Q3; saw some business move into the fourth quarter due to the passage of a budget continuation measure by the US congress. Alliances are key element of our growth strategy. Strong alliances enable us to extend our reach, increase our market velocity enable new solutions for our customers. We recently announced that we entered into an agreement with Dell and I am pleased to note that this new alliance is off to a good start. We continue to grow our relationship with IBM and other key alliance partners including Nokia Siemens Networks and Ericsson. Our emphasis on developing joint technology solution as well as integrated marketing programs speak to the commitments we make to the success of both our alliance partners and our customers. Juniper is executing well against the operating principles we have laid out at the beginning of the year. We continue to drive in innovation agenda and we have been disciplined and focused in our R&D investments. Our vision to the new network is centered on two significant market trends, mobile Internet and cloud computing. We will start with the discussion on our focus on mobile Internet. Last October, we announced the MX 3D Edge platform and we continue to see increased service provider demand for this platform. Project Falcon continues to hit its milestones and we expect to have our initial Evolved Packet Core solution in customer trial by the end of this year. As a reminder, Project Falcon addresses the Evolved Packet Core was software designed to run on the Junos Space MX 3D Edge platform. Our Traffic Direct solution, which was released in Q2, also runs on the Junos Space MX 3D Edge platform. With the explosion of smartphones and tablet devices connected to the Internet, the MX 3D and Project Falcon are addressing a key aspect of scaling the wireless networks in support of the mobile Internet. Security is also a critical element of the mobile Internet. Our mobile secured solution built on the Junos Space SRX product line is finding strong customer adoption globally. We have extended our security focus with Junos Pulse and the recent acquisition of SMobile. In addition to secure access for corporate data, Junos Pulse now offers anti-virus, anti-malware, parental controls, and device policy in support of securing the mobile Internet. We have an event planned for later this month with additional information related to this offering. With regards to the opportunity we see in cloud computing, we announced our architectural approach to data centers of the future with our 3-2-1 architecture. We continue to focus on data center design wins with our EX product line and the Stratus Project continues to hit milestones for providing a single tier data center fabric solution in 2011. The Stratus Project is entering a critical testing and early customer adoption phase this quarter. In support of our solutions for mobile internet and cloud computing, we are beginning to add key sales and marketing resources ahead of several planned launches in 2011. With the growing strength of our product portfolio, we are investing with disciplined approach in the specialty sales forces that drive design wins and revenue. Strategically, we are making progress, expanding the portfolio of products and solutions aligned with the mobile internet and cloud computing trends. Operationally, we continue to execute the principles we outlined at the beginning of the year. We are positioned for 2010 top line growth in excess of 20%. On a full year basis, we have managed our OpEx to grow slower than revenues and we have taken immediate actions to improve order linearity during the quarter as well as ensuring we are fully prepared for the strong demand we see for our new products. The pace and trajectory of the economy will continue to vary as this economic recovery unfolds. We do see a strong Q4 ahead, and we are positioning for the opportunities we see in 2011. Now, I will turn it over to Robyn to discuss our financial results and our outlook for the quarter. Robyn?
Robyn Denholm: As Kevin noted, the underlying fundamentals of the business is strong. I am pleased that we executed through our operating principles and exited the quarter with strong momentum. Demand for our products remained high and revenue and EPS came within our guidance range. Given the strong bookings in the quarter, revenue could have been higher. Revenues for the quarter was impacted by demand for MX 3D exceeding our internal supply forecast, and as a result not all orders were able to be fulfilled during the quarter. In addition, many orders came in late in the quarter as is typical to Q3, reducing our ability to obtain more supply. We have already increased our ongoing supply forecast. We exited the quarter with a set of robust demand metric. Book-to-bill was well in excess of one. Product backlog at the end of Q3 stood at approximately $325 million, up significantly from $260 million in the prior quarter. We also ended the quarter with a strong deferred revenue balance. Review of the numbers. As a reminder, all results include the SMobile acquisition, which closed on July 30, 2010. On a GAAP basis, total revenues for the third quarter was a record $1.12 billion, up 3% sequentially and 23% year-over-year. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.25 for the third quarter compared to $0.24 for the second quarter of 2010 and $0.16 per share in the prior year third quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.32, an increase of $0.02 sequentially and $0.09 compared to the prior year third quarter. This includes OpEx related to both the Ankeena and SMobile acquisitions of slightly less than $0.01 per share. Now, let me provide you with some color on revenue by regions, business segment, and markets. We have been consistent in our view that the macroeconomic environment will continue to strengthen throughout the year and that the pace and trajectory of recovery will vary by geography. In Q3, we continued to see some of this variation in global recovery play out. Looking at our revenue by region, for the quarter, Americas was approximately 53% of total revenues. EMEA was 27%, and APAC was 20%. Americas revenue saw good growth and increased 8% sequentially and 26% year-over-year. This growth was driven by content, cable and regional service providers in the US. EMEA revenue was down 5% sequentially and up 13% year-over-year. We saw sequential declines in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, while Western Europe, especially the UK, Netherlands and France were stronger. APAC revenue increased 5% sequentially and 29% on a year-over-year basis, with sequential growth driven by China, South Korea and Australia.  From a pipeline perspective, we had design wins across our entire product portfolio and all three geographies. On a segment basis, total IPG revenue was $744 million, up 3% sequentially and 25% year-over-year. Total EX revenue was a record $102 million, up 10% sequentially and up over a 100% year-over-year. This includes product revenue of $97 million and highlights our continued momentum in the enterprise switching market. Our new 10-Gig EX4500 switch, which began shipping in Q2, is gaining excellent traction with data centre and campus customers. MX had another record quarter with total product revenue of $176 million, up 18% sequentially and 73% year-over-year. The MX 3D saw an exceptionally strong ramp in demand with $87 million of orders and $63 million of revenues. We are pleased with the ramp of MX 3D platform. During the quarter, we also had significant design wins for the T Series Core products at several large service providers, including China Mobile. Traffic Direct, our first offering from Project Falcon recorded another key win this time at a major European service provider. SLT delivered record revenue of $268 million, up 4% sequentially and 17% year-over-year. SRX product revenue grew 13% sequentially to $84 million. We saw good mobile security wins in many large wireless carriers in the US, EMEA, and APAC. In addition, we are seeing good customer engagement for products from the SMobile acquisition as part our Junos Pulse offerings. Overall, we continue to deliver great innovation to our customers as evidenced by the success of EX, MX and SRX product families. This quarter the three product families generated record combined product revenue of $357 million, up 15% sequentially and 96% year-over-year. Looking more closely at the markets we address, service provider revenue was up 2% sequentially and 21% year-over-year. This was due to solid growth in Edge Routing and High-End Firewall products. We are pleased with the continued momentum we are seeing in our content and cable service providers as well as new design wins with several social network customers. Enterprise revenue was up 6% sequentially and 26% year-over-year. This growth was driven primarily by our continued penetration in Enterprise Switching and Branch Firewall products. The third quarter is typically a stronger one for our US Federal region. This year, however, as a result of the congress continuing resolution late in the quarter some anticipated business shifted into Q4. From a pipeline perspective, during the quarter, we had key datacenter design wins in government, retail and financial services. Consistent with Q2, service provider was 63% and enterprise was 37% of total revenues. On a non-GAAP basis, total gross margin for the quarter was 67.5% of revenue, which is at the high-end of our long-term model range of 66% to 68%. Product gross margins were 69.5% of revenue, down slightly from 70.2% in the prior quarter, mainly due to product mix. Services gross margins were 60.1% of revenue, up slightly from 59.3% in the second quarter of 2010. Moving onto our operating expenses, the Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $439 million or 43.4% of revenues. Relative to the second quarter, operating expenses increased by $8 million, but decreased as a percentage of revenues. Year-over-year operating expenses were up $62 million or 16% due to an increase in variable compensation and investments in new product development, acquisitions and expanding routes to market. As a percent of revenue however, operating expenses are down significantly from 45.8% for Q3 of last year. R&D expenses were $212 million or 20.9% of revenue up $6 million compared to the second quarter. Sales and marketing expenses totaled to $191 million or 18.9% of revenue a $4 million increase sequentially. D&A expenses totaled $36 million or 3.6% of revenues, down $2 million from the prior quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 24.1%, up 20 basis points sequentially. We continue to execute against our operating principle of managing expense carefully, while focusing our investments in key strategic growth areas and I am confident of reaching our long-term operating margin goal of 25% or higher on a sustained basis. Looking at operating margins by segment, IPG operating margin was 24.2% compared to 25.2% in the second quarter. As a reminder, our investments in both EX and Project Stratus and Falcon are included within the IPG segment. SLT operating margin was another record at 24.1% compared to 20.4% in the second quarter. This reflects the continued focus by the team to execute efficiently on the R&D roadmap and aligning sales and marketing resources to drive revenue growth. Turning to the bottom line; Juniper posted non-GAAP net income of $172 million for the quarter, up 5% sequentially and up 40% year-over-year. The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 31.4%. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 30%. Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with approximately $2.7 billion in total cash and investments, which was down slightly quarter-over-quarter, but as a reminder during the quarter, we paid $69 million of net cash in connection with the SMobile acquisition. DSO was 42 days in the third quarter compared to 36 in the second quarter, well within our range of 35 to 45 days. This increase was due to the timing of shipments and in addition, cash flow from operation was $131 million, down $90 million from the prior quarter as a result of timing of cash receipts relative to the accounts receivable balance. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 5 million shares at an average price of $26.81 per share for approximately $135 million. Our weighted average shares outstanding for the third quarter were 535 million shares on a diluted non-GAAP basis, down 4 million shares from the prior quarter. CapEx totaled $54 million, up $9 million from the prior quarter, due primarily to investments in R&D lab equipment. Depreciation and amortization consistent with prior quarters was approximately $40 million. Total deferred revenue was $785 million, sequentially product deferred revenue was up 9% or $21 million. For Q3, both the channel inventory and future feature portions of product deferred revenue were up from the prior quarter. Typical for the third quarter, services deferred revenue decrease marginally by 1% or $4 million. We ended the quarter with headcount of 8,104 employees, an increase of 372 from the second quarter. This increase was due to investments in R&D, sales and marketing and customer service headcount. Included in total headcount are approximately 27 new employees from the SMobile acquisition. Now, let's turn to our guidance. As a remainder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis, except for revenue and share count. We continue to focus on executing against our operating principles and we are well on track to achieving 20% or higher revenue growth in 2010, and therefore for Q4, we are expecting revenues of $1.120 billion plus or minus $20 million. Gross margins for the fourth quarter are expected to be in the range of between 66% and 68%. We expect operating expenses to be slightly lower as a percentage of revenue and increase on a dollar basis. Operating margins for the fourth quarter are expected to range between 24.5% plus or minus 0.5 point. This would result in fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS of between $0.35 and $0.37 and assumes a flat share count, a tax rate of 30% and includes a $0.01 of OpEx from our recent acquisitions. In summary demand indicators are strong, our product portfolio is robust and we are focused on executing against the market opportunity ahead of us. I want to thank our employees for their continued dedication to innovation and our growth agenda. With that, I will hand it over to the operator for questions.
Operator:  We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question is from Simona Jankowski from Goldman Sachs.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs:  Just wanted to ask you first about the end of the quarter. It sounded like you saw some increased business at the end there in particular for the MX 3D. Can you just give us a little bit more sense of what kind of customers were asking for that increased business? Also you made the comment that it’s typical for the third quarter to be back end loaded. However, when I look back in the last three years, DSO were actually flat (inaudible) one of those years and this year is up significantly. So, I would just appreciate a little bit more color on the linearity and kind of what were the various puts and takes there?
Robyn Denholm:  In terms of the end of the quarter, Q3 is a back end loaded quarter. From a DSO perspective, let me handle that part of the question first. It's really day 45 or before in terms of week 9 and in terms of DSO. So, that gives us an opportunity to collect it. This obviously the surge in shipments actually happened after that point, which actually resulted in the increase in the DSOs. Let me talk about MX 3D for a minute. So, if you look at our overall MX revenue it was strong in the quarter $176 million up from about a $145 million, an 18% quarter over quarter increase in revenue. What we saw during the quarter was very good strength in the ramp up of MX 3D as a proportion of the total. We are expecting a big quarter in MX in total, but we saw an increasing proportion of MX 3D orders as a total of the MX orders that were coming. That actually accelerated in the last three to four weeks of the quarter. So, the type of customers are quite broad. We actually saw a demand across all geographies in the service provider landscape in terms of the MX 3D. We’re seeing some very good design wins. We obviously fulfilled quite a number of those in the quarter. So, it's a broad-based increase in the overall level of MX and a higher proportion of MX 3D in the quarter. If you go back, we record a number last quarter. We record $24 million of revenue for MX 3D last quarter of the total 145. This quarter, as I said, we had bookings of 87. So, more than three times as much in the quarter and we tripled the amount of revenue as we did last quarter.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs: In terms of the kind of applications that the MX 3D is seeing the surge of activity for, is it ahead of Project Falcon or are there broader application that this is being purchased for?
Kevin Johnson:  Simona, let me try and answer that. The MX 3D, as you are aware, is designed with the trio chips that allows to scale on three dimensions. It can scale on traffic volumes, it can scale on a number of subscribers or users and it can scale on the number of services provided. As a result, we are finding MX 3D as a platform that’s engaged in a wide number of scenarios. Certainly Traffic Direct and the wins that we've had there, MX 3D as a platform for that for content distribution networks and what we are doing with the Ankeena acquisition and the Media Flow offerings, it's a platform for content distribution networks. We're finding customers using it, where they're connecting data centers, connecting the clouds with the MX 3D. So, there's not one common or one single pattern of scenarios. It's actually getting broad adoption across the wide range of scenarios, which reinforces I guess the design point that we had behind the product.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs: Just a quick follow up on margins for next year. You commented, Kevin that you'll be investing quite significantly in sales and marketing to support some of these new product cycles. Should we interpret that as meaning that the increase in OpEx for next year maybe inline or even ahead of your revenue growth?
Kevin Johnson: The comments I made is that we want to start feathering up our investment in sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue, while at the same time feathering down the percent of R&D OpEx as a percent of revenue while maintaining our long-term model. I think that's reflective of the fact that R&D has delivered this great set of products and expanded product portfolio and certainly, as we have Stratus and Falcon hitting the market along with we've done with Junos Pulse and Junos Space, I feel like it's an appropriate time for us to start feathering up our investment in sales and marketing. We're going to balance that on an overall OpEx way by featuring down R&D as a percent of revenue, and certainly, driving top line revenue growth is what's key to giving us the ability to have op margin expansion while continuing to make these investments.
Operator: The next question is from Nikos Theodosopoulos with UBS.
Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS: Looking at the backlog numbers that you provided, and thank you for that information, I was surprised to see that you entered the quarter with a backlog less than where you ended last year, given the very strong bookings last quarter. So my question there is, last quarter there was a comment that book-to-bill was well in excess of one, and when I look at the starting backlog, it doesn't reflect that given where you were at the beginning of the year. So if you can comment on how that puts and takes from the backlog quarter-to-quarter?
Robyn Denholm: So, actually the backlog was at last quarter Q2, so…
Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS: You said it was $260 million and at the end of last year it was $270 million. So that's the question I have. Why was it down from the end of last year?
Robyn Denholm: So there is Q1 in the middle, so obviously, Q1 we both added on the call…
Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS:  In Q1, you said book-to-bill was one or slightly below one. In last quarter you said book-to-bill was well in excess of one.
Robyn Denholm: Yeah. So, in Q2 it was well in excess of one, and in Q1 it was marginally below one to one. So, our backlog at the beginning of this quarter was $260 million and at the end of Q3, we exited the quarter at $325 million for the quarter in terms of product backlog. So that's a significant increase quarter-over-quarter, which is why I gave the actual numbers in the prepared remarks.
Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS: So if the MX 3D orders were about $13 million above the shipments, can we look at that $13 million as being what you couldn't supply based on the supply constraints? Then if you could also can kind of quantify how much of the government business slipped out to get a feel for how much was actually shifted into the fourth quarter from the third quarter both from the MX supply issues and then the government orders slipping?
Robyn Denholm: So, in terms of MX 3D, I gave the bookings number of 87 million for the quarter and the revenue number at $63 million for the quarter. So, that's an increase in backlog or a backlog amount of $24 million for MX 3D. So, that was the numbers that I gave in the prepared remarks. In terms of the overall federal demand, we had a good quarter with federal. We just believe that it would have been stronger had the uncertainty with the government budget and the continuing resolution happened, and therefore we expect some increased orders in the fourth quarter as it relates to that. Overall, that's captured in our guidance range that we gave in terms of revenue for the fourth quarter.
Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS: Just real quickly the deferred revenue impact, do you have that for this quarter or do you not have that yet?
Robyn Denholm: Do you mean the amount for old rules, new rules?
Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS: Yes, they are just kind of adjust.
Robyn Denholm: Yes. So on a dollar basis, it was roughly flat with Q2 and therefore, on a percentage basis, it was down sequentially.
Operator: The next question is from Ehud Gelblum with Morgan Stanley.
Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley: First, Robyn, you had mentioned that gross margin on the product side, it was down slightly on mix and you had mentioned also that the MX 3D is a higher proportion of your MX. Are those related, should we look at the fact the MX 3D has a lower gross margin than the MX?
Robyn Denholm: No, Ehud. So, in terms of MX 3D, we have said it previously that MX 3D because it has our silicon in terms of a Trio chipset is actually a higher gross margin. So those two comments are not related.
Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley: That's what I would have thought. So your gross margin was actually helped by the higher proportion of 3D?
Robyn Denholm: Yes, that's right. So, we are very comfortable with our overall product gross margins at that higher end of our gross margin range and so, it was only a very slight discernable difference in terms to mix quarter-over-quarter.
Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley: So what was the mix that went the other way that offset that?
Robyn Denholm: So the core revenue in the quarter was just slightly lower.
Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley: Core as in T series and M series?
Robyn Denholm: Yes.
Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley: Okay. T primarily.
Robyn Denholm: Yes.
Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley: Now, it sounds like you had greater MX 3D shipments than you had thought. Presuming that you are originally aiming for some number closer to the midpoint of your range and the MX 3D ended up having stronger orders, was the entire fall off the $8 million or so fall off versus where you would have been, was that due just to having MX 3D versus MX or was there something else that possibly was weaker that brought you down there, because it sounds like you maxed out shipping as much MX 3D as thought you would, and then you stormed it up, let's call it, $8 million shy of the midpoint of your guidance range? So I'm trying to understand what was the shortfall of that? Was that fewer MX that was just replaced with MX 3D prematurely or was it something else that ends up being a little bit weaker?
Robyn Denholm: Yeah. I think in terms of the strength of the overall MX sales in the quarter or revenue in the quarter, we were anticipating a significant increase in total MX. I think in terms of revenues the last quarter it was $24 million. So, as you can see, we more than tripled the shipments in the quarter. Yes, we could've shipped more of that if we actually had supply of the components or had we forecasted for the quarter, we could've actually shipped more and that's why I gave you the bookings number of $87 million. Now, whether we could have shipped all of that or not that's another point, but I do think giving you the delta of $24 million is what we could have got us closer to the high end of guidance.
Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley: What was the orders for MX in total?
Robyn Denholm:
$87 million.:
Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley: That was the MX 3D. What about the MX in total?
Robyn Denholm:  I didn't give you the MX in total. I gave you revenue for MX in total, it was $176 million.
Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley: I'm wondering there was a $24 million delta in the MX 3D, I'm wondering what it was for the entire MX in total. So what is the normal amount that you normally push into the next quarter as opposed to being able to ship?
Robyn Denholm: In any one quarter, we have some backlog and I gave you the opening and the closing. I think the significant part is that we increased backlog significantly quarter-over-quarter, which is why I gave you the two data points there. So, in any one quarter you might have a small fluctuation in the backlog, but this was a significant increase.
Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley: Finally, just any explanation on what's going on in Europe, specifically Eastern Europe and Middle East in (inaudible)?
Robyn Denholm: As we've said in terms of the prepared remarks, Europe was specific to a large deal that we had last quarter in Eastern Europe, and I recorded that last quarter, obviously that did not replace itself in Q3. So that was part of the reason for the sequential decline. The other was Middle East where we actually had some chunky business in Middle East last quarter as well. So, overall, it was down 5%. We did see strengths in the UK, Netherlands, and France in terms of the business there. I think it is fair to say that Europe overall is slightly lagging the rest of the world in terms of recovery, but we are seeing good design wins and as we've said, good business in U.K., France, and the Netherlands in the Q3 period, and last quarter we did see good wins in Eastern Europe and the Middle East.
Operator: The next question is from Tal Liani, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch:  I have three questions. First, I want to go back to the question about the federal or the government. Did you disclose what was federal this quarter as a percentage of sales and what is the deferral that you are expecting for next quarter? Is it net-net do you think that federal you're going to recover next quarter what you missed this quarter? So that's number one. Number two, the shortfall this quarter seems to come from the service provide segment predominantly. You're not the only one to say it, CIENA and Infinera, these are all unrelated data points, but we can all connect them into a straight line, and it seems like there is general disappointment with service provider spending this quarter. So, I'm trying to understand the environment, and if you can relate to the spending environment and maybe timing of projects, what came in and what didn't come? Third point is, if you can just relate to the purchase of BLADE Networks by IBM, what's the implications for Stratus, good or bad?
Robyn Denholm: So, Tal, I'll cover the first two bullets and I'll let Kevin talk about the last one. In terms of service provider overall, we were pleased with the 2% sequential increase in the quarter. We're actually overall very pleased with the orders in the quarter. As you can imagine, many of the MX 3D, in particular, but other orders in the backlog are actually service provider related. So, if you look at the orders as well as the increase in demand, the design wins, the discussions with our service provider customers both in North America and elsewhere, we're pleased with the momentum that we have in service provider. For the full year, we've talked about this before that we believe that the second half of the year is high proportion particularly for the North American service provider customers than the first half of the year. Our experience in Q3 with the orders that we did get was within the range that we were anticipating. We actually believe we're on track to hit that 52% to 55% in the second half.
Kevin Johnson: Tal, on your third question about BLADE Networks and IBM. First of all, a comment BLADE is a partner of ours and IBM is a partner of ours; IBM was very transparent with us as they went through this and letting us know their intentions behind this, but clearly BLADE Networks fills a need that IBM has for their BladeCenter technology and what they are doing with Blade servers, and the ability to have the Blade-switches that are architected for where IBM is taking their BladeCenter servers is an important element of what IBM's trying to do and we are very supportive of that. Clearly, our hope is this continues to just strengthen our relationship with IBM as we can continue to work with them on the overall set of solutions that they have for networking. There is a little bit of overlap in the top-of-rack which I don't see that as being significant issue and I think we continue to have a very constructive open dialogue with IBM strategically on where we are going with the technology and the solution. So, overall, we view this as a positive thing where we have two partners that decided to combine and that we think this continues to strengthen our partnership with IBM. The question on federal, could you take that one, Robyn?
Robyn Denholm: So, in terms of federal, I didn't break out the percentage of revenue. We've not done that before in terms of the percentage of total revenues of federal. We have included the deals that we think have slipped into the fourth quarter within our guidance range.
Kevin Johnson:  Yes, and we're tracking those too, Tal, and some of those we've already closed just in the first few weeks of this quarter, but the federal team has - they have the list of things and we've seen the progress they are making there.
Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: The question I had was more specific in the sense that you missed the quarter by about $10 million, but you guided up about $15 million above consensus. So I'm trying to get is it just $10 million being pushed out to next quarter and that's the delta or can we break it down, the $15 million next quarter above expectations, is it coming from the carriers market as you discussed the late orders or is it coming from federals? I'm trying to understand the delta next quarter where it's coming from.
Robyn Denholm: So in terms of the guidance range, we do expect an increase in service provider and in enterprise quarter-over-quarter. Typically, the fourth quarter is a strong service provider quarter, but we also see a good finish to the year end enterprise. So we actually have incorporated both in our guidance range for the fourth quarter.
Operator: The next question is from Simon Leopold with Morgan Keegan.
Simon Leopold - Morgan Keegan: I wanted to touch on two topics. One is, if you can give us a status update of the IBM OEM relationship as a whole? I know you've talked in the past about it kind of being a slow ramp. I'm assuming that they're not a 10% contributor to the business yet, but if we could get a status update and your thoughts on when and if they can reach that kind of milestone.
Kevin Johnson: First of all, let me just comment broadly on our strategic alliance partners, and our strategic alliance partners are included in that mix IBM, Dell, Nokia Siemens Networks and Ericsson. Certainly, NSN and Ericsson focus more on the service provider side, where IBM and Dell focus more on the enterprise side, but all up, that group of partners are basically their revenue growth year-on-year is a bit more than double what we've seen in our own revenue growth. So they're helping drive a larger portion of our revenue force with our focus on those four strategic partners and IBM is included in that. You asked specifically about the OEM relationship, the overall IBM relationship, whether it's reselling Juniper products or selling the IBM branded version of Juniper products that overall relationship continues to grow year-on-year. The OEM element of that though is moving slower. So the bulk of what IBM is doing is still resell of Juniper product, which is fine with us obviously. I think the key points are that our overall strategic alliances are continuing to help grow and help us drive revenue. Number two, IBM is a key part of that. They are growing as well. Your specific question on OEM, we're seeing most of the growth with IBM being in traditional reselling versus the OEM version of the product.
Simon Leopold - Morgan Keegan: The other thing I want to ask about is, how you're thinking strategically about, let's say, the portfolio evolution, so we understand what you're doing around cloud and in packet core, so then we ask for more of course. I'm just wondering about above Layer 3, when we look at opportunities whether it's application delivery controllers, WAN optimization, Session Border Control, these seem like logical areas for Juniper to participate. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about that within your strategy?
Kevin Johnson: Yeah. I guess, the things I would point to you, certainly, our focus on security and what we're doing in the area of security plays a key role in that, and some of that functionality and capability is in the SRX, and then some of the capability we're doing in security as in Junos Pulse. The WAN acceleration technology, we believe that that is also something that technology evolves to be built into the system versus having a separate system. So, the Layer 4 through 7 stuff for the most part we view that stuff as being built as software applications that run on our Junos platforms. So, I think you see it's evolving strategically in that direction. As you point out, certainly those are logical addressable markets that we can expand into and continue to innovate and broaden the product portfolio and do it in a way that accrues value to the underlying Junos platform.
Simon Leopold - Morgan Keegan: Are these things that are let's say beyond your vision, but are these areas where you are investing R&D today and looking to expand into those markets or are you just acknowledging that, logically these are possibilities?
Kevin Johnson: I'm certainly acknowledging that logically these are possibilities. Things like WAN acceleration we've talked. Mark Bauhaus and the team and SOT has talked publicly about what we're doing to evolve that. So, we've been public about the things that we're working on, and if there is new things that we announced we'll announce those when we're ready to announce them.
Operator: The next question is from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets:  On service providers, are there firm commitments from North American carriers for the fourth quarter asides from the fact that it's typically better so that we don't have to cross our fingers? Sometimes we do get a flush, sometimes we don't, if you could just provide us some insights there?
Robyn Denholm: I'll start and then Kevin can add. In terms of the North American providers, we are very pleased with the Q3 orders and revenues that we received from our Tier 1 US North American service providers, and it was within our expectation of what we anticipated for the quarter. So, if we look at both our backlogs and our discussions with our customers, we're confident of the second half revenue and we're also confident obviously of the fourth quarter because we know what we have in terms of the third quarter revenue from them to-date. So, if I keep going back to the back half or particularly our North American service provider tends to be a higher percentage of total revenue. Then I look at the backlog and I also reflect on the discussions we've had with those customers, we do expect that to tick up in the fourth quarter.
Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets: Then Kevin maybe how should we think of your new linearity, is that the new norm going forward. I mean, what's the root cause of customers waiting for the last minute?
Kevin Johnson: That's a good question, Mark. I think if you look at the historical patterns over the last four to five years, that's been in place for at least the last four to five years where I studied the historical pattern. Certainly, in 2009, things got more back-end loaded as customers were being much more thoughtful about which side of the quarterly boundary they wanted to land their capital purchases. In 2010, we've seen that smooth out a bit more from 2009 into a more normal pattern. I think part of what's just been built in over the last 10 years in terms of how people are making significant capital purchases, they kind of look later in the quarter what they are going to do and certainly that require us to have good visibility to their plans and good relationships in connections with them. Just to reinforce Robyn's comments, from my perspective our engagement with our large U.S. service providers I think visibility is good.
Operator: The next question is from Jeff Kvall with Barclays Capital.
Jeff Kvall - Barclays Capital: Kevin and Robyn, I wanted to address the 20% revenue growth target that you have over a multi-year timeframe. I think, obviously, you folks are hitting it this year. At the same time, you are not really dominating that 20% target this year despite the fact that's bit of a recovery year in spending. So I'm wondering what you think we have to look forward to in 2010 to keep that revenue growth so impressive? Then as a corollary to that, if the fourth quarter is a little bit better than seasonal because of the push-outs in 3Q should we think that the first quarter is going to be a little bit below seasonal as a result?
Robyn Denholm: Let me talk about the multi-year growth agenda. So as I talked a couple of time and Kevin obviously has as well, we are on a multi-year growth agenda of 20% or higher. The reasons why we believe that are the innovation that we brought to market and that we are bringing to market in the corollary is that Kevin outlined in his script actually today on the mobile Internet and also on the data center and also with our continued growth in core and edge routing as well as the switching portfolio. We're confident as we bring these new products to market, we will continue to see the growth that we've had. So the 20% or higher we talked about in February of this year being a multi-year growth agenda and that's what we are focusing as a whole company on in terms of the R&D investments that we're making and also the positioning of the sales and marketing resources as we look to capture that near and longer term opportunity.
Kevin Johnson:  I'll just add to that, Jeff, I think, at the Financial Analyst Meeting after the first of the year, certainly we'll have an opportunity to outline the perspective for 2011 and reconfirm strategically where we are going and how that unfolds, but there is three key points. Number one, we compete in a large addressable market and if you take, just for example, Ethernet switching and the fact that we surpass now 2% market share, we'll just keep driving and taking market share at such a large addressable market that for us to continue to grow in that one gives us plenty of headroom for grow. Number two, we've expanded the product portfolio, and if you look at going into 2011 with the progress that we have made on our Stratus Project for data center fabric, the progress we are making with Falcon for our mobile packet core. We've got an event later this month around Junos Pulse to share some new announcements and things we are doing there that expands our opportunities, the work we are doing with Junos Space. We've complemented that with some M&A in Ankeena, and how that translates to the Media Flow solution that we have for content distribution networks as mobile and how that's being integrated into features of Junos Pulse. The large addressable market, the expanded product portfolio, and the fact that we are complementing our organic R&D with some of this targeted M&A tuck-ins, I think those three things, I think are all key to us delivering on this multi-year growth agenda that Robyn outlined. We look forward to the Financial Analyst Meeting where we can provide you perspective of 2011 and the operating principles and where we're going.
Jeff Kvall - Barclays Capital: Sorry, in the first quarter?
Robyn Denholm: In terms of the first quarter, we'll talk about that in the next quarter's earnings call, but as Kevin mentioned, we are in a multi-year growth agenda. So, we're looking at that long-term perspective as well, but we'll address our Q1 of 2011 specifically on next quarter's call.
Operator:
 :
Michael Genovese - Soleil Securities: Just very quick questions. Number one, I mean, when you talk about having maybe could have done better in the quarter on the revenue line, and that the orders came in late in the quarter and there were some supply constraints. Is there any element of choice in that as well? I mean, are the closed decisions that you make as a management team with the recognized revenue or defer it to the next quarter? Would there be reason to potentially show less revenue this quarter to have a higher level of confidence in next quarter?
Robyn Denholm: I'll address that. I'm not sure exactly the question, but from my perspective, we get the orders when we get them. We book them and we ship them as we can. So, clearly, what I talked about was Q3 was back-end loaded quarter which is typical of the third quarter given the holidays and that type of thing. We actually have a customer request day when they actually place the orders with us and we've done this to meet that customer request day. So, the fact that as we proceeded through the quarter, the last month of the quarter, last three to four weeks of the quarter we actually saw increasing proportion of our MX orders coming as MX 3D, that outstripped the supply that we had for the quarter. So, that's my answer. The other thing is we obviously, as we've said today, in a couple of different areas, we manage the Company overall for the long term. So, we are not looking at the artificial dates at the end of the quarter for in terms of how we manage with our customers actually.
Michael Genovese - Soleil Securities: It looks like the IPG and the SLT margins are converging. SLT making great progress getting into the mid-20s, IPG obviously was in the high-20s over a year ago, but is it because of the inclusion of the EX switch in that category that we're now in the mid-20s and is the long-term goal to kind of have converged operating margins in both major segments or is there a reason that IPG could perhaps reaccelerate to the high-20s?
Robyn Denholm: In terms of SLT, I'm very pleased with the progress that the teams made. They've had very good multi-year discipline in terms of driving top line growth as well as driving the most efficient use of their OpEx as they drive forward. So, they've done a fabulous job. In terms of IPG, we've done a fabulous job with IPG itself. We also include in there Project Stratus and Falcon which have been in a pretty heavy investment size. So the fact that the two operating margins have actually converged is goodness, because as I said, we've got our investments in the other infrastructure areas like Stratus and Falcon that we're doing over this last couple of years. Mike, we'd like to move on. We're getting close to the hour and I know there is a couple of that still have - are in the queue to ask questions.
Operator: The next question is from Richard Gardner with Citigroup.
Richard Gardner - Citigroup: Kevin, I wanted to go back to Simona's earlier question regarding your comment on headcount additions during the year, next year. First of all, could you perhaps give us a sense of whether next year is going to be a significantly larger hiring year than you would typically see? I think in a normal year, if there is such a thing, you hire around 1,000 or 1,100 new employees per year. Secondly, I just wanted to clarify, I was hoping that you could clarify that if the Company achieves its 20% plus revenue growth target for next year, do you still expect to make progress with operating margins towards your 25% long-term goal next year specifically given those investments?
Kevin Johnson: Let me just comment that we are in the process right now in our planning process of putting together our headcount plans for 2011, and so it's premature for me to give you specific numbers on what will happen, but my comments to Simona, I think, reflects strategically what Robyn and I would like to see happen, which is, I call it feathering up of sales and marketing cost as a percentage of revenue, and you can think of that in terms of a point at most in percent of revenue and feathering down R&D as a cost of the percent of revenue, and obviously, doing that all in a way that allows us to continue on our path towards operating margin expansion. So I wouldn't over-interpret these comments as being some dramatic shift in strategy, but it's basically the subtlety of where we are trying to put resources. I think that having our sales and marketing resources to go get the money and go get the revenue is key to us driving the long-term, top line growth agenda. By driving that top line growth agenda that's what's going to allow us to continue to fuel the investments that we need in R&D that help us continue to expand the product portfolio and help us continue to have a long-term value creation agenda for both customers and shareholders.
Operator:  The next question is from William Choi with Jefferies.
William Choi - Jefferies: I just wanted to delve into mobile data. Kevin, you mentioned Falcon on track with milestones, if you could specify any kind of milestones that you could share with us. Since Falcon will be primarily on MX 3D, curious how many customers are currently on MX 3D now, and what percentage of these customers you would expect to capture as a customer for mobile Falcon? Finally, can you talk about the size and the number of customers involved in the trial by the end of the year?
Kevin Johnson: The Project Falcon has a number of different milestones and deliverables. The first deliverable was Traffic Direct, and we shipped Traffic Direct in Q2 of this year, and so Traffic Direct is a shipping software product that runs on the MX 3D, and I think Robyn highlighted some of the design wins that we saw this last quarter on that. Falcon, Project Falcon and the next milestone is part of the Evolved Packet Core software that also runs on the MX 3D, and we anticipate being in a very limited number of customer testing early trials by the end of this calendar year, that's the only milestone that we've announced thus far, and we are on track to make that milestone. Then beyond that, obviously, there are other milestones and certainly, as this unfolds, we'll share those with the marketplace as appropriate. In terms of your question on how many customers are running MX 3D, the first thing I'll remind folks is that, the MX chassis, the MX 3D is basically a line-card upgrade to the MX Chassis. So, all existing install base of MX customers can upgrade to the MX 3D by simply purchasing the MX 3D line cards. So, it's important when you look at the work that we've done to establish the install base that we have of MX, that all becomes addressable platform for us for the Falcon offerings that are coming to markets. I don't have a specific number on the number of customers that are running MX or MX 3D, but I think clearly by the fact that just this quarter, we more than tripled the shipments of the MX 3D versus last quarter, it's just an indicator of the continued increased demand. My comments earlier on the fact that there is a wide range of scenarios that those customers are running it in which is also reflective of the fact it's a wide range of customers that are running it. The key areas to think about were mobile Internet and the focus is as these smartphones continue to grow and the amount of traffic delivered to these smartphones continues to just explode and the transition from 3G to LTE that is the sweet spot for what we've target Falcon and the MX 3D for, and that's where we're going to be laser focused with our go-to-market efforts.
William Choi - Jefferies: Is there any way to think about the evolution of gross margins for MX, so obviously 3D with its own chips that will have higher margins then you have Traffic Direct and Falcon with software so even higher. What's the range of possibility of gross margins on MX?
Robyn Denholm: In terms of gross margins, they are good gross margins. I mean, MX gross margins were good gross margins. MX 3D are better as we've talked about before given that they are our intellectual property on the Trio chipset. So, at the Analyst Day, I gave you lots of different inputs into what will keep our gross margin range in that very healthy 66% to 68% of revenue and MX 3D is one of those areas, the extension of the platform, the continued penetration into different accounts and the fact that we continue to grow in volumes across all of our major platforms SRX, EX and MX as well. Obviously (inaudible) is growing well as well in terms of call. So, all of those things help in terms of the gross margin range.
Kevin Johnson: I'd just punctuate Robyn's comments by saying, well your point that software where we have software offerings like the - offerings coming from Falcon, Media Flow that is content distribution networks, Junos Pulse, Junos Space, those are all software offerings and software offerings have very good gross margin properties. I think at the upcoming Analyst Day, I think, Robyn and I will provide you a little bit more insight into gross margin on the software and how we're going to work to drive a larger mix of our revenue in software which obviously is very helpful when you look at the gross margin perspective.
Operator: The next question is from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.
Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer: Robyn, just want to follow up on the delay in the MX 3D, are you stating that you expect to fulfill all of the backlog that you've had accumulating this quarter because of shortages in components and late orders that you'll be able to fulfill all of that into fourth quarter?
Robyn Denholm: In terms of those are in backlog, exiting Q3, yes. We've taken steps to increase the supply, obviously prior to this call in terms of the MX 3D components, because we obviously anticipate that to continue to ramp. So, we've increased the supply going forward of MX 3D specific components.
Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer: Lastly, with regards to the EX, great quarter there. Could you give us some color on the split of that revenue between carrier and enterprise, what's kind of driving it, and maybe just from a regional standpoint, where you are seeing more versus less traction with this solution?
Robyn Denholm: In terms of EX, we saw a 10% sequential increase and over 100% year-over-year. We actually saw a good enterprise quarter with EX this quarter. Last quarter, we talked about managed services wins and design wins on that front. We had a very healthy increase last quarter quarter-over-quarter with the service providers. This quarter it was largely enterprise that grew. So, we are pleased by that continuing momentum in the enterprise.
Kathleen Bela: We'd like to thank all of you for joining us today. We very much appreciate your participation in our call, and look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Juniper Networks Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Kathleen Bela, Vice President, Investor Relations for Juniper Networks. Thank you, you may begin.
Kathleen Bela: Thank you, Joe. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Here today are Kevin Johnson, Chief Executive Officer; and Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial Officer. A couple of housekeeping items before we begin. First, as a reminder, there is a slide deck that accompanies today's conference call. To access the slides, please go to the IR section of our website at juniper.net. This call will also be available to download as a podcast. For details, visit our website. If you're having any trouble accessing the slides, please try logging out and logging back in to the call and that should bring you back to the section on slides. With that, I would like to remind everyone that statements made during this call, concerning Juniper's business outlook, economic and market outlooks, future financial operating results and overall future prospects, are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including economic conditions, generally or in the networking industry, changes in overall technology spending, the network capacity requirements of service providers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply chain constraints, variation in the mix of products sold, customer perception and acceptance of our products, litigation and other factors listed in our most recent report filed on Form 10-K with the SEC. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances subsequently change after the date of this call. In discussing the financial results today, Robyn will first present results on a GAAP basis. And for purposes of today's discussion, we will also review non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why the management team considers non-GAAP information, a useful view of the company's financial result, please consult our 8-K filed with the SEC today. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results, please see today's press release. In general, non-GAAP results exclude certain non-recurring charges, amortization of purchased intangibles, other acquisition-related charges and expenses related to stock-based compensation. In today's call, Robyn will also be providing forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis. All guidance is forward-looking and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier. GAAP guidance measures are not available on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to the charges, which are excluded from the non-GAAP guidance estimates. Please note that today's call is scheduled to last for one hour, and please limit your questions to one per firm. With that, I will turn the call over to Kevin.
Kevin Johnson: Thanks, Kathleen, and welcome, everyone. Juniper had a strong second quarter, including record revenue and operating margin expansion. We're executing well against the 2010 operating principles we outlined at the beginning of the year. As we look towards the second half of the year, we intend to drive our growth agenda and build momentum going into 2011. I will comment briefly on the current business climate and some progress against our strategic agenda. I will then hand off to Robyn for more details on our results and guidance for Q3. The global economy continues to recover, yet the pace and trajectory of that recovery varied by geography. A number of economists now expect global GDP to grow in the low mid to single digits this year. In this economic climate, we have seen growing demand for our products and services and we delivered growth in all three theaters: EMEA, the Americas and Asia Pacific. Economic recovery in Europe continues to lag and the sovereign debt situation in southern Europe added to concerns about the pace of recovery across Europe. The U.S. continues to show modest GDP growth, though experts continue to debate the pace of the recovery. Asia continues to grow, yet economic recovery in Japan continues to lag. Global demand for networking is increasing as more traffic is being carried over the Internet. Computing is being centralized in massive data centers, and more people and businesses rely on digital devices connected to the network. Our investment in R&D and expanded routes to market support our growth agenda and position us well for spending cycle in some key scenarios, including mobility, video, security and cloud computing. We continue to win deals globally as customers embrace our vision for the new network. Our business grew 24% year-on-year, with Service Provider growing 21% and Enterprise growing 31%. We are expanding our footprint with Service Providers, and we are pleased with the growing demand for our MX 3D edge routers and SRX security platforms. We had a number of key design wins this quarter, including a significant win at Verizon with the MX 3D and SRX. We saw increased growth in our Mobile Secure Solution, based on the SRX platform. And we released Traffic Direct, a mobility solution on the MX 3D. We are on track for early trial of the second offering from the Falcon project, the Evolved Packet Core, at the end of this year. We completed the acquisition of Ankeena. And we are now securing design wins and generating revenue from both Traffic Direct and the Media Flow Solutions. We've made good progress globally in the Service Provider segment and I am particularly pleased with our growing relationship with large U.S.-based carriers and cable operators. For example, Comcast continues to expand its relationship with Juniper Networks, deploying Juniper's MX technology and T1600 core routers to support network expansion, including commercial and metro services. Comcast is also utilizing Juniper's EX Ethernet switches for scaling new services. Relative to the Enterprise, we continue to make headwinds in the segment with an expanded portfolio of offerings. Our comprehensive portfolio of routing, switching and security, all running Junos, and our architectural approach for the data center is resonating with customers. During the quarter, we launched our next-generation data center architecture called 321 that enables customers to connect large numbers of data center servers and storage devices in a way that improved the economics and the performance of these massive data centers. This is enabling growth in our EX business and positions us to expand momentum with our Stratus project. Our Stratus Project is on track. Earlier this year, we successfully completed first power on. We have fully verified the features in silicon, and we are now moving into the system test phase of the first wave of products coming from the Stratus Project. We expanded roster market in the Enterprise with partners, including IBM, large service providers and now Dell. Dell began shipping their OEM version of Juniper products, all running Junos, later this month. We are also seeing growing Enterprise opportunity with service providers, who are delivering managed services and on-premise solutions. Both Verizon and AT&T are strong partners, with Verizon recently recognized by us as Partner of the Year at our annual Partner Summit. In the Asia Pacific region, NEC is proving to be a great partner in the Enterprise segment. These are a few examples of the growing set of partners that are participating in our Enterprise growth agenda. We are fueling innovation with investment in organic R&D, complemented by an increased focus on M&A that creates customer and shareholder value. Our combination with Ankeena is representative of the type of acquisitions we expect to do more of. This will be combinations that are complementary to Junos and accelerate our vision for the new network. Looking ahead to the future, we maintain a positive outlook. Revenue momentum is expected to continue in the second half of the year. And we're positioned to take share in both the enterprise and service provider markets. The foundation is in place, yet we are not taking anything for granted. We have to be focused. We have to execute and we have to stay true to our operating principles. We have very good competitors and the macroeconomic recovery continues to have some twists and turns. We are focused on those investments that deliver long-term customer and shareholder value, while at the same time managing our expenses diligently, maintaining a strong balance sheet and generating healthy cash flows. I look forward to keeping you posted on our progress. And now, I'm going to turn it over to Robyn to dive into the financial results, as well as our outlook for the next quarter. Robyn?
Robyn Denholm: Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report that as a result of strong execution across our business and continued focus on our operating principles, we delivered record revenue and near-record operating profits in the quarter, all about underlying demand metrics was strong. Book-to-bill was well in excess of 1. Our products deferred revenue balance is healthy and pipelines exiting the quarter are robust. We also expanded operating margins, while continuing to invest in R&D, customer support and sales and marketing. We are well on track to delivering profitable growth in 2010 and making progress against our long-term revenue growth objective while expanding operating margin. I will provide more commentary on our outlook in a few moments. But first, as a reminder, all numbers include the Ankeena acquisition, which closed on April 19, 2010. We've seen increased customer demand to this technology, and we are very pleased with the way the integration is taking place. Now a review of the numbers. On a GAAP basis, total revenue for the second quarter was $978 million, up 7% sequentially and up 24% year-over-year. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.24 for the second quarter, compared to $0.30 per share in the first quarter of 2010 and $0.03 per share in the prior year second quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.30, an increase of $0.03 sequentially and up $0.11 compared to the prior-year second quarter. Let me now provide you with some color on revenue by region, business segments and markets. One of our operating principles for the year was that we expect the macroeconomic environment to continue to strengthen throughout the year, and that the price of recovery of standing by our customers will vary by geography. This is proving to be the case thus far, and for the quarter we saw improved levels of spending in both EMEA and APAC, with strong demand indicated in all three regions in both the Enterprise and Service Provider market. Looking at our revenue by region. For the quarter, Americas was approximately 50% of total revenue, EMEA was 30% and APAC was 20%. Americas revenue increased 1% sequentially and 26% year-over-year. We saw strength in regional service providers, content and cable service providers in the U.S. And in Latin America and Canada, we saw a strong sequential in year-over-year growth. EMEA revenue was up 10% sequentially and 25% year-over-year due to strength in Western Europe, Russia and the Middle East. APAC revenue increased 22% sequentially and 19% on a year-over-year basis, with sequential growth driven by Japan, Southeast Asia and greater China. From a pipeline perspective, we had significant design wins in Edge and Security with both wireline and wireless carriers in all three geographies. And in addition, we had core design wins in Japan and Southeast Asia. On a segment basis, total IPG revenue was $720 million, up $0.06 sequentially and 23% year-over-year. Total EX revenue was $92 million, up 20% sequentially. This includes product revenue of $88 million and was another strong proof point of our focused execution. MX had another strong quarter with product revenue of $149 million, up 7% sequentially. Included in this result is our first full quarter of revenue for the MX 3D at $24 million. This new product has generated increased customer interest and showcases our innovation agenda. SLT delivered record total revenue of $258 million, which represents an increase of 10% sequentially and 27% year-over-year. SRX product revenue grew 23% sequentially to almost $75 million. We had good mobile security wins in many large wireless carriers in the U.S., EMEA and APAC. Our strategy is investing in R&D, and our effectiveness in execution on our innovation roadmap has translated into significant revenue growth over the past year. Our most recent product lines, EX, MX and SRX, have generated impressive combined revenues of just over $1 billion in the last four quarters, an 89% growth since Q2 of '09. This is another proof point that our R&D growth agenda is hitting the mark with our customers. Looking more closely at the markets we address, Service Provider revenue is up 5% sequentially and up 21% year-over-year. This is due to a strong momentum in EX, MX and SRX and solid growth in key products. We now have 35 customers that will provide Juniper-powered managed services. More than double a year ago. This quarter, we saw good customer response with Traffic Direct, after its offering from Project Falcon, reporting our first revenue and a design win with a large mobile carrier in the Middle East. Enterprise revenue was up 12% sequentially and up 31% year-over-year. This strong performance reflects our continued market penetration with our switching, routing and security portfolio. We expanded our switching and routing footprint in the financial services and government verticals. For the quarter, Service Provider revenue was 63% and Enterprise revenue was 37% of total revenue. On a non-GAAP basis, total gross margin for the quarter was 67.9% of revenue, which is at the high end of our long-term target model range of 66% to 68%. Product gross margins was 70.2% of revenue, up from 69.3% in the third quarter 2010. And this was due to better product mix and a decrease in manufacturing costs. Service gross margins were 59.3% of revenues, compared to 61% in the first quarter of 2010. This change was due to service mix and [indiscernible] investments in our customer support organization. Moving on to our operating expenses. For Q2, non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $431 million or 44% of revenue. Relative to the first quarter, operating expenses increased $26 million, a decrease slightly as a percentage of revenue. Year-over-year, operating expenses were up $62 million or $0.17 due to an increase in variable compensation and investments in new product development and expanding routes to market. R&D expenses were $206 million or 21% of revenue, up $16 million compared to the first quarter. This was due to ramping up headcount and prototype expenses to support key projects, including Falcon and Stratus, which are in advanced stages of development, as well as R&D expense from the Ankeena acquisition. Sales and marketing expenses totaled $187 million or 19.1% of revenue, a $7 million increase sequentially. As we continue to invest in sales and marketing program to support our go-to-market plan. G&A expenses totaled $38 million or 3.9% of revenue. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 23.9%, an increase of 70 basis points sequentially. This reflects continued execution against our operating principle of managing expenses while strategically utilizing resources in key growth areas. I am pleased with our progress towards our long-term operating margin goal of 25% or higher. Looking at operating margins by segment, IPG operating margin was 25.2% compared to 26% in the first quarter. As a reminder, our investments in both EX and Project Stratus, as well as Falcon, are included within the IPG segment. SLT operating margin was a record 20.4% compared to 15% in the first quarter. This is the first time we have broken through the 20% level and reflects a fabulous effort by the team. This is a result of efficient R&D execution on the product roadmap and aligning the sales and marketing resources to drive revenue growth. Turning to the bottom line, Juniper posted non-GAAP net income of $164 million for the quarter, up 12% sequentially and up 58% from year-over-year. The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 31.1%, the non-GAAP income tax rate for the quarter was 30.2%. Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with approximately $2.7 billion in total cash and investments, which was down slightly quarter-over-quarter. We are pleased with our continued strength in cash generation. For the second quarter of 2010, Juniper generated cash from operations of $221 million. During the quarter, we also repurchased 6.5 million shares at an average cost of $27.33 per share or approximately $177 million. Our cash flow also reflects $64 million of net cash out in connection with the Ankeena Networks acquisition. On a housekeeping note, we want to make investors aware that we intend to file a new universal shelf registration of $1.5 billion with the SEC in the next couple of weeks. This filing replaces our prior shelf, which has expired. The filing is consistent with our desire to maintain financial flexibility. Our weighted average shares outstanding for the second quarter were 539 million shares on a diluted non-GAAP basis, up 2 million shares from the prior quarter. CapEx, consistent with prior quarters, totaled $45 million and depreciation and amortization was $37 million. DSO improved to 36 days compared to 40 days in the first quarter and well within our normal historical range. Total deferred revenue was a healthy $768 million. Sequentially, product deferred revenue was down 5% or approximately $13 million. As a reminder, product deferred revenue is generally made up of two major elements: Channel revenue deferrals, including other sell-through revenues and future features of projects. For Q2 the future feature balance of deferred revenue was roughly flat with the first quarter. Services deferred revenue decreased by 2% or approximately $9 million, which is typical for the fiscal second quarter. We ended the quarter with headcount of 7,732, an increase of 279 from the first quarter. This increase was due to investment in R&D, sales and marketing and customer service headcount. We also added approximately 65 new employees from the Ankeena acquisition. Now let's turn to our guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis except for revenue and share count. As we outlined at our financial Analyst Day in February, we are on a multi-year growth agenda. Our investments in R&D, our M&A strategy and our go-to-market plan are all aimed at delivering against our long-term model of 20% or higher revenue growth and 25% or higher operating margin. As we continue to execute on our operating principles for 2010, we are confident that for 2010, our top line growth will be consistent with our long-term model. For the September quarter, we are expecting revenue of $1.02 billion, plus or minus $20 million. Gross margins for the third quarter are expected to range between 66% and 68%. We expect operating expenses to remain roughly flat as a percent of revenue, an increase on an actual basis. We will focus our investments in sales and marketing and R&D to support projects that are coming to market soon and to capture the market opportunities ahead. These investments are consistent with the plan we outlined at our financial analyst meeting earlier this year. Operating margin for the third quarter is expected to be approximately 23.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points. For the full year, we remain committed to growing our revenues faster than our operating expenses, resulting in profitable growth for the company. This would result in the third quarter non-GAAP EPS of between $0.30 and $0.32 and assumes a flat share count and tax rate of approximately 31%. In summary, I'm very pleased with our results this quarter. We continue to make good progress on our long-term model objective, including revenue growth, improved operating margin and operational excellence. I want to thank our employees for their continued dedication to innovation and our growth agenda. We are confident of capturing the market opportunity ahead of us and delivering profitable growth in 2010. Now with that, I'll hand it over to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ehud Gelblum with Morgan Stanley.
Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley: Robyn, in looking at the guidance top line of 10% 20% and then kind of correlating that with your operating margin and EPS guidance, should we be assuming that sequentially, the operating margin clearly sort of is down sort of from where it is here to get into that, call it, $0.31 at the midpoint on that 10% 20% or should we be looking -- if the mix end up being basically roughly, how you think it is similar to this quarter, I was just wondering, how do we get into that range? I would have ended up with a little bit higher of a range given the revenue.
Robyn Denholm: Yes. So the way we are calibrating the operating margin at the high end, we should be roughly flat in terms of operating margin. So with the -- at the 10 40 level, 23.9%, 24% operating margin is what we're expecting at that level. And clearly, we were quite high in our long-term model range for growth margin this quarter. So if you calibrate in terms of 66% to 68%, which is our sort of targeted model for next quarter, then that will help with the model in terms of operating margin.
Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley: Can you give us a hint as to how large Ankeena was this quarter and how much that'll be contributing to Q3 and Q4, was it negligible or something we can just count on two hands?
Robyn Denholm: Yes. So in terms of the overall integration of Ankeena, we're very pleased with the way that has gone. In terms of revenue, it's actually very nominal for the quarter. We are very pleased with the customer dialogue we've been having and in terms of the increased importance of video to a customer conversations and content distribution, et cetera. So it helps with all of those conversations. But in terms of pure revenue, it's very small for the quarter.
Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley: Very small, meaning $5 million or less?
Robyn Denholm: Very small.
Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley: And then finally, and then you said, I just want to make sure I understood you correctly you said 2010 on a revenue model, you said 2010 will be consistent with your long-term model of 20% growth. Given that you've now given guidance for Q3, which comes out to at your midpoint of 10%, 20% comes out to about 23-ish, 23.5 percentage growth. How should we read Q4 that it should kind of flow in such that the full year ends up being consistent with 20%, that will be deceleration from the last two quarters or that we should look at Q4 sort of being continuation off of what we've seen the last couple of quarters?
Robyn Denholm: Yes. I think in terms of the long-term operating model, our target is 20% or higher. And so for this year, we believe we will be in that range, 20% or higher.
Operator: The next question is from Troy Jensen with Piper Jaffray.
Troy Jensen - Piper Jaffray Companies: For Robyn, your gross margin has gone up four consecutive quarters now, at being at 67.9%. I mean, seems like the low end of the range is really unachievable. I mean what would it take for it to get down to that level assuming product mix and is there a point in the future were you guys may reassess your gross margin targets?
Robyn Denholm: In terms of the model range, it's in a good range for us over the last couple of years. I think that is the right range for us. There are very many factors in terms of what goes into the gross margin composition, as you know. And I went through a number of those at the financial analyst meeting. I'm pleased with the execution, both in terms of the sales side and also in terms of the operation group in terms of delivering quarter-over-quarter cost reduction. I'm also pleased with the investments that we're making on the Services side. As that business grows, positioning architecture services and also the state's part [ph] (41:59) to ensure that we have the right resources closest to the customer to ensure that we've got the right customer environment I think is key.
Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley: Was there any 10% customers in the quarter and would you expect to have any in either at the second or any of the remaining two quarters of the year?
Robyn Denholm: So there were no 10% customers in the quarter. And we'll see how Q3 and Q4 pan out in terms of who will be a 10% customer in those periods.
Operator: The next question is from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets Corporation: Can you help us understand the moving dynamics within North American telcos, notably AT&T and Verizon, maybe the trends in business there? Should we factor in sequential growth in the near term with these key customers and then a sharp bounce in the fourth quarter? And also, Robyn, when we factor in your healthy pipeline, are you assuming a similar deal closure rate in 3Q as you did in 2Q and as linearity become more a factor in the third quarter?
Kevin Johnson: I'll take the first question and I'll hand off to Robyn for the second question. Clearly, we're pleased with our relationship with large Tier 1 carriers in North America and the U.S. And certainly, when you look at some of historical patterns, capital spending, in fact, I looked just at, certainly, the top two service providers in the U.S., spending of capital in 2009, range from 53% to 57% of their capital spend in the second half of the year. And so we are -- we do anticipate that there would be, perhaps, some uptick in spending in the second half of the year. But we haven't quantified that. Certainly, our guidance for Q3 reflects the view of what we think will happen. And we are planning for a bigger second half than we had in the first half with the larger Tier 1 service providers.
Robyn Denholm: Yes. And I think in terms of healthy pipeline, the thing that I was pleased about was it's both wireless, wireline content cable service providers. So it's pretty universal, and it's also pretty good across all of the geographies as well. So we conduct our quarterly business reviews, Kevin and I, and it was very good in terms of health of the pipeline.
Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets Corporation: And closure rate, Robyn?
Robyn Denholm: So our closure rate, varies by geography and the size of the deal. But consistent with our recent past in terms of closure rates, I think it's fair enough.
Operator: The next question is from Nikos Theodosopoulos from UBS.
Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS Investment Bank: I wanted to ask one question on the deferred revenue. I think you made a comment that, Robyn, you made a comment that Services deferred was down in the second quarter. I don't get a sense that, that's a seasonal trend. So maybe if you can just elaborate on that? And then the second question I have is there's been some concern in general about public sector spending, do you have any comment on whether you're seeing any change in the outlook for that portion of your business and if you can quantify it?
Robyn Denholm: I'll cover the first part of the question and I'll hand over to Kevin for the second. So in terms of deferred revenue, it was down quarter-over-quarter but it is still a very healthy balance overall. So on the product side, I commented in the prepared remarks that there are basically two parts to the product deferred revenue. The channel and other sell-through revenue, which was actually the piece that was down in the quarter and the future features, which was roughly flat with the first quarter. In terms of Services, the timing of bookings of multi-year deals influences that. And so when I look at that and I look at sequential patterns as bookings in the first quarter, then that is a normal sort of pattern for us in terms of the second quarter.
Kevin Johnson: Nikos, on the second question about concern in public sector, I think the concern is limited to the U.S. public sector. And it's really focused on the fact that U.S. Federal budget approvals and Congress working through getting final approval for that in this quarter. In Q3, it is the fiscal fourth quarter of the U.S. Federal government. And so depending on how Congress and the budgeting decisions unfold in the U.S. public sector, that could have implications on Enterprise revenue in the U.S., of which public sector is a part of. We think in terms of the range of guidance we've provided, we have enough range to reflect the fact that if there's some downside there, we're going to work hard and do what we can but it is a noted risk.
Operator: The next question is from Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo.
Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Two questions. First, are you seeing anything from a gross margin perspective that would suggest the gross margins would be down during Q3? And maybe you can elaborate on whether or not you may use current strength to offer some additional discounts to drive share. And then from an operating margin perspective, infrastructure operating margins, pre-recession, typically stood at 28% to 30%. Is this the right level to be thinking about once revenue for the EX Switch and Project Falcon reach scale? And within SLT, can you help us understand what do you think about as far as the sustainable operating margin go for this business? Can you reach 25%? Or shall we be thinking about current levels as a more sustainable range?
Robyn Denholm: Okay, Jess. I think I can remember most of the parts of the question, but let me go back to the first one which is on gross margin. So the gross margin remains 66% to 68%. That is the range that we've been operating in for some time now. There is various influences on that. I do not see anything at this point that would lead us to believe that we're going to be outside of that range. It will be in that range. That's what we typically see at the beginning of the quarter. So I'm comfortable with that as the Q3 guidance. What was the second part?
Kevin Johnson: The second question, let me take a shot at that. The second question, Jess, was -- I'll paraphrase it as, "Do we believe the 25% operating margin is a sustainable margin to achieve?" And the answer is we do. As we outlined in the financial analyst meeting, we actually gave a range of R&D as a percent of revenue, sales and marketing as a percent of revenue and G&A as a percent of revenue. And that 25% operating margin was kind of in the center of those ranges. If you look at this quarter, R&D as a percentage of revenues is up about 21%, which is probably about two points higher than the high end that we outlined at the analyst meeting. And I think that's because we're in the core of some significant R&D on projects Stratus and the Falcon project, which are significant elements of our growth agenda going forward. So we believe that the investments we're making in R&D are clearly linked to our multi-year growth agenda. Yet getting the margin expansion and certainly sustaining it at the 25% or higher really is a function of us continuing to break through and get the scale economics, which you see us starting to get in the enterprise. And so, look, as we outlined at the analyst meeting, we still got strong conviction that, that is the multi-year plan that we're pursuing. We think 25% or higher operating margins are certainly achievable and sustainable.
Operator: The next question is from Tal Liani with Bank of America.
Tal Liani - BofA Merrill Lynch: I have three quick questions. The first one is about the impact of the euro that was over 10% change versus the dollar. And can you discuss pricing pressure or discounting? The second question is about the impact of the accounting change on deferred revenues. Last quarter, you changed the accounting. I don't know whether it does or it doesn't have any impact from deferred revenues? And the third question is just Europe. Can you discuss the environment in Europe overall? You made some comments about the economy. Maybe you can make some comments about what you're seeing with your customers?
Robyn Denholm: So I'll take the first two parts of the question, and I'll hand over to Kevin for the last. So in terms of the impact of the euro, as a reminder, because we're working through distributors and other partners throughout the world, we actually bill in U.S. dollars in Europe by and large. So at the moment, there is obviously no direct impact from the effect of the euro. Clearly, overtime, if the U.S. stays where it is, we're watching very closely in terms of competitive pressures or anything else in terms of euro, or also whether or not any of the credit crisis over there or sovereign debt actually has an impact on the business. In enterprise, we saw a little bit in terms of demand pausing, if you like, in some parts of Southern Europe. But in the rest of Europe, the business was very strong as you saw, so I was pleased with that. In terms of the accounting change, so as we expected, for the second quarter, the absolute dollar amount was up compared to the first quarter. We were expecting that in terms of what we recognize under the new accounting rules. But the comment that I made in terms of deferred revenue, the only piece that is fixed in terms of deferred revenue on the product side is the future feature area, and that was flat with the first quarter. So really, that piece on the balance sheet is solid. The piece that actually declined was the channel and other filter revenue, which is what you would expect to happen as the business environment improves.
Kevin Johnson: Yes, and on the third element of it, it's a little bit more color on Europe. I was in Europe a few weeks ago with a team calling on customers and visited several countries. And consistent with my comments, I think generally, the economic recovery in Europe is lagging, and it certainly is visible. That said, I think in the quarter, we demonstrated still some strong growth both in service provider and in enterprise segments. Southern Europe, when you look at the sovereign debt situation in Southern Europe, we did have evidence that showed some enterprise customers in Southern Europe where maybe being somewhat baffled or deferring some of their projects, which slowed our enterprise growth in Southern Europe. Our service provider growth though in Southern Europe maintained some strength and with some good relationships with customers and some new design wins there. So it's a little bit of a mixed bag in Southern Europe. Certainly, the question is if I think today, probably there are less concerns about what Europe's going to do about the sovereign debt crisis than there were a couple of months ago, so there's more certainty there. And hopefully, that translates to continued confidence and leads to more signs of economic recovery. That said, we continue to feel like we've got good relationships and a good pipeline on the Service Provider business. We continue to build our Enterprise business in Europe. Yet, I think the European economic situation, that too, should be flagged as a risk. -
Tal Liani - BofA Merrill Lynch: Maybe just quick follow up on the deferred revenue question I had. The short-term deferred revenues went down by $75 million, but the long-term deferred revenues went up and recovered about 2/3 of the decline. Can you discuss the differences between short-term and long-term trends?
Robyn Denholm: So short term and long term is purely a mathematical date-driven exercise. So those that we expect to recognize within 12 months from the printed date of the quarter are in short term, and those that are over the 12 months are the long term. It's purely a date-driven exercise.
Operator: The next question is from Simon Leopold with Morgan Keegan.
Simon Leopold - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.: I wanted to first ask a little bit about the segment detail because you've given us enough disclosures that process elimination tells us about the E Series, M Series and T products, which look like they were relatively flat sequentially. So I just want to check on what you see going on within those product groups in terms of shifts and mix? I'd presume that the E Series is trending down given the links to Verizon and FiOS but the M Series is probably getting a little bit cannibalized by the MX, but I want to see if those assumptions are correct.
Robyn Denholm: So in terms of sequential growth, which I think was your question, Simon. So EX, MX and SRX obviously, you've got those numbers. T was also up as I mentioned in the commentary. Service was also up and then other, if you net everything else that's in the product categories, they were also up. And so basically, they were all up as a total portfolio. So we think that, that's actually good. The fact that our new products or newer platforms are actually generating $1 billion of revenue in the last four quarters and they're actually growing very nicely year-over-year. They're up nearly 90% as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, and that's a real testament to the value of the R&D that we're doing as we go forward.
Simon Leopold - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.: And to follow up, you mentioned in the prepared remarks your expectation that you'd gain market share in both Enterprise and Service Provider. I think the Enterprise, the bar is set pretty low given that you're relatively new to that market. Service Providers seems a little bit more challenging. So if you could maybe give us some more thoughts on how you're going to take that market share with strategy you're using and which products or applications you expect to help you in that?
Kevin Johnson: Yes, thanks for the question, Simon. I think that in the Service Provider segment, certainly, the big trends and things we see are related to mobility and video. And we've seen very strong uptake on Mobile Secure, our security platform in major wireless carriers globally. And that's been a big solution and a big value proposition to them. That combined with the progress that we're making with MX 3D as a unified edge router for both fixed and mobile and the fact that many service providers architecturally are looking to converge those networks to where they're carrying that Internet traffic on a single network. That, combined with the fact that the MX 3D is programmable and the deliverables that we have for the Falcon project is something that, I think, is generating significant interest and dialogue with our customers. So consistent with what we outlined at the analyst meeting, it really is the Junos as a single operating system, programmable operating system running on our platform, but technologies is helping customers, not only change the economics through reducing the cost per bit, but also enabling new business models, and it's delivering a better user experience. And so we continue to focus on that value proposition.
Operator: The next question is from Jeff Kvaal with Barclays Capital.
Jeffrey Kvaal - Barclays Capital: I was wondering if we could delve back into the deferred revenue question for a minute, specifically the channel and sell through. Could you, Robyn, perhaps clarify for us exactly how that process works? And I guess superficially, one could read the lower channel, deferred revenue as better sell through? But on the other hand, maybe we worry the channel is taking less inventory because they're worried about the recession?
Robyn Denholm: Yes, I wouldn't take it as the latter. It's actually because of the fact that there is more demand out there, and that category of revenue is what we do take on a sell-through basis.
Jeffrey Kvaal - Barclays Capital: And then Kevin, for you, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you were seeing in the mobile space? Obviously, that's heated up and the Evolved Packet Core is -- or carriers are making decisions there. If you could give us a little bit of color on how those -- where carriers are in the decision-making process and how your relationship with Ericsson is faring? That would be very helpful.
Kevin Johnson: I guess the first comment I would make is that every wireless provider on a global basis is perhaps in a different stage of the migration from 2G to 3G to LTE and has their own set of business plans in terms of how they're doing that. What is consistent though is that mobile Internet is growing. And it's growing because of the growth in smart phones and certainly, led by the work Apple has done with the iPhone and Google has done with Android and iPad. There's just more of these digital devices driving demand for mobile Internet. That's a very consistent perspective on a global basis. And so number one, we're working with these wireless providers to really help to understand their roadmap in terms of how they're enabling solutions and the ability to carry that traffic economically and provide a great experience for their customer base, and that's number one. Second of all, when you look at Ericsson's GGSN that runs on Junos, it continues to do well in the market, and so we're pleased with our partnership in that regard with Ericsson.
Operator: The next question is from Jeff Evenson with Sanford Bernstein.
Jeffrey Evenson - Bernstein Research: I was wondering if you could give us some color on a couple of your growth initiatives? First, around the managed services. You talked about the number of customers going up to 35. I'd be curious as to what percentage of these or percentage of your financial relationships in these areas are around security? And then for customers who've already sold it, you've already sold to, how they're coming back and reordering the product? And the second area I'd like to hear about is just a little bit of an update on the investment you made in ADVA and where that might go?
Kevin Johnson: On the question about managed services, a number of large service providers see this certainly as a growth opportunity for their business, to build out data centers and provide a managed services capability to enterprise customers. It aligns with not only the network infrastructure they have in place but their operational expertise in terms of running large infrastructure-related businesses. And so in our partnership with large service providers, we've got a very specific team and set of resources that are building those relationships with those service providers who are building a managed services business. And that relationship involves us sharing our architecture with them around data center, collapsing layers in the data center going from three to two and to one with Stratus. It involves our technology across routing, switching and security, all running Junos. That involves us helping them find efficient ways to manage the operating expenses using Junos Space. And it certainly also provides them capability to provide user secure SSL VPN with Junos Pulse. And so the relationship is very broad in terms of the product set. And on a consistent basis, these service providers see this as a growth opportunity for them. Your specific question is how many of these relate to security. Well, to have a successful managed services business, you have to have a secure environment or enterprise customers will not turn over their processing and data and connections to run in your managed services. So security is at the heart of being able to be in that business. Regarding the relationship with ADVA and the investment piece, at the analyst meeting, I think Stefan and Pradeep conducted a session where they sort of took you through a view of the role that we saw optical playing in packets switch, what we are looking at with our routing technology. And I think there are many, many players in optical out there and ADVA is one of them, and we're pleased to have a relationship with them. But it relates to the partnerships that we're building in optical as it helps shape our agenda for our routing technology and where that's going in the future.
Operator: The next question is from Brent Bracelin with Pacific Crest Securities.
Brent Bracelin - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc.: First, really, is follow up on the service provider demand trends. If I look at your segment, four of the last five quarters, Enterprise has grown faster than the Service Provider business. I guess my question here is as you look at the Q3 pipeline, how would you characterize the Service Provider activity? Is it trending in line with kind of the historical trends that you saw in the past year and through Q3 given the slow, kind of sluggish start to the year? Do you see that the Service Provider pace of order is starting to pick up to maybe above seasonal trends in Q3? Any sort of additional color there would be helpful.
Robyn Denholm: So I think, Brent, in terms of the Service Provider trends, obviously, we saw a good growth this quarter, especially in EMEA and in APAC. And we think that was a good trend, with our Service Provider and our Enterprise customers actually increasing their demand in both geographies. So in terms of going forward, Kevin talked about what we see specifically with our U.S. service provider customers where their CapEx has tended to be more back-end loaded historically. So we don't expect that to be different this year. We are anticipating that in the second half. And our guidance for Q3 reflects, in terms of the range, the difference in what their pattern could be in Q3 or Q4.
Kevin Johnson: Just to add to Robyn's comments, Brent, I think when we look at the second half of 2010, and I think the pipeline and opportunities we see in the service provider are very good. The real question, when you look at Q3, is how much of that pipeline will land in Q3 versus Q4? In 2009, obviously, we had a very big Q4 driven by Service Providers. And there's a question of will that start to smooth out to see a stronger Q3 and still a strong but maybe not as strong as Q4? Can some of that revenue be blended across Q3 and Q4? We'll have to see how that unfolds later in the quarter.
Robyn Denholm: Yes. The one other thing I'd add was in this quarter, particularly in the U.S., we saw a continued spending by the regional carriers and the content and cable sector, which are called out specifically because it is important from a diversification perspective overall in terms of the Service Provider business longer term.
Brent Bracelin - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc.: Then just one clarification. Kevin, at the beginning of the conference call here, you did talk about kind of an increased focus on M&A given the backdrop of a kind of renewed shelf offering. Could you just remind us kind of what type of acquisition that would be ideal that you're looking at? And potentially, would you consider a large acquisition?
Kevin Johnson: Yes. First of all, I would say that we will consider a range of things. But the ones that are preferred, the ones that are really sort of on the radar screen, I would characterize as very similar to Ankeena. There are things that are based on intellectual property and talent that's complementary to Junos, that helps us accelerate our vision for the new network, things that we believe we can do a good job of integrating and managing the integration and things of that will translate to revenue and revenue growth fairly quickly. So that said, I think the best way to characterize it is just point to Ankeena as one example, and of what I think is probably the more likely scenarios to expect.
Operator: The next question is from Paul Mansky with Canaccord Adams.
Paul Mansky - Canaccord Genuity: I wanted to talk a little about EX, specifically kind of expectations as you go on to the back years, you have the second of your two major OEMs looking like they're prepared to launch?
Kevin Johnson: And so the question is in the second half of this year or longer term, Paul?
Paul Mansky - Canaccord Genuity: Second half of this year. Specifically, I just wanted to get, I think, kind of get the sense vis-a-vis cadence in or around that ramp of those OEM relationships?
Kevin Johnson: Yes. I think certainly, we had achieved some revenue on the EX through the OEM relationships, but we still -- I wouldn't discount all the relationships that we have with partners that are reselling EX. So let me just talk about EX as a total product offering whether it comes through OEM or through resale. Number one, I think the portfolio that we've assembled, routing, switching, security, running Junos, the role of Junos Space and the role of Junos Pulse, the data center architecture of 321, that value proposition is one that we are communicating more broadly to more enterprise customers and it's one that's resonating. Our job is to help make sure that we've done the right job on R&D to create the right solution set and that we create demand in the market. And that's what we've been very focused on doing. And in doing that, that creates more opportunity for our partners to then sell into that demand that we're creating, and as they do that creates more demand and more awareness. And so I think we are executing against our plan to continue to do that. I think that we continue to make good progress relative to that plan. My expectation is as we do that, we continue to reach a point where we hit a tipping point where then awareness hits a certain point and that demand creation part has taken place, and then there's just a lot of partners fulfilling opportunity. I don't think we've hit that tipping point yet, but I do think we're a step closer. I look at the design wins, I look at the level of dialogue we're having, I look at the energy behind our partners, I participated in the Americas Region Partner Summit this last quarter, and there's just a lot of energy from our partners: Dell, IBM, Verizon and many, many other partners on a global basis. So look, our long-term growth agenda, we've got to grow the Enterprise, I think, at the analyst meeting, we've got to grow our Enterprise segment 25% plus higher over this period to drive that. Certainly, the EX plays a big part of that, and so it is core to the growth agenda.
Operator: The next question is from Sanjiv Wadhwani with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Sanjiv Wadhwani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Robyn, in terms of when you gave guidance for Q2, you had mentioned that the swing factor over there was going to be timing of service provider orders. Given that you came in at the high end of your guidance, can you talk about whether this was one or two carriers coming in or was it multiple carriers? And then second question on the head count, you had a pretty steep ramp even if you x out Ankeena, about 215-odd people, were they skewed on the R&D side or sales and marketing? Any color there would be helpful.
Robyn Denholm: So on the carrier spending, when we gave the guidance for Q2, we were expecting that range to be variable with service provider spending. So in terms of how the quarter unfolded, it did unfold as we expected. Obviously, we overachieved relative to our guidance. But in terms of service provider, it was within the range that we gave you on the Q1 call. So in terms of headcount, yes, the headcount was up. The main areas, as we said, they're about at the 65 headcount as a result of Ankeena, approximately 65. And then the rest were primarily R&D for the projects that we've talked about in terms of R&D, plus customer service and support. So those are the three categories. There was a little bit in sales and marketing, but it was still mainly the other categories.
Operator: The next question is from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Just a question on margins. Your product gross margins are now at the highest level in the last two years and at the same time, we've seen fiscals margins decline in the last couple of quarters. So just curious if you can walk us through some of the reasons for that expansion? How much of that has been cyclical versus structural, and in particular, are some of the newer products like the SRX or the MX 3D higher margin? And is that also the case for things like Falcon and Media Flow? And is that contributing to the expansion?
Robyn Denholm: So in terms of the overall product margin, we were very pleased with the rate of growth margin on products. In terms of product mix, the security products had very good margins relative to the range of margins that we have. So obviously, that helps. You've seen how SLT has become profitable and now has broken through the 20% level. Their gross margin structure is very healthy. So in terms of other areas, yes, the MX 3D is a higher gross margin product for us. It's our silicone, our IP. So obviously, that contributes to favorable gross margin in terms of mix. In terms of structural areas, the operations team has been doing a very good job in terms of continuing, just grinding away at the cost. And as I mentioned at the financial analyst meeting, there are two sides to the equation on the gross margin side, and cost is definitely an area that the team's very focused on driving.
Kevin Johnson: Yes, let me just add one or two other comments to what Robyn said. I think certainly, our investments in silicone, I think is significant in terms of the value it creates for customers and for shareholders. And that the value for customers is being able to solve these kinds of networking problems at scale that we think is unique, and that we have differentiated position in the market, which allows us to have higher gross margins in some of those areas. The second piece is we're building out software businesses. You asked the question of Media Flow and Falcon. If I look at Media Flow, that's a software business. If I look at Falcon, it's a software business. If I look at Junos Space, it's a software business. If I look at Junos Pulse, it's a Software business. These software businesses have much higher gross margins, certainly, than our Systems business. And we love our Systems business, but we're going to complement our Systems business with the Software business. Certainly, the revenue for Media Flow was immaterial this quarter, but over time, as we're successful building these software businesses, that should also be something that provides us some lift or ability to improve product gross margins as that mix shifts.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: I guess, Robyn, for you on deferred revenue. I want you to zero in on the product deferred revenue that's related to the future features and projects and that was flat in the quarter. Why would that be flat when you're continuing to grow on a sequential basis going forward? And in particular, how should we think about that when your book to bill was well over one?
Robyn Denholm: So in terms of future features, so in terms of the stuff that has been on the balance sheet under the old rules, over the next four to six quarters, we expect that to actually be recognized. So that is normal flow of future feature activity. In terms of the stuff that's being put onto the balance sheet, that is the change. So under the new rules, the deferral still happens, the amount of the deferrals on 100% of the activity, it is the amount that's represented by the features that we have yet to bring to market. So but net-net in the quarter, I want to be very clear, that part was flat. So there was no reduction in the deferred revenue associated with future features, even though the right at which we were putting it on was at a lower percentage of the total deal. So that does actually explain, in terms of the increased activity, you are seeing that because the amount was flat in the quarter. And we expect that to be the case over the next four quarters.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Is there a way to quantify that? I think last quarter was about $25 million that would have been part of deferred under the old rule. Should we think about it as a similar amount this quarter?
Robyn Denholm: No. I did say in the prepared remarks that it was actually higher this quarter. When we publish the 10-Q, we're going to give you quite a bit of detail in terms of the various components and that type of things. But the amount in absolute dollars was actually higher the last quarter, which is what we were expecting.
Operator: Our next question is from Rod Hall with JPMorgan.
Rod Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Just quickly, can you guys comment on component shortages, whether that's expected to affect your ability to deliver in the next couple of quarters? Just real quickly since a lot of other people are talking about that. And then just big picture on the 20% growth target, can you give us some idea what the plus or minus range on that is, in your own minds? And also just clarify whether that's an organic growth target?
Robyn Denholm: So I'll handle the component question. So in any quarter, you always have various components that might be in higher or lower demand situations. There's no question, our operations team, they're doing a phenomenal job in an environment where our demand has upticked. They've actually been able to meet that demand. So we're very pleased with what we've been doing in that area.
Kevin Johnson: Yes, just let me add on the components piece. It's also fair to say that in the industry in 2009, a lot of the suppliers had reduced inventories and reduced manufacturing capability. Now as demand is returning, we do think that the industry is seeing some pressure on suppliers for those components. We work very hard to ensure that the component shortages don't affect our ability, but we acknowledge that in our discussion with suppliers and doing that work, clearly, there is some pressures in the industry, overall, on components.
Kathleen Bela: And that is all the time we have today. We'd like to thank you all for joining our conference call and we look forward to updating you next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Juniper Networks first quarter 2010 earnings results conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Ms. Kathleen Bela, Vice President of Investor Relations for Juniper Networks. Thank you. Ms. Bela, you may begin.
Kathleen Bela: Thank you, Manny. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Here today are Kevin Johnson, Chief Executive Officer and Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial Officer. A couple of housekeeping items before we begin. First, as a reminder there is a slide deck that accompanies today’s conference call. To access the slides please go to the IR section of our website at juniper.net. Also, we have included a full look in to our geographic revenue distribution in our slide deck. This call will be available to download as a podcast. For details, visit our website. I'm also pleased to announce that starting today, you can follow Juniper IR on Twitter at BelaJNPR. Over the next few weeks, the IR group will be posting items to our corporate blogs and network ahead and we would of course love to hear your input on how best to use social media to communicate with you. With that, I would like to remind everyone that statements made during this call concerning Juniper’s business outlook, economic and market outlook, future financial operating results, and overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors including economic conditions generally or in the networking industry, changes in overall technology spending, the network capacity requirements of service providers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply chain constraints, variation in the mix of products sold, customer perception and acceptance of our products, litigation, and other factors listed in our most recent report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances subsequently change after the date of this call. In discussing the financial results today, Robyn will first present results on a GAAP basis. And for purposes of today’s discussion, we will also review non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why the management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company’s financial results, please consult our 8-K filed with the SEC. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results, please see today’s press release. In general, non-GAAP results exclude certain non-recurring charges, amortization of purchased intangibles, other acquisition related charges, and expenses related to stock-based compensation. In today’s call, Robyn will also be providing forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis. All guidance is forward-looking and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier. GAAP guidance measures are not available on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to the charges which are generally excluded from the non-GAAP guidance estimates. Please note that today’s call is scheduled to last for one hour and please limit your questions to one per firm. With that, I will turn the call over to Kevin.
Kevin Johnson: Thanks, Kathleen and thanks, everyone for joining us today. Our first quarter results reflect continued good execution throughout the company as we establish a solid foundation for growth. On our January call and at the February Financial Analyst Meeting, we laid out a set of operating principles for the year. Primary among them is that we see 2010 as a year of growth. The performance we are reporting today reinforces our posture for growth and increases our conviction of that view as we look ahead. The economic environment continues to evolve constructively for us overall and as we commented in the past, the pace and trajectory of the recovery will vary by geography. We continue to see the U.S. economic situation improving with Western Europe economic indicators somewhat less favorable than those of the U.S. Macroeconomic indicators in Asia remain strong with the exception of Japan. And at a global level, demand for high performance networking continues to grow and we are seeing good momentum in critical areas of the business. Particularly, with the traction we are gaining in new products and our efforts to expand routes to market. In addition to driving growth, we are also evolving our internal processes, systems, and execution capability. We are aggressively pursuing the opportunities presented by the transformation of the network and at the same time, we are strengthening our organization to best support our growth objectives, both near and long term. Our entire company has done a great job embracing this transformation, staying focused, and delivering financially for our shareholders. I'll give more details on the actions we are taking internally, but first, let's take a look at the business environment, starting with the service provider market. After a very strong finish to Q4 of 2009, our outlook for the first quarter implied a slight quarter-on-quarter contraction of carrier spending. Our Q1 results was in line with that expectation. As we enter Q2, we are already seeing positive signs in the pipeline of U.S. carrier for the upcoming quarter and for the year. We were also pleased to see the resumption in investments during the quarter by our content service provider customers. In short, we expect it to be a good year for service provider spending overall and our outlook supports that. Now, this quarter, we continue to make progress in core routing as we secured five new customer wins for the TX Matrix Plus; we reaffirmed our leadership in 100-Gig Ethernet networking during a trial that covered a 1,000 mile, optically amplified section of the Verizon network; we announced advances in silicon that will enable customers to upgrade their existing T Series Core Routers to a system capacity of 4 terabits per second without service interruption. We believe the combination of increased demand for core routing, share gains we observed in Q4 of 2009, innovation in 100-Gig Ethernet trial, advances in silicon, and new customer adoption of our TX Matrix Plus is positive signs for our business in core routing. In the area of edge routing, we were pleased with the customer response to the MX 3D and we are seeing some strong early bookings of the dense 10-Gig Ethernet line card, as well as several beta trials of the low-end MX80. We have expanded our solutions footprint into the areas of mobility and video. Mobility and video represent significant drivers of network expansion and they are areas that complement the MX 3D Edge Router and our Programmable Junos platform. For example, our Traffic Direct solution is running in production of early adopters and will be generally available to all customers this quarter. This solution is the first deliverable from Project Falcon and enables wireless operators to offload bulk data traffic directly to the Internet and migrate seamlessly to next-gen network architectures, including 4G. We launched the Junos Space platform late last year to enable partners and customers to drive automation, reduce operating expenses, and better support high performance network. At the end of Q1, we had over 60 service providers executing trials of Junos Space. We introduced our Mobile Secure solution that is tailored for the new world of anywhere, anytime, any device connectivity and we are pleased to note that Verizon, Sprint, and AT&T, have all expanded their infrastructure routing base to include the high-end SRX solution to secure mobile traffic. At the Mobile World Congress, we also announced Junos Pulse, which is software to secure SSL VPN and user access control experience, running onboard a range of mobile devices, including notebooks, netbooks, smartphones, and feature phones. We expanded Junos Pulse to now run on Android, Symbian, Windows Phone, and earlier this month, Apple announced the Secure Mobile capability as part of their iPhone OS 4 announcement. In addition to our progress in mobility, we recently announced an agreement to acquire Ankeena Networks, which closed yesterday. This combination aligned with our strategy. First, their technology enables rich media content caching and distribution within the network, as well as smooth streaming of video to end-user devices. It also directly integrates with our MX 3D Edge Router solution. As a partner and Ankeena developed their technology in alignment with the Junos platform, we believe this strengthens our value proposition not only for edge routing, but it expands our addressable market now to include the iCDN solutions. Second, we have a roadmap of additional media and content capabilities that leverage Junos, Junos Space, and potentially Junos Pulse that further transform the economics and user experience of video distribution and consumption. Finally, as part of the Media Flow solution, our sales force has been working with Ankeena to develop an opportunity pipeline across a number of service providers. We believe this tuck-in acquisition reinforces our vision of the new network ecosystem, expands our portfolio of edge routing solution, and delivers unique value to our customers. It also opens up a new addressable iCDN market for Juniper, which in turn creates additional shareholder value. Let me now shift to the enterprise market. We grew our enterprise business in 2009 and this quarter represented a great start to 2010. We are gaining traction in the enterprise because of our ability to deliver a portfolio of routing, switching, and security solutions. Our EX Switch portfolio continues to grow on a sequential and year-over-year basis. We expanded the EX portfolio with EX2200, we achieved engineering milestones on the Stratus Project which advances our vision for how datacenters will be architected in the future, and our product portfolio continues to expand. This is fueling several landmark customer wins. One example in public sector is the U.S. Joint Forces Command where we are enabling a comprehensive, core-to-edge network for real-time training of Army, Navy, and Air Force personnel. We continue to expand in the financial services sector as well. We recently announced our work with the Tokyo Stock Exchange to provide a low-latency, ultra-reliable, high-capacity network that supports its next-generation securities trading system. At the Agricultural Bank of China, we announced Juniper as the provider for their new nationwide backbone network. These are just a few examples of the opportunities we are winning in the enterprise. We are seeing more opportunity for growth in the enterprise and we intend to ramp up in our engagement with the channel and our field and sales and marketing with a goal of further accelerating our market penetration of the EX and the enterprise solution portfolio. From an operational perspective, we implemented several improvements in Q1 that strength our operational capability and support the growth agenda for the company. Specifically, we implemented a new field operating model with specific operating areas aligned by our service provider and enterprise sectors. This provides more line-of-sight visibility on execution and accountability at the field level. We implemented a new customer relationship management system that supports our sales, marketing, and services execution engine, and we also created the Junos Ready Software business group to amplify our focus on software that leverages Junos, Junos Space, and Junos Pulse. In summary, we have a clear strategy and it's working. We are building a foundation to drive disciplined execution and long-term growth at Juniper. We have a big opportunity and we are going after it. Now, I'll turn it over to Robyn to tell you a little bit more about the numbers. Robyn?
Robyn Denholm: Thank you, Kevin and good afternoon, everyone. We established a good foundation this quarter for growth throughout 2010. As a result of continued market position wins and solid execution, our revenue and gross margin came within our expected range, whilst operating margin and earnings per share came in above our forecasted ranges. We continue to deliver strong performance in both the service provider and enterprise markets. As expected, service provider declined modestly, following an exceptional fourth quarter and showed good year-over-year growth. Our momentum in the enterprise continued to build with another record revenue quarter. Overall, our underlying demand indicators this quarter were healthy with another record deferred revenue quarter and a book-to-bill of approximately. Now, onto a review of the numbers. As you read in the press release, we early adopted the new revenue accounting rules. For the purposes of today's discussion, all Q1 2010 results reflect these new rules. On a GAAP basis, total revenue for the first quarter was $913 million. This is a 19% increase from the prior-year first quarter and a 3% decline from Q4 2009. The $913 million includes $25 million of recognized under the new revenue accounting. All of the $25 million related to orders that were booked and shipped during the quarter. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.30 for the first quarter compared to $0.04 per share in the fourth quarter of 2009 and a $0.01 loss per share in the prior-year first quarter. GAAP net income includes the impact of the new revenue recognition rules of approximately $0.02 per share and a non-recurring income tax benefit of $54 million or $0.10 per share. This relates to a change in the tax treatment of stock-based compensation in R&D cost sharing arrangements due to a federal appellate court ruling in the Xilinx case earlier this quarter – earlier in Q2 – during the quarter in Q1. We also recognized the final portion of the 2009 restructuring costs in the amount of $8.1 million or approximately $0.01 per share. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.27, an increase of $0.10 compared to the prior-year first quarter and down $0.05 sequentially. Looking more closely at revenue, I'll give you color on the regions, business segments, and markets and for additional detailed commentary, please refer to the slide deck. Looking at our revenue by region, for the quarter, the Americas was approximately 53% of total revenue. EMEA was 29% and APAC was 18%. The Americas revenue increased 36% year-over-year and decreased 5% sequentially. As anticipated, the sequential decline primarily reflects lower spending by certain U.S. carriers compared to an exceptionally strong Q4 2009. EMEA revenue was up 18% year-over-year and 4% sequentially due to strength in the U.K. and Germany. APAC revenue declined 12% on a year-over-year basis and 7% sequentially due to declines in Japan service provider. The rest of APAC grew 8% year-over-year with significant service provider design wins. Total APAC enterprise grew 14% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. As we move throughout the year, we expect the geographical mix of revenues to fluctuate quarter to quarter in keeping our view that the pace of the economic recovery will vary by geography. Overall, we are planning for 2010 to be a growth year for Juniper. On a segment basis, total IPG revenue of $679 million was up about 20% year-over-year, driven by both net new customer wins and expansion in our current installed base, and down 2% sequentially. IPG saw growth on a sequential and year-over-year basis in MX products. We are pleased with the strong customer acceptance of our recently launched MX 3D line cards, which continues to fuel the growth of our overall MX product platform. We also crossed a significant milestone achieving over $1 billion of revenue for the MX product line since it first shipped in Q1 of 2007, making it one of our fastest ramping product families to date. We saw a continuing resumption of customer investment in the core and we are pleased with the performance of our TX Matrix Plus Series core routers. This performance reflects both existing projects and new design wins. TX revenue grew to $77 million, more than double the revenue level of the prior-year quarter and a 4% sequential increase. The momentum we are seeing from our EX Switch business continues to drive good results as we expand our market penetration and build our installed base. SLT delivered revenue of $234 million, which represents a 19% increase on a year-over-year basis and a 5% decrease sequentially. The increase was driven by growth in SRX, which contributed $60 million in product revenue. The SRX product line continues to gain traction and is now at an annual run rate of about $240 million. Looking more closely at the markets we address, service provider revenue was 67% and enterprise revenue was 33% of total revenue. Service provider revenue was up 17% on a year-over-year basis and down 5% sequentially. We saw a resumption in spending content service providers globally, as well as regional North American carriers. This was the result of new design wins with new customers and expansion of projects with existing customers. We also saw reasonable growth in the European carrier. Verizon was greater than 10% of our revenue for the quarter. This was driven by the expansion of multiple ongoing projects, as well as new design wins. We are very pleased with our strong relationship with Verizon. Enterprise revenue was up 25% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. IPG was up 36% year-over-year and 20% sequentially. EX was up more than double year-over-year and up 11% sequentially. SLT was up 1% year-over-year and reported a seasonal decline of 10% sequentially. These results are a reflection of our ongoing go-to-market strategy and increased focus on our sales of routing, switching, and security into the enterprise. We saw good traction in the financial services, government, and health care markets. On a non-GAAP basis, total gross margins for the quarter were 67.6% of revenue, which is within our long-term model of 66% to 68%. Product gross margins were 69.3% of revenue, up from 67.6% in the first quarter of last year and up from 68.5% in the fourth quarter of 2009. This improvement is the result of cost reduction and mix. Service gross margins were 61% of revenues compared to 62.4% in the first quarter of last year and compared to 64.1% in the fourth quarter of 2009. This decline is the result of higher services cost, driven by increased headcount and higher space purchases to support the continued growth in the business. Moving onto our operating expenses, for Q1, non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $405 million or 44.4% of revenue. Relative to the fourth quarter and slightly better than expected, operating expenses declined marginally. Year-over-year, operating expenses increased $23 million or 6%. Factors affecting Q1 expenses include new hires as we continue to invest in R&D, sales and services and seasonal factors including bonus accruals and the reset of the FICA taxes. R&D expenses were $189 million or 20.7% of revenue, up $17 million compared to the fourth quarter. Sales and marketing expenses totaled $180 million or 19.7% of revenue, a $20 million decreased sequentially due to lower marketing expenses and a reduction in sales commissions. D&A expenses totaled $36 million or 4% of revenue, up slightly sequentially. I'm pleased with our non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter, which was better than expected at 23.2%. This represents a 1.2-point sequential decline, which is primarily a function of revenue. These results, overall, reflect continued good execution against our operating principles and support our long-term operating margin goal of 25% or higher. I'd like to thank our employees for their continued dedication to innovation, customer focus, and operational excellence. Looking at the operating margins by segment, IPG operating margin was 26% compared to 19.7% in the first quarter of last year and 26.3% in the prior quarter. As a reminder, our investments in both TX and projects Stratus and Falcon are included within the IPG segment. SLT operating margin was 15% compared to 6.6% in the first quarter of last year and 19.3% in the prior quarter. This sequential decrease was primarily due to seasonally lower revenue and higher costs including costs related to the FICA. Turning to the bottom line, Juniper posted non-GAAP net income of $146 million for the quarter, up 60% year-over-year and down 16% sequentially. As we noted earlier, we recorded a non-recurring income tax benefit of $54 million, which resulted in a GAAP tax rate for the quarter being a benefit of 1.8%. As expected, the non-GAAP income tax rate for the quarter was approximately 30.6%, which was higher than last quarter due primarily to the expiration of the R&D tax credit. Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with nearly $2.8 billion in total cash and investments. This balance was approximately up $108 million from the prior quarter. We are pleased with our continued strength in cash generation. For the first quarter of 2010, Juniper generated cash from operations of $258 million before the litigation settlement payment of $169 million. In late February, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program for up to $1 billion of common stock. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares at an average price of $27.04 per share or approximately $74 million. Our weighted average shares outstanding for the first quarter were approximately 537 million shares on a diluted non-GAAP basis, roughly flat with the prior quarter. CapEx for the quarter totaled $38 million and depreciation and amortization was $35 million, consistent with prior quarters. DSO was 40 days compared to 44 days reported in the fourth quarter. Total deferred revenue was a record $790 million. Product deferred revenue was up 71% or $104 million year-over-year and up 4% or approximately $9 million sequentially. Services deferred revenue increased 16% year-over-year or $74 million and 5% or approximately $27 million sequentially. Even with the adoption of the new revenue recognition rules, we continue to defer product revenue for arrangements entered into prior to the beginning of the year and we will recognize those revenues under the old rules. We ended the quarter with headcount of 7,453. The increases were in R&D, customer service, sales and marketing and are all aimed at supporting growth in the business. Since the end of the first quarter, we announced and have now closed the acquisition of Ankeena Networks, the cash plus the assumption of outstanding equity awards. The Ankeena acquisition reinforces our vision of the new network ecosystem and expands our portfolio of edge routing solutions and delivers unique value to our customers. It will also open up a new addressable iCDN market for Juniper. Total cash consideration at closing was less than $100 million. Now, let's turn to our guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis, except for revenue and share count. We believe that the economic environment continues to improve. We also anticipate the continued resumption of spending by service providers in both the core and the edge and that we will continue the momentum we've established in the enterprise sector. These factors are increasing our conviction that 2010 will be a year of growth for the company. As a result, we are expecting revenue for the June quarter of $950 million plus or minus $20 million. Gross margins for the – for Q2 are expected to remain flat with the first quarter at approximately 67%. Operating expenses will increase modestly as we invest in sales and marketing and R&D to support growth in the business. Operating margin for the second quarter will be approximately 23% plus or minus 50 basis points. We remain committed to achieving our long-term targets on a sustainable basis. This would result in Q2 non-GAAP EPS of between $0.27 to $0.29. This assumes a flat share count and a tax rate of 31%. And guidance is prior to any acquisition related costs, which we expect to round up to $0.01 for Q2. For the year, let me remind you of our operating principles. First, we assume the macroeconomic environment will continue to improve. We intend to accelerate out of the downturn and outpace the market recovery. We will continue to invest in innovations that deliver long-term value to our customers and we will drive year-over-year margin expansion by growing revenue faster than OpEx. And we will maintain a healthy balance sheet and generate strong cash flow. And with that, I'll hand it over to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator instructions) Our first question is from the line of Simona Jankowski. Please go ahead.
Simona Jankowski – Goldman Sachs: Hi, thank you so much. Just a clarification first and then a question. In terms of the clarification, Robyn, the $25 million benefit to sales from the accounting change, was that an apples-to-apples comparison versus your guidance or should we exclude that if we wanted to kind of compare the results versus guidance?
Robyn Denholm: Thanks, Simona. So in terms of the rules around the revenue recognition, they came into place in October of 2009 and as you could see from our K, we were continuing to evaluate that. What I will say is that in terms of the factors that we look for guidance, the deal that we recorded and it was a single customer that generated the $25 million. It was in the pipeline at the time that we were pulling together our guidance and it was actually booked and shipped in the quarter. So it isn’t revenue that came off the balance sheet, it was actually booked and shipped in the quarter.
Simona Jankowski – Goldman Sachs: Okay. So in terms of kind of when you gave guidance, that was something that you had assumed would be recognized in this quarter or not?
Robyn Denholm: It was definitely in the pipeline in terms of one of the factors that we looked at to guidance for the quarter.
Simona Jankowski – Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then a question for Kevin in terms of the environment on the service provider spending side. It sounds like the U.S. is the strongest region and even Europe is showing some signs of improvement. But can you give us a little color on the APAC region? It sounds like that's still not picking up and in particular, if you can also help us think through the implication from the reduction in CapEx by the major Chinese carriers?
Kevin Johnson: Yes, I think, as you pointed out from the comments, Simona, that the U.S., we've got good visibility and feel comfortable with what we see in the pipeline and the growth opportunities there. I think a little color on that in the first quarter, some of the larger Tier 1 service providers' growth was – or spending was a bit lower, consistent with their Q1 spending of a year ago. But a lot of the Tier 2 service providers kicked in and we've got good visibility on our lager Tier 1s. Europe was stronger and we delivered year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter growth in Europe. And as you point out to Asia-Pacific, the comparable on Asia-Pacific, a year ago, we had some significant revenue in Japan. And so, we still had a significant amount of revenue, but less than we had a year ago in Japan and then when you look, a lot of Asia-Pacific is in some of the emerging markets or is certainly strong GDP growth markets, China and India in particular. And I think we are making some progress in some of those areas and we've got work to do in other areas. And so, Asia-Pacific, I think, remains a big opportunity for us.
Simona Jankowski – Goldman Sachs: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Tal Liani with Banc of America. Please go ahead.
Tal Liani – Banc of America: Hi, thank you. The question I had, first of all, is about the $25 million. How do we classify it in the quarter of product, services, enterprise, and carriers? You said it came from a single customer. So I'm wondering if you can give us a little bit more color there and then the question I have is about deferred revenues. Can you give us a little bit more color on deferred revenues? It's the second quarter where deferred revenues grow pretty substantially. What areas and is it geographical areas or customer segments or again, a little bit more color there. Thanks.
Robyn Denholm: Yes, Tal. In terms of the $25 million, nearly all of it was product, very small amount was services. And it was related to a single customer and actually new business in the quarter. So under the recognition rules, it was – anything that was booked or any POs that we received up until the end of the fourth quarter of last year actually remains under the old rule. It's only new business with new – with customers that were transacted from the 1st of January onwards that the new rules apply. And what that means in the future feature commitment area is that you still defer an amount of revenue, but the amount is commensurate with the value of those features as opposed to deferring the whole of the revenue amount. And in terms of the second question around deferred revenue balance, yes, we are pleased with the continued growth there in terms of the deferred revenue. As I just mentioned, anything that was under a deal that was – we had a purchase order or a contract that the business was transacted prior to the end of last fiscal year is under the old rule. So even if we booked and shipped that in the quarter in Q1, it would still be deferred. In terms of the growth, I mentioned last quarter that it wasn't any one single customer that's driving that growth. It’s a nice, healthy, diversified balance across a few customers.
Tal Liani – Banc of America: Thank you.
Robyn Denholm: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ehud Gelblum with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ehud Gelblum – Morgan Stanley: Hi, thank you very much. To keep going on the line of accounting types of things, but it's interesting. So the $25 million that was in pipeline, Robyn, I'm sorry to keep harping on this one thing. Did that – was that in SLT or IPG and was that – how did that impact your margin because I'd imagine there was no associated OpEx for that. So it just kind of came through fully, the full gross margin of that flow through to your operating margin and I'm wondering if that is one of the reasons that you came through at a 23% operating margin versus you thought previously 21% and if that's why, going forward, you were sort of at a 23%, if you can kind of help us with that. And then, what is this non-controlling interest that cost you $1.5 million? Was that an investment in some of your – some of the $50 million fund that you started investing and how should we look at that? Is that a number that's going to grow as you make more investments because that was the difference between $0.27 and you would have in fact seem to have done $0.28 – the business seems to have done $0.28 except for that $1.5 million in non-controlling interest. That seems to have nothing to do with Juniper, but just kind of flowed through the first time.
Robyn Denholm: Yes, Ehud. So let me answer the last question first. So in terms of the $1.5 million, that's to do with equity investment in the joint venture with NSN on solutions that we are delivering on the service provider side. And that's an ongoing investment. We obviously will view revenue as products come to market through that joint venture. In terms of the – in terms of margin impact of the $25 million, we – you do record the costs associated with that and you also record the expenses associated with that. So it's not a windfall in terms of the operating margin. In terms of the – I'll give you a little bit more color in terms of the customer profile and where that was. It was a non-U.S. service provider customer and it was a new deal, new piece of business with that customer. And it was the service provider customer and it booked and shipped in the quarter.
Ehud Gelblum – Morgan Stanley: Okay, great. So we should assume that it carried an operating margin very similar, 20% to 25% operating margin, similar to the – to your regular business and had no operating margin impact at all?
Robyn Denholm: Yes, that would be right because you would record the expenses the same way. Yes.
Ehud Gelblum – Morgan Stanley: Okay, terrific. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Jess Lubert – Wells Fargo Securities: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Just a follow-up on the operating margins. They came in – it looks like they came in much better than the guidance. Can you maybe just discuss where you are able to drive the leverage versus your expectations and given your expectations for revenue to improve roughly 4% sequentially at the midpoint of the guidance, why wouldn't operating margins also improve sequentially? Thanks.
Robyn Denholm: Yes. So in terms of the current – the Q1 numbers, the operating margin was slightly higher than we guided to and it was around the operating expenses. So the team performed very well and in despite the headwinds that we have in Q1 with the FICA reset and the expenses to do with that and obviously the resetting of bonus and commission plans in – as a result of the new fiscal year. So the team executed very well. As I mentioned in our guidance commentary, we are obviously very prudent with our expense management across the board. We've done a very good job on our cost structure over the last couple of years and we will continue to do that as we move forward through the growth that we are seeing. But we do need to invest modestly in incremental sales and marketing areas to make sure that we are capturing the demand opportunity that's out there. And we will do that prudently and as I said, we do expect an operating margin for Q2 in that 23%, plus or minus a half.
Jess Lubert – Wells Fargo Securities: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Nikos Theodosopoulos with UBS. Please go ahead.
Nikos Theodosopoulos – UBS: Yes, thank you. I had a couple of quick ones. You mentioned that book-to-bill was about 1. Can you comment on sequentially what the trend was, up or down or flat, on the six months rolling product backlog? And then, I guess a question for Kevin on M&A. This is the first – I mean it's a small deal the company has done in quite a while and I know the company has looked at several over the last few years. What's your perspective on M&A going into a growth year and what does this deal indicate for the types of deals the company may or may not do in the future?
Kevin Johnson: Yes, I'll go ahead and take your second question, Nikos and then hand over to Robyn for your first question. First of all, I think the strategy that we are on in many ways is driven primarily by the organic R&D that we are doing around the platform of Junos, Junos Space, and Junos Pulse. That said, we will complement that organic R&D strategy with strategic acquisitions where they make sense. And in this particular case, the fact that Ankeena had developed intellectual property in an area, video, that is a significant growth and it complements edge routing, it made a lot of sense for us to go ahead and move forward with this acquisition. Kind of think of it as a tuck-in acquisition that aligns with our strategy. We will clearly look at other and we continue to look at other M&A opportunities that align strategically with the agenda that we've outlined at the Analyst Meeting and we continue reinforce and I think this is just representative of one of those that fit that model. Robyn, you want to take the first question?
Robyn Denholm: Yes. So in terms of the book-to-bill, Nikos, as I said, it was approximately 1. It was just slightly under 1 under the new revenue rules. So – but we are very pleased with our underlying demand metrics overall. We saw good activity, and as Kevin mentioned, that activity has continued into the early part of Q2.
Nikos Theodosopoulos – UBS: So did the product backlog go up or down sequentially? It's hard for me to reconcile that with the deferred revenue changes and everything else. I'm just trying to get a sense of how it trended.
Robyn Denholm: Yes, the backlog – product backlog itself was very, very marginally down, very slightly. But the deferred revenue is up. So from my perspective, that – if you net the two things together, they are actually very healthy indicators that things are positive from a demand perspective.
Nikos Theodosopoulos – UBS: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Mark Sue – RBC Capital Markets: Thank you. I thought we'd bring on the cow since we beat the horse dead, but just on the revenue for next quarter, should we kind of think it as a relative comparison really $925 million plus or minus $20 million? And what makes it $20 million plus or minus? That seems to be a weird way to explain it. Is it concentrated on one particular customer and revenue rack? And then Kevin, just kind of how you feel about exceeding 20% top line growth this year?
Kevin Johnson: Okay. I'll take the second question, Mark, and I'll give the first question to Robyn. Thanks for the questions. First of all, we see this a 20-plus-percent growth year. Well, we've delivered Q1 and we've guided for Q2. Our growth in Q1 is 19% year-over-year and our guide at $950 million plus or minus $20 million at the midpoint is 21% growth year-over-year. And so if you look at that trend, I think that supports the view that we are growing in that 20% range and as we complete Q2, we will offer guidance for Q3. But I think it's very consistent with what we outlined at the Analyst Meeting in February.
Robyn Denholm: Yes, I think in terms of the $950 million plus or minus $20 million, what we are seeing obviously is good demand on the service provider side and the enterprise side. We expect that to continue. We expect a sequential increase in service provider spending and the differential between the midpoint of the range and the high end of the range is whether or not that spending comes in early enough to be recognized in the quarter. In terms of the enterprise, we are seeing good year-over-year and quarter – and sequential growth, even in Q1 and we expect that to continue in Q2.
Mark Sue – RBC Capital Markets: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Ittai Kidron – Oppenheimer: Thanks, Robyn. Again, going back to that $25 million, I'm sorry about that. With regards to the costs associated with this, I can understand how the cost of goods sold get – gets deferred as well when you defer such revenue, but it doesn't seem like there is OpEx related to that. Is it fair to say that the operating margin of that $25 million was higher than your corporate average of low-20s? Just a simple yes or no, I would appreciate it.
Robyn Denholm: So I think the answer is no. The operating margin, you do take the selling expenses into account in terms of the revenue that you recognize. So commissions, sales costs, all of that sort of thing taken to – into account when we booked that. And so it was no different to other deals of commensurate products that were booked in the quarter.
Ittai Kidron – Oppenheimer: And with regards to the penny dilution you expect from the acquisition, should we expect that to be a recurring event now for some time? When does the acquisition become undiluted to your earnings?
Robyn Denholm: Yes. So I – for the Q2, what I said was it would round up to $0.01. It's actually sort of in that $5 million to $6 million range, which rounds up to a penny. So it would be up to a penny. On an ongoing basis, I'll tell you next quarter – the first quarter, you normally have the integration costs, as well as the ongoing R&D that you are assuming with the company. But I'll give you an update on that as we are integrating the company next quarter.
Ittai Kidron – Oppenheimer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kvaal with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.
Jeff Kvaal – Barclays Capital: Yes, thank you very much. Kevin, Robyn, I'm going to assume that AT&T is not a 10% customer this quarter, Verizon is. I'm wondering if you could tell us a little bit about some of the dynamics involved there, particularly I know there is a lot of controversy about AT&T and the domain project and what that implies for you folks. Thanks.
Kevin Johnson: Yes, thanks for your question, Jeff. Look, we've got a lot of very important customers. Certainly, AT&T is and remains a very important customer of ours and I think when we look at our opportunities going forward, we anticipate they are going to continue to be a significant customer for us and any questions regarding the domain decisions and what they are working on, I'd have to refer you to AT&T. But clearly, our focus is continuing to deliver value and grow our relationship with them.
Jeff Kvaal – Barclays Capital: Should we expect AT&T to be back in the 10% customer roster on – maybe even on an uneven basis across the year?
Kevin Johnson: Well, it's – in terms of our growth, it's going to be a function of how all of our revenue is growing in enterprise and service providers, and the flow of their spending on a quarterly basis. But clearly, AT&T is and continues to be an important customer for us.
Jeff Kvaal – Barclays Capital: Okay. So it's right there whether it's above or below any quarter is hard to predict.
Kevin Johnson: They are a significant customer and we are very focused on them.
Jeff Kvaal – Barclays Capital: Okay, got you. Thanks, Kevin.
Kevin Johnson: Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jeff Evenson with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Jeff Evenson – Sanford Bernstein: In October, you talked at the New York Stock Exchange about your open ecosystem. I'm wondering if you could give us an update on some of the progress in that area and also suggest some maybe external factors that we can look at to judge its success going forward.
Kevin Johnson: Yes. Thanks for the question, Jeff. I think one of the things that we look at certainly is the number of third parties that have signed software developer kit license agreements with us and are actively building solutions based on Junos, Junos Pulse or Junos Space. And since we've announced that capability, I think now we've – we are now at or slightly above 60 licensees of that software developer kit who are building and a high percentage of those are actively building solutions on top of Junos. So I think the two things, maybe a couple of metrics to look at. Number one would be, as we report the number of third parties that have licensed the SDK and are building solutions on Junos and the second would be as those partners announce products and solutions that run on Junos, Junos Space or Junos Pulse, that would be indicators of the third-party ecosystem rallying around Junos as a platform.
Jeff Evenson – Sanford Bernstein: Roughly how many of this 60 are service providers and what are the types of initiatives that they are taking with the SDK?
Kevin Johnson: Well, a small percentage of the 60 would be service providers. It's – and when I say small, I don't have the specific numbers, but there is a handful of service providers that are doing custom R&D on Junos in support of their strategy in the network services that they deliver to customers. Certainly, there are large technology partners, IBM being one that has announced the work that they are doing is part of the service provider delivery extensions and some work that we are doing there together with IBM who is innovating on it. And then there is a number of them that are also innovators that from different size companies that basically are in the business of innovating and creating technology solutions to address the needs of networks. So there is quite a wide range of innovators that are coming to participate in this Junos as a platform approach.
Jeff Evenson – Sanford Bernstein: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Samuel Wilson with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
Samuel Wilson – JMP Securities: Good afternoon. Just a question on competitive landscape with HP 3Com closing and Cisco seeming to be more aggressive, just want to get some sense [ph] on the enterprise side of the business how you see the competitive landscape.
Kevin Johnson: Yes. Clearly, HP was with their ProCurve offering and then recently closing 3Com, obviously they are very focused on the enterprise switching opportunity. The focus that we have really is on the value proposition we have, beginning in the datacenter with what I would characterize as an architectural transition or an architectural disruption that is unfolding in datacenters in the way they are architected where these mega datacenters just have massive numbers of servers and storage devices that need to be connected together. And strategically, we have a view that traditional three-tiered architecture is collapsing to two-tiers, which we deliver today with our EX product family and with the Stratus Project, it will collapse further to a single tier. And in many ways, that architectural disruption is driving a significant amount of dialog and the design wins that we are getting with many of these large enterprise customers and I think that’s something independent of what else is going on in the competitive landscape. That's a unique aspect that we bring to the table and that is generating a lot of the dialog and demand that we are engaging on today. The second area that we are seeing a significant amount of discussion with customers and landmark wins is in the area of branch and access where customers are looking to consolidate what typically would be multiple network appliances. And so with our low-end SRX in the branch, the fact that we could do routing, switching, security in a single system, single solution and with Junos as a platform, we continue to expand the range of solutions that are available that run on that system. And so that too is driving demand. So from a competitive approach, we are very focused on what we refer to as the new network, which is what we believe is a unique approach that dramatically changes the way that customers deploy capital and enable solutions in a way that leads to better economics and better experiences for their users.
Samuel Wilson – JMP Securities: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Ader with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Jason Ader – William Blair: Yes, thanks. I just want to continue on the enterprise side. The – if I'm correct, the revenues in Q4 are up 1% from Q3 and then Q1 is up 1% from Q4, which is not bad, but I would say maybe a little bit below where I would have expected them to be and just given your increased presence in portfolio on the enterprise. So I guess the question is, are you seeing any more pressure out there and how do you accelerate your growth and share gains in the enterprise market?
Kevin Johnson: Yes, I think we continue to see strong demand and dialog for the value proposition as we enter the enterprise. I think certainly we've done work to increase the, I'll call it the unaided awareness of Juniper's offerings in the enterprise, recognizing certainly that there are some very significant competitors with big technology names that are also competing in that space. But I think within our enterprise growth, sequentially this quarter we saw 11% growth in our EX Switch product line, selling to the enterprise. You mentioned in Q4 we had a 1% growth in the enterprise. But we saw a 50% growth overall in our EX Switch revenue from Q3 to Q4. And much of that was driven by service providers that were investing in that switch solution for managed services for enterprise. So at the end of the day, sometimes the revenue whether it's delivered to a managed services solution or delivered to an on-premise enterprise customer can get landed in either enterprise or service provider. But overall, I think that the proposition we have for enterprise datacenter computing and this new architectural paradigm is unique and it resonates with customers. I think the proposition that we have around Junos and automation through Junos Space allows customers to dramatically reduce the operating expenses associated with networking. And I think when it comes to unique solutions such as branch, we've got an integrated routing, switching, security platform at the SRX that does well. And going forward, you say, what can we do –
Jason Ader – William Blair: Yes, tactically, I want to know.
Kevin Johnson: Yes, tactically what do we do to accelerate? Well, I think right now as we are focused on these set of industry verticals to get landmark wins which we are feeding into our marketing campaign and you see now that some of the ads that we are running, we are highlighting customers who are now running their enterprise networks on Juniper. I think this is an opportunity. As we go into Q2, we will increase some of our focus on deeper engagement with the channel and we are going to put some more resources behind enterprise sales and marketing, really looking at capturing a larger share of this growing opportunity that we see unfolding in the second half of this year.
Jason Ader – William Blair: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Paul Silverstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Paul Silverstein – Credit Suisse: Hi, clarification on two questions. Can you tell us what the combined contribution of MX, EX, and SRX were similar to what you did last quarter and the quarter before?
Kevin Johnson: Robyn is –
Robyn Denholm: Just calculating.
Kevin Johnson: – tallying some things, Paul. Just a second here.
Paul Silverstein – Credit Suisse: Robyn, if it's easier, just tell us the MX number, because that's what I'm getting at.
Robyn Denholm: It was up sequentially. I don't have the number in front of me actually. Yes, so –
Paul Silverstein – Credit Suisse: I'm sorry.
Robyn Denholm: It was – the three of them together?
Kevin Johnson: No, MX.
Robyn Denholm: MX was up about 15% sequentially.
Paul Silverstein – Credit Suisse: MX was up about 15% sequentially?
Robyn Denholm: Yes, I don't have the number in front of me.
Paul Silverstein – Credit Suisse: Okay. You had given us that number the last three quarters. That’s why I asked.
Robyn Denholm: Yes.
Paul Silverstein – Credit Suisse: The questions are – I guess I'm trying to understand the operating margin. It looks to me like all the upside was a function of gross margin as opposed to the strong OpEx control that you referenced in your comments. I recognize it wasn't much out of line with what you guided – what you had projected for us, but that wasn't the source. The upside was the gross margin. So the question is, as we look forward, how much of the operating margin upside you are expecting is from OpEx as opposed to the gross margin rebounding back to that 67% plus level where it had been a year plus ago with better revenues?
Robyn Denholm: So gross margins were at about 67.6% for the quarter. They were roughly flat with last quarter, which is what we were expecting. The balance between products and services slightly favored the product side this quarter versus Q4. So it really was – I – we were expecting expenses to increase sequentially slightly, given the FICA reset and the bonuses and actually we were able to manage it to a slight decline. So that was principally the difference between the guidance and the results as they yielded. We are very pleased with our ongoing performance on the gross margin side and as I outlined in the Financial Analyst Meeting, we are still working and continue to work on things in the supply chain and our ongoing activities in – on the cost side of our gross margin and we continue to drive for value with our customer set as well.
Paul Silverstein – Credit Suisse: Robyn, one other question, if I might. In your guidance, can you give us any insight – if you already addressed this, my apologies, but can you give us any insight into how much of the growth is a function of your traditional carrier routing business as opposed to the newer EX and SRX products in the enterprise side?
Kevin Johnson: Yes, go ahead, Robyn.
Robyn Denholm: Yes. So I – Paul, in terms of the $950 million of guidance, plus or minus $20 million, what we said was that we are expecting the strong increase in sequential enterprise, our momentum that we've had in that area to continue and we expect an increase in the sequential revenues to do with service provider. So – and most specifically, between the top end and the midpoints or between the $20 million, between the $950 million and $970 million. That's primarily the difference in one level of revenue from service provider and another, depending on when – the timing of when they would bring in those orders, that type of things.
Kevin Johnson: Yes, let me just add to that. I mean, if you look at the $950 million midpoint on guidance and you sort of model a 2% to 3% upside growth quarter-on-quarter for SP and 8% to 9% on enterprise, you very quickly get to about the $950 million. And across the product sets, certainly we sell EX products, SRX products, and MX routers to service providers and we sell those products to enterprise customers. I would expect all of those product areas to grow sequentially in that guidance. Now, certainly there is – the range of plus or minus $20 million means there is certainly some upside and some downside depending on timing. Most of that is timing of service provider orders. And so there could be some upside on the $950 million depending on the timing of those orders. Likewise, there could be some downside. But if you just model at the midpoint of $950 million, you'll get about a 2% to 3% on service provider, 8% to 9% on enterprise and that gets you close to the $950 million.
Robyn Denholm: Yes. And just to follow up on your first question, products for EX, MX, and SRX in the quarter combined was $270 million.
Paul Silverstein – Credit Suisse: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of John Marchetti with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
John Marchetti – Cowen and Company: Thanks very much. At a high level, when you look what you are starting to come to market with Stratus, as that initiative starts to mature, should that drive acceleration in your EX Switch sales? Does that sort of pull through as you go through the whole effort of sort of flattening the network? And then looking at that on the opposite side, as you talk about all of this effort to sort of collapse networks and we look at the carrier market at the high level, do you start to look for ways to do the same on the carrier side and does that mean you need to get into the access market to be able to do the same on the carrier side going core all the way to edge? Thanks.
Kevin Johnson: Yes, thanks for your questions, John. First of all, I think that anytime we've got a strong value proposition and certainly the architectural disruption in the datacenter and really transforming the architecture of datacenters of the future, I think that creates product pull across the product line, not just for the EX, but for our entire portfolio in the enterprise. And I think we are seeing that a bit today as we've seen growth in our MX, SRX, and EX product lines and a complete solution focused on enterprise customers. And I think the Stratus Project is just going to reinforce that and strengthen that. So the answer to the – to your first question is yes. I think that creates – if we execute well on that, we've got a strong value proposition, which I believe we do. I think that creates more pull for the overall portfolio of offerings and solutions we have in the enterprise. Your second question then is, do you – do we see this type of consolidation in mega datacenters and things affecting or impacting service providers and certainly if you look at the architecture of next-generation central offices and pops, certainly we think the architectural focus we have to help reduce the cost footprint and help those service providers consolidate some of those assets on a high performance network, that creates opportunity for us. And that opportunity does not require us to get into the access business. That's an opportunity that I think is very complementary to the access solutions that they have in place today.
John Marchetti – Cowen and Company: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We have time for one last question. Our last question comes from the line of Brian White with Ticonderoga. Please go ahead.
Brian White – Ticonderoga: Yes. Kevin, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about the OEM agreement with IBM that started in the December quarter, how that's progressing, and also if the Dell OEM agreement is on target for the June quarter. Thank you.
Kevin Johnson: Yes, thanks for your question, Brian. First of all, keep in mind, our relationship with IBM, they resell Juniper Networks systems and they have an OEM version of the systems that they can sell as well. And so the way I look at is really how are we doing in the combination of what they resell plus the OEM systems that they are selling. And on that total number, we are pleased with this quarter and continued progress with IBM. There is obviously more work that we are working hard together on, but they continue to demonstrate progress in helping enable this route to market. That said, the mix between OEM and resell is not really the relevant issue. It's how we are working closely with the IBM field team and their services organization to deliver the right solution to their customers and we continue to make progress there. Certainly, we announced I think last October the relationship with Dell and the OEM relationship. I think we are – we are working on that and I think we've got a lot – made a lot of progress with Dell. I would expect that will be released probably – it might be the first couple of weeks in July, later June-ish, but it's kind of near the end of this quarter, early next quarter that we are on track to enable that offering with Dell.
Brian White – Ticonderoga: Okay, thank you.
Kevin Johnson: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you.
Kathleen Bela: Okay. Go ahead, Manny.
Operator: In closing, so let's turn the floor back over to management for any closing comments.
Kathleen Bela: Thank you so much. We'd like to thank you again for joining us today. We look forward to meeting with you at IR events throughout the next couple of quarters. I want to call out the fact that we are hosting our Annual Shareholder Meeting here in Sunnyvale on May 12. Thanks again and we look forward to speaking with you soon.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Welcome to the Juniper Networks fourth quarter 2009 earnings results conference call. At this time all participants are in a listen only mode. A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Kathleen Bela, Vice President of Investor Relations for Juniper Networks. 
Kathleen Bela:  Here today are Kevin Johnson, Chief Executive Officer and Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial Officer. A couple of housekeeping items before we begin. First, as a reminder there is a slide deck that accompanies today’s conference call. To access the slides please go to the IR section of our website at www.Juniper.net. Also, please note that beginning with this call a full look in to our geographic revenue distribution will be available in our slide deck. Secondly, this call will be available to download as a podcast. For details you may also visit the IR section of our website. With that, I would like to remind everyone that statements made during this call concerning Juniper’s business outlook, economic outlook, future financial operating results and overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors including economic conditions generally or in the networking industry, changes in overall technology spending, the network capacity requirements of service providers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply chain constraints, variation in the mix of products sold, customer perception and acceptance of our products, litigation and other factors listed in our most recent report on Form 10Q filed with the SEC. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances change after the date of this call. In discussing the financial results today, Robyn will first present results on a GAAP basis and for purposes of today’s discussion we’ll also review non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why the management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company’s financial results please consult our 8K filed with the SEC today. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results please see today’s press release. In general, non-GAAP results exclude certain non-recurring charges, amortization of purchased intangibles, other acquisition related charges and expenses related to stock-based compensation. In today’s call Robyn will also be providing forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis. All guidance is forward-looking and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier. GAAP guidance measures are not available on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to the charges which are excluded from the non-GAAP guidance estimates. Please note that today’s call is scheduled to last for one hour and please limit your questions to one per firm. With that, I will turn the call over to Kevin.
Kevin R. Johnson : Juniper Networks finished 2009 on a very strong note financially, operationally and strategically. Our fourth quarter performance not only represented quarter-on-quarter growth but also year-on-year growth. The results for the fourth quarter and the year as a whole reinforce a few key points. First, they provide good indication that the macro environment continues to improve. While it remains too early to predict the pace and trajectory of recovery, particularly by geography, we’ve come a long way from the economic uncertainty we were facing at this time just a year ago. Second, our results reinforce that Juniper is executing operationally. We executed well on our R&D roadmap and we strengthened and expanded our go to market capability, introducing potentially valuable new partnerships. We’re also implementing our connected sales and marketing model worldwide which is the foundation for continued improvement in sales execution.  These achievements are translating to financial results. Our operating margins are improving, our cash flow generation is strengthening and we’re getting these results while staying true to our commitment to invest in our innovation road map and customer support. Third, the fourth quarter is another data point that indicates we’re on the right track strategically. We expanded our portfolio of offerings leveraging our investment in R&D across both the service provider and enterprise sectors.  At the core of Juniper is a drive for innovation which has enabled us to deliver routing, switching and security on a common software platform Junos. This programmable software platform running on custom silicon is changing the economics of networking and it is attracting partners which is enabling more choice and flexibility to our customers.  Many of you heard us talk in detail about our vision and strategy for the new network in New York at our October event. As Internet traffic continues to increase customers face the difficult challenge of managing the complexity associated with the network and the significant investments required to maintain and expand it. It becomes increasingly apparent that there is a tremendous opportunity to develop a new approach to the network that delivers significant value to customers as they manage these challenges. We believe the new network must be delivered on a common open software platform Junos, supported by dedicated silicon that allows scalability. It’s a platform in which our partners and customers can innovate and deliver new and better user experiences in an environment that is fast, reliable, secure and scalable. In New York we made several key announcements that move us down this path. Our new Junos software platform which includes Junos in the Network, Junos Space and our new network client Junos Pulse. The launch of our next generation silicon Trio, which enables 3D scaling and positions our MX routers as the world’s first universal edge platform, a critical development for the mobile market.  Five new solutions and a new suite of products for our datacenter cloud initiative and a series of Junos Space partnerships including agreements with IBM and Dell that extend our market reach as well as a host of licensing and application development partnerships. You’ll be hearing more about all these developments in the weeks and months ahead. In the meantime, they lend further validation to what we accomplished in 2009 and reinforced where we are going in this new decade. Early in 2009 we laid out for you a set of operating principles by which we have managed the company through the worst macroeconomic environment any of us have ever faced. After establishing those principles in Q1 we consistently improved our financial performance sequentially in each quarter. As we look ahead at 2010 we’ve taken a fresh look at the principles that we will use to guide us in 2010.  I want to lay out those principles for you today and then hand it over to Robyn for more details on the quarter and the look ahead. Five principles that will guide us in 2010 include first, we are assuming in 2010 that the macro economy continues to improve as we move through the year setting the stage for a year of growth. Stability has improved and GDP growth is forecasted in 2010 though growth will vary by geography and of course the sustainability of growth is dependent upon the job recovery and many other factors. Second, we always plan for multiple scenarios but our intent is to accelerate coming out of the downturn and outpace the market recovery in 2010. Visibility is good in the enterprise market, we continue to take share, we are increasing awareness and we have momentum. Visibility continues to improve in the service provider sector and there are good growth opportunities for Juniper. I am particularly pleased to see the traction we are getting in the service provider sector in areas outside our traditional scope including security and managed services. Third, we will invest in innovations that deliver long term value for our customers. Our product roadmap is targeted to investments that extend our competitive advantage and enable our customers’ success. I talked a moment ago about innovation in silicon, software and systems that will power the new network and we will continue to target new investments in mobility, the datacenter and other key areas. In 2010 you will see us expand our focus on customer solutions that bring these technologies together in unique ways. Fourth, we remain diligent in managing our operating expenses. Our intent is to grow revenue faster than operating expenses enabling us to drive year-on-year operating margin expansion. We’ll do this by driving operational excellence as we continue to invest in innovation, our routes to market and customer support.  Finally, we will maintain a healthy balance sheet and generate strong cash flows. Our goal is to optimize financial flexibility to reinvest in the business and augment that with returns via share repurchases as business and market conditions warrant. This set of principles should communicate our optimism about 2010. Consistent with 2009 we will maintain agility as we come out of the downturn.  To sum up, we’re pleased with the performance of the company operationally, financially and strategically. The difference in ton of the business is strikingly different than it was a year ago at this time. Economic improvement has afforded us the opportunity to perform but it’s the execution on our operating principles throughout the past year that positions us to really succeed.  As we enter a new decade I want to take this opportunity to say thank you to all the Juniper employees and our partners who worked tirelessly in pursuit of our mission: connect everything and empower everyone. We know that there is still much more to do yet we see a year of growth ahead for Juniper and we fully expect the company to accelerate out of the downturn.  I’ll ask Robyn now to review the financial results in more detail.
Robyn M. Denholm : We are pleased with our fourth quarter financial results which demonstrates that we are executing well in a market that appears to be improving. Our solid execution in the quarter resulted in record enterprise sector revenue and strong sequential growth in the service provider sector. Our key demand indicators were all healthy with record levels of deferred revenue on both product and services and strong overall bookings which led to product book-to-bill well in excess of one.  We continue to demonstrate financial discipline showing good improvements in gross margins and measured [standings] that contributed to a significant sequential improvement in our operating margins. This performance underscores the operating leverage built in to our financial model.  On a full year basis we did what we said we were going to do. We committed that if our revenues were down for the full year our expenses would be flat to down. For the full year, revenue was down 7% while non-GAAP operating expenses were down 3%. We achieved this goal by reducing op ex while carefully directing investments to R&D. These investments resulted in key product releases and projects that position us well as our markets continue to improve. These actions enabled us to improve our operating margin on a sequential basis throughout 2009.  Now, on to a discussion of the numbers; on a GAAP basis, total revenue for the fourth quarter was $941million. This was a strong finish to the year and represents a 14% sequential increase and a 2% increase from the prior year fourth quarter. Juniper reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.24 for the quarter compared to $0.16 per share in the third quarter and $0.25 per share in the prior year fourth quarter.  GAAP net income includes a $12 million charge due to the legal settlement related to a land development agreement for property purchased in 2000 and a restructuring charge of $3 million. Combined these two items represent $0.02 per share. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.32, an improvement of $0.09 compared to the third quarter and flat compared to the prior year fourth quarter.  Looking more closely at revenue, I will give you color on the regions, business segments and markets. Looking at our revenue by region, for the fourth quarter the Americas were approximately 55% of total revenue, up three points sequentially. EMEA was 27% and APAC was 18%. On a sequential basis the Americas revenue increased 22% and 7% year-over-year. This growth was driven by a record revenue quarter for the US where service providers saw strong sequential growth in both enterprise and service providers saw good year-over-year growth. EMEA revenue was up sequentially in the fourth quarter due to the growth in both the enterprise and service provider markets. This growth was primarily driven by the UK. APAC grew both on a sequential and a year-over-year basis. This growth was fueled by the enterprise business and offset by slight declines in the service provider business while it was stronger in Australia and in India. On a segment basis, total IPG revenue of $695 million was up a strong 17% sequentially and down 1% on a year-over-year basis. IPG saw growth on a sequential basis in MX M- and T- products as well as higher services revenues. EX revenue increased 47% to $74 million which represented our highest EX revenue quarter to date. SLT delivered another revenue record quarter of $246 million which represents an increase of 8% sequentially and 11% on a year-over-year basis. This growth was driven by strength in SRX and SSL VPN products. SRX products were $43 million. We are pleased with this 38% sequential increase. One of the significant drivers of the revenue increase for SLT was our continued expansion in to the service provider market with a record $71 million of revenue this quarter. This was led by increased sales of our SRX and security products in to our Tier-1 US service provider customers.  Overall, we are pleased with our return on investment in R&D. As evidenced by the strength of new products including MX, EX and SRX which contributed more than $236 million in revenue in the quarter. For the full year, these products contributed over $700 million in product revenue. We are seeing increased success with our portfolio’s selling strategy contributing to market share gains in enterprise and expanding our market depth and breadth in service providers.  Looking more closely at the markets we address, service provider revenue was 68% and enterprise revenue was 32% of the total revenue. Service provider revenue was up 22% sequentially and up 1% compared to the prior year fourth quarter. This success is a result of improving market conditions in the US, growth in routing and increased penetration of our switching and security products. This focus resulted in increased SLT product sales of 6% and EX sales of 67% sequentially.  In terms of customers, AT&T was a greater than 10% of our revenue for the quarter and for the year. This was driven by the expansion of multiple ongoing projects and new design wins in security and mobility. We remain very pleased with our strong relationship with AT&T. Enterprise revenue was up 1% sequentially and up 5% compared to the prior year fourth quarter. For the full year, enterprise was up 11% as we delivered on our strategic objective to expand our presence in the enterprise. Switching fueled the growth and our portfolio selling enabled good expansion in enterprise routing and security.  On a non-GAAP basis total gross margins for the quarter were 66.9% of revenue, a significant improvement over the prior quarter and returning to our long term model of 66% to 68%. Overall the biggest factor to total gross margin was the increase in the mix of product revenue versus services. Product gross margins were 68.5% of revenue up from 67.8% in the third quarter with the highest sequential improvement in IPG. This improvement was primarily due to volume and efficiencies resulting from our ongoing supply chain management. Service gross margins were 61.1% of revenue, up from 59.2% in the third quarter. This improvement was due to better than expected revenues as well as good cost management.  Moving on to our operating expenses; I am very pleased with our continued cost management. A huge thank you goes out to our extraordinary employees who showed great commitment to containing costs while continuing to execute at high levels. Their efforts directly contributed to our results. For the full year 2009 we reduced total non-GAAP op ex by 3% while redeploying investment in to R&D and customer support and reducing our sales and marketing expenses by 7%.  For Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $400 million or 42.5% of revenue. Relative to the third quarter operating expenses increased $29 million or 8% on revenue growth of 14%. R&D expenses were $172 million or 18.3% of revenue, a slight increase of $2 million compared to the third quarter and flat for the full year. This is a significant achievement by the R&D team who have delivered on their roadmaps and met significant milestones on time. Sales and marketing expenses totaled $194 million or 20.6% of revenue, a $28 million increase sequentially. This is a result of higher variable sales expense and an increased investment in revenue generating marketing campaigns. D&A expenses totaled $34 million or 3.6% of revenue flat with the third quarter. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $230 million resulting in an operating margin of 24.4% of revenue, a very strong 3.6 point sequential gain. Looking at operating margins by segment, IPG operating margin was 26.3%, up five points from the third quarter and contributed the most to our sequential improvement in total operating margins. This increase was due to higher revenue, higher gross margins and good cost discipline in sales and R&D. As a reminder, our investments in both EX and Project Stratus and Falcon are included within the IPG segment. SLT operating margin was 19.3% flat compared to the third quarter and I am pleased in the strength in both segment’s operating margins.  Turning to the bottom line; Juniper posted non-GAAP net income of $174 million for the quarter up 42% sequentially. Net other income and expense was zero for the quarter. Interest income of $3 million was offset by higher distributor financing costs as a result of the increase in volume and modest foreign exchange losses. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was lower than expected at 25.4% down sequentially by 3.8 points. The primary driver was the geographic mix of pre-tax earnings. The reduced tax rate contributed $0.01 to our non-GAAP EPS. Looking at the balance sheet we ended the fourth quarter with more than $2.6 billion in cash and investments. This balance was up $60 million from the prior quarter. We generated record cash flow from operations in the quarter of $260 million up from $224 million in the third quarter. For 2009 we generated $796 million in cash from operations.  During the quarter we repurchased 8.1 million shares at an average price of $26.14 per share or approximately $212 million. For the full year we repurchased 20.7 million shares at an average price of $21.91 per share or $454 million. Our weighted average shares outstanding for the fourth quarter were 539 million shares. On a diluted non-GAAP basis up slightly from the prior quarter. As of December 31st our absolute shares outstanding were 519 million shares down eight million compared to the end of 2008. As Kevin noted, it is our intention to continue to execute on our buyback program as business and market conditions warrant. Cap ex for the quarter totaled $40 million and depreciation and amortization was $37 million consistent with prior quarters. DSO increased to 44 days from 41 reported in the third quarter which is in line with our long term model and typical for the fourth quarter. Total deferred revenue was up significantly to a record $754 million. Sequentially product deferred revenue was up 27% or a $51 million increase.  Services deferred revenue increased by 13% or $60 million. Year-over-year total deferred revenue balance increased by a notable $163 million or 28% with product deferred revenue up 53% and services deferred revenue up 19%. Our deferred revenue profile reflects a broad range of customers with no one single customer representing a majority of the increase. We ended the quarter with a total headcount of 7,231.  Now, let’s turn to our guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis except for revenues and share count. As Kevin noted earlier, while we are always planning for multiple business scenarios our expectations are that 2010 will be a growth year for Juniper. We also anticipate that the pace of economic recovery will vary by geography but that overall the economic environment will strengthen as we move throughout the year.  As we enter the first quarter we are mindful of the strong demand metrics that we posted in the December quarter and we’re balancing that with the fact that many of our customers are still setting their 2010 budgets. For the March quarter with the midpoint of $895 million our revenue range is $880 to $910 million. We are expecting gross margins for Q1 to remain solid and within our long term model of 66% to 68%. We intend to manage operating expenses essentially flat with the fourth quarter and as a reminder, op ex in Q1 include higher FICA taxes as well as the resumption of some of our variable compensation expenses.  Operating margin for the first quarter will be down sequentially on the reduced revenue but it will be at 21% plus or minus half a point and as we progress throughout 2010 we anticipate operating margin expansion as revenue grows on a year-over-year basis. We remain committed to achieving our long term operating margin targets on a sustainable basis. We expect Q1 non-GAAP EPS to range between $0.23 and $0.26. A note on the tax rate, the anticipated tax rate for the March quarter will be approximately 31%. This is due to the R&D tax credit not yet being approved. The impact of this higher tax rate on the March quarter EPS is approximately $0.02. Share count is expected to be flat compared to the fourth quarter.  In summary, throughout 2009 we demonstrated good financial discipline and were able to show good expansion in operating margins. We managed our cost structure well within our anticipated revenue opportunity and at the same time continued to deliver great innovation to the marketplace. As we look forward to 2010 we will continue to be prudent with our costs and will execute our investments in line with the market and economic recovery.  With that, we look forward to seeing you at our analyst day scheduled for February 23rd where we will provide more detail on our strategic plan supporting the long term growth of the company. I will now hand it over to the operator for questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Jeffrey Kvall – Barclays Capital.
Jeffrey Kvall – Barclays Capital: Robyn I would like to inquire about the trajectory of the first quarter numbers. It seems as though yes, a lot of your metrics are very high and traditionally seasonality has not been down quite as sharply so could you talk us through a little bit of the thought process there? Then, if you could expand on that and talk about routing growth through 2010 that would be very helpful?
Robyn M. Denholm : In terms of our guidance, as we said we’re predicting a range of $880 to $910 million and really the variability in that range has to do with our service provider segment as we said in the commentary. I think we did have a very strong finish to 2004 in the fourth quarter and we saw good growth in both routing and also security and switching in to service provider and also we saw growth in the enterprise sector. We are expecting sort of that range for the first quarter and as you historically know the first half of our year is between 47% and 48% of total revenue for the year if you go back over the last four or five years that has been about the case. Then the second half of the year tends to be about 52% or 53%. That is how we’re looking at the year trends in terms of next year. We don’t see any pattern change in that so we do expect a bigger second half than the first half. 
Kevin R. Johnson : On your question about routing growth, look we look at the service provider addressable market in 2010 growing roughly 13% to 15% so certainly router growth would have to be in that range and that’s for the addressable market. Now certainly, our ability to execute and accelerate out of the downturn but your question on broad addressable market that’s what we’re looking at on the service provider side. Enterprise addressable market that’s probably a more modest growth. I think some of the recent surveys of CIOs have showed that IT budgets are picking up. You might see the total addressable market there grow by mid single digits 5%ish or so. But, at the end of the day we’re taking share in the enterprise so independent of growth of the addressable market I think we’ve got opportunities just to continue to have systematic execution.
Jeffrey Kvall – Barclays Capital: Any comment on the routing versus optical questions that are circling?
Kevin R. Johnson : I view the opportunity of looking at how routing and optical work together to solve customer problems as an opportunity. Our field sales teams are engaged with a number of customers on this as is our IPGT business group and probably the best thing to do is invite you to our analyst meeting and we’re going to focus on having a breakout on that particular topic where those teams can go in to more detail. But, at the end of the day I think it’s an opportunity for us.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Jeffrey Evenson – Sanford & Bernstein.
Jeffrey Evenson – Sanford & Bernstein: Wondering if you could give us some insights in to what type of projects with service providers seem to be gaining the most traction and I’m thinking if you could divided it maybe in to wireline versus mobile and then just adding capacity to existing products versus starting new projects?
Kevin R. Johnson : The way I would frame a lot of the new activity and the new focus is in the area of mobility. For us in many ways two things, number one mobile security. When you look at the marketplace anytime you have an explosion of devices, ubiquitous use of devices, lots of applications and connectivity to the internet you start to open up the risk and concerns of malware and viruses and security issues. So our SRX and the solutions that we have with the SRX and Junos Pulse have seen a lot of activity in the area of mobility. The second thing then is with the announcement of the MX 3D the fact that we’ve got the world’s first universal edge router that can scale on three dimensions whether it’s traffic, number of users or the number of services provider to the user I think that’s generating opportunity as well. Now, certainly on the wireless side traffic continues to grow and people have to continue to manage and tune their networks so continued build outs on the wireline side continues but when it comes to mobility I think that’s where we’re seeing a lot of opportunity.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Simona Jankowski – Goldman Sachs.
Simona Jankowski – Goldman Sachs: Kevin, I just wanted to ask you it sounds like a lot of your incoming opportunities in the service provider segment are coming from some of these new areas like security and managed services. How do margins in those areas compare to your traditional IPG businesses?
Kevin R. Johnson : Well, I think they compare favorably to what you have seen. I think when you look at some of the areas like managed services certainly that brings in a flavor of our EX switch business and some of the solutions that are applicable in the enterprise which is a little bit different than routing but at the end of the day I think from a margin perspective as I think Robyn highlighted in our guidance that we’re forecasting even with the growth in these areas to be within our long term guidance range of 66% to 68%.
Robyn M. Denholm : I think you covered it Kevin. You just need to look at our segment operating margins. We saw very healthy growth in the IPG segment which has the switching business as well as in the SLT and the security area. We maintained a very high operating margin that we actually was a record last quarter and we maintained that this quarter so I think the numbers speak for themselves.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Nikos Theodosopoulos – UBS.
Nikos Theodosopoulos – UBS: My question is on the AT&T commentary, they broke over 10% I think you said for the quarter and the year. I think that’s the first time they were ever a 10% customer let alone for the year. Can you talk about is that sustainable in to next year? Was there something unique in the quarter there? And, were they the only big addition sequentially for you or were there other strong customers here in the US?
Kevin R. Johnson : First of all, we had a number of strong customers in the US and worldwide so it wasn’t just the relationship that we have with AT&T. Second, AT&T is clearly a very important customer of ours and we’re pleased with the relationship and we’re going to continue to work hard to earn the opportunity to do business with them. That’s part of our job to be good at innovating and good at building that relationship and solving customer problems and I think what you see is the reflection of the work that we’ve done and its certainly our intent to continue to work hard on new design wins and continue to expand the relationship with all of our customers.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Tal Liani – Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Tal Liani – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I have a broad question on EX, if you don’t mind to give us an update on your plans for the year, where do you see the growth coming from predominately? Is it through agreements you have with big system integrators or maybe more direct selling, direct meaning distribution channels? Also, on profitability if you can give us an update kind of more the way you see the year coming through?
Kevin R. Johnson : I’ll take the first half of that and then I’ll hand it over to Robyn on the profitability question Tal. First of all the growth that we’re seeing in the EX certainly is focused on the enterprise and certainly service providers contributed to that growth this quarter as well as they’re providing managed services and services in to the enterprise. Frankly, I expect growth through all channels. I expect growth through managed services in the service provider channel, I expect growth through the big relationships that we have with IBM and Dell as that kicks in and I expect growth through our traditional channel. Much of that is raising awareness and visibility of the offerings and the value that we have in the marketplace and continuing to drive against our connected sales and marketing agenda. I’ll comment too it’s not just the EX, it’s the entire portfolio that is helping create that value proposition. Robyn, do you want to comment on the profitability question?
Robyn M. Denholm : Tal, on the profitability side in terms of what you saw this quarter for Q4, we had a sequential increase in revenue of 14% and we drove a significant improvement in the operating margin quarter-over-quarter, about 3.6 points. As I said what I think will happen during the year, the macro environment will continue to strengthen. I gave you a bit of color in terms of how we think the first half versus the second half in terms of revenue should play out. We also believe that we will expand operating margins as we go throughout the year but we’re measuring ourselves on a year-over-year basis for the full year. We believe that for the full year we’ll expand operating margins over the 2009 period of time.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Richard Gardner – Citi.
Richard Gardner – Citi: Kevin, I was just hoping that you might give us an update on your OEM partnerships with IBM and Dell and how those are progressing, especially IBM and whether there was meaningful revenue contribution from these partners in the fourth quarter and what product specifically you’re seeing the most traction through these channels?
Kevin R. Johnson : I’ll start with IBM, keep in mind that we just probably early November so kind of late in Q4 that IBM even started shipping the OEM version of the EX and the MX products and so as a result IBM also resells a lot of the Juniper products but the OEM component of that was fairly insignificant it was just a few million. But, at the end of the day IBM continues to play a big role in our reach to enterprise customers and so it’s still very early days with the OEM but I would say that our partnership with IBM continues to get stronger and we continue to build that partnership out. Just a quick update on Dell, we’re very pleased with the work that we’re doing with Dell and right now I would expect that it would be in Q2 sometime that the OEM version of the products through Dell would come to market. So, it’s still early days there as well.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Paul Silverstein – Credit Suisse.
Paul Silverstein – Credit Suisse: Kevin and Robyn if I can just return to the question on AT&T, was it close to being 10% in any other quarter in the year?
Kevin R. Johnson : The answer is probably yes. They had a fairly reasonable spending pattern through many of the quarters. I don’t know the specific numeric but this wasn’t an incident where all of their spending came in Q4. Robyn do you want to add?
Robyn M. Denholm : That’s exactly right.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Ehud Gelblum – Morgan Stanley.
Ehud Gelblum – Morgan Stanley: Robyn one to you and then a follow up; just quickly you’re now above run rates that you had previously when you had 25% operating margin, you’re back there again. If you look at next year and you kind of block out the way you’re looking at it you’ve always described your operating margin targets as 25% or more, how should we be looking at that as we get to the year? Will you end the year at 27% to 28%? Can this business run to 30% as we look in to 2011? How are you looking at the play between letting operating margin run, and I guess this is a question as well for Kevin, versus letting more of the margin go in to R&D to field future projects so maybe it only stays at 26% to 27%?
Robyn M. Denholm : I’ll tackle the first part of that question Ehud and then hand it over to Kevin. From my perspective, as we said we do expect operating margins to expand over the 2010 period of time and the Q1 number of 21% plus or minus a half is actually higher than the full year operating margin for 2009 so we do expect continued expansion on that front. It will be measured because we do continue to fund our R&D agenda and Kevin will go in to that a little bit more.  But, the other perspective is that we are very committed to our long term operating margin targets as we’ve talked about before and they are at 25% or higher on the bottom line as we grow at 20% plus over time. With that, I’ll hand it over.
Kevin R. Johnson : I would just complement Robyn’s answer with a couple of key points, the first one is that as you saw the performance in Q4, this business has a lot of operating leverage opportunity in it. If we start driving revenue the fact that we invest a dollar in R&D that can then be monetized in both the service provider sector and the enterprise sector is a very powerful formula. If we can accelerate revenue growth there is a lot of operating margin expansion that we can drive.  Now, as we’re accelerating out of this downturn obviously if there are investments that we can put in to further accelerate that growth in revenue that’s what’s going to drive the most profitability for shareholders so certainly those investments may come near term more in the form of sales and marketing that help us accelerate out of the downturn. Now, long term certainly keeping our eye on the R&D agenda, and we feel very good about the execution that we had in R&D in 2009, we feel very good about the decisions that we’ve made in terms of allocation of R&D resources in 2010. So I think in many ways we’re going to execute against that R&D agenda in 2010 and the more we can accelerate the more operating leverage we’re going to get. Your question of could this business over the next few years if we get enough operating leverage and break through rise above 25% operating margins? The answer is absolutely it could. Our job right now today is to accelerate out of the downturn and that is the strategy.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Simon Leopold – Morgan, Keegan & Company, Inc.
Simon Leopold – Morgan, Keegan & Company, Inc.: When we sort of think about the coming quarters in your forecast, I’m reflecting on the Q4 guidance which was wrong but wrong in a good way and then you had good upside. Just if you could talk a little bit about your philosophy of providing the forecast and what you were mistaken about in providing the lower forecast in Q4 so what surprised you and take that in to how confident you are in your Q1 outlook?
Robyn M. Denholm : I think the way we approach forecasting every quarter is we actually call it like we see it. We’re not trying to second guess what we’re seeing in terms of our demand indicators, pipeline, etc. and we also set our guidance in discussion with our customers as well. So that’s what we do each quarter. We were pleasantly surprised in the fourth quarter in terms of the ramp of the service provider business particularly in the US. We saw that sort of pick up a little bit faster than we were originally expecting. The linearity was good and the pace of that was very good. We expect that to continue although we think that things get off to a slower start in the first quarter given January is the reset for a lot of our customers in terms of their new fiscal year, etc. just like it is for us. So, that’s really reflected in our guidance and in the range itself.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Analyst for John Robertson – Pacific Crest Securities.
Analyst for John Robertson – Pacific Crest Securities: Kevin, I had a follow up question on that, obviously as you look at deferred revenue here a lot of momentum, highest sequential increase in five years, one could argue a bit of an inflection point yet you are still guiding to a below normal seasonal Q1 implying a level of conservatism here. My question is what’s driving the conservatism? Is it tied to the timing of orders, of some projects, any color that you could provide on the level of activity in conversations you’re having with service providers in particular around their spending plans this year would be helpful.
Kevin R. Johnson : I think first of all you look at Q1 of 2009 and I think it was a sequential 17% quarter-on-quarter decline from Q4 2008. I think in many ways you look at that pattern of spending that started back when the macroeconomics situation was a lot more questions around it. I think today as our customers have worked through a lot of how they’re playing through the economic downturn, the bigger question is right now whether or not as they enter their fiscal year they’ve landed and finalized their capital budgets and how much of that has been released. I think that varies customer by customer.  Certainly, when I look long term at the fundamentals of the networking industry traffic volumes continue to grow, there’s more users on more devices, there’s more user scenarios in mobility wireless, there’s opportunity certainly to the earlier question that was raised about optical and routing, there are a significant number of opportunities for us. So, I think in terms of putting the guidance together as Robyn said we looked and said that quarter-on-quarter typically in the enterprise spending Q1 is a lower capital spend for enterprise customers than Q4.  We’re projecting our enterprise business roughly flat quarter-on-quarter and the one variable is the service providers. So could that number be lower? Yes. Could it be higher? Sure. But, I think based on our best roll up from our field teams and our look at the business I think we’ve offered a realist range of guidance.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Sanjiv Wadhwani – Stifel Nicolaus & Company.
Sanjiv Wadhwani – Stifel Nicolaus & Company: Just one clarification and a question; Kevin, you suggested that service provider spending is likely to be about 13% to 15% this year over 2009?
Kevin R. Johnson : That’s addressable market. That’s looking at total market and that’s based on triangulating a number of analyst data points combined with our own assessment of what is happening in the geographies but that’s an addressable market point for service provider sector.
Operator:  Your next question comes from William Choi – Jefferies & Co.
William Choi – Jefferies & Co.: Just on AT&T I’m curious if there’s any particular rev req issues? You talked about a very consistent quarterly deployment cycle but I’m wondering if there was more rev req done in the Q4?
Robyn M. Denholm : No. As you saw, our deferred revenue was up significantly not only quarter-over-quarter but year-over-year and I also pointed out that there was no one customer that actually created that increase if you like so there was no deferral, it’s actually very consistent with a normal quarter.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Ittai Kidron – Oppenheimer & Co.
Ittai Kidron – Oppenheimer & Co.: Robyn I wanted to drill a little bit to reconcile some of the comments you’ve made. First, looking at enterprise 1% growth actually looks pretty weak on a quarter-over-quarter basis and I’m trying to reconcile that with some of the growth you had by the way you slice it on the product side, specifically that you mentioned EX was $74 million, correct me if I’m wrong which means that by itself contributed to 3% growth quarter-over-quarter relative to September and that implies that every other product within enterprise was actually down quarter-to-quarter down shipping in to the enterprise channel unless you are shipping a lot of EX in to the carrier channels. So, if you could clarify how much of EX is really going in to carriers and is my interpretation correct that actually your enterprise business excluding EX was actually down quarter-over-quarter? And, do you expect EX to maintain momentum in to March or could it actually finally take a breather here and be down in March?
Kevin R. Johnson : Let me just handle the first part and then I’ll let Robyn comment on a couple of specific numbers. First of all the EX revenue grew 50% quarter-on-quarter so another strong indicator of customer acceptance of the EX product line. The thing that you have to be careful of is part of that EX growth we counted in the service provider sector but it’s used for managed services to service enterprise customers. So, as enterprise customers look to the service providers certainly service providers will be buying product in our enterprise solutions that are serving enterprise customers so I think that’s the bulk of what you saw in this particular quarter. I think Robyn’s got a couple of specific numbers she can share.
Robyn M. Denholm : In terms of the EX revenue, it was $74 million up as Kevin mentioned just under 50%. In terms of SLT in the enterprise what we said was that SLT itself was up significantly quarter-over-quarter and they actually had another record revenue quarter. They did sell quite a number of products in to the service provider sector as well. They had some good wins from a mobility perspective so we’re actually very pleased with our enterprise revenue growth. We had a very big Q3 revenue as well in the enterprise so we’re pleased with our performance in enterprise and for the full year we were up 11% in enterprise on a down market so we actually think we’re doing very well on the share side in enterprise.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Mark Sue – RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Sue – RBC Capital Markets: I’m trying to understand what may be additive to your top line growth rate in the mid to high teens in 2010? Does wireless for example add 100 basis points of growth? How do you do that without an acquisition? Does Stratus contribute meaningfully this year or is it IBM that can be a big deal late this year or all of the above?
Robyn M. Denholm : In terms of full year Mark I didn’t hear the first part of your question.
Mark Sue – RBC Capital Markets: I’m trying to see what may be additive to your top line growth rate this year assuming an economic recovery? What may actually swing it above that?
Robyn M. Denholm : As Kevin said, from an enterprise perspective we’re expecting the market to grow in the single digits but actually from our perspective we believe we’re going to continue to take share driving both in the switching area but also in the security area. In terms of service provider we expect that market to grow in the 12% to 15% range and actually we’ll continue to execute well in our edge and core routing business but also continue to expand in the areas that we have been recently around mobile security and our SRX products in to carrier space as well. Again, carriers we always talk about wireless and wireline carriers, we’re also doing well in the cable sector and that contributed to our fourth quarter earnings as well.
Kevin R. Johnson : Mark, I think things that can help us continue to accelerate on the growth agenda in 2010 are in many ways our sales and marketing getting more connection with customers on the mobility solutions we have around security and things that we can do to help them as the wireless sector grows, things that we’re doing to raise awareness in the enterprise and continue to build partnerships and drive our sales and marketing execution in to the enterprise. That’s what’s going to enable us to accelerate on our growth, it’s with the set of products and services that we have today and the things that we have in the pipeline. I think in a lot of ways it’s doing a great job on executing on our routes to market.
Operator:  Your next question comes from John Marchetti – Cowen & Company.
John Marchetti – Cowen & Company: Just curious guys, as you are looking out in to that 1Q quarter there and you talked a little about how this one really surprised you a little bit on the service provider side, as you look out in to 1Q if there is upside to those numbers would you again expect it from the North American carrier market? Are there other areas where you really see meaningful upside to the guidance that you’re giving out there next quarter given the way this quarter really seemed to surprise you guys on the high end?
Robyn M. Denholm : I think in terms of our guidance we see the range as we called it. In terms of possible scenarios that are out there we have not yet seen a significant recovery in either our APAC or our EMEA service provider demand trends so there’s obviously opportunities in those markets. We believe we’ve served customers really well in those markets and we’ll continue to do that. In Q4 we saw the Tier-1 US service providers spend more and they were reflected in our results.
Operator:  Your last question comes from Jason Ader – William Blair & Company, LLC.
Jason Ader – William Blair & Company, LLC: My question is Kevin do you think that 20% revenue growth is possible in 2010? Then, a real quick one on top of that is have you guys talked at all about your opportunity in wireless backhaul?
Kevin R. Johnson : On your first question of 20% growth in 2010 we’re only offering guidance for our first quarter of the year. Certainly, we have aspirations to get to our long term operating model which is to grow at 20% plus and to expand operating margins to 25% plus. So, we stay focused on that long term operating model. Will we get there in 2010? I don’t know. Right now we’ve guided for Q1 and we’re just going to continue to drive good execution and good thinking in the business and just continued sustained progress as we take share and as we grow in the market and we’ll see where that leads us. On backhaul, we have a mobile backhaul solution, the BX product that we have in the market and so we do have a play in mobile backhaul.
Kathleen Bela: That will conclude today’s conference call. We’d like to thank you again for joining us today and we hope to see many of you in San Francisco on February 23rd. Thanks again.
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today’s teleconference. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Juniper Networks Third Quarter 2009 Earnings Results Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator instructions) It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Kathleen Bela, Vice President, Investor Relations of Juniper Networks. Thank you. You may begin.
Kathleen Bela: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Here today are Kevin Johnson, Chief Executive Officer and Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial Officer. Couple of housekeeping items before we begin. First as a reminder there is a slide deck that accompanies today's conference call. To access the slide please go to the IR’s section of our website at juniper.net. Also this call will be available to download as a podcast. For details you may also visit the IR’s section of our Website. With that I would like to remind everyone that statements made during this call concerning Juniper's business outlook, future financial operating results and overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors. Including economic conditions, generally or in the networking industry, changes in overall technology spending, the network capacity requirements of service providers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply chain constraints, variation in the mix of products sold, customer perceptions and acceptance of our products, litigation and other factors listed in our most recent report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event, facts or circumstances change after the date of this call. In discussing the financial results today, Robin will first present results on a GAAP basis and for purposes of today's discussion he will also review non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why the management team consider non-GAAP information a useful review of the company's financial results please consult our 8K filed this afternoon. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results please see today's press release. In general non-GAAP results exclude certain nonrecurring charges such as amortization and purchase intangibles other acquisition related charges and expenses related to stock-based compensation. In today's call, Robyn will also be providing forward looking guidance. As a reminder guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis. All guidance is forward-looking and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier. A GAAP EPS target is not accessible on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and no visibility with respect to the charges which are excluded from the non-GAAP business estimate today. Please note that today's call is scheduled to last for one hour and please limit your questions to one per firm. With that, I will turn the call over to Kevin.
Kevin Johnson: Thank you everyone for joining us today. In the third quarter we continue to see visibility improve in key areas of our business. I commented in the July call that it appeared we had hit a bottom in the first half of 2009. Our Q3 results support that view, that we are indeed in the early stages of an economic recovery. We are going to continue to monitor our phase of expansion carefully as we believe it will play out differently across geographic markets. For instance there are early signs that GDP in the US is turning positive near the end of the year and in fact, our results show improving performance domestically. In Europe we think the recovery will take hold more slowly while in Asia, where I just met with a number of customers, business trends are relatively stable. Sentiments are improving in Asia but the market there is not affected as badly by the down turn as other geographies. So even with improvements in visibility in 2 quarters of sequential growth, the pace of economic growth will vary across geographies. We are going to continue to execute our operating principles we laid out at the beginning of the year. To remind you those principles include assume an economic environment allocate resources effectively with a focus on investing in organic R&D and customer satisfaction, maintain agility and position for the upturn and maintain a strong balance sheet. These principles served as well again in the third quarter and as we delivered sequential growth in revenue expanded our operating margins and continue to invest in and deliver on our product roadmap. We are investing in the right places and controlling the right expenses thoughtfully throughout the business.  On the top line we saw significant growth in both the service provider and enterprise markets. On the service provider side visibility is improving, that works are running hotter as service providers manage their capital during the downturn but increasingly they are moving toward a period where spending is resuming. IP packets switch traffic continues to grow and our view is bandwidth demand will continue to double every two years for the next decade. Mobility and video are important drivers of that demand. For service providers investing in mobility is the priority. We are addressing mobility solutions today with a suite of products architected on a common platform JUNOS and a set of partnerships one of which includes Ericksson GGFN solution that runs on our M-Series routers. We saw a significant uptake of the high end SRX solution for security and session management of our service provider’s wireless networks. You will hear more about our work in the areas of mobility which is based on a view that we can deliver better scale economics to service providers though the convergence of their wire line and wireless networks.  This approach recognizes the future will require a new level of performance for massive scale of traffic users and services. Therefore we have anchored an approach on a platform that addresses the future scale demand of the unified network versus point solutions that do not address the future scale requirements. You should expect additional announcements and disclosures related to our approach in the near future. In addition to current industry trends, history show that when GDP is growing, service providers are at best in their networks. We saw an uptick in spending in the third quarter. We saw an uptick in deferred product revenue in the third quarter. We continue to see good activity in the fourth quarter and these are all positive forward indicators. Service providers are in the early phases of planning their capital budgets for 2010. It is a bit early to proclaim a consistent upward trend going into the new year but with traffic demand increasing and increase engagement with service providers we continue to agile as we set up for accelerated growth. Meanwhile we continue to generate momentum in the enterprise. Sequentially our enterprise revenue was up 10% quarter on quarter. As positive as that result is, we view our performance in the enterprise as just the starting point for the momentum we believe we can create going forward. A level of dialogue that we are having with our customers are on Junipers value proposition as accelerated significantly over the past two quarters. Customers are embracing our offering of integrated routing, switching and security on a common platform, our JUNOS Operating System. If they look forward our vision of the data center architecture of the future and the solutions we have today are resonating with our customers. We believe this positions us very well. We are executing better in the marketplace as we combine our connected sales and marketing strategy with strong partnerships. We implemented the strategy in the US at the beginning of the year and has enabled strong enterprise growth in the US. We are now implementing this model in EMEA and APAC as we look to continue to drive growth in the enterprise going into 2010. On the partnership front just thus week, IBM communicated to their field and their customers that the IBM the Juniper offerings are now available and we expect the first shipments to occur by the end of this month. In addition to expanding routes to market we are also seeing increased interests from partners who are innovating on JUNOS. Stratus and Akeena are examples of companies that are innovating on top of JUNOS to create solutions for customers.  As I look toward the end of 2009 and to the next year I am increasingly confident in Juniper’s position. The economy, though still fragile, is showing early signs of recovery. The secular growth drivers that tower our view of the network market opportunity remains firmly intact. Bandwidth demand, video mobility and the move to cloud base computing. Visibility in the Juniper’s end markets is improving and we are building execution momentum. We continue to invest in R&D and that investment is paying off.  New products in our core routing, in switching, in security are helping to drive growth and expand our relevance in both the service provider and enterprise factors. Offerings like our SRX line of products are ideally suited to the mobility market. We are addressing new opportunities in the cloud and we are consistently delivering on our R&D roadmap.  If this organic investment in innovation that is the key value creator for Juniper. Juniper is a Company built on great R&D. The stack stands out in the technology marketplace that it is seeing increased consolidation and plethora of point solutions. The industry consolidation of point solution without the technical integration pushes the complexity to the customer and increases their overall operating expenses. Our value proposition addresses these customer challenges in a compelling way. We offer truly integrated products on a common platform that drives the lower total cost of ownership. This is enabled by our capability in organic R&D and amplified through partnerships based on JUNOS. We believe this approach is the cornerstone of the networking platform for the next decade. Our product portfolio delivered on the common JUNOS platform is geared for that environment. This is not to say that we will not or do not look at acquisition opportunities, we do look at them but we expect organic R&D to be our primary value creator. Even in a low or no growth economic environment, this approach should enable us to grow through shared gains near term and strengthen our unique intellectual property for the long term.  So in wrapping up, I think Juniper is in a very good position. The fundamental drivers of the networking marketplace are intact. We are very clear about our strategy and we are executing on it. we are accelerating in the enterprise and we are positioned for more success in the service provider market. We are expanding partnerships based on innovations around JUNOS. Our strategy is working and we are being very intentional and disciplined in our approach as the economic environment improves. Visibility is improving. Our execution is improving and I am confident we are coming out of the economic down turn stronger we good opportunities ahead.  I will ask Robin now to review the financial results in more details and we will take your questions.
Robyn Denholm: Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased with our third quarter financial results which again demonstrates that we are executing well in a market that appears to be stabilizing. Our sales execution in the quarter resulted in good revenue growth in enterprise on both the year-over-year and the sequential basis. Stable revenue increased product deferred revenue and increased backlog are providing greater evidence to increased spending in the service provider market. The improved demand coupled with solid execution of our business results in continued in organic R&D and customer support are partly controlling operating expenses elsewhere in the business resulted in improved margins and strong free cash flows for the quarter. Our year to date results emphasizes the success of our execution as we continue to innovate and deliver on our product roadmap while reducing total non-GAAP operating expenses.  As Kevin mentioned earlier, while the global continues to present near term challenges in the market place our third quarter results serve to validate the operating principles under which we are managing the Company and we are well positioned to success that whenever the market recovers. In today's call, I will focus on the following four areas. First, I will review the financial results for the quarter. Third, I will provide an update on our cost reduction and operational excellence initiatives. And finally I will conclude with our guidance for the third quarter. Now, on to a discussion of the numbers. On a GAAP basis total revenue for the third quarter was $824 million, which was above the high end of our guidance for the quarter. This represents a 5% increase sequentially and an 13% decline from the prior year third quarter. Juniper reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of [$0.06] for the third quarter compared to $0.03 in the second quarter and $0.27 in the prior year third quarter. GAAP net income includes a nonrecurring income tax charge of $4.6 million related to our subsidiary in India and a restructuring charge of $4.5 million. Combined these items represent roughly $0.02 per diluted share. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.23 an improvement of $0.04 compared to the second quarter. The book to bill was greater than one for the quarter. Both shipment linearity and product to bill was the best we have seen this year. Looking more closely at revenue, I will give you color first on geography, then business segments and markets. Looking at our geographic revenue on a sequential the Americas revenue increased both in the US and in International Americas. The US growth was driven by our continued expansion in the Enterprise market.  EMEA revenue was up due to the growth in service provider and enterprise market. This growth was primarily driven by Western Europe. In APAC, revenue was down in both service provider and enterprise due to declines in China and Korea which were partially offset by growth in Malaysia and Japan. The resulting geographic mix of total revenue for the quarter was the Americas at approximately 51%, EMEA was at 30% and APAC was at 19% of total revenue. The Americas was up 2 points as a percentage of total revenue. On a year-over-year basis, total revenue was down in aggregate across all fields. However we achieved year-over-year revenue growth in the enterprise mix in both the Americas and in EMEA. On a segment basis, total IPG revenue of $595 million was up 2% sequentially and down 18% on a year-over-year basis. We saw improved performance sequentially from higher EX, M and T product revenue and higher services revenue. IPG revenue included over $50 million of EX switch revenue. Total SOT revenue of $229 million, was up 13% sequentially and up 5% on a year-over-year basis. Sequential revenue growth was driven strength in SRX and SSL VPN products. SLT product revenue includes $31 million of our recently launched SRX products. We are very pleased with the continued success of this product line where revenue more than doubled sequentially. Overall, we are encouraged with the ongoing return on investment of our R&D dollars as evidenced by the strong contributions of new products including MX, EX, and SRX product lines which contributed more than $190 million in product revenue in the quarter. We are also seeing good traction from our portfolio selling strategy with the same cost complimentary product from our routing, switching and security product lines. Looking more closely at the markets we address, service provider revenue was 64%, and Enterprise revenue was 36% of total revenue. Service provider revenue was up 2% and Enterprise revenue was up 10% sequentially. Our growth in the enterprise was forward base with particular strength in the US markets. As Kevin noted earlier our success in the Enterprise a result of our to offer portfolio of routing, switching and security integrated on JUNOS and our improved go to market capabilities. We also saw good growth in both SLT and EX sales into the service provider market. We are pleased to see results in our cross selling strategy as IPG sales grew 25% sequentially in enterprise and SLT product sales grew 43% sequentially in service provider. Verizon which represented a 10% revenue customer is a great example of our success in cross selling of our portfolio products.  For more detail on our revenue break out by geography business segment and market please refer to the slide available on today’s webcast.   Turning to gross margins, on a non-GAAP basis, total gross margins for the quarter were 65.8% of revenue. Product gross margins were 67.8% of revenue, up from 66.2% in the second quarter. This increase was primarily due to lower manufacturing cost and product mix and to a lesser extent geography mix. Services gross margins were 59.2% of revenue, up from 57.9% in the second quarter. This was also due to good cost management. .Moving on to our operating expense discussion, as we have said throughout the year in an environment where revenue is down year-over-year we will manage our full year operating expenses flat to down while maintaining our investment in our innovation roadmap. I am proud of our team’s discipline and continuing to execute against this objective.  Year to date we have reduced total non-GAAP OpEx by 4% compared to the same period in 2008 while redeploying investment into R&D and customer support. We have increased R&D headcount by 6% year-over-year deploying the majority of those increases into lower cost regions. We will continue to manage expenses thoughtfully through this period of time of economic uncertainty and beyond. For Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $371 million or 45.1% of revenue. Overall, relative to the second quarter, operating expenses decreased $8 million or 2% as expected on revenue growth of 5%. R&D expenses were approximately $171 million or 20.7% of revenue, a slight increase of $2 million compared to the second quarter. Sales and marketing expenses totaled $166 million or 20.2% of revenue a $6 million sequentially driven by the sequential increase in revenue. General and administrative expenses totaled $34 million or 4.2% of revenue. This is flat with the second quarter. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $171 million, resulting in an operating margin of 20.8% of revenue, A strong 2.7 points growth sequentially. Looking at our operating margins by segment, IPG operating margin was 21.3%, up slightly from the second quarter and as a reminder our investments in both the EX and Project Stratus are included in the IPG segment. SLT operating margin was 19.4%, up 8.5 points from the second quarter. This represents a record operating margin from SLT. This strong performance is due to a sequential revenue increase of 13% which was also a record and increased proportion of service provider, continued success in portfolio selling into the Enterprise as well as good cost control. I am pleased with the control progress in the operating margins of SLT. Turning to the bottom line, Juniper posted non-GAAP net income of $123 million for the quarter, up 18% sequentially. Non-GAAP net income and other expense was $3 million for the quarter, down $1 million sequentially. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 29.2%. The increased rate is reflective of our geographic distribution of revenue and therefore taxable income. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.23 in the third quarter, up 4% sequentially and down $0.09 from the prior year figure of $0.32.  Looking at the balance sheet as of September 30 we ended the third quarter with nearly $2.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments. This balance was up approximately $200 million from the prior quarter. We generated good cash flow from operations in the quarter of approximately $224 million, down from $149 million in the second quarter. During the quarter we repurchased approximately 2.9 million shares at an average price of $24.67 per share or approximately $72 million. Our weighted average shares outstanding for the third quarter were approximately 538 million shares on a diluted non-GAAP basis, up slightly with the prior quarter. CapEx for the quarter totaled $34 million and depreciation and amortization was $36 million consistent with prior quarters. DSOs decreased to 41 days from 49 reported in the second quarter. This increase is the result of timing of shipments in the quarter and the timing of our cash receipts from our customers.  Total deferred revenue was slightly down from the second quarter at $643 million, however more importantly product deferred revenue was up 7% or $13 million. Services deferred revenue decreased by 4% or approximately $18 million. Year-over-year, our total deferred revenue balance increased by a healthy $81 million or 14%. Moving on to headcount, at September 30, Juniper had 7,034 employees, a net increase of 14 sequentially. While this is a relatively negligible net number this has been the case throughout the year, Shift have been made in our various businesses areas to support our R&D efforts and customer service.  Additions this quarter will largely focus in customer services and we continue targeted reductions across our marketing and other areas of the Company. Year-over-year R&D increased 6% and customer service increased 8% while total headcount increased 3%. On a year to date basis the Company has eliminated approximately 275 positions while total headcount has increased a net of 20. This demonstrates our commitment to redistributing employees to our focus areas. The geographic distribution of our total headcount is 59% in the Americas, 24% in India and China and 11% in EMEA and 6% in the rest of Asia-Pacific. This represents a shift in head count to lower cost regions of approximately 2%.  Now let us turn to our guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis, except for revenue and share count. Even in our improved visibility and potentials for improvement in the US service provider market as well as continued share gains within enterprise we expect out Q4 to range between $860 million and $895 million. We are expecting gross margins to Q4 to be roughly flat with the third quarter and this is within our mid-term range of 65% to 67%. We will continue to focus on prudent management of our operating expenses while also ensuring we meet our innovation road map. We expect our total operating expenses for the December quarter to increase at a slower rate than revenue, resulting in a slight increase in operating margins for the quarter. With a revenue range of between $860 million $895 million we expect Q4 non-GAAP EPS to range between $0.23 and $0.26. This is assuming a tax rate of approximately 29% and assuming a flat share count compared to Q3.  In summary, as we have demonstrated year-to-date 2009 we have been able to manage our cost structure well within our anticipated revenue opportunity and at the same time continue to deliver great innovation to the marketplace. As we look forward, we will continue to be prudent with our cost and we will execute our investments in line with the market and economic recovery. In other news, we recently announced that we are moving our listing to the New York Stock Exchange and we will commence trading on October 29th. We believe this change aligns well with out strategic goals and we will be in New York next week to participate in the opening bell ceremonies and celebrate the listing with our customers, partners and investor. We will share more with you in regard to our corporate vision and strategic initiatives in the meeting being held following the market opening. To those of you who are not attending in person, the event will be webcast. With that I will hand it over to the operator for questions.
Operator: (Operator instructions) The first question is from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs: Just a question for Robyn and later on for Kevin. Robyn just want to get a sense for where the upside in the quarter changed from relative to your expectations and how to connect that with your deferred revenue decline and DSO also came down. So can you just comment on that a little bit more? And then the question for Kevin was going to be, I heard what you were saying about the organic strategy and the preference for the JUNOS over point products. However that being said there are certainly is a range of technology about there were it is unclear that a single vendor can fairly stretch and cover all of those. There is certainly wireless has been one recently brought into focus with the foreign Stratus acquisition. So can you just comment on striking that balance?
Robyn Denholm:  Okay I’ll answer your first question Simona, I think in terms of the revenue upside to guidance, I think it was pretty broad-based so in service provider side and on the enterprise side. I think the enterprise increase of 10% sequentially was probably a little bit higher than we were anticipating as I said the SLT revenue in its own mark was a record for the quarter so I think the US as Kevin mentioned we were seeing some signs of early recover there. In terms of service provider I just want to make sure that I was clear on the call. Product deferred revenue actually increased. We have seasonal reduction in our services, deferred revenue and as you know services is a large portion of the total deferred revenue and that normally we have bigger booking quarters in Q2 and Q4 and so we normally see a slight decline in services in deferred revenue in Q3 and Q1.  We are happy with our deferred revenue because product was up in the quarter and I will also mention that our backlog was up, our back to bill was positive and it was best that we’ve had this year.
Kevin Johnson: Yes o the second question Simona, thanks for that question first of all the fact that we focus on a single software code base that does routing, switching and security allows us to invest a dollar of R&D to ride the future and then be able to propagate that across the product portfolio including the EX, the SOX, the MX and others. What we find is that approach to the horizontal platform really simplifies things for customers which dramatically their total cost of ownership. Dramatically lowers their operating expenses. That combined with the work that we do in the Silicon plus the software plus the system allows us to also achieve the world’s most scalable high performance networking platform but do it in that horizontal manner. Now the organic R&D approach is really all about continuing to propagate that but then as you point that a single vendor can’t cover all these solutions. That is why our strategy is a pure playing high performance networking that embraces partners is so key. What we are finding is more and more partners are coming to us who are interested in innovating on top of JUNOS and we just a couple of examples today but ideally what we see is enabling the industry with this horizontal platform around JUNOS and then opening the application programming interfaces and opening up the innovation and then embracing in ecosystem of innovators, we thin at the end of the day that provides the customers the best of both worlds. The most reliable high performance networking platform at the lowest total cost of ownership combined with an ecosystem of innovators that can do a broad range of solutions to help them solve problems. 
Operator: The next question is from Tal Liani from Bank of America
Tal Liani - Bank of America:  I have a question about revenue break down this quarter and what is embedded in the guidance. You went a little bit through why infrastructure was up 0.4% sequentially versus the strong growth in0SLT, in your guidance which is above consensus do you expect infrastructure to grow faster next quarter or do you assume that the same trend will happen next quarter where SLT goes faster, Then the second question is about timing when service provider spending comes back, do you expect to start recognizing revenues immediately when orders are coming in or is there any delay embedded in revenue recognition. I am trying to understand the magnitude of any delay by revenue recognition. Thanks.
Robyn Denholm: Okay so in terms of our guidance going forward. I think what I said on the call was that we do have improved visibility on the potential for improvement in the service provider side and actually we expect to continue to execute on the enterprise side. SO I think that is what we have embedded in our guidance going forward.  In terms of the revenue deferrals, that sounds normal revenue accounting in terms of when we record revenue. What I call [collade] in terms of my guidance is always what we expect to record this revenue in that period of time.
Tal Liani - Bank of America:  When you say visibility, what do you mean visibility? Visibility meaning bookings that could be recognized or orders that could be recognized that quarter or do you mean more orders strength.
Kevin Johnson:  Clearly you see products deferred revenue is up, that is certainly one indicator but beyond that is R&D activity. It is direct engagement from our sales force with customers in the line of sight to the project and the timing of those projects and the visibility is improving.
Operator: The next question is from Nikos Theodosopoulos from UBS
Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS: I have two questions. Given the better visibility in service provider. I realized it is early in terms budget forecast for next year given that this is a down year in router spending by service providers and yet the traffic growth continues. Do you expect next year that we would see an abnormally strong year as there is some catch up spend or do you think that there is an ongoing pressure to manage the budgets as much as possible. Then the second question, given your planned with [Inaudible] out now do you envision a higher R&D budget next year for wireless IP or is that something you think you can partner with someone else at this point.
Kevin Johnson:  Thanks for you questions, Nikos, let me try and address those. Your question on visibility and service provider and the question about looking into the year 2010, I think we are not providing guidance for 2010 so I cannot really comment but I will go back to some of the principles that I discussed in the opening. The fact that networks are running hotter and service providers were very cautious on managing capital in the first half of the year. Visibility improving that all is favorable indicators. How will that play out in 2010. Service providers are in the early stages of planning their budgets not and so we will have to wait and see but we will certainly give more perspective on that in our January call. In terms of your question about managing the budget relative to that, my view is there is always an ongoing responsibility to be fiscally responsible and thoughtful about how we allocate resources when times are good and when times are tough and ideally what I want is we have got clarity strategy. We are in execution rhythm and we are going to be very disciplined about how we allocate resources to have the maximum impact in the market place. That [philosophy will not change as we go into the next year. In terms of your question on mobility and I will go back to Simona’s question. We have more and more partners coming to us to partner on JUNOS and that is because we have a platform that is of interest and can scale to the next decade and certainly as you point there are some partners that through consolidation maybe partner one day and get acquired another day. That does not change our strategy a bit, in fact we are very confident we have got line of sight to how to deliver on the mobility solution and we look forward to sharing about that with you in the near future.
Operator: The next question is from Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer & Co.
Itta Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co.: Thank you very much Robyn, a question, I wanted to focus on the gross margins first on the services side and it seems like you are now a little bit close to all time peak on that front. Is there anything you can do more here or you think we are pretty much leveling and on the product if you just take the mid-point of your revenue guidance fore the next quarter, in turns out around $875 million. If you look in 2008 and roughly same revenue levels you are at above 70% gross margin. What will it take for you to get back to 70% margin? What is holding you back, and if it is just aggressive pricing why do you think that will ever change really?
Robyn Denholm: Thank you for that Ittai, I think the biggest factor this quarter on both the services and the product gross margin is actually is discipline on the cost side. The change has been phenomenal they are working very well with our supply chain on the manufacturing side and continue to execute on that front. On the services side the same thing. Last quarter as you recall we did increase our purchases of spare parts to help us with the increasing demand on the enterprise side and so that actually depressed their margins a little bit last quarter and so we that improved this quarter but we also saw costs management as well. And that has been a big factor this quarter, I mean obviously one of the big factors in our gross margin particularly on the product side of any quarter is our product mix and we saw some strength in our SLT and M Series this quarter but that always has an impact on our gross margin as well.
Tal Liani - Bank of America: So what will you get back to 70 on the product side?
Robyn Denholm: By continued focus on the innovation that we are doing, continued focus on cost, continued focus on SLT execution.
Kevin Johnson :  Let me just add to that too. I think as Robyn pointed out, as we expand product portfolio and as we expand geographically putting spares in the depots and making sure we have got the resources to deliver great customer services is key and so part of our success in the market expanding the product and expanding geographies places some responsibility for us to make the right investments to have great customer satisfaction.  The second thing too is as we bring on new customer, as we expand and diversify the customer we‘ve got new JUNOS customers. So we are engaging and supporting our new JUNOS customers in those early deployments. We want them to have a great first experience. I am going to stand behind our customer service team and the work they and the impact they make and the investment we make there. That serves our Company well for the long term and certainly as Robyn said there are opportunities for us to improve margins but there are also some very, very good solid reasons why these investments are needed.
Operator: The next question is from Mark Sue from RBC Capital Markets
Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets:  Just trying to calculate where service providers rather is up sequentially during the quarter and for your guidance, are you factoring in some CapEx and perhaps some catch up spends. Should we start thinking abut increased seasonality in your business such as in the March quarter as enterprise grows as a percentage of revenues. Lastly if you touch on cash how big IBM revenues can be in the near term?
Robyn Denholm: What I commented on Mark was the service provider was up 2% sequentially, in total, and that obviously includes all of our products and in terms of the IPG revenue that was also 2% sequentially as well.
Kevin Johnson:  Mark I will take the question on IBM. Long term I’ve got very high aspiration for the IBM partnership and we continue to make progress in that partnership on all front. Near term though I have modest expectations fro how that translates to revenue but long term is key and we are making good progress and I think you see continued step forward there and it is a key partnership for us. 
Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets: Any thoughts on CapEx budget or catch up spend from service provider?
Kevin Johnson:  If you look at service providers and what they have stated their annual CapEx budgets are and in each one, some are being more public about what they intend to spend that in the 4th quarter or not you can calculate what percentage of seasonal capital spend will come in the 4th quarter because the first half was perhaps a little bit tighter maybe it is little but higher than normal but I don’t think too far out of range of perhaps what you have seen in other years from the seasonality perspective. You can do the math based off the earnings reports from the service providers and I think that gives a reasonable gauge.
Operator: The next question is from Jeff Evenson from Sanford Bernstein
Jeff Evenson – Sanford Bernstein: Taking the question that was just asked on catch up spending a bit further, you said during the call that service providers are running their networks a bit hotter. Do you expect that at some point over the next couple of years that they try to take them back to past utilization levels or that they are comfortable where they are now?
Kevin Johnson: My perspective is and I studied this patterns over the last ten years and as I commented when GDP is good or growing, service providers will invest than in times are tough and they will run hotter and I do not think that trend you have seen over the last decade. I don’t see that changing going forward over the next couple of years. Therefore you could argue that there are good signs of economic recovery happening, if you know it, it will vary by geography that would bode well for continued investments in the network to support the traffic. The traffic continues to grow that is a constant and that is not changing and so there is going to be continued pressure to make sure that the infrastructure is in place to carry that traffic and deliver the quality of service that their customers expect.
Jeff Evenson – Sanford Bernstein: Scale modeling question, in past fourth quarters your OpEx has been down sometimes a bit because you’ve lapse the Ficus spending limit, should we expect that this fourth quarter?
Robyn Denholm: I think with the still intensive OpEx is that we will grow slightly less than our revenue growth in the fourth quarter.
Operator: The next question is from Brent Bracelin from Pacific Crest Securities
Brent Bracelin - Pacific Crest Securities: I have a question on linearity, Kevin you have the linearity that you have seen this year. Does that mean you are coming back to normal or just less back end loaded than what you saw in Q1 and Q2 and then as you think about the trends in October here, How should we think about linearity and what you expect for Q4.
Kevin Johnson: I think it was Robyn’s comments on linearity but your question, are we back to normal, I have been in this job for a year now and I have not seen normal. If you look at business this is the best that we have seen in the last 4 to 6 quarters relative to linearity and Robyn you want to comment further?
Robyn Denholm: The linearity and the book to bill as I said was the best that we have seen this year.
Brent Bracelin - Pacific Crest Securities: So going to into Q4 linearity could further improve then as well?
Kevin Johnson: Linearity can always change. What we’ve guided and what we commented here is based on our perspective coming out of Q3 and what we have seen thus far in Q$.
Operator: The next question is from Jeffrey Kvaal from Barclays Capital
Jeffrey Kvaal - Barclays Capital:  Robyn I want to get back to the operating margin targeted you have given us in the past. You talked about 25%, you are really not that far away from the operating margin but you hit a $950 in sales and you are really not that far away from that too. So would you be able to provide us a little more color on how you are thinking of that please. 
Robyn Denholm:  In terms of our long term model where we committed to 25% or higher on the operating margin line and we also committed to our long term growth rate as well as 20% plus on the top line. So in terms of the second part of the second part of your question with regard to the revenue level, the last time were above 950 was last year and last quarter last year was 948 and we did 25.1% operating margin. The single biggest difference was the gross margin in that quarter was a couple of points higher as you know from the model. So we need to continue to focus on our operating expenses and our gross margins to hit our long term operating model. 
Jeffrey Kvaal - Barclays Capital:  So 950 is not necessarily the right place to think with 25% again because of the gross margins you have. 
Robyn Denholm:  Well as I have said in my guidance we are expecting slight gross margins in Q4 so that would…, and we also said that we would grow OpEx at a slower rate than revenue so we do expect the slight expansion in our operating margins. 
Operator: The next question is from Paul Silverstein from Credit Suisse
Paul Silverstein - Credit Suisse:  Robyn going back to you model, focusing just on the gross margin line before we talk about OpEx. It looks like several levels of revenue back in March of 2008, your gross margin was 253 hundred basis points higher and you cited good cost control along with good product mix from the quarter. Since we were down the road in terms of the ability to expand gross margin. Putting aside the revenue growth in your OpEx structure, is it a changed environment where we should not expect to do much better than 65%? Could you comment on pricing as part of that? I am also trying to understand the difference today given your product mix, given the cost controls you cited, as you are coming out of a difficult economy but if you could give us some insight before I ask the next one?
 :
Robyn Denholm:  I think in terms of gross margin area the single biggest factor in any quarter is our mix and that is various products and geography mix. The comment that I was talking in the script were really on a sequential basis, single positive factor was actually costs. So what we do is we [paid]in the marketplace and the marketplace is what it is and we contyinue to drive our cost and our operational excellence measures to improve the margin on an ongoing basis. 
Kevin Johnson:  One of the most important things I think we can do as a Company to maintain or even expand the gross margin is drive innovation. The more value we create our product set in the marketplace whether it is reducing total cost of ownership or solving problems for customers that consume power, less floor space, generate less heat, can handle more scale, and reduce the cost per bit of traffic. The investment in R&D is in many ways a very, very key ingredient to our ability to compete, take share and maintain a price that we think allows us to expand that gross margin.  We have been investing in R&D, we have been delivering against that product road map. We have been diversifying our customer base and then there are some things that certainly would pull down on that. Certainly in a tough economic situation. It is very competitive and we have seen of that this year. With that said, I think we have tried to manage very thoughtfully how we work through that without big dips in gross margin. We had a little bit last quarter but we are back to within a range this quarter nut also then in the investments that I mentioned earlier in terms of customer satisfaction as we are taking on new customers, our services teams are going to work hard to help them have a great experience and that will require our continued focus on the services side. So look there are some things give us upward and there are some things that will pull that down and we are going to manage in a thoughtful way.
Operator: The next question is from Sanjiv Wadhwani from Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.
Sanjiv Wadhwani - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.:  Kevin the performance of the enterprise business, obviously you are clearly executing much better so that does not sit really better. Can we talk whether the market condition are also getting better over there. For Robyn huge increase in SLT margins is there further room for improvement there. Does that business get to the 25% corporate goal or do you get to 25% by really improving the4 IPG margins?
Kevin Johnson: I do believe we are executing better and I think a lot of that improved execution coming mainly from the US. From the operating model we implemented at the beginning of the year. We are now rolling that operating model to Europe and to Asia and I expect as we go into 2010 we are just going to discontinue to throttle up on our execution capability globally and I think that is serving us well, but clearly we are share takers in the enterprise marketplace and as we expand in the enterprise markets independent of a good economy or a bad economy we have got a lot of upside as a Company. With that said certainly IT budgets in the enterprise they tighten up those budgets this year relative to last year and again as economic conditions improve I would expect that the investment from enterprise will improve although that will improve at a floor rate than the capital investment of service providers.
Robyn Denholm: In terms of the SLT margins it is actually built on the same thing that Kevin was talking about. In terms of our ability to execute that, obviously, drive additional into SLT area of 13% sequentially and also we saw an increase proportion of styles in the service provider market which has a lower cost of styles traditionally for us and that continued success in the portfolio selling approach that we have had on the enterprise as well as the cross selling that I just talked about in terms of taking the same R&D and applying it to both markets, both service provider and enterprise markets actually helped to drive the increase in the operating margin and I think in terms of focus and tenacity this can team demonstrated the best of Juniper in terms of continuing to focus on that. A year ago the margins in SLT were single digit and we broke the 10% mark early this and have continued to focus all aspects of the business to drive that.
Sanjiv Wadhwani - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: Robyn do you expect SLT margins to get to the 25% corporate goal or do you think that is always going to be below of the 20%.
Robyn Denholm: There is nothing long term to suggest that they can’t get there and I have been saying that for some time. I actually think continuing to drive the volume that had a record quarter in terms of revenue this quarter continue to drive execution in both the SALs and also in the manufacturing and the rest of the operation and now continued to that. Another key point that Kevin made earlier. Innovation is behind those story in SLT as well. We deliver great products like the SRX products family to the market and customers value that.
Kevin Johnson: Let me add on the SLT margin, as Robyn said there is nothing that suggests we can achieve that objective in SLT and it is about scale economics. What you saw this quarter was the fact that we invest in R&D for the SRX that sell to the enterprise and in this quarter it is selling very well into the high end service providers. So $1 of R&D investment being able to monetize it multiple customer segments is about scale economics. As we came to market with our EX switch business and now we’ve got routing switching anD security portfolio for enterprise customers. That is generating a portfolio that is giving us more scale economics than the enterprise side. So it is just allowing us to better monetize every dollar of R&D investment as we go forward and those things will do nothing but benefit SLT.
Operator: The next question is from Richard Gardner from Citigroup
Richard Gardner - Citigroup: Kevin I was hoping that you could tell us how to rate in the composition of new customer wins with the EX this quarter compared to the alt couple of quarters and also could you talk about your pricing strategy as you enter this market. Obviously it is not unusual to price aggressively to gain a few reference customers. I heard a variety of investors express concern about some of the pricing on the EX line and we would like to hear you thoughts on that.
Kevin Johnson:  First of all on customer wins I do not have specific numbers, the two data points or two observations I would make. The level of buzz and dialogues we are having with customers in the enterprise, just quarter-on-quarter just continues to grow. Our field organization is very engaged and there are a lot of opportunities that were engaged in. Now how does that translate to wins and specific things, we will see how that translates. I actually think that buzz and that level of engagement is a leading indicator of our opportunity. The second thing statistically we looked in this quarter once again, over 50% of the new EX customers were portfolio customers. They purchased routing either EX and routing and or switching. SO that end-to-end solution of portfolio play is I think is serving as well. Certainly the discussion around data center architecture of the future and the Stratus combined with the fact that we have a solution to sell today based on the EX complimented with the SRX is really generating opportunity in the pipeline. From my perspective positive indicators but we have got to execute. We got to do well to engage that is why connected sales and marketing is important. That is why I am implementing it in Europe and Asia is important. I think supports the case that we can invest in R&D for the products that can land well both in the service provider segment and in the enterprise. In terms of pricing strategies and some of the questions earlier too around gross margins. Look I will just remind, our gross margin that we’ve held to at 65% to 67% and we are consistent on that and there some service gross margins, questions that came up about spares and some other things but certainly pricing is a key lever that we have and we are being very thoughtful about how we price the products across the portfolio and I would say right. Each area that I am going to focus more and Robyn looking out longer time on a pricing strategy but right now I am confident that we have got a strong product portfolio that resonates very well with customers. It is differentiated. It can command a premium price. We are pricing it fairly versus the value that we believe it delivers and with that approach we are gaining market share. I think that is our opportunity to make sure that we do not take our eye off the ball and we are going to continue to be very thoughtful about that. 
Kathleen Bela: Okay that is all the time we have this afternoon. I like to thank everyone for joining us today and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter. 
Operator: This concludes our teleconference. You may disconnect your lines. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Juniper Networks Second Quarter 2009 Earnings Results Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator instructions) It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Kathleen Bela, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.
Kathleen Bela: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Here today are Kevin Johnson, Chief Executive Officer and Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial Officer. Couple of housekeeping items before we begin. First as a reminder there is a slide deck that accompanies today's conference call. To access the slide please go to our Web site at juniper.net and click on the investor relations section. Also this call will be available to download as a pod cast. For details you may also visit the IR section of our Website. With that I would like to remind everyone that statements made during this call concerning Juniper's business outlook, future financial operating results and overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors. Including economic conditions, generally or in the networking industry, changes in overall technology spending, the network capacity requirements of service providers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply chain constraints, variation in the mix of products sold, customer perceptions and acceptance of our products, litigation and other factors listed in our most recent report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event, facts or circumstances change after the date of this call. In discussing the financial results today, Robin will first present results on a GAAP basis and for purposes of today's discussion he will also review non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why the management team consider non-GAAP information a useful review of the company's financial results please consult our 8K filed this afternoon. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results please see today's press release. In general non-GAAP results exclude certain nonrecurring charges such as amortization and purchase intangibles other acquisition related charges and expenses related to stock-based compensation. In today's call, Robyn will also be providing forward looking guidance. As a reminder guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis. All guidance is forward-looking and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier. A GAAP EPS target is not accessible on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and no visibility with respect to the charges which are excluded from the non-GAAP business estimate today. Please note that today's call is scheduled to last for one hour and please limit your questions to one per firm. With that, I will turn the call over to Kevin.
Kevin Johnson: Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us. The operating results we're reporting today are a result of disciplined execution against a clear set of principles that we defined at the beginning of the year. These principles were established to guide us as we navigate this global macro economic downturn. As a reminder the principles include assume challenging economic conditions, allocate resources effectively and reduce costs, maintain agility in position for the upturn, and preserve balance sheet strength. Now we continue to balance the economic realities of the near term with the focus on long term shareholder value creation. But things we can control, such as operating expenses. We have been very disciplined in our cost reductions while at the same time funding important work in R&D and customer support. We remain committed to that strategy. Customers have now had multiple quarters to assess the impact of this downturn on their business and they have adjusted as appropriate. Our flow of orders this quarter was not as back-end loaded as it was last quarter, which supports the view that the environment continues to stabilize. Our Q2 revenue of $786 million represents a 3% quarter-on-quarter growth. In the service provider segment, visibility to projects is improving, yet it is still very challenging to accurately predict timing of purchases. Visibility to projects not necessarily translate to visibility in timing of orders. Overall though long term demand drivers remain in tact as internet traffic continues to grow. Our service provider segment declined slightly quarter on quarter by about 1%. My sense is that we may be bouncing along the bottom in this segment yet our visibility into the timing of our recovery is limited. Therefore, we remain cautious, while focusing on our product road map and positioning ourselves for an eventual uptick in capital spending. Our opportunity pipeline in the enterprise segment is growing due to our entry into the switch market. We are also seeing improvement in the pattern of deal closure which suggests the visibility is improving. IT budgets are still constrained but clearly there are encouraging signs of demand for our enterprise value proposition. Those signs are reflected in our 12% quarter-on-quarter growth in the Enterprise segment. However, from a macro economic perspective, IT spending patterns will vary by industry and recovery will take some time. Our product portfolio along with a growing set of partners, we feel we're well positioned to outgrow the segment through share gains. Overall, long term growth fundamentals for high performance networking remain in tact. The economic environment continues to stabilize. There are areas where visibility is improving, yet at the same time we realize that the macro economic recovery will take time. Therefore, we will continue to maintain agility as we work through the economic situation on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Now let me share just a brief perspective on how our strategy combined with an execution focus has helped us improve our portfolio of products, expand our customer base and strengthen our partnerships. We are a leader in high performance networking and our investment in R&D enables us to have a compelling differentiated value proposition in the market. Through this downturn we have concentrated on delivering against our product road map as was evidenced in Q2. In the area of switching we expanded the family of EX switches with the EX8216 and the EX2500. The EX product family was introduced a year ago and it is now at an annual run rate of over $150 million and growing. We continue to diversify our customer base with key wins that include New York Stock Exchange, major financial services institutions, and large retailers including 7-11. These wins are also translating to satisfied customers and industry recognition. For example, our work with the U.S. Department of Energy's, ESnet4 which is a research and education network built on Juniper technology won the highly coveted excellence.gov award from the American Council for Technology and Industry Advisory Council. In the area of routing we continue to innovate in ways that help advance the scale, performance, security and reliability factors that define high performance networking. In the quarter we expanded our router relationships with several customers including Comcast and we were recognized at Enpothi Tokyo [ph] with a special award for the industry's first 100 Gig Ethernet line card. We see an increased number of third party solutions built on JUNOS. One example is an expanded set of voice services with our integrated multiservice gateway and a third party embedded Performance Monitor, Telchemy. This solution integrates Telchemy monitoring technology with JUNOS software and MX routers to attract and trouble shoot a broad array of IP services including voice and video. We introduced four new models of the SRX Services Gateway this quarter. These new models extend the SRX family which uniquely integrates routing, switching and security services into a single system. Keep in mind we introduced the SRX family late last year and this family of products is already approaching an annual run rate of $50 million and growing. These products all run JUNOS and are enabling a compelling and differentiated value proposition. This is translating to growth opportunities for Juniper Networks. As a pure plan high-performance networking that embraces partners we strengthened our customer value proposition with strategic partnerships in the market. This quarter we announced an expansion of our worldwide partnership with Nokia Siemens networks with a focus on carrier Ethernet transport solutions built on JUNOS. We're combining our MX Ethernet routers with NSN Ethernet switches and network management capabilities we're able to enable a JUNOS solution that delivers a fully interoperable centrally managed end to end carrier Ethernet solution for mobile backoff, business services and residential broadband network. We also announced that NSN is building an optical line card for our routers. These are just two examples of how strategic partnerships can enable a broader set of solutions for our customers. We continue to expand our partnership with IBM. Yesterday IBM announced that they would be selling an IBM branded version of our EX switching and MX routing products, all running on our JUNOS software platform as part of their data center networking portfolio. Many partners including NSN are building services on JUNOS. IBM will be shipping IBM branded systems run in JUNOS. We have an expanded product portfolio running JUNOS. JUNOS is a well architected programmable network operating system and this is a very important element of our strategy. Our market presence with our J-Partner continues to grow. The channel community is showing increased confidence in Juniper's high performance networking solutions and our commitment to them. I hope this gives you some insight into our operating approach and some of the observations from the quarter. I just want to take a moment and share a couple of comments on our capital structure and cash deployment strategy. This is not a new strategy. We want to share some principles with you as a way to be more transparent, and just reinforce our approach. I consider Juniper's strong balance sheet one of our core assets. Our balance sheet provides us with flexibility to run the business and sends an important signal of stability to our customers. I am also mindful of the fact that capital structure decisions are one of the most important responsibilities we have as a leadership team. In just a moment Robyn will walk you through the key principles in more detail that define our philosophy with respect to managing our cash and preserving a strong balance sheet. But let me outline the highlights. One, we will preserve sufficient levels of cash to run our business. Two, we will maintain cash to remain flexible to pursue growth opportunities in the market. And lastly, and importantly, we intend to return cash to shareholders that is in excess of required levels to manage and grow the company. Now, in summary I would like to reiterate some key takeaways for the quarters. First, we continue to operate in the challenging economic climate and the principles that have guided through this downturn remain unchanged. Second, stability continues to improve. And there are some areas where visibility to projects is improved, yet our ability to predict the timing of orders still remains somewhat limited. Finally, we will continue to remain cautious in our operating approach, with a clear strategy to position ourselves to drive top line growth, while expanding operating margins as the economic situation recovers. Let me now hand over to Robyn for a more detailed comments on the financial results and some guidance for Q3. Robyn?
Robyn Denholm: Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon everyone. Our second quarter financial results reflect solid execution in a market that remains challenging due to the global economic recession. We continue to make good progress in aligning our total expenses to current revenue opportunities, and as a result, we delivered improved operating margins and good free cash flows for the quarter. In today's call, I will focus on the following four areas. Firstly, I will review the financial results for the quarter. Second, I will provide additional insight into our cost reduction and operational excellence initiatives. Then I will discuss our capital structure and cash deployment strategy. And finally I will conclude with our guidance for the third quarter. Now, on to a discussion of the numbers. On a GAAP basis total revenue for the second quarter was $786 million, which was slightly better than the top end of our guidance for the quarter. This represents a 3% increase sequentially and an 11% decline from the prior year second quarter. Juniper reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.03 for the second quarter compared to a loss of $0.01 in the first quarter and compared to earnings of $0.22 in the prior year second quarter. GAAP net income includes a nonrecurring income tax charge of $52.1 million or $0.10 per diluted share related to a change in the tax treatment of stock-based compensation in R&D cost sharing arrangements. This charge was due to a Federal Appellate Court ruling in the Zyling [ph] case in the second quarter of 2009. GAAP net income also includes restructuring charges of $7.5 million or $0.01 per diluted share. Non-GAAP revenue was $786 million and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.19, an improvement of $0.02 compared to the first quarter. The product book to bill was greater than one for the quarter. I will focus the rest of my earnings commentary on revenue, gross margin and operating expenses. So now turning to revenue, I will give you color on geography, business segments and markets. In the America, revenue increased both on a sequential and on a year-over-year basis. This growth was driven by our continued expansion in the Enterprise market in the U.S. EMEA revenue was up slightly on a sequential basis due to the growth in service provider. As expected, APAC was down sequentially due primarily to a seasonally weaker quarter in Japan. Excluding Japan, APAC was up quarter over quarter driven by good growth in China. The resulting geographic mix of total revenue for the quarter was Americas at approximately 50%, EMEA was at 29% and APAC was at 21% of total revenue. On a segment basis, total IPG revenue of $584 million was up 3% sequentially and down 13% on a year-over-year basis. We saw improved performance sequentially in MX and E products offset by declines in T&M products. IPG revenue includes almost $43 million of EX switch revenue. Total SOT revenue of $202 million, was up 3% sequentially and down 2% on a year-over-year basis. We saw good sequential revenue growth from SSL VPN and high end firewall and SLT revenue reflects $11 million of our recently launched SRX products. Overall, we are pleased with the ongoing return on investment of our R&D dollars as evidenced by the strong contributions of new products including EX, MX, and SRX product lines. Looking more closely at the markets we address, service provider revenue was 65%, and Enterprise revenue was 35% of total revenue. Service provider revenue was down slightly and Enterprise revenue was up 12% sequentially. We believe our success in the Enterprise reflects both solid market share gain momentum without recently introduced switch products as well as our continued focus on selling our full portfolio of networking solutions into the Enterprise. There was no single customer that represented 10% of revenue for the quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, total gross margins for the quarter were 64.3% of revenue. Product gross margins were 66.2% of revenue, down from 67.6% in the first quarter. This was primarily due to the product mix and to a lesser extent pricing. This was partially offset by cost reductions. During the quarter we saw a higher proportion of Edge product revenue namely E and MX versus Core or T products and a higher mix of EX as a percentage of the total revenue. We also saw a higher ratio of chassis versus PIX or line card mix ratio. Services gross margins were 57.9% of revenue, down from 58.8% in the first quarter. This was primarily due to additional spare parts purchases for our Enterprise business, which is experiencing growth in both new product introductions and increased business in emerging markets. While gross margins will always tend to very based on product and geographic mix we continue to work on our cost reduction initiatives and supply chain optimization. Therefore, our gross margin midterm range of 65% to 67% remains unchanged. Moving on to our operating expense discussion, our continuing focus on reducing operating expenses resulted in good operating margin performance for the quarter. I am pleased with the team support and discipline in continuing to manage expenses thoughtfully during this period of economic uncertainty. As a reminder our intent is to deliver on the commitment we made at our financial analysts meeting in late February. Specifically, that in an environment where revenue is down year-over-year we will manage our full year operating expenses flat to down while we maintain our investment in our innovation road map. Non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $363 million or 46.2% of revenue. Overall, relative to the first quarter, operating expenses decreased $13 million primarily as a result of our previously announced mandatory shutdowns as well as the timing of new prototype build, reduced expenses relating to employee related benefits and other expense controls. R&D expenses were approximately $169 million or 21.5% of revenue, a slight decrease of $2 million compared to the first quarter. Sales and marketing expenses totaled $160 million or 20.4% of revenue and $11 million decrease sequentially. General and administrative expenses totaled $35 million or 4.4% of revenue. That is flat with the first quarter. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $142 million, resulting in an operating margin of 18.1% of revenue. This was 1.7 points higher than sequentially. Looking at our operating margins by segment, IPG operating margin was 20.5%, up slightly from the first quarter. And SLT operating margin was 10.9%, up 4.3 points from the first quarter. This good performance is due to a slight revenue increase, good cost controls and our continued success in portfolio selling into the Enterprise. Turning to the bottom line, Juniper posted non-GAAP net income of $104 million for the quarter, up 13% sequentially and a decrease of 34% from the year ago result. Non-GAAP net other income and expense was $3 million for the quarter, up $1 million sequentially. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 28.4%. The rate is slightly higher than anticipated primarily due to the change in our geographic distribution of revenue and therefore taxable income. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.19 in the second quarter, up $0.02 sequentially and down $0.09 from the prior year figure of $0.28. Many of you have asked about our cost structure specifically what elements should be considered discretionary reductions in the light of the current economic environment. And what elements reflect the same sustained reductions in OpEx. Let me walk you through this. As our results show we are continuing to focus on our reducing OpEx in a thoughtful and prudent manner. We have managed to slow resources to R&D in support of the investments that we believe continue to strengthen our competitive position in the market. Our expense reduction actions include both variable and structural measures. Variable measures include executive salary reductions, suspended merit increases, reductions in bonuses, commissions, and other variable compensation, and mandatory shutdown days. When year-over-year revenue growth resume we will manage the increase in these variable expenses very carefully. Structural measures on the other hand are part of our efforts to build efficiencies into our business and will therefore reflect the same savings to our cost structure. These include restructuring of our real estate portfolio, implementation of a new corporate wide mobility policy, supply chain efficiencies including geographic distribution, focus on adding key engineering talent in low-cost regions, reduction in outside services and contractors, changes to meetings and event practices resulting in lower overall travel expenses. In summary, we have taken cost reduction measures that are both variable with revenue and (inaudible) structural. We will be as disciplined in adding costs as revenue growth returns as we have been in taking costs out. We will also be very focused on balancing the long-term investments that we need to make in order to fund our product road map as well as operating as leanly and efficiently as we can as a company. Turning to the balance sheet as of June 30 we ended the second quarter with nearly $2.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments. This balance was up $91 million from the prior quarter. We generated good cash flow from operations in the quarter of approximately $149 million, down from $164 million in the first quarter. During the quarter we repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares at an average price of $22.73 per share or approximately $50 million worth. Our weighted average shares outstanding for the second quarter were approximately 533 million shares on a diluted non-GAAP basis, roughly flat with the prior quarter. CapEx for the quarter totaled $45 million and depreciation and amortization was $38 million. DSOs increased to 49 days from 43 reported in the first quarter. This increase is the result of timing of shipments in the quarter and the timing of cash receipts from our partners. Although DSO increased quarter over quarter, we are satisfied with the health of our accounts receivable balances and as market conditions continue to stabilize we expect to return to our typical range of 35 days to 45 days. Deferred revenue increase to $649 million, up from the $612 million reported at the end of the first quarter. Sequentially, product deferred revenue was up 21% or approximately $31 million. And services deferred revenue increased by 1% or approximately $5 million. Year-over-year, our total deferred revenue balance increased by a healthy $56 million or 9%. At June 30, 2009, Juniper had 7,020 employees, a net increase of 45 sequentially. These additions were in R&D and in customer service, areas that we consider indicators of the long-term health of our company. We are continuing with our targeted reductions and rebalancing across our work force. The geographic distribution of our total headcount is 59% in the Americas, 24% in India and China and 11% in AMEA and 6% in the rest of Asia-Pacific. This represents a head count shift moving into lower cost regions, with a year-over-year increase of 2 percentage points of the total in India and China. I also want to spend a few moments discussing the principles that guide our cash deployment and capital structure strategy. As we have noted in the past, more than 50% of our worldwide cash and investments are held outside of the US. Given the profile of our revenue and our operating expenses and our ongoing stock repurchase program, we are growing our non-US cash balance faster than our U.S. balance. We manage our cash and investments prudently to support our strategic goals based on the following three principles We maintain enough cash to ensure operating liquidity and to cover contingencies; we maintain financial flexibility to pursue growth opportunities both organic and inorganic which meet both of our strategic and our financial rationale; cash that we generate that is in excess of our requirements according to these principles, we will continue to distribute back to our shareholders. Now let's turn to our guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis, except for revenue and share count. As Kevin noted, the market continues to stabilize, but we still have limited visibility to customers or orders. We therefore expect the third quarter revenue to be roughly flat with the second quarter. And we could see a revenue range of $717 million to $805 million. Gross margins for the third quarter are expected to trend up slightly and be within our midterm guidance range of 65% to 67%. We will continue to focus on prudent management of our operating expenses while also ensuring we meet our innovation road map. In support of that we will incur slight additional expenses associated with our new prototype build. Assuming flat revenues we expect total operating expenses for the September quarter to be flat, to slightly up. Again, assuming flat revenue, we would expect Q3 operating margins to be flat, to slightly up, compared to our Q2 results. Given our revenue range for the quarter, we expect Q3 non-GAAP EPS to range between $0.19 to $0.21. This is assuming a tax rate of 28.5% and a share count approximately flat with the current quarter of 533 million shares. In summary, we will continue to manage our cost structure thoughtfully while ensuring we're investing in our new product initiatives to prepare us for the resumption of revenue growth. Operator we would now like to open the call up for questions.
Operator: (Operator instructions) The first question is from Jeff Evenson with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Jeff Evenson – Sanford Bernstein: One of the things I was surprised about in the quarter is that your Edge sales increased relative to your core sales. Last quarter you guys talked about I think quite reasonably that as bandwidth grows people tend to keep the core more in line. Wondering if you could give us some color on what happened.
Kevin Johnson: Well, as I mentioned we have got improving visibility to projects and the work that we're doing but it's been difficult to predict the sort of the flow of orders on a quarterly basis. So I attribute it more to that. I think clearly as networks are running hotter demand for internet traffic continues to grow. More users consuming more bandwidth on the internet, those trends continue. And every customer is in a different situation and this is sort of just the flow of orders that we saw this quarter.
Jeff Evenson – Sanford Bernstein: Thanks.
Operator: The next question is from Paul Silverstein with Credit Suisse. Please state your question.
Paul Silverstein – Credit Suisse: Robyn, can we get a little bit more color on the gross margin pulled down during the quarter. I think you mentioned that some of it was competition pricing related and there were some other factors. Can you just go a little more if you could quantify it and maybe give us a little bit more insight in terms of where the pressure is coming from in terms of pricing?
Robyn Denholm: Yes, Paul. So intensive gross margins for the quarter as I mentioned in the prepared script, in any one quarter the overall proportion of services versus product, actually has an impact on the total gross margins. Also, in terms of mix. So, we talked about our product mix including chassis versus line kazal [ph] pix. So that obviously has a single biggest impact on the quarter in terms of the overall product mix. And then in terms of pricing we actually did see some pricing and we said that it was to a lesser extent than it was mix in the quarter. And then on the services side, we also saw a reduction in the gross margin there quarter over quarter due to the expanding business on the enterprise side and our need to purchase more spare parts. So that was sort of the three key elements there.
Paul Silverstein – Credit Suisse: Robyn, so in order to the Chassis versus PIX then the product mix, then pricing, and then services?
Robyn Denholm: Yes, I think overall the gross margin services versus product revenue split was a factor last quarter in Q1. It's also a factor this quarter. And then if you drill down into product, it's overall product mix including the Chassis versus PIX, yes.
Paul Silverstein – Credit Suisse: Alright. In terms of the revenue guidance, Kevin, how much of this is being conservative on your part, and being prudent and how much of it is a reflection of just, as you said, the improve visibility isn't yet translating into orders.
Kevin Johnson: Well, let me talk about it from the two segment perspectives. And I will start with the Enterprise segment. On the Enterprise segment, we see a growing pipeline of opportunity. And in this last quarter, our predictability on closing of that pipeline improved. So I feel like we see the growth opportunity on the Enterprise side and visibility is as improved over last quarter on the Enterprise side. On the service provider side, we are seeing improved visibility to the projects and just anecdotally that, that comes across as our sales teams are seeing more RFPs, there is more RFP activity and that's an indication of the priorities that our customers have. But by the same token we have not been able to be as clear about the timing of these orders. And so as a result you look and say, hey we're kind of in my view in the service provider side bouncing on the bottom right now. And the view is there will be an uptick it's just a question of when. And therefore in terms of looking at this quarter, we have guided to where we think within a range that we think look there is some upside, there is a little downside but the fact is, I do believe looking forward, at some point, there is an uptick but we just without the visibility of predicting the timing of those orders it's difficult to then build that in.
Paul Silverstein – Credit Suisse: And Kevin does that translate so you would expect continued improvement in Enterprise and flattish in obviously below flat from a sequential basis and the service provider business, can you break that down?
Kevin Johnson: Well, we don't break down guidance between by segment, but the comments that I made about, I think IT spending in the Enterprise is still constrained and I think it's going to be a long, slow recovery. However, we're new entrant in the switch market. Our value proposition is resonating. The pipeline is growing and so I think we can outgrow the IT spend recovery in the Enterprise and there is perhaps more variable than on what would happen in the service provider side.
Operator: The next question is from Jeff Kvaal with Barclays Bank. Please go ahead with your question.
Jeff Kvaal – Barclays Bank: Yes, Kevin, following on to the team it seems though visibility is improving a little bit and your deferred revenue obviously up very, very nicely and yet the flattish guidance. Should we take that I mean there is an uptick in your mind coming it's just that you can't put it in stone or coming in the September quarter?
Kevin Johnson: I think clearly in any economic downturn at some point you hope there is a recovery and that recovery is going to come in the future and I think that trying to predict that in a particular individual quarter is a very difficult thing. And so I think we're being very thoughtful in looking at the overall macro economic situation and consistent with the principles that we outlined at the beginning of the year, we're going to continue to assume that we're operating in a challenging economic period until we see evidence otherwise which would be represented in actually seeing the deal, the deal flow and the closure rate improve.
Jeff Kvaal – Barclays Bank: Okay so the range of the guidance then was established using assumption similar to the ones you used in the June quarter.
Kevin Johnson: That's correct. That's why we shared the principles with you and it's the principles plus additional insight that we shared relative to improved visibility of projects yet, limited visibility on timing of orders, and on the Enterprise side a growing pipeline and improved predictability of close rates. So the Enterprise side is perhaps a little bit more predictable than little more visibility than we have in timing of the orders on the service provider side and that's all factored into that guidance.
Jeff Kvaal – Barclays Bank: Great. And then Robyn, I was wondering if you could comment a little bit about where you would like to be back at your 25% target operating margin, what revenue level? I think, in terms of this quarter, we saw a good sequential increase in our operating margins. We're very focused on that. And I think the 1.7 points of improved operating margin quarter over quarter with just a slight 3% increase in revenue, I think is a good indicator of that. And we are continuing to work on our cost structure as we have talked about and in terms of the prepared remarks I went through the fact that some of those cost reductions that we have done are structural. So we will continue to get good benefit of that. So we are committed to the 25% operating margins or higher, we obviously need higher revenue growth than 3% to do that, but we are continuing to work on the cost structure as well.
Operator: The next question is from Nikos Theodosopoulos with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.
Nikos Theodosopoulos – UBS: Thank you. I had a question on the IBM relationship. I guess can you give some background on why Juniper decided to move the IBM relationship to an OEM rather than the existing resale relationship that's been there. I think it's the first OEM relationship the company has had. I'm trying to understand the motivation behind it. Is it a desire of both companies, one of the companies, is it a reflection on ongoing investment in the channel and a way to better penetrate the Enterprise market and how will you differentiate within IBM between Cisco and Brocade?
Kevin Johnson: Thanks for your question, Nikos. I guess I commented look strategically for us to scale in the Enterprise, we're going to have to build more routes to market. And the IBM sales force and our partnership with IBM clearly is one of those routes to market. Being able to provide an IBM branded version of the switch and router just reduces friction or barriers for that sales force to sell those products. So clearly this is a strategy that we believe enables our customers to be able to have the choice and flexibility and for us to have the ability for the IBM sales force to sell in a friction-free way a solution that involves a set of products based on Juniper Networks. So I think it's a good thing for Juniper, I think it is good for IBM and I think it is good for customers.
Operator: The next question is from Richard Gardner with Citigroup. Please state your question.
Richard Gardner – Citigroup: Okay, thank you. Kevin and Robyn, obviously the quarter was very back-end loaded given the significant increase in AR. I was just wondering if you would be willing to elaborate on the reasons for that a little bit, the dynamics. Was it anything unusual or simply just the lumpiness in the order patterns that you referred to in your prepared comments? Thank you.
Kevin Johnson: Yes, thanks for your question. Let me just start and I will hand over to Robyn. I want to differentiate. The order flow was less back-end loaded this quarter than it was last quarter, but shipments as you point out are more related to the DSO. So then let me hand over to Robyn on that.
Robyn Denholm: That's exactly right. Two things that influenced our DSO: The first was the timing of shipments and obviously, if that comes after a certain week then is not due for collection in the quarter and then the other was the timing of our cash receipts from some of our partners which actually fell outside of the quarter and we collected them in July. So they were the two effects. And as Kevin said the order volume was less back-end loaded in Q2 than Q1 which I think is the important factor.
Operator: The next question is from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets. Please state your question.
Mark Sue – RBC Capital Markets: Kevin, if the Enterprise pipeline is better and you're gaining share why would that change in one quarter, implying that the service provider segment will decrease sequentially in a quarter when most carriers are reporting a sequential increase in CapEx. Some help there? And also Robyn when do we see a reversal in this negative correlation between the success in the Enterprise and the impact on product gross margins.
Kevin Johnson: Thanks for your questions, Mark. I will take the first one and then hand over to Robyn. Yes, look this quarter a 12% quarter-on-quarter growth of Enterprise was certainly a significant sequential growth and when we look at that pipeline and when we look at the opportunities we have going into the third quarter, sometimes there is some differences geographically in Europe, for example, most of the month of August is holiday, and so there are some factors that come into play there, but I think what we tried to do in our guidance is balance the reality of what we have visibility to with the recognition that there is still some variability in timing of spend and yet we're going to continue consistent with our principles continue to manage assuming challenging economic conditions and if we have signs that signal otherwise, then that's a positive thing. Robyn, do you want to take the second piece?
Robyn Denholm: Yes, Mark, in terms of the operating margins, the operating margins for our SLT business which obviously is primarily sold into the Enterprise customers was actually up sequentially 4.3 points from the first quarter. So I think our continued success in the Enterprise is actually positive in terms of the operating margin, outcome for the quarter. In terms of the product gross margin, we did talk about there being mix change and we pointed out some differences on the IPG products in terms of chassis versus PIX in the IPG products and the product mix there.
Operator: The next question is from Tal Liani with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.
Tal Liani – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Hello. I have three quick questions. First, you expect gross margin to go back to the 65% or better, next quarter, does it mean that it is better mix or is it because of cost reductions? The second one is, on your IBM sales because it is an OEM agreement does it mean you have lower margin level than if you would have been selling directly, if you can explain the relationships there of margins. And the last point is just a general question about your appetite for M&A. You're active in data centers now, you won some major deals in New York for data centers and the question is, whether you need to expand through acquisitions or whether you have any appetite to expand through acquisition into space? Thanks.
Kevin Johnson: Thanks for your questions. I will have Robyn take the first two and I will take the third one.
Robyn Denholm: Yes, so Tal, in terms of the gross margin we did say that we expect it to increase slightly, to the low end of the range in terms of the 65% for the third quarter. And that will be a combination of cost reductions. We obviously continue to work on our cost reductions quarter in, quarter out both in terms of the material costs then in terms of the ongoing supply chain. We know that our mix varies each quarter depending on the different types of orders that come in. So we said that we guided up assuming a certain mix of products. So in terms of the overall IBM OEM relationship, as Kevin said, that's an expansion of our existing partnership with them. We don't expect there to be an impact on gross margins from that relationship. And given that it is primarily focused on a route to market for us in terms of the Enterprise, we expect that over time that will help us reduce that or increase our total operating margins.
Kevin Johnson: Yes, let me take the third question you asked I think related to M&A. We believe this is an interesting time and it's important for us to keep our strategic options open. We're clear that our primary value creation activities through organic R&D, but we will consider targeted M&A where it makes financial sense and strategic sense. But we will reinforce our primary value creation vehicle is through organic R&D.
Operator: The next question is from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Simona Jankowski – Goldman Sachs: Hi, thank you very much. Just first in terms of the strength in the quarter relative to your original expectations, is it fair to say from your comments that it seems like most of that came from the Americas and particularly from the Enterprise segment. And then just secondly during the quarter we had the SCOE standard ratified and we now have some of the converged solutions out there shipping. I believe your stratus project probably going to have something similar but maybe a couple years out so just curious if that changes any way your go to market approach or any kind of strategic discussions.
Kevin Johnson: Yes, thanks for the question, Simona. Do you want to take the first one, question about the geographic mix?
Simona Jankowski – Goldman Sachs: Yes, so in terms of the area that came in stronger in terms of the overall revenue, it was in the Enterprise and yes, the U.S. actually did quite nicely in terms of revenue in the Enterprise for the quarter.
Kevin Johnson: Yes, on your second question about routes to market as we look forward, I think clearly we are working to generate awareness and demand for our products in the Enterprise and we do that directly. So wins like the New York Stock Exchange, certainly our team in the field played a significant role in helping secure that win and establish that as a significant architectural design win. We also believe that to really get the scale and the Enterprise, it's going to be through our work with strategic partners. And so certainly the relationship with IBM is one example, but the work that we're doing with the J-Partners also reinforces that and I think as we're coming out with more products in the Enterprise, you mentioned the stratus project is one example, we're going to leverage that infrastructure capability that we're building on routes to market in the Enterprise.
Operator: The next question is from Simon Leopold with Morgan Keegan. Please state your question.
Simon Leopold – Morgan Keegan: Thank you. Really two things I want to check on, one is just to follow up on the IBM OEM relationship, is there some guidance you could give us to help understand the sizing of the opportunity, how big it is, how incremental it might be? Particularly given that you had a partnership I would like to understand some range. Whatever you can shed some light on as to how you're thinking about it. And then the second question is following up on Robyn's discussion about managing your operating expenses. I would like to get a sense of how the bonus accruals might come back once we do see sales recover, and my concern is bluntly, we saw very quick step down in your operating expenses. I am wondering if we see a quick step up when the accruals come back. Thank you.
Kevin Johnson: Thank you for your questions. I will take the first one and hand the second one to Robyn. On the IBM OEM agreement first of all it's important to keep in mind that we have a relationship with IBM today. IBM resells our products today. They continue to resell those products and with this OEM agreement, I think it's probably going to be late Q3 before we're actually shipping product and have that product in markets. So it would probably be Q4 at the earliest that we would see any impact of the IBM OEM relationship, part of the relationship. Longer term and I think this is about continuing to build awareness and demand in the market as we get more design wins like the New York Stock Exchange, it's those types of things that I think is going to fuel more of the demand for growth and so for the IBM OEM thing I think it will just be a continued ramp with our Enterprise business as it grows and for purposes of Q3, I think it's going to be late Q3 before anything ship. So the first time we would see at least some start of revenue flow on that would be in Q4.
Robyn Denholm: Simona, in terms of the operating expense and the variable bonuses, so as I said in the prepared remarks, we will continue to manage our increases in total expenses and variable expenses when revenue growth does resume year-over-year. So and just to clarify in the bonuses, that is on a revenue growth on a year-over-year basis. So but our fundamental principle is, just as we have been very disciplined in our approach in operating expenses as revenue has come down year-over-year, we will also maintain that focus when revenue growth starts to come back.
Operator: The next question is from Bill Choi with Jefferies. Please state your question.
Bill Choi – Jefferies: Thanks. Did you give out an employee total headcount at the end of the quarter? Can you start with that please?
Robyn Denholm: Yes, the employee headcount was 7,020 a net increase of 45.
Bill Choi – Jefferies: I want to get a sense of the kind of investment that might need to be made into your business, less R&D related, perhaps more on the kind of sales coverage overall. You have in front of you some really good opportunity, certainly helping carriers transition to next trend networks. To me that sounds like you might need to really build up some consulting staffing there to control the discussions and ultimately win products, sales, and also on the Enterprise, great momentum, but you were on the process of building out that sales port before the economy slowdown so just trying to get your sense for where we are in the need to build up these things, these organizations and how you might use cash to seek these growth opportunities perhaps on a more step function way.
Kevin Johnson: Thanks for your questions, Bill. Let me just start with service providers. We have a fairly capable sales force today in the service providers segment. I think we're calling directly on the top 200 service providers and I think as we outlined them certainly we expanded the breadth of service providers in that reach. And as we work to increase the depth of relationship with those service providers certainly there is some incremental resource but it's not a linear thing with revenue. So, in some ways, I think there is certainly some investment that we would make on the service provider side and as you point out maybe there are some things to help consult or help architect or do more of that, which, which we have as a principle around customer satisfaction continued to invest in through this downturn. I think as Robyn mentioned our headcount increases were in the areas of R&D and customer satisfaction, so much of that focus has been maintaining those relationships and ensuring that our customers are very satisfied and we would continue with those principles going forward. On the Enterprise side, I think certainly as we scale, there is an opportunity to say how much field sales resource do we need to secure, what I will call light house wins, how do we get the big design wins that, that basically create a light house for other customers to look and see what's possible with kind of our vision for network data centers of the future. And as we do that that creates a significant amount of demand from a number of other customers. And that's where having good partnerships with companies like IBM and our J-Partners they are able to engage and help fulfill much of that demand. And so certainly there will be some increases in investment on the Enterprise side but in doing that I actually think we start to reduce the sales cost as a percentage of revenue on the Enterprise by achieving scale. And in both cases if we execute well on that it supports the principle of growing the operating margin as we scale the company.
Operator: The next question is from Brent Bracelin from Pacific Crest. Please state your question.
Brent Bracelin – Pacific Crest: Thank you. I actually had a follow-up question on the Enterprise I apologize but I guess it's still little unclear to me as we look at earnings season here how much of the rebound Enterprise is kind of an industry rebound versus company specific kind of share-gain factors, specific question, how much of the Enterprise strength would you attribute to share gains versus industry, factors versus large deals versus improving sales execution, how should we think about that magnitude of the rebound that you guys saw on the Enterprise side and as you scrub those numbers?
Kevin Johnson: Yes, thanks for the question, Brent. I will comment on that. First of all, IT spending in the Enterprise, our view is that will have a longer recovery than the capital spend and service provider. So, we believe that service provider capital spend will uptick certainly much faster than the IT spending in Enterprise. And the view is every industry vertical will recover, have spending patterns that vary. And if you look at past recessions that's always been the case, financial services has a certain pattern, retail has a certain pattern, health care has a certain pattern, government has a certain pattern. And so you look at IT spend, it's going to in my view be sort of a long slow recovery on the IT spend side in the Enterprise. The fact that we have as a new entrant into a large market of switches and a complete portfolio across switching routing and security combined with a value proposition of lower total cost of ownership that I think makes us very relevant and puts us in a position to take market share. And I think that, that holds true. Because of that I think we're in an opportunity where we can significantly outgrow the recovery of IT spending in the Enterprise because we are such a new entrant, we have so much upside there. And so I think that is the biggest factor in this. Now when it comes to improved execution, I think we have seen significant improvement in our Enterprise execution in the U.S. And not as much outside the U.S. and a big part of that was the strategy that we had to really model something we called connected sales and marketing in a new way of how we generate demand, fulfill demand and drive that execution in the U.S. And our opportunity is to take that now and start to propagate that rest of world. So I think to combine strength of our value proposition with now a proven model on how we can drive that growth, taking that globally, I think those two things, mean that I think we're positioned to outgrow IT spend recovery, but that would be how I frame that, Brent, from an Enterprise standpoint.
Operator: Next question is from Michael Janedis [ph] with Soleil Securities. Please go ahead with your question.
Michael Janedis – Soleil Securities: Hi, great. Thanks a lot. First thing is I think last quarter you gave us an indication of the EX number revenue in the quarter. I didn't hear that so I was wondering if you could maybe repeat that. And then secondly, when you look at the market share numbers in Edge routing, IP and Ethernet, Alcatel continues to do extremely well and continues to gain traction there. I'm just wondering if you've seen anything changing in the competitive environment relative to Edge routing, relative to Alcatel. Do they seem to be tougher, are they competing on price, is it their products, anything notable going on there? Thanks.
Kevin Johnson: Yes, thanks for your questions, Michael. First of all, the answer to your question on the EX I think last quarter it was 30 million, this quarter its $43 million on the EX of revenue. And as I mentioned we released the EX8216 and EX2500 so we strengthened the product portfolio on the switch side. And second question, Alcatel-Lucent competition. If you look at through 2008 before the economic downturn, I think the numbers, most numbers that analysts would report showed us gaining share in core and edge routing. Since the economic downturn my view is we have been fundamentally holding share. There are some places where maybe there is a little slight uptick, slight downtick, but for the most part we have been flattish on share. I do think you see competitors like Alcatel-Lucent has been doing well. The share numbers that I have looked at kind of show that they have been taking share primarily from Cisco but certainly it's a competitive environment. And our approach we have to win based on the value of the innovation that we deliver and how that value translates to customer value and being able to handle the world's most highest needs of scale, reliability, performance, means that we can help customers carry their traffic at the lowest cost per bit. And with technology like the (inaudible) services Edge and programmable services on top of JUNOS they can build new services and increase their revenue per bit. And that's our strategy. And I think we've got a compelling value proposition. But clearly your point is taken. There is a lot of competition out there.
Operator: We have time for two more questions. The next question is from John Marchetti with Cowen and Company. Please state your question.
John Marchetti – Cowen and Company: Thanks. Kevin, I was wondering if you could just spend a second and kind of take us through what you're seeing maybe by the different geographies in terms of service provider and Enterprise. I know you talked about better visibility into some of the plans for builds but not really better visibility into orders. Just curious if you could maybe comment on how that's different by geography? And then Robyn, you went through some of the different line items, if you will, that are under the variable and structural costs changes that you have been doing. Can you give us a sense maybe just on a percent basis how much of it is, is a variable comp and how much of it is more structural in nature? Thank you.
Kevin Johnson: Yes, thanks for your question, John. I think let's see. I will start with Asia-Pacific. I think generally, in Asia-Pacific, they were down slightly this quarter and much of that was anticipated. There is seasonality in Japan that affected us. We were strong in China. But overall in the service provider side we were down slightly, and Enterprise, I think the place that we performed the best in Enterprise was in the U.S. And so Enterprise was flattish in Asia-Pacific. And that highlights an opportunity for us to take our execution model and drive improved execution on the Enterprise side. In Europe, I think we saw some improvements on the service provider side. We were up slightly in Europe. And that's in AMEA and that's a good sign because, frankly, I think capital spending from service providers was tough this quarter in AMEA and we actually grew, had a better quarter in AMEA. Our Enterprise execution in AMEA was not as good as the U.S. so they didn't perform quite as well, but I think they are were up slightly as well on the Enterprise side. So in the U.S. Enterprise performed very well and service providers I think was relatively flattish. So you put that all together and service provider was down by about a point quarter-on-quarter, Enterprise was up about 12 points giving us about a 3% sequential growth. I do believe that our ability to drive good predictable results on the Enterprise side remains intact and I think the question that people want to know is when will this uptick occur, on the service provider side and because we see better visibility to projects, but not improved ability to predict that revenue, we're not calling that at this point.
Operator: Next question is from Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank.
Vijay Bhagwat – Deutsche Bank: Yes, hi, this is Vijay Bhagwat [ph] calling on behalf of Brian. Hi, Kevin. Hi, Robyn.
Kevin Johnson: Hi, Vijay.
Vijay Bhagwat – Deutsche Bank: Just two questions if it is okay. First is kind of just drilling down into the makeshift that happened in the quarter. How much of that was due to share lost potentially to Cisco or to an Alcatel-Lucent just downtick in spending and follow-up is in terms of ramping up Enterprise market share through your partners kind of give us an idea of what target do you have in terms of any rough market share expectation for next year or the year beyond so that we get an idea of how do you wish to ramp that business?
Kevin Johnson: Go ahead. Robyn, maybe you take the first one on mix and I will take the second one.
Robyn Denholm: Yes, so, in terms of mix, we talked about two types of mix there. We talked about the total product mix and we saw improving relative to the first quarter mix of E and MX and a slight decline in T actually in terms of quarter over quarter mix and we saw a higher mix of chassis overall than we did see line cards or pix and that's across the portfolio. And then of course we also saw an increase in the EX mix of the total revenue. So that was sort of the mix factors that we outlined.
Kevin Johnson: Yes on your second question of Enterprise market share, we haven't put some stake in the ground that says we are going to be at X% share in the Enterprise by a certain date. But what we have said is that fundamentally our long-term operating model is one that we expect revenue to grow 20 plus % top line while we expand operating margins. In order to grow 20% plus top line clearly our Enterprise business has got to be growing above that and kicking in significant amount of our growth on a year-on-year basis. In order to do that we got to do exactly what we're doing which is strengthening the product portfolio and you seen us continue to fund R&D and come out with a portfolio of products. Secure some visible design wins that demonstrate our value proposition of high performance networking, lower total cost of ownership and choice and flexibility. We're doing exactly that. And strengthening the partnerships with our J-Partners and large partners like IBM, it strengthened us in the way of giving us more routes to market. Those things will enable us to achieve scale in the Enterprise. How long will that take I don't know but that's our opportunity and that's where we got to stay focused.
Kathleen Bela: Okay that is all the time we have this afternoon. I like to thank everyone for joining us today and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our teleconference. You may disconnect your lines. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Greetings. And, welcome to the Juniper Networks Fourth Quarter 2008 earnings financial results call. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Katheen Bela, Vice President Investor Relations for Juniper Networks. Thank you Ms. Bela, you may begin.
Kathleen Bela: Thank you, Doug. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Here today are Kevin Johnson, our Chief Executive Officer, and Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, I would like to remind everyone that statements made during this call concerning Juniper’s business outlook, future financial operating results, and overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including economic conditions generally or in the networking industry, changes in overall technology spending, the network capacity requirements of service providers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply chain constraints, variation in the mix of products sold, litigation and other factors listed in our most recent report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC.  In addition, forward-looking statements relating to our Japan distributor review and its impact in completion are also subject to a number of uncertainties and risks, including but not limited to the discovery of new facts or issues.  All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances change after the date of this call. In discussing the financial results today, Robyn will first present results on a GAAP basis and for purposes of today’s discussion will also review non-GAAP results.  For important commentary on why the management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company’s view of the financial results, please consult our filings with the SEC. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP, please see today’s press release. In general, non-GAAP results exclude certain non-recurring charges such as amortization of purchased intangibles, other acquisition-related charges, and expenses related to stock-based compensations. In today’s call, Robyn will also be providing forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis. All guidance is forward-looking and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier. A GAAP EPS target is not accessible on a forward-looking basis, due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to the charges which are excluded from the non-GAAP EPS estimate today.  Please note that today’s call is scheduled to last for one hour and please limit your questions to one per firm. With that, I will now turn the call over to Kevin.
Kevin Johnson : Well, thank you for joining today’s call. Before I hand it over to Robyn to review the numbers, I thought it would be helpful to frame my perspective on our performance for the quarter and for 2008.  2008 was a year in which Juniper Networks expanded the product portfolio, maintained or took market share in every one of our key product categories, and grew our customer base. Leveraging the power of the JUNOS operating system, we introduced several new products, including our EX series of Ethernet switches, the SRX Dynamic Services Gateway, and the Intelligent Services Edge offering that advanced the M and MX series platforms.  These new product offerings have helped customers achieve the flexibility, simplicity, and scale needed to support their evolving business requirements. From a market share perspective, Synergy Research released a report Q308 on market share. And it showed that we improved our market position in all of our core routing categories as compared to the same quarter the year before.  Our entrance into the adjacent $20 billion switch market is providing us additional share growth opportunities. We are expanding our switch offerings with the introduction of the EX8208, which has completed testing. And we have early shipments to a limited number of customers with broader FRS in early February. Our service offerings such as security have also contributed to share gains. Infonetics Q3 analysis showed Juniper gained 1 to 2 points a share in each of the key security categories which we compete in. Gartner’s Analysis also placed Juniper in a leadership position of Gartner’s Magic Quadrants for a range of offerings including firewall VPN, intrusion prevention systems, WAN optimization controllers, and SSL VPN. Now growing share in a growing market of high performance networks resulted in a 26% year-over-year revenue growth and a 43% year-over-year growth in non-GAAP operating income for 2008. Diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis grew 36% year-over-year to $1.18 per share.  Certainly the macroeconomic conditions in Q4 were challenging and we expect these economic conditions to continue into 2009. Even with the economic challenges presented in Q4, we delivered year-over-year revenue growth of 14% and non-GAAP operating income growth of 19%.  A few observations from Q4. First, even in a challenging economic climate, we achieved a company record in orders for products and services which exceeded the $1 billion milestone for the first time in the company’s history. Now, think about this for just one moment. Juniper achieved the largest amount of orders in the most challenging economic period of recent times. Demand for high-performance networking solutions continues and achieving this milestone reinforces the fact that we are gaining both market share and mindshare. Second, in this economic downturn, customers are monitoring their financial performance in real time and making careful decisions on the timing of their capital expenditures. Bookings came in later in the quarters compared to past fourth quarters. Some customers have placed orders with future ship dates in and even beyond Q1.  We continue to take a customer-focused approach. We work to align with our customers, support their project timelines, and help them deploy Juniper’s solutions to reduce their total cost of ownership. In a tough economic climate, customers appreciate that. Third, our Enterprise business grew 17% year-over-year in a period where IT spending is being reduced. Even if you compare year-over-year revenue in the Enterprise without our new switch business, we had solid growth. Our expanded portfolio has strengthened our value proposition, with our traditional strength in security offerings and routing, our EX switch portfolio and new offerings such as the SRX Dynamic Services Gateway, we are seeing more Enterprises customers make a portfolio commitment to Juniper. Examples include the U.S. Department of Energy, which now uses Juniper MX series routers, EX series switches, and JUNOS software to support their network to enable 40 DOA research sites and other research institutions to collaborate. The Laboratory of Neuroimaging at UCLA selected Juniper MX series routers and EX series switches for their network upgrade to help them simplify operations and scale performance. Scottrade recently added the SRX Dynamic Services Gateway to their existing Juniper security and routing solutions. So Enterprise business continues to grow.  Fourth, service provider demand for high-performance networking continues to grow as IT traffic is nearly doubling every two years. The math behind the demand equation is simple. An increased number of subscribers times an increased number of minutes per subscriber times an increased number of bits per minute, driven by content such as video. This equation is driving demand for high-performance networks and certainly as our service provider customers manage through the economic downturn, there have been some delays of deals into future quarters as we did see Q4 softness in the U.S. and EMEA service provider segments, with strength in Asia.  We’ve also expanded our reach of the top 100 service providers globally. And, we now do business with all 100. Examples include SingTel is using Juniper’s security solutions to enable their managed security service offerings. Internet Initiative Japan deployed Juniper’s Ethernet services routers to improve network performance and reduce power consumption. Divona Telecom, one of Africa’s leading satellite and WiMax telecom operators selected the MX series to create a high-speed service-enabled backhaul network.  And, the M and MX series offerings continue to gain traction with the announcement of the Intelligent Services Edge in Q4. We are deepening relationships with services providers globally, such as Deutsche Telecom, Telenor, and Telecom Italia. In a growing market for high-performance networking, our expanded product portfolio, our focus on the customer is enabling us to grow market share, grow mindshare, and strengthen customer relationships. Let me know hand over to Robyn to take you through the details of our financial performance in Q4 and a discussion on guidance. Robyn.
Robyn Denholm : Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon everyone. Our fourth quarter results were consistent with the expectations laid out three months ago. We were and are optimistic over the longer term, but cautious that conditions in the macroeconomic environment could change our customers’ buying patterns over the near term and accordingly impact our results. In the fourth quarter, whilst our order volume was good and products book-to-bill remained above 1, customers requested later deliveries which were outside of the quarter, thereby negatively impacting our Q4 revenue. On a year-over-year basis, revenue was up 14%, but for the first time in 2008, we were towards the lower end of our guidance range and we saw a sequential decline in revenue. While we are very focused on managing through the current environment, we do not want to lose sight of the fact that 2008 was a very successful year for Juniper, both from a financial and an operating perspective. The achievements this year from an operating execution perspective helped position us to accelerate when the current economic environment improves.  In the meantime, our mission is to sharpen our focus on continued investments and improvement in execution and in the operating expense model and to concentrate on the investments in R&D. As we do so, we have the financial strength and flexibility to continue to deliver on the innovations required for us to continue to take market share. As stated in our press release, we are in the process of completing a review of our Japan revenue derived from sales through distributors. Typically, we are able to complete our reviews before we announce results. However, in this case, we were not and for this reason we felt it was appropriate to disclose this to you. Total Japan distributor-related revenue was approximately $13 million in Q4, which includes a revenue deferral of $3 million, which we believe is adequate to cover the issues we identified. We currently expect that we will complete our review before the filing of our annual report on Form 10-K. Now, on to the numbers. I’ll discuss revenue and earnings on GAAP basis first and then shift to the non-GAAP discussion as we dive deeper into our operating performance. Total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $923 million, up 14% from the prior year and down 2% sequentially from the third quarter. For the full year 2008, total revenue was $3.57 billion, up 26% year-over-year and reaching a record level for the company.  For the fourth quarter, Juniper earned net income of $132 million on a GAAP basis or $0.25 per diluted share, up 14% from the $0.22 reported in 2007 fourth quarter. For the full year, net income was $512 million or $0.93 per diluted share, up 50% from $0.62 in 2007.  Our diverse geographic and customer revenue mix supported our growth again this quarter. The Americas represented approximately 52% of total revenue in the fourth quarter, as compared to 51% in the third quarter. EMEA represented 30% of total revenue in the fourth quarter, as compared to 29% in the third quarter. And, Asia Pacific represented 18% of total revenue in the fourth quarter, as compared to the third quarter at 20%.  Regionally, the Americas grew total revenue 25% year-over-year with our largest single region, the U.S., growing at 18%. International Americas had a good quarter, growing at 77% year-over-year. The Americas service provider revenues grew 28% year-over-year. And, Enterprise grew at 19%. Impressive growth in a tough market. On a sequential basis, service provider revenue declined 5%, while Enterprise revenue grew 15%. APAC also had a solid quarter, with year-over-year growth of 10%. This growth was led by Japan, Asian countries, and China. APAC year-over-year growth rates for service provider and Enterprise were at 13 and 3% respectively. On a sequential basis, service provider and Enterprise revenue declined 15% and 3% respectively. EMEA was essentially flat year-over-year reflecting strong growth in Enterprise of 21% and sequential Enterprise growth of 16%. EMEA service provider revenue continues to be weaker, with year-over-year and sequential declines of 7% and 8% respectively. This is largely the result of lower overall demand by the larger service providers in 2008, offset slightly by increases in demand with the second tier and emerging country service providers. On a segment basis, total IPG revenue of 702 million was up 20% on a year-over-year basis and total SLT revenue of 221 million was flat on a year-over-year basis. IPG revenue includes almost 28 million of EX switch revenue and EX bookings increased to 32 million in the quarter. Within each of the segments, IPG product revenue was up 17% year-over-year and IPG services revenue was up 32% year-over-year. IPG product revenue growth was across all product families with the largest percentage growth in MX, EX, and E series products.  On a sequential basis, total IPG revenue was down 4%. In SLT, product revenue was down 6% year-over-year. And, SLT services revenue was up 17% year-over-year. The SLT product revenue decline was attributed to declines in DX and WX products, partially offset by growth in SSLVPN and Network Management products.  As Kevin mentioned, we are pleased with the initial reception of our JUNOS based SLX platform and the first quarter revenue of $4 million is a good start. On a sequential basis, total SLT revenue was up 2%.  Looking at the markets we addressed, service provider sales were 69% of total revenue, up 13% year-over-year, and down 8% sequentially. Total sales into the Enterprise market were 31% of total revenue, an increase of 17% year-over-year, and up 11% sequentially, with strength in the Americas and EMEA. There was no single customer that represented over 10% of revenue in the quarter. Turning to our non-GAAP results, total growth margins for the quarter were 67.5% of revenue, within our long-term model range of 66 to 68% and down slightly year-over-year and sequentially. Products growth margins were 69.4% of revenue, down from 70.3% in the third quarter, due primarily to pricing pressure and product (inaudible). Services growth margins were 59.8% of revenue for the quarter, up from 58.3% in the third quarter. This was due to the favorable impact of variable compensation expenses and a very good result from the ongoing cross-initiatives the team has been working on. Operating expenses totaled $398 million or 43.1% of revenue. Overall, relative to the third quarter, operating expenses were favorably impacted by the reduction in variable compensation expenses, the timing of prototype expenses, and the impact of some of our ongoing cost reduction activities. It should be noted that this was unfavorably impacted by approximately $4 million of resource rebalancing activities. This activity was principally in the sales area. R&D expenses totaled $168 million or 18.2% of revenue. On a year-over-year basis, we increased our spend by 7%. We continue to invest in the areas that will ensure we maintain product momentum. Sales and marketing expenses totaled $196 million or 21.3% of revenue, a 1.3 percentage point increase as a percentage of revenue from the previous quarter. This increase was primarily due to the year-end commission-related variable expenses and the rebalancing activities mentioned earlier.  General and administrative expense totaled $33 million or 3.6% of revenue. On a year-over-year basis, our G&A expense as a percent of revenue remains flat, but slightly improves sequentially. Operating profits for the quarter was $226 million, resulting in an operating margin of 24.5% of revenue, slightly lower than last quarter, but an increase of 1 percentage point as a percent of revenue from the fourth quarter last year. Looking at our segments, operating margins for IPG were 28.8% for the quarter and SLT operating margins were 12% for the quarter, above 10% for the first time.  Turning to the bottom line, Juniper posted non-GAAP net income of $169 million for the quarter, an increase of 12% from the year ago result. Full year 2008 net income was $651 million, up 29% from 2007. Net interest and other income was $8 million for the quarter, down 15% sequentially, and 60% year-over-year, as the result of the lower interest rates due to the conservative nature of our cash investment strategy. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 27.8%, down from 29% in the third quarter as anticipated. This is due principally from the renewal of the R&D tax credit at the beginning of the quarter. Our 2008 annual non-GAAP tax rate was 28.7%. Diluted earnings per share were $0.32 in the fourth quarter, flat with the third quarter and up $0.05 over the prior year’s figure of $0.27. For the full year, diluted earnings per share were $1.18, up a substantial $0.31 or 36% for the full year 2007. Looking at the balance sheet as of December 31st, we ended the fourth quarter with over 2.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments. This is up from the 2.1 billion in the third quarter. We generated cash flow from operations in the quarter of approximately $215 million, up from the 205 million in the third quarter. For the full year, we are (inaudible) cash flow from operations which totaled $875 million, up 88 million from the 787 million in 2007. During the quarter, we purchased approximately 2.4 million shares at an average price of $17.45 or approximately $43 million. We have been conservative in our investment strategies with regards to our cash, and with no debt on our balance sheet, we are in a very comfortable cash position to grow our business and execute on R&D investments to extend our product portfolio and product cycle advantages. Our weighted average shares outstanding for the fourth quarter were approximately 535 million shares on a diluted basis. CapEx for the quarter totaled $43 million and depreciation and amortization was $38 million. CSO increased to 42 days from 35 in the third quarter, well within our range of 35 to 45 days. Deferred revenue increased to $590 million, up from the $563 million reported at the end of the third quarter. Product deferred revenue were essentially flat and services deferred revenue increased by approximately $28 million. Year-over-year our deferred revenue balance increased by 77 million or 15%.  At the end of December, Juniper had 714 employees, an increase of 184 for the quarter. The increase was primarily in R&D in our Bangalore office. We slowed the hiring significantly in November and December and as a result of the increase of our cost-reduction activities. Now, let’s turn to our guidance. As Kevin discussed earlier in our call, revenue in the latter part of the fourth quarter began to show the effects of the changes in demand patterns of our customers as a result of the macroeconomic environment. We anticipate this volatility to continue at least over the near term. While book-to-bill did remain above 1 for Q4, we do see changes in demands patterns including placing orders but requesting delivery out over longer periods. This was especially so in the service provider business.  We also anticipate the macroeconomic impacts to add to the normal Q1 seasonality in the Enterprise business. Overall, taking these factors into account when looking at our business on a year-over-year basis, we expect March 2009 revenue to be roughly flat to down 3% when compared to March 2008 revenue of $823 million. In other words, a range of $800 to $830 million.  In the near term, we expect growth margins due to pricing and mix to be in the range of 65 to 67%. In the current economic environment, we are even more focused on our cost structure and we will carefully manage our OpEx in order to maximize profitability. We are committed to the R&D programs that we believe will be key differentiators for us as we move forward. We remain fully engaged in the many operational excellence programs we have implemented over the last 18 months.  During the quarter, we implemented several specific initiatives targeted at reducing total OpEx by approximately $100 million per annum. Some of these initiatives include a revised travel policy, implementing new mobility policy, increasing the use of video conferencing especially for large internal meetings, reducing our spend on outside consultants, cancelling the annual merit increase, and curtailing hiring in areas outside of critical R&D projects. For Q1, our objective is to hold OpEx relatively flat with Q4, with the addition of approximately $10 million for the employee-related taxes and other benefits expenses typically seen in Q1.  At the low end of our revenue guidance range of $800 million and despite the cost containments that we have outlined, we expense to see operating profit margins of approximately 15% for the first quarter. Our Q1 quarterly non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be approximately 29%. Based on these factors, we see non-GAAP earnings per share for the first quarter of between $0.15 and $0.17. This is calculated on a share count of 538 million shares.  Summing up, Juniper turned in a strong 2008 and fourth quarter, especially given the current economic circumstances. While Q1 will see continued softness, the company is in a very strong financial position and has significant opportunity to build additional productivity, efficiency and leverage into the business model. The economic challenges only heighten our attention on moving on those initiatives aggressively. I’ll now turn the call back to Kevin for additional color on Juniper’s outlook. Kevin.
Kevin Johnson: Before we take questions, let me add a few additional comments on our view of 2009. As Robyn mentioned, we expect Q1 will be a flattish quarter as compared to 2008 Q1 revenue. The fact that we are coming off our largest quarter ever in terms of orders, combined with the fact that our customer base is expanding reinforces the demand for high-performance networking remains. It’s not a question of if, it’s a question of when.  So as we look toward the full year for 2009, there are a range of scenarios with many variables as customers sort through the implications of the economic downturn. Therefore, we are not providing revenue guidance for 2009. We do view this as a time to focus on strengthening our product portfolio, growing market share, and driving customer satisfaction. We intend to do this while at the same time containing costs and allocating resources effectively. We’ve planned for a range of scenarios and we intend to be agile in our approach. Now, there are four principles that will guide our financial approach for 2009. First, we will continue to invest in R&D to deliver on our strong product roadmap. This means that our 2009 R&D OpEx may increase roughly 15% year-over-year in support of this investment. This investment ensures we are strengthening our value proposition relative to competition, which we believe positions us for acceleration as market conditions improve. A second principal is that we will continue to invest in customer satisfaction and maintain our commitments to customers. We will staff to meet demand in our services business. In specific instances, we will increase account resources assigned to our largest accounts as part of our support of very large projects that are under way. Satisfied customers are a long-term asset.  A third principal: while maintaining these customer commitments, we intend to drive sales and marketing productivity gains for 2009. We will work to be agile and deliver slight improvements in our sales and marketing expense as a percentage of booked revenue. Now, we recognize there may be some lumpiness quarter-to-quarter, but we will work to drive productivity on a year-over-year comparison.  And, then the fourth principal is all other costs will be managed very closely with a view toward cost containment in support of operating income. Now, we believe this approach enables us to enhance our product portfolio in the area of high-performance networking and strengthen our relationships with customers for the long-term growth. These two elements support a view of strengthening our position relative to competition during this downturn. We will work to be stronger than the smaller niche competitors and more agile than our larger competitors. And, my hope is that these financial principles will help you better understand what to expect from us in 2009. I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the ongoing dedication of all Juniper employees. As you may have seen, Juniper was included in Fortune’s recently released top 100 best places to work list. This is an award won by our employees and I want to thank them for making Juniper the kind of company we are and for their relentless focus on teamwork, innovation, and the customer. I also want to say that I’m looking forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming financial analyst day which will be held on February 24th in the Bay Area. So, at this time, let’s go ahead and open up the call for questions.
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will begin conducting the question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Evanson with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.
Jeff Evenson - Sanford Bernstein: Sure. I was wondering if you could give some comments on the thought process that service providers are going through as they reconfigure the timing of their orders.
Kevin Johnson: Yeah, I guess the way I would frame it is the projects that are underway are still underway. And, in many ways, my view is that like many other customers, they’re watching their revenue streams towards the end of the quarter and they’re being thoughtful on which side of the quarterly boundary they want to see their CapEx investments fall. But, it really has nothing to do with the project roadmap, it has more to do with being thoughtful about that financial management. And, so, in many ways, the conversations that I’ve had with our largest service provider customers, you know, we’re committed to help continue to drive forward on these projects and that’s why customer satisfaction becomes such a priority for us. We’re going to partner and work with these service providers as we work through this downturn. And, it’s not so much a question of if the demand’s growing and if these projects are going to happen. It’s more a question of when and the timing of how things fall quarter-to-quarter. And, that would be my perspective.
Jeff Evenson - Sanford Bernstein: So since projects are continuing, are they doing something different with just normal maintenance to existing networks or upgrades to existing capacity?
Kevin Johnson: Well, you have both. I mean, you have people that are doing upgrades to existing networks that have been deployed. And, they’re also doing new projects in convergence to lay in new services, new capabilities. So, there’s a full range of projects. But, it’s more a function of I think short-term fiscal management of which quarterly - you know, you look at the quarterly boundary where CapEx expenses are going to fall. But, these projects are continuing.
Jeff Evenson - Sanford Bernstein: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the Nikos Theodosopoulos with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS: Thank you. I wanted to touch on a couple of things. The comment about, I’m not sure if I heard this right, but it sounded like you're planning to increase operating expenses about I think you said 14-15% for the year. If I just look at the last couple of quarters, you know, OpEx has been generally flattish, and if I use the run rate and just keep that constant, it would be more of a flat OpEx in ’09 over ’08. So, it sounds like you plan on increasing OpEx throughout each of the quarters of next year. Is this based on confidence that March is going to be the lowest quarter on revenue and you would expect it to increase because if there is not a lot of visibility? I’m trying to understand why would OpEx keep increasing throughout the year.
Kevin Johnson: Yes. Thanks for your question, Nikos. The comment I made was we’re going invest in R&D OpEx which is a subset of total OpEx and the principle there is we’re offering a view that our 2009 R&D OpEx may increase roughly by 15% year-over-year. So that’s not total OpEx, that's just R&D OpEx and the view is that customers like our product roadmap. We like our product roadmap and we think by investing in R&D, it enables us to accelerate as this economic downturn eases. Now, certainly that requires us to be efficient in every other area so gaining efficiencies in sales productivity, containing costs in other areas are going to allow us to channel priorities into driving the delivery of that product roadmap and so my comment was specifically to R&D OpEx.
Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS: So how do you think the total OpEx will trend for the year then?
Kevin Johnson: Well, we’ve offered the set of four principles that I gave you allow you to take a look. We said we’re going to invest in R&D to deliver on our product roadmap. Customer satisfaction, I think, you look and say we're going to staff to meet service demand and certainly our services expenses fall more in the cogs related to services but there will be some areas where we’ll have customer projects that we’ve committed incremental resources on the account team to drive satisfaction. But then on sales and marketing, we’re really intending to drive productivity gains for 2009 and that productivity gain is looking at OpEx as a percentage of booked revenue and then, all other costs we’re going try to manage very closely with the view toward cost containment and Robyn outlined roughly $100 million of actions that we've taken on cost containment thus far.
Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS:  Alright. Thanks.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Ehud Gelblum with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.
Ehud Gelblum - JP Morgan:  Hi. Thank you. Thanks guys. Clarification on the question actually. You mentioned, for the clarification, you mentioned that the enterprise grew 17% and that included EX and that It grew nicely without it. Could you give us a sense as to what it grew without the EX or maybe give us what the EX number was as well so we can get sense of what EX doing there? Further, the timing in the 8200 on the EX and when we can see that? Is it still on track for - I see actually it's in not easy to get $28 million. So if you can give a sense of what enterprise did without the EX that would be helpful where the 17% goes?  My question is when you look at Q1 in the order of a $10 million, a $20 million or so in that range, basically down $100 million from the Q4 of 09/23 and bring the operating margin down with it versus where we were at this level last year, can you give us the components as to what is primarily falling off in the $100 million from the Q4 to now and what are the components that really bring the margin down? Is there some kind of mix such change in the margin?  We’re losing more IPG than we’re losing SLT and therefore, the mix moves more to SLT and brings the margin down or it is purely just a higher OpEx? So if you can give a sense of what the mix of the $100 million that we’re losing and how does that tells and do in the margin to get us down to the low 800s in revenue and the 15% operating margin would be great?
Robyn Denholm:  So let me talk about the gross margin area first, Ehud.
Ehud Gelblum - JP Morgan:  Sure.
Robyn Denholm: If you look at the gross margin I actually said in the guidance for the near term, we have moved our range down. Typically, we talked about 66% to 68% margin. We’ve actually pulled it down to 65% to 67% and that is based on the competitive dynamics out there. It's also a productive mix. As Kevin talked about in terms of projects and things like that, they have different gross margin levels that type of thing to run rate business and also in terms of the product areas. As you know, our gross margin vary between some of the higher end routing product compared to the EDGE and also that type of thing as well so we do see an impact both from pricing and competitive dynamics their and then also in terms of the product mix in the near term.
Ehud Gelblum - JP Morgan:  Is the pricing more on the routing side or it is more in the enterprise side?
Robyn Denholm: Just given the macro environment out there, we believe pricing is more competitive.
Kevin Johnson :  Yes and it’s not so much in the core routing. A little bit on EDGE and some in enterprise and some of it is also a mixed shift as we see the EX switch business and SLT businesses grow within the enterprise.
Ehud Gelblum - JP Morgan:  Okay. So the difference between Q4 and Q1, where is the major (inaudible) revenue? is it across the board or is it more in one part of the business than the other?
Kevin Johnson:  It's probably more in service provider than in enterprise.
Robyn Denholm:  And as stated in the guidance section, Q1 we see a typical seasonal pattern in terms of enterprise being down slightly. So we also anticipate that being amplified in this environment.
Ehud Gelblum - JP Morgan:  Okay. Great. Could you give us an enterprise number without the EX? Is that possible?
Robyn Denholm:  So the EX for the quarter was - sorry. $28 million of revenue.
Ehud Gelblum - JP Morgan:  Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Samona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Samona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs:  Hi. Thank you very much. I just wanted to follow up on that last question on the pricing dynamics embedded within your margin guidance. To what extent is the introduction over your competitors' new EDGE router, the ASR 9000, which I think is starting to ship this quarter, affecting that at all? And also relative to your MX shipment, are you selling those in place where you normally be selling the T-series. In other words, you think the EDGE router and what should normally be using CORE routers and is that also having an impact on the margin?
Kevin Johnson :  You want to take that or do you want me? 
Robyn Denholm: So in terms of the overall gross margin dynamics, as I said before there is - we think increased pricing competition across the board not in any particular product area or another. What was the second part, Samona, of your question?
Samona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs: Relative to the MX versus the T-series, if they're starting to overlap in terms whether the MX is shipping so is that maybe reducing the opportunity for your T routers? 
Robyn Denholm: So what I've been saying is we have a very broad portfolio in terms of products and we put the right products in for the customers' environment so whether that's T or MX, it really depends on the situation itself. So having the broad portfolio that we have that actually helps not only in the customer environment itself.
Samona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs: And then just a quick followup. Do you have any sense for whether the overall IP routing market this year is going to be up or down? 
Kevin Johnson: Well, I guess my perspective is that the demand equation continues. There are more broadband internet users. They’re spending more minutes of usage or user on the internet and they’re consuming more high-bit traffic such as video, and so you put that equation together and demand for high performance networking continues to grow and I don’t think that changes in 2009. I think the projects are going to continue in this particular area and I do think service providers they are going to be thoughtful about the capital spend quarter by quarter and I think they’re going to play quarter by quarter as well, but I think the projects and deployments, we'll need to continue to meet the demand of traffic growth.
Samona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs:  But the order push outs and the delivery shipment push outs you're seeing, do you think those reflect some of the service providers' ability to run their networks harder for a period of time and maybe or whether they can meet continued increase in demand? And so do you think the net of that equation of increasing utilization and increasing demand net out to positive or negative growth for the year?
Kevin Johnson:  Well, I think if you look at that maybe you can go a quarter or two quarters, but I don’t think there is that much buffer to run that high much beyond that. So I do think there's a little bit of a view of some folks are taxing a little bit quarter by quarter to see what happens, but in the end they’re going to have to make a move to continue to continue to meet the demand. And our approach is going to be one, we’re partnered on these projects. We want to make sure customers are satisfied and we’re going to work with to make sure we’re deploying and enabling these solutions recognizing that in this economic situation they’re having to be thoughtful - about the CapEx and which side of the quarterly boundary is going to fall.
Simona Jankowski - Golden Sachs: Thank you.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets: Thank you. Kevin does the weak first quarter or first half for that matter suggest a magnified back half recovery or are you not planning for that scenario and customers may remain challenged for the entire year? And I’m just asking from an order pattern point of view, do you feel $800 million is the bottom or considering the dynamics with the network utilization; things can actually slide further from there?
Kevin Johnson: Yes. Thanks for your question, Mark. First of all, if you look at our pattern over the last several years Q1 is always a lower quarter as a percentage of total full year revenue and at this point there is a range of scenarios and I think Q1 will continue to be a lower percentage of full year revenue. The view is though that there is a range of scenarios that could play out. The second half could be a higher percentage of full-year revenues than it has been traditionally or the pattern could continue, but I think a lot of that is the function of the economic downturn and the uncertainty in the economic climate and then, how customers are managing those quarter-to-quarter decisions. So we have modeled the full range of scenarios and we’re going to play this quarter by quarter and be thoughtful about our resources and the principles by which we're positioning ourselves so that when we do see an uptake in this that we have strengthened our position relative to the competition and position us for an accelerated growth coming out of this downturn.
Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. So generally, you do see a recovery at one point which is why you’re not doing a headcount reduction across the board? 
Kevin Johnson: We have done some headcount rebalancing as Robyn mentioned and we are - if I look at the principles that we outlined here, we want to continue to invest in R&D. Sales and marketing, we’re going to drive productivity gains which says that we’re going to be agile and flexible as we see revenue, but I also think quarter on quarter we could see some lumpiness in the patterns of revenue that don’t necessarily match prior years just given the economic situation.
Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of John Marchetti with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.
John Marchetti - Cowen and Company: Thanks very much. Just a quick question given the outlook on the orders and what you’re seeing now on book to bill just sort of getting back to Mark's question a little bit. As we look through the remainder of the year, you talked about orders being pushing out, do you think these are push outs of a quarter or two? Do you think they’re out beyond that? And then secondly, from an R&D perspective, how does that affect you as these things are getting pushed out? Do you see that R&D spending still following through relatively on a consistent basis as you go through the year? Is it more fund end loaded? Just trying to get a sense for how you’re looking at that spending versus how you expect some of the revenue that the orders have been deferred are going come through?
Kevin Johnson: Yes. Let me make some comments and then I’ll let Robyn punctuate a couple of things. Let’s see, first of all the R&D plan. We really have to think about that in terms of a two to three-year product cycle because if we look at the investments we make in the set of things that we’re building over the next two to three years, when we sit down with customers and customers are sharing kind of their needs and their projects' timeline and we’re sharing our product roadmap, there becomes a connection there in terms of what we’re trying to drive in terms of creation of value for the customers and that’s enabling us to continue to increase the value were creating. So we have to be careful not to have stops and starts in the R&D plan quarter to quarter. We have to be a little bit more fluid in our thinking on the longer term investments in R&D and that’s why I think when we see some lumpiness in revenue, we can’t overreact and start cutting R&D projects and then the next quarter try to start them up again. If you’re constantly in start-stop mode, you never deliver on the end product. And so we’re going to try and play that more consistently through 2009 and be more agile in other areas of our business where we can perhaps contain costs and drive sales in marketing productivity. First part of that question, Robyn, you want to answer?
Robyn Denholm: Yes. So John on the book-to-bill as I said in my prepared remarks is that it was above one in the quarter and what we saw was more orders with the customer request side (ph) outside of the quarter both the Q4 in terms of what we normally experience at that part of the quarter. And so what we anticipate is that we'll continue that as Kevin said that as companies are actually monitoring their own financial quote performance, they will decide they want the product but they don’t necessarily want this quarter versus next quarter. So we expect some of that volatility to continue.
Kevin Johnson:  Yes and I think just to add to it. We see most of them are orders that are pushed out to the next quarter. Some pushed out two quarters, but very few if any start going beyond two quarters. So customers are kind of looking out over the next six months and they're sort of placing orders that land in the next quarter although a few of them push out two quarters, but it’s not like they’re pushed out much beyond that.
John Marchetti - Cowen and Company:  So most of those orders just haven’t been sort of pushed out within a definite delivery day, it may be a quarter or two.
Kevin Johnson:  That’s correct.
John Marchetti - Cowen and Company:  Thank you.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Ken Muth with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Ken Muth - Robert W. Baird: Hi. The question of kind of your product portfolio and kind of where you’re headed in some of the additional investments. We saw a lot of good data from their build out in 2008 along with kind of the cloud build outs, can you just give us your insights, what you kind of expect that to be in 2009?
Kevin Johnson:  Well, I think what you've highlighted is the significant market trend in computing that is really driving centralization. I call it centralization. You can call it cloud-based computing, but it is driven by the fundamental economics of declining costs of CapEx per unit of compute with the increasing OpEx required to support that unit of computing as driving customers do centralize and so the centralization of these mega data centers is something that is just beginning and will be a trend over the next five to ten years. And because of that the emergence of things like virtualization and massive server farms, you see things like many core processing. You see the whole convergence of compute fabrics with storage fabrics with network fabrics that run the centralization of these big data centers, and my view is that's not just a short term 2008 phenomenon. That is a phenomenon that will continue over the next five to seven to ten years and that is one that also plays right to our strength. It plays to our strength of world class networking at scale. It presents some of the most complicated problems in the world on how to handle this computing and the kind of scalability performance, reliability required for these mega data centers to operate, and so we view that as clearly another area that's generating demand in our core confidence of high performance networking.
Ken Muth - Robert W. Baird:  But do you just may be see just a slow down or a pause in the first half of '09 as well? Just to give you saw a kind of strong buildup through 2008?
Kevin Johnson:  Well, if you look at history every economic bump in the road has caused customers to be very thoughtful about capital spend and I think this period is no different than what we've see in the past and I think that would apply to enterprises as well as service providers and so I think it will cause customers to be thoughtful about their CapEx for these mega data centers as well.
Ken Muth - Robert W. Baird: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Ader with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.
Jason Ader - William Blair: Thank you. I was just curious on the EX. How much do you think the macro headwinds are going to affect your ability to gain significant share with that product line this year?
Kevin Johnson: Well, we’ve been growing share with just having the EX 4200 and EX3200 in market and the fact that we now have the EX 8208 in market that gives us a significantly more scalable solution in the switching business, I think, gives us more tailwind to grow share in the market that clearly customers are going to be thoughtful about capital spend in the next quarter. Then we’re going to add to it the EX 8216 and so I think that the continued rhythm coming from our business groups on product releases will continue to help strengthen our switch portfolio and I think that goes well for opportunities to take share even in a tough economic climate.
Jason Ader - William Blair:  What does it mean for the customers? What are the main draws of the product? Cisco is so dominant in that space and I'm sure they're going to be very aggressive in this environment in terms of pricing and things like that to maintain their market share. How do you compete against them?
Kevin Johnson: Well, I think in a tough economic period, a proposition that lowers total cost of ownership plays very well with enterprise customers and we've engineered these solutions to require a smaller footprint in data centers to consume less power, to put off less heat, and because of Juno we can actually deploy this with less labor on the customer side and so I think there is a significant value proposition around total cost of ownership that resonates with customers.
Jason Ader - William Blair:  Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Coleman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Scott Coleman - Morgan Stanley: Thanks. Just to go back to the bookings trends, Kevin. I think what you said in your prepared remarks that bookings were late. They came in late in the quarter but it was also a record quarter for orders. So it sounds like you had a flood the last a couple of weeks of the quarter in terms of orders. Did it dry up a lot in January? I understand the concern about delivery dates but I'm wondering what the trend has been since what sounds like a very strong period of orders late in the quarter?
Kevin Johnson: Well, I guess my first comment is when you look at prior quarters, much of the order flow occurs in the third month of that quarter. Not all of it, but in the third month. This last quarter Q4 I would say it was probably more so than prior quarters and even more so in the last couple of weeks of the quarter. And I attribute that to the fact that customers are watching their financial revenue flows and they're making financial decisions on which side of the quarterly boundary they want to see the capital expense hit and so they wait until very late in the quarter to make those decisions and as they made them then we saw the results of that of these orders coming in late in the quarter. And I expect that to continue in a period where customers are going to be very focused on monitoring their financial performance and being thoughtful about their expenditures especially on the capital side while we're working through this economic downturn.
Scott Coleman - Morgan Stanley: Okay. So clearly did not carry over into the early part of part of January then.
Kevin Johnson: Yes. Well, I think we're early in the quarter and we'll see what happens. But the pattern in every quarter is that higher percentage of the orders come in the third month of the quarter and I would expect our Q1 to be no different.
Scott Coleman - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then maybe, one for Robyn on OpEx. I think what you said is for Q1 OpEx would be flat but would potentially an additional $10 million for things like Fica (ph) and so on. Your R&D was down pretty significantly on a sequential basis at least in my model. Did that pop back up in Q1 and sales and marketing will starts to come down and that is how we should think about the starting point for the year?
Robyn Denholm: Yes. Scott, let me answer that. The first question, I did say that Q1 we expect to be roughly flat with Q4 with the addition of about $10 million in total. So now I'll go back to Q4. In Q4 what we saw was a favorable impact versus Q3 of 2008 of variable compensation expense. And so it is variable than obviously as we moved forward in Q1 and R&D specifically there's also the timing of prototype in terms of Q4 in being lower. So we do expect those to increase and then as Kevin said, working on the efficiencies that we have not just in sales and marketing but across the board and the cost reduction - assets that we have already put in place, but then also within sales and marketing continuing to work on the productivity as well.
Scott Coleman - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Thank you very much
Robyn Denholm: Thank you. Operator we have time for one more question.
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Jeff Gable with Barclays Capital. Please proceed with your question.
Jeff Gable - Barclays Capital: Thank you. Robyn, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more clarity on the trajectory of OpEx half of the first quarter. Is there a way for us to build a $100 million into our expectations for the latter half of the year or about the three quarters of the year, really?
Robyn Denholm: At this point, as Kevin said, we're not going to give full-year numbers. So we have given you some principles. So the area of R&D is one that we do want to see or continuation in our investments across the year and you need to set those up at the beginning of the year so that we do actually deliver the products that are in that roadmap that we continue to do that. In terms of the other areas, as I've said in the prepared remarks, we have taken action already to reduce cost by more that $100 million and we will continue to look for other areas of opportunity.  Kevin talked about the sales and marketing area, obviously G&A were continuing to look at for cost improvement as well and actually even in our cogs area and across the board in terms of the whole company working on our operational excellence programs. And we've been at this for a while in terms of those operational excellence initiative. So we expect them to continue to deliver throughout the '09 period.
Jeff Gable - Barclays Capital: Okay. So R&D, we have - that's very helpful. On SG&A then would it be prudent then to say you'll try and match your sales and marketing expense to the trajectory of revenues?
Robyn Denholm: I would say that it's fair that we would look at revenue in terms of one of the indicators of what we should be doing in sales and marketing.
Jeff Gable - Barclays Capital: Okay. Thank you, Robyn.
Robyn Denholm: Okay. Thank you. We'd like to thank everyone for joining us today and we look forward to seeing many of you at our analyst day which is scheduled for February 24th here in the Bay area. Thank you so much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this thus concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your line.

===== 2008 Q3  (2008-10-23 16:45:00) =====
Executives: Kathleen Bela - VP of IR Scott Kriens - Chairman of the Board Kevin Johnson - CEO Robyn Denholm - CFO
Analysts: Scott Coleman - Morgan Stanley Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS Tal Liani - Merrill Lynch & Company Ehud Gelblum - JPMorgan Jeff Evenson - Sanford Bernstein Jeff Gable - Barclays Capital Troy Jensen - Piper Jaffray Paul Silverstein - Credit Suisse Tim Long - Banc of America Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer
Operator: Welcome to the Juniper Networks Q3 2008 earnings results conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions). It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Miss Kathleen Bela, VP of IR for Juniper Networks. Thank you, Miss Bela, you may begin.
Kathleen Bela: Thank you, Doug, good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today. Here today are Scott Kriens, Chairman of the Board; Kevin Johnson, our Chief Executive Officer; and Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, I would like to remind everyone that statements made during this call concerning Juniper's business outlook, future financial operating results, and overall future prospects, are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including: economic conditions generally or in the networking industry; changes in overall technology spending; the network capacity requirements of service providers; the timing of orders and shipments; manufacturing and supply chain constraints; variation in the mix of products sold; customer perceptions and acceptance of our product; litigation; and other factors listed in our most recent report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the event facts or circumstances change after the date of this call. In discussing the financial results today, Robyn will first present results on a GAAP basis and for purposes of today's discussion will also review non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why the management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company's financial results, please consult our filings with the SEC. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP, please see today's press release. In general, non-GAAP results exclude certain non-recurring charges such as amortization of purchased intangibles, other acquisition-related charges, and expenses related to stock-based compensation. In today's call, Robyn will also be providing forward-looking guidance. As a reminder, guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis. All guidance is forward-looking and actual results may vary for the reasons I noted earlier. A GAAP EPS target is not accessible on a forward-looking basis, due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to the charges, which are excluded from the non-GAAP EPS estimates. Please note that today's call is scheduled to last for one hour, and please limit your questions to one per firm. With that, I will turn the call over to Scott.
Scott Kriens: Thanks, Kathleen, and good afternoon to everyone. Since Kevin and I shared the duties at the helm for this quarter, I would like to take just a few minutes here, before turning the call over to Kevin and Robyn, to share my perspective on two points with all of you. First, as we announced on our July earnings call, Kevin started September 8th, so I would like to begin with an update after these first seven weeks since Kevin's arrival as our new CEO, and then second, some observations on the quarter we've just reported and our belief on what makes these results possible in what anyone would agree are challenging times. So, as you may remember from earlier updates on the hiring process that brought Kevin to us at Juniper, we approached the search with two criteria of utmost importance to us, one being the right cultural fit with our beliefs and our values, and secondly, the skills and the experience that would help us realize the potential we have before us here at Juniper. It's been both fun and exciting to get the chance to begin working together in these first weeks. We have been able to confirm shared beliefs about how a company and the community that it represents should be built, and for me to roll up my sleeves with a leader with whom I can have every type of conversation, from cultural to technical, and from operational to strategic. It's already very clear, Kevin has seen this kind of growth before, and with that the challenges it brings, so we are having a lot of very short discussions on the needs and the opportunities, because that's all it takes before we move into what choices we might make, and the priorities we should have. Kevin will offer his comments in a few minutes here as well, but our team today is stronger than ever before, and Kevin's impact and his value-added are already apparent to all of us. What's also apparent from our results is that Kevin's joining a very strong team. This team has not only welcomed Kevin to his role, but also John Morris, who joined us in July as our new leader of Worldwide Field Operations, with responsibilities for the revenues we posted this quarter and a significant share of the expenses that were managed under the top line in order to achieve our 25% operating margin model earlier than we had expected. The entire team, of both executive leadership and the almost 7,000 others who support those leaders, have proven their focus and their commitment to operational excellence by delivering outstanding results through times of change and uncertainty, and that's really the strongest test possible of the underlying strength of any team. This quarter, we saw compelling evidence of our customer's confidence in Juniper, which is apparent in looking at virtually every metric we manage. Robyn will cover these results in detail in a moment, but suffice to say we're very pleased with our performance in Q3, and thus far this year, as we continue to meet and exceed our goals for operating margins, market share gains, and overall performance in our markets. The question anyone might ask is, “How is this possible in these times?” And the answer, quite simply, is that our strategy is working. There is a very distinct market within the overall communications industry for high performance networking, and our leadership in that market is emerging even more rapidly in challenging times. People are buying only what they need, and we are responding to those needs with a superior operating system in JUNOS and a portfolio of hard-hitting product cycles with immediate benefit in both operational savings and value added to our customers in their markets. With that backdrop, and in the continuing execution of our transition, I will now turn this call and future earnings calls over to Robyn and Kevin to bring you their perspectives on both the details behind the strength of our performance and the outlook for the company. Kevin?
Kevin Johnson: Great, thanks, Scott. Well, first of all, I'm delighted to be here at Juniper, and to participate in this discussion about our Q3 results and the outlook for the future. I've had a chance to meet some of you on the call today, and I do look forward to meeting many more of you in the weeks and months ahead. I would like to share some thoughts on my transition into Juniper, and offer some early observations about our business and the opportunities ahead. As part of my transition, my initial focus has really been in three areas. Number one is making connections, both internally as I meet with Juniper employees around the world, as well as externally as I meet with customers, partners, analysts, and investors. Number two is driving execution through a hands-on engagement with the management processes that we use to run the business. I've been conducting individual and group meetings throughout the organization, really focusing on understanding how we do business and identifying the levers we have to improve our performance. Number three is about shaping our three-year plan as part of a well-defined planning process that engages leaders throughout Juniper. This process is really focused on delivering a three-year plan with a clear set of goals and an operating plan for 2009. Engaging in these areas, there are some key observations about the industry, and how Juniper is positioned in the industry, that I think are relevant. From a high level, I think the long-term growth fundamentals of the high performance networking industry are good. The number of people using the Internet will continue to grow, and digitization of content, including video content, is accelerating. Consumption and protection of that digital content across a broad range of devices continues to expand. Businesses will continue to pursue productivity increases through communication and collaborative solutions, and [client-based] computing will evolve and play a larger and larger role in applications for both consumers and businesses. All of these trends create long-term demand for high-performance networks, as the network is really the enabler in all of these scenarios. When I step back and look at the industry, the long-term growth fundamentals are good. Near term, there's a lot of uncertainty in the economy, and many questions as to how the economic conditions will affect the short-term outlook for the industry. Even with the recent economic uncertainty, we delivered a solid Q3 and we are optimistic, yet cautious, about our opportunity going forward. Given the uncertainty in the economy, I think there are many questions that prompt all of us to step back and be thoughtful about the near-term approach. Questions like, ”How will the credit markets impact the capital spend of service providers and enterprise customers?” “How will the economic situation impact consumer demand for communication services from service providers?” “How will the economic situation impact enterprise IT spend and enterprise investment in infrastructure?” These are a few of the questions that we're exploring as we chart our course for the near term. Looking ahead, we remain cautiously optimistic about Juniper, and our ability to drive growth even in a challenging economic period. I think there are five factors that work in our favor. Number one is our expanded product portfolio. Number two is our value proposition as it relates to providing customers a lower total cost of ownership. Number three is our people and continued improvements in execution. Number four is, the expanded depth and breadth of our customer base. Number five is our favorable position to take market share. Let me comment on each of these five in a bit more detail. First, our expanded product portfolio is delivering value to our customers. I look at the EX switch offerings. They've been a hit with industry watchers and customers alike. We are readying the next products in this family with the EX 8208 and the EX 8216. The EX 8208 switch is currently in beta testing with customers, and it will ship with JUNOS 9.4 in Q1 of 2009. The 8216 will follow shortly thereafter. The MX product family was released last year, and has been the fasting ramping product in our company's history, with more than 300 customers worldwide. This week, we announced the Intelligence Services Edge, which is an integrated portfolio of new features for our M and MX-series that extend JUNOS to a broad range of new applications. We introduced the industry's first Dynamic Services Architecture in a new category of extensible networking products with the SRX. Organizations such as Raymond James and the University of Frankfurt are attracted to the Juniper approach and this new architecture as a way to help them maximize their technology investments and address their ever-changing business requirements. Our product portfolio is strong. It is expanding, and we have more coming in the R&D pipeline. The second key point, then, in the challenging economic period. One element of our value proposition is a lower total cost of ownership for our customers. Core to Juniper's differentiation is our strategy to provide a comprehensive high-performance network portfolio powered by JUNOS. This enables customer to increase the performance, reliability and security, while simplifying their operations and lowering their operating expenses. In the enterprise setting, companies such as Technicolor, AmazingMail, AdvancedMD Software, Ferrum College, have all deployed Juniper solutions to lower their IT cost and complexity. On the service provider side, we're enabling customers like XO Communications to accelerate new service introductions for business customers while reducing their operational cost. We are also providing enhanced network security, and more efficient responsive service delivery, for customer facing providers, including Telecom New Zealand International. Amplifying this customer benefit of the lower total cost of ownership is something that resonates in a period of economic uncertainty. Number three, our people and execution, continues to improve. We've got a great team here at Juniper, and that team is focused on excellence, execution, and driving results. I've seen evidence of this in many parts of the business, whether it's our R&D organizations that are executing on the product creation side or field organizations driving execution across the regions. Our enterprise go-to-market is making progress as our EX products offer a compelling sales opportunity for our challenge partners. There's certainly much, much more that we need to do in the area of excellence and execution, but we are making progress and our people are really focused on it. Fourth area is expanding the depth and breadth of our customer reach. I think it's important to me that we as a company stay very focused on the customer, and driving deeper relationships with service providers enables us to participate in more projects and earn more of their business. In the Enterprise segment, we're growing our reach. In Q3, over 30% of our EX enterprise customers were new customers to Juniper. Expanding the breadth of customers we do business with, and expanding the relationship with existing customers, will create opportunity. And finally, as a challenger in the market, I think we are well-positioned to take share. A strong product portfolio with the customer focused value proposition, great team of people focused on execution, and an increased depth and breadth of customer relationships, all support a growth agenda. Certainly, we have great competitors, but we will stay focused on the customer, and we will deliver great solutions that enable customer value. I think these five points support a view that even in a challenging economic period, we can be cautiously optimistic about our near-term prospects, recognizing the long-term growth fundamentals of the industry are good. In a moment, Robyn will take you through our results and provide some detail around our outlook for the balance of the year. We believe the company will deliver on its objectives for 2008, and in the meantime, will work through our planning process to gain more insight on the broader macroeconomic environment. As we enter Q4, we will continue to be thoughtful and responsible with our investments as we execute in this uncertain economic period. As you will hear, we plan to continue to execute against the philosophy of driving top-line revenue growth, while also increasing operating margins through productivity gains and economies of scale. We will be financially responsible in this time of economic uncertainty while maintaining a proactive posture of driving growth in our top-line revenue. Now I'll ask Robyn to take us through the numbers, and we'll come back to take some questions. Robyn?
Robyn Denholm: Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon everyone. I'm pleased to report that in the third quarter, we met or exceeded all guidance metrics, including delivering on our goal of 25% operating margin one quarter earlier than targeted. Given the developments in the global economic environment, we are being thoughtful in how we assess the state of our business, but with that said, our demand metrics remain strong, through the end of the quarter. Our product book-to-bill ratio remained above 1, we have good visibility into our pipeline for Q4, and our deferred revenue balance remains strong. Scott and Kevin have shared insights with you about the strategic factors that drove our growth this quarter, so I would like to focus my comments on the improving execution in the business that has enabled Juniper's profit growth to accelerate. I will discuss revenue and earnings on a GAAP basis first, and then shift to the non-GAAP discussion as we dive deeper into our operating performance. Total revenue for the third quarter of 2008 was $947 million, up 29% from the prior year and up 8% sequentially from the second quarter. Juniper earned net income of $148.5 million on a GAAP basis, or $0.27 per diluted share, up 77% from the $0.15 reported in the 2007 third quarter. During the quarter, as anticipated and on schedule, we delivered an essential element of the Verizon FiOS network build. This event triggered the first revenue recognition for this project. As can be seen from the balance sheet, our deferred revenue balances reduced on a sequential basis as a result of this, with the majority of the recognition of revenue in services. The diversification of our revenues, from both a geographic and customer perspective, again aided our results. The Americans represented approximately 51% of total revenue in the third quarter, as compared to 44% in the second quarter. Europe, Middle East, and Africa, represented 29% of total revenue in the third quarter, as compared to 33% in the second quarter. Asia Pacific represented 20% of total revenue in the third quarter, as compared to second quarter of 23%. Regionally, the Americas had a strong quarter, growing total revenue 39% year-over-year, with our largest single region, the US, also growing at 39%. Service provider revenues grew 46% year-over-year, and enterprise 21%. In APAC, they also had a good quarter, with year-over-year growth of 27%. This growth was led by Japan and ASEAN with year-over-year growth rates for service provider and enterprise at 31% and 16% respectively. EMEA grew 16% with good year-over-year growth in the Middle East and in Eastern Europe. On a segment basis, total IPG revenue of $729.3 million was up 34% on a year-over-year basis, and total XLT revenue of $217.7 million, was up 14% on a year-over-year basis. IPG revenue includes $18 million of EX switch revenue and EX bookings more than doubled quarter-over-quarter from $10 million to over $20 million. As Kevin mentioned, our switch products continue to receive great customer and industry reviews. Within each of the segments, IPG product revenue was up 31% year-over-year, and IPG Services revenue was up 50% year-over-year. IPG product growth was primarily due to the increases in T-series, MX, and E-series products. SLT product revenue was up 10% year-over-year, and SLT Services revenue was up 25% year-over-year. The SLT product growth was mainly driven by access solutions, branch solutions, and high-end firewall systems, partially offset by declines in the WX products. On a sequential basis, total IPG revenue was up 8% and total SLT revenue was up 5%. Looking at the markets we addressed, service provider sales were 72.7% of total revenue, up 31% year-over-year and up 8% sequentially, with strength in the America and APAC regions. Total sales into the enterprise market were 27.3% of revenue, an increase of 24% year-over-year, and 7% sequentially, with the Americas region showing the best growth and showing continued improvement from selling more infrastructure solutions, both switches and routers to enterprise customers Verizon was our only customer to exceed 10% of revenue for the quarter. Total revenue with Verizon for this quarter was 13%, and this was a result of both new business and the deferred revenue recognized. Turning to our non-GAAP results, total gross margins for the quarter were 68% of revenue, at the top end of our long-term model range of 66% to 68%, and slightly higher than our Q2 gross margins. Product gross margins were 70.3% of revenue, slightly lower than the second quarter. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, geographic mix contributed favorably due to our strong Americas performance, and this was offset by product mix being relatively lower due to a larger proportion of E and MX-series products and a lower overall pick mix. Product gross margins are strong. Services gross margins were 58.3% of revenue for the quarter, up 53.7% from Q2. This increase was primarily due to the increase in revenue and the ongoing productivity and cost initiatives the team has undertaken. Operating expenses totaled $406.4 million, or 42.9% of revenue. This represents an improvement of 5 percentage points from the third quarter of last year when expenses were 47.9% of revenue. On a sequential basis, we contained our expense growth to just 5%, a good result compared with our 8% sequentially revenue growth. R&D expenses totaled $181.2 million, or 19.1% of revenue, an increase of 15% on a year-over-year basis. We continue to invest in the areas that will ensure we maintain product momentum. Sales and marketing expenses totaled $189.5 million, or 20% of revenue, a reduction as a percentage of revenue of nearly 3 percentage points in a year-over-year basis. Operating profit for the quarter was strong at $237.6 million, resulting in an operating margin of 25.1% of revenue. Solid revenue growth, good gross margins, and a disciplined focus on our expense management have resulted in our achievement of this target that we set out at the beginning of the year, and we achieved that a quarter earlier than we committed. I am very pleased with the continued improvement in execution, and we expect to sustain these operating margins into Q4. Looking at our segments, operating margins for IPG were strong at 29.7% for the quarter, and SLT operating margins increased to 9.5% for the quarter. Operating margins for both IPG and SLT demonstrate good sequential improvement, and SLT operating margins increased for the third successive quarter. Turning to the bottom line, Juniper posted non-GAAP net income of $175.6 million, an increase of 41% from the year ago results. Net interest in other income was $9.7 million, down 26% sequentially, and 46% year-over-year, as a result of lower net returns on our investments. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 29%, and diluted earnings per share were $0.32, up $0.04 from the second quarter, and up a substantial $0.10 over the prior year figure of $0.22. Looking at the balance sheet, as of the end of September, we ended the quarter with over $2.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short- and long-term investments. This is down from about $2.3 billion in the second quarter due to the share repurchase activity in the quarter. We generated cash flow from operations in the quarter of approximately $205 million, up slightly from $200 million in the second quarter, and during the quarter we repurchased approximately 80 million shares at an average price of $24.56, or approximately $440 million. We have been conservative in our investment strategies with regards to our cash, and with no debt on our balance sheet we are in a very comfortable position to continue to grow our business and execute on our R&D priorities. For the quarter, our share count was approximately 554 million shares. CapEx for the quarter totaled $40.9 million, and depreciation and amortization was $38.9 million. DSOs decreased to 35 days in the third quarter, from 43 days in the second quarter. This was mainly as a result of the increase in revenue and the strong cash collections, and well within our range of 35 days to 45 days. Deferred revenue was $562.5 million, down from the $592.8 million reported at the end of the second quarter. Product deferred revenue decreased by approximately $10 million and service deferred revenue decreased by approximately $20 million. At the end of September, we had 6,830 employees, an increase of 299. The increase was primarily in the research and development, and included approximately 120 new employees being hired in India. We have slowed the increase in headcount quarter-over-quarter to ensure the flexibility in the operating model as we move forward in these uncertain times. Let's turn to our guidance. As Kevin discussed earlier in our call, over the long term, we believe the fundamentals of the markets we serve are sound. Given the near-term uncertainty around the credit markets and the economic environment in general, we are being cautiously optimistic about our near-term revenue guidance. We have shown that the productivity and operating efficiency programs that we've already had in place are delivering, and our operating expense control is working to ensure our operating model performance. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be between $921 million and $971 million, and our non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter to be between $0.30 and $0.33. This includes a $0.01 one-time benefit from the renewal of the US Federal R&D Tax Credit in October 2008. Our Q4 quarterly non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 27%. We expect gross margins to be between 66% and 68%, and operating margins to be consistent with Q3 at 25% or higher. This is calculated on a share count of 545 million shares. For the full 2008, this brings our revenue range to be between $3.57 billion to 3.62 billion, roughly in line with our previous quarter full year outlook. Due to our improving operational efficiencies, we have increased our guidance for full year EPS to between $1.17 and $1.20 per share. This is up from our previous full year guidance of $1.14 to $1.17 per share. Our 2008 annual non-GAAP tax rate is expected to decrease by 0.5% from 29% to 28.5% due principally to the R&D Federal Tax Credit renewal. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Kathleen to initiate the Q&A session.
Kathleen Bela: Thanks, Robyn. Doug, you can go ahead and open up the call for the Q&A.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Scott Coleman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Scott Coleman - Morgan Stanley: Thanks, and good afternoon. Obviously a very wide range of guidance, and prudent, given the circumstances, but Kevin and Robyn, I'm wondering if you could walk us through some of the specifics as to what would get you to the high end versus the low end? Are you more concerned about the carrier market or the enterprise market? Are there specific products or product categories that you are more or less concerned about? Just so we can understand some of the swing factors in the range here.
Kevin Johnson: Yeah, Scott, this is Kevin. Let me answer the question. First of all, I'll go back to the fact that we increased guidance at the end of Q2 for the full year, and certainly at the high end of revenue, we're maintaining that full year guidance, based on our optimism of performance. Now, at the same time, this quarter, we're increasing our EPS guidance, due to our improvement in execution and performance, which is leading to some growth in the margins. Certainly the widening range is more reflection of just the unknown in the current economic situation, and the speed at which the credit markets begin to shift and the speed at which that propagated to other aspects of the economy raises many questions. And so the widening of guidance is more a function of just being realistic about the fact that there is a number of unknowns in the market, and it's less about any lack of confidence or optimism about the value that we're delivering to customers. So I just pause there and see if that helps.
Scott Coleman - Morgan Stanley: Do you have any particular view on whether it's the carrier or the enterprise market that you're more concerned about as you go into Q4 with a book-to-bill greater than 1, and strong order trends through the quarter? I understand the caution, but I'm just curious if there's any area in particular you're more concerned about.
Kevin Johnson: There is not a specific area that we're concerned about and I think clearly there's different sets of issues related to credit available for capital spend in the service provider segment, and how cautious will enterprise IT. So this is really receipted to the macro level economics, and just being prudent in the fact that there's a lot of uncertainty and that we as a company, I want to make sure, first of all, we recognize that, two we're being thoughtful of that. And that as we look at our investments and the way that we're executing throughout the quarter, that we execute in a disciplined way. But to answer your question, there is not a specific concern that we would point to that says this is what would lead us to the low end. It's more macroeconomic related.
Scott Coleman - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Thank you very much.
Kevin Johnson: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nikos Theodosopoulos with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS: Yes. Thank you. I had a couple of questions, hopefully both of them are pretty quick. Can you give an update on the IBM relationship and whether or not there has been any sell-through of the EX product through that relationship at this point or are the sales of the EX pretty much through the traditional channels? And my other question was on the services gross margin, which went up pretty strongly, was there any one-time benefit due to this large deferral recognition of the Verizon revenue or is this something we should look at as productivity that can continue? Thank you.
Kevin Johnson: Thanks, Nikos. I'll take your first question and then I'll hand the second one over to Robyn. First of all, to answer your are question, certainly IBM is an important partner, and they are reselling our EX switches, and we're going to continue to focus on strengthening our partnerships with all of our channel partners, IBM included. And so they're an important part of our work in the market.  And Robyn, do you want to take then second question?
Robyn Denholm: Yes, on those services margin improvement, the sequential improvement, there's definitely some cost savings, you can see the trend throughout the year increasing quarter-over-quarter, but there was some favorable impact due to the services revenue recognition in the quarter with Verizon.
Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS: Can you kind of quantity how much of the improvement was due to Verizon?
Robyn Denholm: What I can say is that if you look at the trends in terms of the actual productivity improvements, they are increasing over time.
Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS: Okay. Thank you.
Kevin Johnson: Thanks, Nikos.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Merrill Lynch & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Tal Liani - Merrill Lynch & Company: Thank you. My question relates to the question that Nikos asked at the end. Is the decline in deferred revenues, I think $30-plus million, short-term deferred revenues, is this predominantly related to Verizon? Do we look at it as a good proxy for the recognition at Verizon? And then would you mind to comment on the breakdown between service revenues and product revenues? You did say a lot of it went to service revenues, if you can give some kind of to quantify it? And third, is this one-off or should we see a decline in deferred revenues for a few quarters because of the Verizon deal? Thanks.
Robyn Denholm: Thanks, Tal. I'll answer that question. So the first thing that I wanted to make sure I commented on is deferred revenue is a normal part of our business. Every quarter we add deferred revenue, and it comes through the balance sheet and then through the P&L and some quarters we take out deferred revenue depending on when features that delivered and normal ratable revenue recognition on services. For this quarter, we did have the first event in terms of revenue recognition on Verizon, and what I talked about was the deferred revenue balance sheet amounts, $20 million in the services area and $10 million quarter-over-quarter in the product area. They were the sequential movements. In terms of prospective deferred revenue and the balance sheet, we're always going to have projects with customers that are strategic in nature, in which case go over many quarters. So I think deferred revenue as part of our model is actually a very healthy thing as I commented before.
Kevin Johnson: Yes, I'll just add to that, that on a quarterly basis, certainly you look at the book-to-bill being greater than 1. That's reflective of the demand we're seeing in the market. And every quarter, there's a certain set of milestones we hit that we have things coming in and out of deferred revenue all the time. And I think just looking at book-to-bill just reinforces that I think we're moving in a positive direction, and this is the normal course of doing business.
Tal Liani - Merrill Lynch & Company: Sorry, I didn't mean to say that it's a reflection of deterioration not at all. The question I had was whether it's a good proxy for what you recognize this quarter with Verizon. And just accounting, whether it's a one-off recognition or it's a project that continues over a few quarters, and therefore you'll have ins and outs from deferred revenues, but at least this part will come out from deferred revenues for a few quarters?
Robyn Denholm: So the project with Verizon is ongoing. This was the first revenue recognition event, but we do over time expect our deferred revenue in total to increase, not just specifically to one customer.
Tal Liani - Merrill Lynch & Company: Thank you.
Kathleen Bela: Next question, please?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ehud Gelblum with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Ehud Gelblum - JPMorgan: Hi, thank you very much. A couple of questions, if I could. First of all, Kevin, when you said the 8200 is slotted for the first quarter of this year, I seem to remember that in the past it was going to be the end of '08, not in '09, just wanted to get an update on timing, and how that compares to earlier numbers? Second question, you mentioned that there was strength in EMEA and Middle East and Africa, as well as Eastern Europe. Could you comment a little on Western Europe? We have heard from a number of companies naturally Western Europe is weaker, and just what you are seeing there and will the trends remain weak? Or do you expect that to only be temporary, if you have any visibility on that? And in terms of this revenue recognition piece, did you expect to get the recognition in Q3? Or when you originally gave your Q3 guidance and your full year, did you expect to be in Q4, and that this is just bringing forward, say of the $30 million and that your full year is pretty much unchanged, everything else, just you recognized in Q3 what you thought you wanted to recognize in Q4?
Kevin Johnson: Yes, thanks for the questions. I'll maybe take the first two, and then I'll ask Robyn to take the question on the recognition, the third question, Ehud. First of all, on your first question about the 8200, I believe that what was communicated in the past was that the 8200 would begin shipping by the end of 2008. And so the fact that we are releasing that product to the market in Q1 is reflective of the fact that we've really been focused on insuring that the quality of that product meets the needs of our customer, and so that is slightly different from the shipping it by end of 2008, but we're on a good path. It's in beta with customers currently, and we're on a good path to release the 8208 in Q1 with the next product right behind that. Your second question was regarding what we're seeing in Western Europe. I think it's fair to say that we're seeing some softness in the wireline carriers in Western Europe. Certainly wireless and other areas we're not seeing as much softness, but with wireline carriers in Western Europe, we are see something softness, and it's difficult to predict, that it going to be sustained or is that a short-term softness, but we are seeing that in Western Europe. Robyn, you want to take the third one?
Robyn Denholm: Yes. In terms of recognition of revenue this quarter, it was absolutely expected when we put out our guidance. If fact, I can actually say it was expected when we did our planning for this year. It's been a project that's been underway for some time. The team delivered as scheduled this quarter, and therefore, the recognition happened as per expectation.
Ehud Gelblum - JPMorgan: So the upside this quarter did not really come versus your guidance did not really come from that recognition that was already in the plan that came from another area?
Robyn Denholm: Yes, that's right.
Ehud Gelblum - JPMorgan: Primarily, I assume, on the SLT side, I would assume?
Robyn Denholm: In terms of the revenue upside?
Ehud Gelblum - JPMorgan: Right.
Robyn Denholm: It was across the board, both service provider and IPG, SLT, and also EX performed well as we mentioned on the call.
Ehud Gelblum - JPMorgan: And better than you thought?
Robyn Denholm: Yes. Better than we thought.
Ehud Gelblum - JPMorgan: Okay. And so vis-à-vis, what you had been expecting for Q4, you're now expecting a little bit less than you have before because we've got. Our full year is the same, but we actually had a real, we didn't have a shift from Q4 to Q3, we had a real uptick in revenue and demand in Q3, so Q4 you're being more cautious on than before?
Kevin Johnson: Yes. I think consistent with just looking at the macroeconomic situation, I think we're taking a cautiously optimistic posture, but at the end of the day, we're going to be on the front foot, really driving top-line revenue growth, but there is a lot of macroeconomic uncertainty.
Ehud Gelblum - JPMorgan: I understood. It makes sense. Thank you so much.
Robyn Denholm: Thanks. Ehud.
Kathleen Bela: Next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Evenson with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.
Jeff Evenson - Sanford Bernstein: Some equipment suppliers have talked about carriers running their networks hotter. How long do you think a typical carrier could cut router spend say by half and not see a customer backlash due to lower quality of service?
Kevin Johnson: Well, Jeff, that's a good question. I'll share my reaction to that. I think the services, the carriers provider are really mission critical to their capabilities, and I just don't see how they could take any kind of pause, especially when they have increasing demand for usage on the Internet. And I don't thick there's a lot of 0 overcapacity right now in the carrier space, and therefore, any kind of a pause I think would be very noticeable to their customer base and be impactful from a competitive situation. So I think I don't see that as a scenario.
Jeff Evenson - Sanford Bernstein: And just a follow-up on Ehud's question. When did you decide to move the formal introduction into production shipments of the 8600 into Q1?
Kevin Johnson: Of the 8208?
Jeff Evenson - Sanford Bernstein: Yes, sorry.
Kevin Johnson: Well, it was in this quarter, I guess, or just in the recent weeks as we were doing beta testing and making a decision on when the product would be ready.
Jeff Evenson - Sanford Bernstein: Thanks. 
Kathleen Bela: Next question, please?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Gable with Barclays Capital. Please proceed with your question.
Jeff Gable - Barclays Capital: Thanks very much. I would like to ask about the backlog from a year-over-year, or deferred revenue from a year-over-year growth perspective rather than sequentially. It seems as though year-over-year, the deferred revenue is up about 10%, which is a little bit lower than revenues. Are there one-time factors that are in there or a how should we think about that Delta? Thank you.
Robyn Denholm: The deferred revenue as you commented is up year-over-year, and I think in terms of the trend that we talked about earlier, deferred revenue, important part of our business model as we work with our customers in terms of the strategic projects that we're involved in. We just commented that we did record the first recognition from the Verizon project that we've been working on for roughly three or four quarters at this point. So that is the first recognition of that project.
Kevin Johnson: Yeah, I'll just ad one other comment, Jeff. You point out that's up 10% year-over-year, and certainly if we look at the mix of products and what customers are buying, the fact is some of the product offerings we have where there's not some new feature, or something that is dependent on us recognizing revenue means that, when we look at book-to-bill being one to one, some of that revenue flows straight through to net revenue. So you may see ebbs and flows in deferred revenue, depending on product cycles and product mix, and that is something to factor into your model.
Robyn Denholm: Yes, and actually, Jeff, I just checked the numbers. The combined deferred revenue is up about 24%. Product is up about 29% year-over-year.
Jeff Gable - Barclays Capital: Okay. Well, we'll discuss that offline. Thanks. And then as for book-to-bill, was it slightly above 1, or comfortably above 1, anything you could characterize there?
Robyn Denholm: So the product book-to-bill was above 1 in the quarter.
Jeff Gable - Barclays Capital: Okay. Thank you.
Kevin Johnson: Thanks, Jeff.
Kathleen Bela: Thank you. Next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Troy Jensen with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.
Troy Jensen - Piper Jaffray: Yes, quick question for either Kevin or Scott. There's a lot of obviously interesting valuations out there. I'm curious what your guy's appetite would be for acquisitions to maybe fill in some product holes?
Kevin Johnson: Yes. Let me start by just commenting that as a technology company, our value that we create from customers comes really from our organic R&D. That has to be our primary focus. Now certainly when looking at the product cycle we are in, that's reflective of our investment in R&D and the organic innovation that we've been driving in the market. With that said, certainly there are either areas of the product line that we may have gaps, or opportunities to broaden a product portfolio that could involve an acquisition, and we will consider those. Certainly any kind of acquisition opportunity, we've got to look at, first of all, at the strategic rationale, second at the rationale and then we have to balance that with ensuring that we understand the risks and opportunities related to integration. And so I think at the end of the day, we're going to focus on, lead with organic R&D, and if there is places we need to round out the product line, we'll consider our acquisitions, but it needs to meet the test of strategic rationale, financial rationale, and we balance that within some assessment of risks or integration challenges that might be related to an acquisition.
Troy Jensen - Piper Jaffray: Got it. Good luck, going forward, guys.
Kevin Johnson: Thanks, Troy.
Kathleen Bela: Next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Paul Silverstein - Credit Suisse: A couple of questions if I may. First off, Kevin, can you talk about how much of the upside in going forward what you see from NTT and the Cable/MSOs? I think last quarter those particular were specified or called out. I think NTT was as much as one-third of the sequential increase. Can you give us some insight what's going on there? And I've got another question for you.
Kevin Johnson: Yes, Pail, I am sure I've got the specifics. I do know that our relationship with NTT and the work we're doing in Japan, that certainly we remain optimistic about that, and we're making good progress there, but I don't have any specific numbers. Robyn?
Robyn Denholm: Yes. So Paul, what I called out in the script was that Japan actually led the way in terms of growth, and you can assume that that was driven with NTT, but there is obviously growth in Japan with other companies, as well.
Paul Silverstein - Credit Suisse: I guess the real question is when you look forward, how much additional growth of the type that you have seen over the past several quarters, do you anticipate from NTT and from the cable MSOs? I know Cable/MSO is a new market and you're penetrating your gaining share. Can you give us insight in terms of what you're seeing in with both of those NTT and the cable operators?
Robyn Denholm: So what I would say in terms of the diversify case of in the diversification of our revenues across both the service provider market, and even geographically, that we believe that we have broad-based strength in both markets and the products that we have, as we said. And we continue to look at new areas where we can take advantage of those strengths, but we have in penetrating new markets as well, just like the cable sector that you called out from our call last quarter.
Paul Silverstein - Credit Suisse: Robyn, the current demand strength that you're seeing relative to most of the other suppliers in the industry, how much do you attribute to share gain versus Cisco or others, where Cable/MSOs or other customers, and how much of that is just normal market, at least relative to your positioning?
Kevin Johnson: Yes, Paul, I'll share my perspective. Look, I think we have good momentum across the board. I mean it's, as Robyn said, across products, geographies, customer segments, and I think the much of that is attributed to the fact that we're in a strong product cycle. The expanded portfolio and the value we've created, I think is leading to us being able to take share in the industry, and that's a broad perspective.
Paul Silverstein - Credit Suisse: Right. Scott, a quick question for you, or maybe not so quick. If you go back to the bubble, back in 2000-2001, I know it was a long time ago, and unfortunately I don't remember all the details. But when you look at what you're seeing now, in terms of the slowdown and your caution, and what you're seeing in your customer base and go back to the bubble years, do you recall whether you saw similar, I know revenues fell off the cliff, given the dramatic growth you hood back then, but was there any warning signs in terms of a slowing down before it fell off the cliff?
Scott Kriens: Paul, I think the major difference this time that I would note is that, first of all, the slow down and the hit was a direct one on the networking industry itself, and this one is indirect in the economy, more generally. But specific to our markets, the biggest difference is that the networking industry from a capacity standpoint was dramatically overbuilt in 2001 from massive speculation specific to the industry that we live in and couldn't be further from the truth right now. So we're careful in this market, simply on a macro basis, as Kevin said, but there are far more differences than there are similarities, and as a result for us, far less concern about the industry that we see today compared to 2001, and also far more strength here at Juniper as we run today at $3.5 billion company with over $2 billion in cash, and generating $2 million or $3 million of cash every business day. We're in a dramatically superior position to where we were in 2000-2001. We're today stronger than the small companies in this market, and faster than the big ones. So we're pretty pleased with our position here.
Kathleen Bela: Next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Long with Banc of America. Please proceed with your question.
Tim Long - Banc of America: Two quick ones, if I could. First, you mentioned some of Eastern Europe and Middle East, Africa doing well in the quarter, but could you just talk maybe in the Asian theater what you've kind of seen in this quarter and how the outlook is for some of the emerging markets in Asia? Secondly, Robyn, I'm not sure if you gave the Edge and Core split. If you could just give that and maybe just update us on anything that's changed or going on in the competitive front, particularly in the Edge part of the market as other companies are still being pretty aggressive there? Thank you.
Robyn Denholm: So in terms of the Core and Edge split, we will pose that on our website, I don't actually have it here with me. But, what I'll talk about in terms of Asia, so we saw good growth in Japan, as said, and then the [ASEAN] countries, in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, that area. And it was good growth year-over-year and quarter over quarter. So I think that was that. In terms Edge versus Core, what I'll say is that I did call out that T and MX and E were strong in the quarter, and that's both the T is Core, and MX and E are Edge, so both of those sets of products were strong in the quarter.
Tim Long - Banc of America: Okay. Any comments on changes in the competitive or pricing environment on the Edge side?
Robyn Denholm: Not so, that were noticeable in the quarter, no.
Tim Long - Banc of America: Okay. Thank you.
Kathleen Bela: Next question, please?
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.
Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer: Thanks. I made it. Two housekeeping question. Robyn, can you remind us how much is left on your buyback plan, and how should we think about net interest income? It declined quite nicely. How much of that is just a reflection of your declining cash balance, versus just lower interest income that you're getting on your deposits?
Robyn Denholm: So, Ittai, it's about $800 million that's left on our buyback with the authorizations that we announced back in March. In terms of the interest income, what we did see in the quarter was obviously reductions in rates. We've got a very conservative portfolio, and became even more conservative as things started unfolding over the last quarter and a bit. So we're expecting interest rates to be down and our interest income to be down going forward. And, yes, so I think that answers your question, actually.
Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer: Yes. And lastly, with regards to WAN optimization, you mentioned, if I am not mistaken, another weak quarter in that area, but now you have a new solution. How long before you think we see that business start turning around, get something more momentum behind it?
Robyn Denholm: Yes. So it was a decline in the quarter and we're very pleased with the new platforms that are out there from a WX perspective and we are getting good customer acceptance of the product and good reviews. We will report on the progress as we see the revenue coming in.
Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer: Very good. Good luck, guys.
Kevin Johnson: Great. Thank you very much.
Robyn Denholm: Thank you.
Kathleen Bela: We would like to thank everyone for joining us on today's call, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Operator:  Welcome to the Juniper Networks, Inc. second quarter 2008 conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Kathleen Bela, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Kathleen Bela: Here today are Scott Kriens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial Officer.  Before we get started I would like to remind everyone that statements made during this call concerning Juniper’s business outlook, future financial operating results and overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of uncertainties and risks. Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors including economic conditions generally or in the networking industry, changes in overall technology spending, the network capacity requirements of service providers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply chain constraints, variations in the mix of products sold, customer perceptions and acceptance of our production, litigation and other factors listed in our most recent report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the events facts or circumstances subsequently change after the date of the call. Also, in discussing the financial results today, Robyn will first present results on a GAAP basis and for purposes of today’s discussion will also review non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why the management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company’s financial results please consult our filings with the SEC. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results please see today’s press release. In general non-GAAP results exclude certain non-recurring charges such as amortization of purchased intangibles, impairment charges and expenses related to stock-based compensation. Please note that today’s call is scheduled to last for one hour and please limit your questions to one per firm. With that I will turn the call over to Scott.
Scott G. Kriens : As we’ve been doing with the format of our calls beginning in the last quarter I will turn this call over to Robyn in a few minutes for a full review of our financials and the key metrics for the second quarter and also the first half here at the mid-year and then I will rejoin you to share some summary comments and also to provide guidance for the third quarter and the balance of 2008. But first, let’s start with the news of this morning. As we announced and I am very excited to talk to you about and we can do this both now and in questions, Kevin Johnson will be joining us from Microsoft as our new CEO in early September and at that time he’ll also be appointed to the Juniper Board of Directors. It seems like not enough to say. Kevin is a world class executive. He’s done an amazing number of things and in particular from my point of view his alignment to our culture, to the values that we have built this company on and coupling that with this experience at scale in a number of areas of absolute direct relevance to the vision for this company, Kevin is going to enhance this team in some very powerful ways and I’m really looking forward to having him join this team. I will be remaining as the company’s Chairman of the Board and I’ll also be very active on an ongoing basis in support of Kevin and the entire company principally in the areas of strategy, leadership and talent development and of course ongoing support of a number of key relationships that I’ve built over the years. This first 12 years at Juniper has been for me an incredibly satisfying experience and even with all that said I look forward to the years ahead with even more enthusiasm. Kevin and I have built a great relationship and with his leadership, the support of Pradeep Sindhu here, our founder, and the rest of the Juniper team we are fantastically staffed to make the most of opportunities. I’ll talk some more about that staffing in a few minutes as well, but this is a team that is just incredibly capable and ready to take advantage of our future here in some ways that we’re excited about. I’ll save the rest of this on Kevin and questions you might have for after primarily because we’ve got a lot of very impressive results to share with you today as well. But I’ll frame that discussion with a simple headline for the first half of the year and it’s actually, to reduce it if you wanted to six words that would tell you everything about what I’ve said and I’m about to say, Juniper is strong and getting stronger. I’ve said that in very unequivocal terms so let me anticipate the obvious question you might have. Why such a confident statement in the midst of an uncertain economy? There’s four basic reasons that underlie the strength that we demonstrated in the results that you saw and also the confidence that we’ll share with you today. First and most simply our strategy is working and that strategy is one of focusing on high performance networks where the network performance determines business success. That means that Juniper customers can remain focused on their networks as a priority and even as they look elsewhere in their budgets for savings that priority remains. So the strategy is solid. Second, we enjoy strength from the diversity of multiple markets, a wide range of products across all regions and all the economies of the world. Third, our product cycles are stronger than ever with the Juniper high performance technology being manifested in ways that are more compelling than ever particularly for discriminating network buyers. Then fourth, expanding our position in the enterprise market with our EX-series Ethernet switches is really ushering in a new era of opportunity as customers are inviting us to join with them as a strategic partner in ways never before possible and especially in the early examples we’ve seen of product excitement and acceptance and I’ll speak to a few of those examples in just a minute. Finally, bundled in with all four of those drivers is the constant focus on execution and the improvements in the productivity and the operational efficiency behind these results. Our ability to execute and to realize the leverage available in our business model and our agility in managing changes as they occur gives us the confidence that we’ll manage our business well even as uncertainty persists. With that said, let’s get into the results for the second quarter and our outlook. Once again throughout Juniper the team continued to execute well in the second quarter and delivered solid results. Top line revenue was up 32% over last year and non-GAAP operating profit up 53% over last year underscoring the strength of the business model and our focus on operational excellence. Let’s look first at the geographies and then the markets across both service provider and the enterprise businesses. On a geographic basis in the second quarter we saw very consistent performance across the service provider and enterprise segments of our business around the world. The Americas represented 44% of total revenue in the second quarter as compared to 51% in the first quarter of 2008 with particular strength in the US Federal sector. As a reminder the average Americas quarterly contribution throughout 2007 was 47% so with the first quarter at 51% and the second quarter at 44% we’re at the same contribution level for the year that we’ve historically seen from the Americas.  Europe, Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, represented 33% of total revenue in the second quarter as compared to 29% in the first quarter with continuing strength in the enterprise markets and also among tier two service providers. Asia Pacific, or APAC, represented 23% of total revenue in the second quarter as compared to 20% in the first quarter with strength in both enterprise and service provider.  So let’s review the service provider and enterprise businesses and I’ll start with service provider. The second quarter marked continued success of our portfolio strategy with our service provider customers as we helped them to embrace new business models. In particular we saw increasing contributions from cable providers in the quarter with strategic wins that included Comcast deployment of the MX240, 480 and 960 and also the T1600, Cox Communications’ deployment of the MX960, TeleCable’s deployments of the M and MX series in Spain and CableCom’s deployment of the M series and SSG security products in Mexico. We also expanded the Juniper Open IP Development Programs with the additions of IBM, NEC, Kasenna and Polycom and NTT Advanced Technology adopted the Juniper Partner Solution Development Platform to build specialized applications on top of our JUNOS network operating system. In the second quarter the edge represented just over half of our infrastructure business and as in previous quarters we expect to see this mix fluctuate between core and edge on a quarter-to-quarter basis. At the core of the network exiting the second full quarter of shipping the T1600 core router total units booked nearly doubled to 195 up 90 units in the quarter and total units shipped more than doubled to 165 up 88 units in the quarter. NTT Communications selected the T1600 core router to scale the capacity of its global IT network, the world’s largest dedicated Internet backbone network. Several keys here to success, a couple being the non-disruptive upgrade path from the T640 and also the energy efficiency advantages of the T1600. Another T1600 customer in the quarter was ONO who is the leading service provider in Spain. We realized continued success with the T series and T640 with Hanaro Telecom of Korea and Virgin Media demonstrated T series core routers equipped with 40 gigabit interfaces over a live UK commercial network. Moving to the edge of the network the MX series continued to gain momentum exiting its first anniversary with more than 250 customer deployments in 43 countries and an annual revenue run rate of over $300 million. MX series customer shipments in the quarter Abovenet, Bell Canada, Internet Initiative Japan, Or IIJ, Qwest, XO Communications and Yahoo!. We also realized success with the MX and E series with three New Zealand service providers, Orcon’s deployment of MX960, E120 and C-series Controllers, TelstraClear's deployment of the E320 and C-series Controllers and WorldxChange's deployment of the E320.  These overall results continue to be enabled by a number of partners in particular NSN was responsible for just over 10% of revenues delivering 10.4% of total Juniper revenues primarily in their role as a partner in the service provider marketplace. From a market share perspective Juniper continued to maintain or gain market share in every major product category. According to Synergy Research for the latest quarter reported Q1 of 08 Juniper fortified its number two position in service provider routing, maintained the number two position in core routing, gained share in the edge, the BRAS and multi-service edge categories and also maintained share in the Ethernet edge category as well. So enterprise, let me comment on the enterprise business including some of the achievements in the quarter and I’ll actually spend an extra minute here because there’s a lot of news to cover. We are seeing consistent and expanding success with our strategy of positioning Juniper as a partner to our enterprise customers. The customers are extending invitations to us to join them at the Network Planning table and play a significant role in their success. We’re seeing this consistently across geographies and industries including financial services, education and public sector segments of the market. A key driver in our ability to compete and win in enterprise network infrastructure opportunities is the availability of our EX-series Ethernet switches.  In the quarter we recognized over $10 million in Ethernet switching revenue and shipped EX3200 and EX4200 switches to more than 100 customers around the world. The industry obviously has recognized the arrival of the EX as well. The EX was awarded top honors at Interop Tokyo 2008 winning the Grand Prix Award for business infrastructure and there was also a just published Network World Exclusive Clear Choice Test where the EX4200 was subjected to the same benchmarks that are used previously to assess seven other competitors and the finding in the words of the independent network test editors were that the EX4200 delivered line rate throughput in every case, the only switch network world has tested this year to do so. In addition latency or delay was the lowest ever measured and they were equally impressed with the EX4200’s feature set and of course the JUNOS Operating System. So the summary, and this is again in the words of the testers, solid results for a new product, more solid in fact than some other vendor’s third or fourth efforts. Actually to underscore our momentum in the quarter here’s three very strategic enterprise wins that highlight the customer invitations in this portfolio strategy that we talked about. Our first example is from the Americas, Commerce Bank based in Missouri with approximately 360 locations across the Central US has selected Juniper High Performance Network infrastructure as the foundation of a company-wide network upgrade to their core switching aggregation and branch office routing infrastructure. In the initial phase Commerce Bank will deploy MX 960 Ethernet service routers, M10i edge routers and J series services at all branch office locations and the bank also plans to deploy the EX-series Ethernet switches into new branch bank locations as it expands and all of this is underpinned by our JUNOS Network Operating System. Our second example which is from EMEA, the University of Exeter which is a leading research university in the UK, has deployed Juniper solutions for its campus-wide infrastructure upgrade for more than 14,000 students to a host of converged applications that include video and audio conferencing, and the University has deployed Juniper EX-series Ethernet switches in tandem with the MX series Ethernet services routers, integrated security gateways and secure access SSLVPN infrastructure.  Our third example which is from Asia Pacific, the Hastings District Council which is the administrative authority for the Hastings Region on the East Coast of New Zealand has deployed a mix of EX3200 and 4200 Ethernet switches in a mixed Layer 2 / Layer 3 environment to support a host of applications including IP Telephony across their fiber-based metro area network. Hastings also selected Juniper SSG and our Unified Access Control security solutions for consistent, enterprise-wide security for the applications and services that are running over the network. Finally we’re also seeing an ongoing adoption and integration of our network infrastructure into managed third party enterprise solutions with key partners. For example HP announced that it’s standardized on the Juniper M and J series edge and services routers as integral elements of their Halo Collaboration Studio which is a fully managed telepresence collaboration solution supported with the Halo Video Exchange Network. Beyond these examples there were several other factors that drove enterprise momentum in the quarter. JUNOS software was key as always in all of Juniper wins that I referenced and our Operating System strategy continues to drive our leadership position in this high performance networking segment. This past July 7th marked the 10th anniversary of on time consecutive quarterly releases of JUNOS software and when the history is written of this success overall the single source operating system strategy is going to be a key determining element in that success story. Across our SLT portfolio which also is a component of our service provider revenues, we realized continued acceptance in the enterprise market as well with strength across our security offerings particularly the market introduction and acceptance of the new IDP 8200 which is the industry’s fastest intrusion prevention system running at true 10-gigabit per second speeds and the strength in SLT was offset by some softness in our application acceleration business in the quarter as well. Finally from a market share perspective Juniper maintained or gained share across every category. According to Synergy Research for the latest quarter reported which again is Q1 of 08 Juniper maintained the number two position in high-end enterprise routing and according to Infonetics Research for the latest quarter reported, Q1, Juniper maintained the number two position on total network security, the number one position in the SSLVPN and high-end firewall categories and gained share in secure routing as well.  These are the highlights across the markets and the geographies that we continue to serve around the world. On the personnel side in addition to obviously the news of Kevin this morning and along with now more than 6,500 other employees we added to the Juniper executive leadership team with the appointment of John Morris to head our Worldwide Field Operations and Luis Avila to head corporate development. John joins us most recently from Pay By Touch where he served as the CEO and before that he enjoyed a 23-year career at IBM and Luis joins us from Scientific Atlanta and Cisco where he served in a series of strategic assignments over the course of 14 years, most recently as the Vice President of Corporate Strategic Planning. All in all to say the least a very busy time for Juniper on many fronts. With that let me turn the call over to Robyn for a detailed financial review of the second quarter and the first half and then I’ll come back with a few final comments on outlook that we see for our markets and our guidance going forward.
Robyn M. Denholm : In the second quarter Juniper again met or exceeded all guidance metrics. We continue to deliver improving financial results demonstrating that both strategically and operationally the company is performing well despite the current macro economic environment. Demand for our products remains strong and we believe we are growing faster than our industry. Our product book-to-bill ratio remains above one. We enjoy healthy deferred revenues and we have a solid business pipeline. Our execution is good and we expect to continue to deliver on both the revenue and expense side of the P&L as we move through the second half of the year. Scott will speak directly to what that means for our guidance in a few moments. As an opening comment on our operating performance I think the trends tell an interesting and positive story about Juniper. First, we are offering the most comprehensive portfolio of products we’ve ever had and it’s a strong line up. Secondly, our focus on the high-performance networking market and our improving ability to cross-sell is fueling our revenue momentum. The profits these trends create are giving us the flexibility to invest in growth and we’re doing that. But we’re doing it at a time when we are also continuing our Operational Excellence program to reduce and control infrastructure expense as well as build discipline and efficiency into our model. The result is that we are making good progress to our Q4 08 25% or higher operating margin goal and we’re doing it in the right way. Now onto the review of the results, I’ll discuss revenue and earnings on a GAAP basis first and then shift to the non-GAAP discussion as we dive deeper into the operating performance. Total revenues for the second quarter of 2008 was $879 million up 32% from the prior year and up 7% sequentially from the first quarter. Juniper earned net income of $120.4 million on a GAAP basis or $0.22 per diluted share up 47% from the $0.15 reported in the 2007 second quarter. The diversification of our revenue from both a geographic and customer perspective is the key to the strength of our business. Regionally both EMEA and APAC had strong quarters. Year-over-year growth in EMEA for total revenue was 44% and APAC grew by 35%. Within these geographies EMEA grew the enterprise business the strongest of any geography with good growth in Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa. Service provider growth in this region was driven mainly by the second tier service providers. In APAC we saw strong growth in both service provider and enterprise business with the strongest growth in Japan, China and [Ethean] including India. In the Americas we saw strong growth in Latin America and Canada in both the service provider and enterprise customers. In the US our service provider business showed good growth on a year-over-year basis but was sequentially lower due to the timing of purchases from some of our customers. We saw good year-over-year growth on a sequential basis in the US enterprise led by strength in our Federal business. On a segment basis total IPG revenue was $672.4 million up 40% on a year-over-year basis and total SLP revenue of $206.6 million was up 12% on a year-over-year basis. The IPG revenue includes $10.1 million of EX switch revenue. We are pleased by the reception of the switch products that we have received from our customers and this first quarter of revenue is a good start. Within each of the segments IPG product revenue was 43% year-over-year and IPG services revenue was up 24% year-over-year. IPG results reflect strength in the MX and T series sales to service providers. SLT product revenue was up 7% year-over-year and SLT services revenue was up 30% year-over-year with growth in the SSG, J series and IDP products partially offset by declines in WX products. On a sequential basis total IPG revenue was up 8% and total SLP revenue was up 3%.  Looking at the markets we address service provider sales was 73% of the total revenue up 33% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially with strength in all three regions. Total sales into the enterprise market was 27% an increase of 29% year-over-year and up 12% sequentially. This strong growth is clearly being driven by the sale of more infrastructure product solutions including the new switching line to our enterprise customers. The only customer above 10% as Scott mentioned was NSN at 10.4% for the quarter. Turning to our non-GAAP results, total growth margins for the quarter were 67.6% of revenue in line with our long-term model range of 66% to 68%. Product gross margins were 70.6% essentially flat year-over-year and down 130 basis points over a strong first quarter. The changes to gross margin were due to changes in the product and geography mix. Overall product gross margins are strong including those of our newly introduced switch line. This is a good indicator that our strategy to focus on the high-performance networking market and the investments that we have made in R&D have resulted in products that our target customers value. Services gross margins were 53.7% for the quarter up 120 basis points year-over-year. This is mainly due to an increase in the volume of service contracts and a continued focus on the costs of servicing our install base. Operating expenses totaled $386.8 million or 44% of revenue. This represents an improvement of better than three percentage points from the second quarter of last year when expenses were 47.1% of revenue. R&D expenses totaled $174 million or 19.8% of revenue. Sales and marketing expenses totaled $180.6 million or 20.5% of revenue. Operating expenses were up 5% sequentially primarily due to the increases in employee-related expenses, continued investments in research and development including headcount and prototypes. Operating profit for the quarter was strong at $207.4 million resulting in an operating margin of 23.6% of revenue. This is an improvement of 3.2 percentage points over the second quarter of last year and up modestly on a sequential basis. Looking at our segments, operating margins for IPG were strong at approximately 29% for the quarter and SLT operating margins increased to 6% for the quarter. We are pleased with our continued progress on this front which is due to good discipline on the operating expense area.  Turning to the bottom line, Juniper posted non-GAAP net income of $156.6 million an increase of 5% from the first quarter and 35% higher than year ago results. Net interest and other income was down 25% sequentially and 48% year-over-year as a result of lower interest rates earned on our cash and investment balances. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 29%, diluted earnings per share were $0.28 up $0.01 from the first quarter and up substantially from the prior year figure of $0.20. Turning to the balance sheet at June 30 we ended the second quarter with over $2.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents. This is up from about $2.2 billion in the first quarter. We generated cash flow from operations in the quarter of $200.5 million down from the first quarter primarily due to timing of tax payments in the quarter and the timing of cash receipts from our customers. On June 16 the company’s zero coupon convertible senior notes matured and were converted into shares. As a result we have no long term debt on the balance sheet. CapEx totaled $47.4 million in the period and depreciation and amortization was $40.4 million. DSOs increased to 43 days from 40 days in the first quarter mainly as a result of the timing of cash receipts from our customers but well within our range of 35 to 45 days. Our deferred revenue was $592.8 million up $26.9 million compared to the end of the first quarter. At June 30, 2008 Juniper had 6,531 employees up from 6,111 at the end of the first quarter. The increase was primarily in research and development and the sales and marketing departments with more than one-third of this increase being added to our [inaudible] engineering center. During the quarter we utilized approximately $68 million to repurchase shares of our stock. For the quarter our share count was approximately 559 million shares. With that let me hand it back to Scott to go through the guidance for the third quarter and the full year 2008.
Scott G. Kriens : As you can see from Robyn’s review and as I said at the outset Juniper’s business is strong and getting stronger and it’s primarily a reflection of this portfolio strategy we’ve talked about and the position we occupy in support of our customers and also in the plans with our partners. There are four key attributes and the words we hear from our customers that answer this question, why Juniper? We have the size and the strength to be relied on, the speed to innovate and respond to the demands of high-performance networking, the focus to build upon customer confidence in our leadership position and the ability to execute that enables us to be trusted to deliver and meet the commitments. All of this translates into the strength of our outlook and the guidance I’ll share with you now. Let’s go through that. As a reminder guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis, all guidance is forward-looking and actual results may vary for a number of reasons including those noted in our recent 10-Q as filed with the SEC. A GAAP EPS target is not accessible on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to the charges which are excluded from the non-GAAP EPS estimates. For the third quarter we expect revenues of $925 million to $935 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of between $0.29 and $0.30 assuming a tax rate of 29%. We expect gross margins to be in our range of between 66% to 68% and operating margins to be roughly flat with the second quarter. For the full year and based on a thorough assessment of the business pipeline we are raising our revenue outlook to $3.59 billion to $3.62 billion. This is up from our previous outlook for revenue of $3.4 billion to $3.55 billion and we are also raising the range of our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to between $1.14 and $1.17 per share for the full year. This reflects both operational improvements as well as a share count anticipated between 560 million and 570 million shares. Finally to reiterate a previously stated goal we continue to expect to exit the December, 2008 quarter with operating margins of 25% or higher. As we chart our course for the second half of 2008 our financial objective here is clear and concise, top line growth, market share gains as we continue to demonstrate leverage in the business by growing the bottom line even faster. We believe that we have the visibility across the high-performance networking marketplace necessary to make this possible and we have the commitment across Juniper to continue to drive the intense execution necessary to capitalize on the opportunities in front of us. All of this is possible only with the support of our employees whose continued commitment and incredible efforts make these results possible as well as our many partners, our customers, our suppliers and our long term stockholders. I’d like to thank you all for your continued support and confidence in Juniper Networks. With that I’ll turn the call over to Kathleen to initiate the question-and-answer.
Kathleen Bela:  Operator can you open the call for questions?
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Ehud Gelblum – JPMorgan.
Ehud Gelblum – JPMorgan: Couple questions if I could, first of all the guidance is certainly a lot stronger on the top line. The operating margin on the IPG side fell a little bit. Is that essentially due to the addition of EX, the $10 million and the lower margin on that? Is that why that grows in Q3? Do we see the operating margins stay relatively stable? Transitioning to your 25% or higher guidance for Q4 what happens in the two sides, in IPG and SLT margin wise to get us to the 25%? Certainly a larger comment on the transition of CEO, at what point did you make the realization that it was the right time to move on, to transition the CEO as opposed to just replacing Steven [Heloff] at the CEO spot?
Robyn M. Denholm : I’ll answer the first part and I’ll hand it over to Scott to answer the second part of your question. On the IPG margin we’re very pleased with the margin of 29% that we have there. Obviously the gross margin overall was slightly lower than last quarter due to the geographic and product mix that I talked about and obviously as we’ve talked in previous quarters, the mix of picks that we have in any quarter actually adds to the gross margin. So this quarter we actually saw that come down a little bit and then the geography and product mix influenced the overall gross margin and hence the operating margin. So we’re very comfortable with our 66% to 68% range that we’ve talked about.
Scott G. Kriens : Then, Ehud, also just one quick final point to add to Robyn’s, the 25% goal is going to be contributed to by both businesses and product groups so there will certainly not be one at the expense of the other, it’ll be both. Finally on the CEO, certainly in the arrival of Kevin in particular, there was no real moment of realization in any of this. The goal was really to hire the best possible executive that we could find and one in which I would have supreme confidence in putting this company in the hands of and it may not have been possible to accomplish that as we have done with the caliber of person that Kevin Johnson is in which case we would have hired someone into a lesser role and it would have been a development exercise.  But when Kevin and I met and began to understand one another, both with regard to what he brings and I could talk about that, but the competencies and the capabilities he has on the sales side, the engineering side, we’re growing this business from the $3+ billion we have today, we have our sights set on $5 billion, we have aspirations to $10 billion. There’s not really a place that number stops but Kevin has seen $3 billion, $5 billion, $10 billion, $20 billion, $30 billion, $40 billion and $50 billion.  He started at Microsoft at a time when it was 6,000 people and just under $2 billion so he began his career there when Microsoft was smaller than Juniper is today, so he’s seen both sides and beyond of everything that we’re trying to do here and more importantly to me, personally, and to this company, is who he is and how he shows up and does what he does. That’s really on the axis of his values, his belief system and the alignment of those beliefs with my own and with this company’s. When this became possible it was simply obvious, frankly, and bringing Kevin into play this role and being here to support him in the ways that I spoke of, is the best possible outcome I could have hoped for and there wasn’t a moment in time until we knew that this was secured and Kevin and I had committed to each other to do this, that it would be possible for this to be the way it played out. But now that it has, I couldn’t be more excited about it. This is the major insertion for this team and impact for this company and we’re going to have some fun. So no particular moment in time, but that’s the history of what became possible and what we realize with Kevin’s arrival.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ittai Kidron – Oppenheimer & Co.
Ittai Kidron – Oppenheimer & Co.: First Scott can you comment on the EX and how do you expect progress in that product to be going forward? You were very cautious when you introduced it and you said it’s more of an 09 event, it seems like it’s happening earlier than expected. Should the steps here be like the MX maybe, hopefully? Second, assuming that product still continues with its momentum different to the year and assuming that the strength that you have on the routing side continues, that implies that the rest of your business, what’s left of SLP outside of EX is actually going to be declining on a quarter-over-quarter basis for the next two quarters. So if you can reconcile that, that will be great.
Scott G. Kriens : We have had a great first half and the EX is of course off to a great start. I don’t know that there’s a comparison to MX here that’s as appropriate because the MX rolls into pre-existing commitments to the JUNOS Operating System in most cases across the service provider market. Given that we’re in the top 65 service providers already in most of the cases where you’d introduce an MX on JUNOS that JUNOS commitment has already been made. In many of these, more than 100 customers that have chosen the EX, those are new customers to Juniper and so there’s not the same pre-existing understanding of the advantages there and that takes more effort and time. Overall I’d say the EX it’s progressing as we would have hoped and it’s doing what we would have wanted it to do on a number of fronts, certainly on the revenue side and the breadth of customers around the world. Importantly though which is not a revenue comment it’s a portfolio comment and that is the way that the EX has enabled customers like Commerce Bank or Exeter or Hastings that I talked about, it’s enabled them to make portfolio commitments to Juniper and that leverage is applicable to everything that we do.  So we see the potential for the strength of that strategy to be a positive force across all product lines existing in new. We’ll watch and see how it unfolds over the year. Part of the reason for the strength that we reflected in our guidance is the confidence that we have in that portfolio strategy having an impact in both the service provider and enterprise marketplaces. It won’t happen for free, so the work that it takes to do that does take time. So there’s not any overnight successes in this that come without effort but our focus and the realization and the early feedback from the customers has been this is exactly what we wanted to see from Juniper and it’s exactly what we needed to make the commitments that we have. Frankly the simple direct translation, it’s exactly what drives our confidence. The portfolio strategy, the enterprise business was up 29% from last year, the service provider business was up even more. So that’s the beauty of the strength of the outlook that we have is you can look at it through any lens and you come to the same answer and we are looking forward to watching that happen for the balance of the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from Scott Coleman – Morgan Stanley.
Scott Coleman – Morgan Stanley: I’m wondering if we can talk about the enterprise strategy going forward, the 8000 product comes out in the not too distant future and that possibly pulls through demand for some of the access switches that you have out today. How do you think about penetrating the data center with the new products? What do you need to add on to that, if anything? There would seem to be an argument in the market today that fiber channel is a requirement to be a player in the data center and I’m wondering how Juniper is thinking about this going forward?
Scott G. Kriens : One, you’re right, the 8000 or 8200 product is scheduled to be out at the end of this year and is on schedule to do so and that does add to the portfolio obviously in coupling with the 3200 and 4200 products and as we’ve talked about. As the data center emerges it will also be a factor but it’s important to point out also that the MX960 Ethernet product is a factor in the data center today. The data center is a place that requires a number of things that would all pretty easily fall into the category of high-performance networking whether it’s the obvious performance or throughput, remember the EX was the only product to run at line rate with the lowest delay of any product they’ve ever tested. Those kinds of things in a data center, when you measure things in microseconds, this may sound a bit arcane in the midst of a conference call, but when you talk about latency and microsecond delays and line rate throughput in a data center conversation, it really matters. Put underneath that reliability and strength of an operating system that delivers the up time and today supports literally billions of devices with exactly the same operating system, you get a lot of good answers to important questions in the data center. There are surrounding attributes and I’m sure that market will unfold over time here. Clearly connection to storage infrastructure is relevant in connection to storage and processor infrastructure is important as well. The data center is not one beast, there’s a big difference between the discussion around cloud computing and the data center in your local pharmacy or in even medium sized businesses or large private companies and the either centralized or in some cases distributed designs around those data centers. So it’s hard to put it all under one label but I think one thing that does carry across every example is you need absolutely rock solid high-performance network infrastructure to make it work and that starts with the operating system and it carries through the architecture of things like the 4200 and the upcoming 8000 products and the existing MX and all of it, by the way, has to be secure.  That element of our portfolio matters a lot, security is more important in the data center arguably to some than it is anywhere else in the network. We are pretty comfortable with our position in that market, let me say that and we think we’ve got some pretty good answers to some pretty important questions.
Operator: Your next question comes from Nikos Theodosopoulos – UBS.
Nikos Theodosopoulos – UBS: I had two questions, on the EX revenues of 100 customers I think you said on the call, can you give a sense of the win rate in those accounts? If you look at the market today Cisco has about 70% of the market and everyone else combined has about 30%. Are your wins consistent with that market share out there or are you winning a greater percentage of deals in non-Cisco accounts or more Cisco accounts? That would be my first question and my second question is on SLT, the operating margin went from 3% to 6% sequentially, did you see an equivalent improvement in both services and hardware or was it skewed more to one or the other?
Robyn M. Denholm : Nikos, let me handle the second question first, in terms of SLT margins from 3% to 6% we are pleased with that as I said in the script, pleased but probably not satisfied. We’re continuing to work on the cost structure there and we’re continuing to work on the revenue drivers to make sure that we keep growing that business. I would say that our cost improvements are on both services in aggregate as well as for SLT and also products as well. And I think both of those contributed to the improvement.
Scott G. Kriens: Nikos, on the other side and on the X side sometimes it’s a little hard to tell because when they really get into the X they stop talking about the other products so I don’t always know. But I would make a generalization about this, and it’s not science, it’s more anecdotal. There are two types of wins. One of them is what I would call tactical where someone’s simply making a fastest box or best point product decision. Some of those we’re involved indirectly; some of them actually go through distribution at a level we may not see with the same insights. And that could be against anybody because that’s generally the criteria that are used for the selection, so there it’s a lot more of a potpourri.  But when it’s a strategic decision, when someone is making a decision on a network design, those tend to be primarily against Cisco being the only other company that approaches it with their own attempts at answers to those questions. So if it’s a design decision and a strategic dialogue, the differentiation in the operating system and the portfolio, there are only two companies that end up in that conversation. And if it’s a local or tactical decision, then it’s I’d say more of a potpourri. I don’t know what the mix is to give you that breakdown by these 100 plus examples that we have so far this quarter. The ones that we are more actively involved in are of the more strategic nature and that’s probably the majority of them, but beyond that characterization I don’t have a more precise breakdown.
Operator: Your next question comes from Analyst for Cobb Sadler - Deutsche Bank Securities.
Analyst for Cobb Sadler - Deutsche Bank Securities: With Verizon and British Telecom business and [inaudible] Internet, to what extent is that positive for your business? And two, do you feel other carriers will follow the lead in moving away from [PVT]?
Scott G. Kriens: It remains to be seen what the other carriers choose in this mix. I think the key for us and the priority here is supporting the technologies and the needs that the customers describe to us. It tends to be better to look at it that way than it does to turn it into a warring technology conversation. I think there are times when customers or sometimes vendors have things they wish were possible and sometimes they are and sometimes they aren’t, and those get explored and conclusions get reached, and at the end of the day what customers tell us they need and what they want is what we’ll build and what we’ll do. And if [PVT] falls away, then obviously it’ll do so on our priority list as well. And if for some reason it carries forward, it’ll stay on our list as customers tell us it should. But I think those are at least a couple of examples you mentioned where it would be nice if this did all of the things we need. Turns out it really doesn’t. And on we go. So we’ll see if that happens or to what extent it happens and we’ll adjust our priorities accordingly. But those are definitely a couple of clear cut conclusions that we heard as well in the market.
Operator: Your next question comes from Kenneth Muth - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Kenneth Muth - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Scott, could you just give us your insights of what market segments or geographies concern you the most in the second half 08?
Scott G. Kriens: Yes, I can. It’s a little bit of a guess because I’m a line up with all the other macro forecasters here and none of us knowing until it happens. But certainly here in North America particularly in if you wanted to call it a vertical or a geography across financial services or Eastern seaboard where most of those are based here, it depends on whether things get better or worse. I saw something today suggesting oil was headed for $110 and inflation was overstated as a concern and so forth.  If that’s all true and if we don’t watch mortgage institution failures happen and so forth, the more stable all of that is, the less concerned I’d be about the financial services sector in the Americas and to the extent that bleeds into other of those markets as well. But I think if I step back and say, “Where do we see the strengths?” the service providers have clear needs and strategic commitments and design decisions that they have to support and that’s pretty much true around the world. You’ll watch it come and go at a given moment in time and in any individual situation things can change. I like our chances at MSN a lot better today. But other than that, I think service providers I would say generally are pretty solid contributors in all of this. On the enterprise side of things, America’s in total probably fine. APAC across many countries is different. We saw strengths in India, China, Japan. In EMEA it was Eastern Europe, Africa, as Robyn mentioned or we talked about on the breakdowns, I would expect the sources of strength which have been pretty consistent in Eastern Europe for example, Middle East, have been there. I would expect that to be the continued source of strength and I think if there are question marks, they’re going to be just seeing how resilient we are here in the United States in particular. And if that macro environment doesn’t get horribly worse, then it’s probably no cause of great concern here. Obviously if the sky falls, everyone seems to think that’s where it’ll fall and we’ll watch and see if it does. But I don’t have any reason to think that’s going to happen frankly.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets: What happens once we hit 25% operating margins besides from a party of course? Is it just a fourth quarter target? Do we move higher from there or is it possible it can dip below that? I think historically it’s been as high as 30%. As also, Scott, maybe for those who may not be familiar with Kevin, any thoughts on operating margins as a priority for him in the overall scheme of things?
Scott G. Kriens: Well, Mark, my first hope is when we hit the 25% goal you’ll write a poem. So if you do that, that’ll be a victory to begin the party with. So let me start there. As we’ve said before and I have to reiterate because it remains true, it may be implicit but let me make it explicit in our guidance as well we see that target as one we have and continue to be committed to the 25% target in the Q4 timeframe this year. And that is not a ceiling and it is not the case where we would redivert all proceeds beyond that to other purposes.  It depends probably a bit on what the momentum of the business is as to where it goes from there, and the stronger the momentum the easier it is to move more of that to the operating margin improvement over time. And there are strategic programs and the thing that’s important here and it’s threaded through the results and the reasons that these results are what they are are because the strategy is working. The investment in the portfolio strategy and in the operating system and in the mix of products is why we’re winning.  So to the extent more investment will create more wins, the priority here is going to be on growing the absolute top line, growing the absolute earnings in dollars and in earnings per share in absolute terms and in that process growing the operating margin percentage as a measure of continued discipline and improving our execution as a company. So it’s a very important metric. It won’t take the place of absolute growth as a priority. We could grow the operating margin tomorrow but it would be at the expense of absolute growth market share gains and the continuing march towards being a much larger company, which is probably a good segue to Kevin. I’ll let him speak for himself next time we join you in October, but Kevin is an incredibly capable operating executive. He measures success, he drives accountability for that success, and over the course of his career he realizes that success. So those metrics are going to include the operating measurements that all of us are driving for here and certainly that’s operating margin and operating margin improvement. One of the things that makes Kevin as strong as he is as an executive is he can synthesize that incredibly well with strategic intent.  So it will not be done at the expense of the strategy and the position the company sees for itself and is realizing today. And in there somewhere is when science becomes art. Exactly what that means is a decision that you make over a set of information as it comes in and feedback that you get from customers and so on. But this will be a business which continues to be driven by not just Kevin but Robyn, by the entire executive team on the metrics and the use of those metrics to drive improvements and set targets for ourselves. And that’ll be continuous and uninterrupted with Kevin’s arrival.
Operator: Your final question comes from Sanjiv Wadhwani - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.
Sanjiv Wadhwani - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: There’ve been some concerns about shifting priorities and spending in the US by service providers and you had a little bit of a dip down sequentially. I’m just curious if you could just shed some light about what’s going on. Is this a very temporary thing or you see some shift going on into next year in terms of projects? Any color there would be helpful.
Scott G. Kriens: Let me respond on the subject of SP trends. I don’t take away any conclusions from this quarter with regard to SP momentum or market. We saw the service provider growth of more than 30% compared to last year. I do think we still see, and this is particularly true again in a role as a strategic provider in these large projects. At any given time you can have some lumpiness in that even as we now push near $900 million. Projects come and go and the timing of those can affect any given period. So what we see is a very consistent thread that runs through all of the relationships that we have which is the commitment to the model and the commitment to the multiservice infrastructure about IP and so forth is very consistent across the world really.  Different stages of deployment, different investments in fiber optic to the curb or to the home and so forth. So it won’t always manifest in the same way but the strategic intent is amazingly consistent. And if you’ve got a great business in a particular country, it gives you the freedom to invest in the new network infrastructure. And if you’re in trouble and you need to produce more innovative products and more cost efficiency, then you better invest in the infrastructure faster because that’s what makes it possible.  So there isn’t as near as we can see a bad time for the place we find ourselves in providing the strategic future that is central to the service provider market across, and we think of this in many dimensions, that’s in cable, that’s in the content providers, meaning the Yahoos and the Googles and the Microsoft networks of the world, that’s in the wireless market place, that’s in the traditional wireline space. So we look through a lot of lenses underneath the broad umbrella of service providers and everywhere you look and every which way you cut it, there is a need for world class high performance network infrastructure and the solutions and operating systems with the reliability and resiliency and all the things we talked about, you just keep finding the same requirements.  Exactly how it manifests in a given snapshot at an instant of time of course will always fluctuate but there is, I’d make this a final comment, from our perspective as we look across not just the first half but looking out over the second half as well, this strong and getting stronger perspective that we see is because when we look at this business through a lot of lenses you see the same line which is up and to the right. And we’re going to make that happen with the technology and the team and the people that are here, and as it comes into the top line you’re going to see it driven through an increasingly disciplined model of execution so that it materializes on the bottom line at an even faster rate. And that so far is as we believe a pretty good formula. So expect to see more of it.
Robyn M. Denholm: That is all the time we have this afternoon. We’d like to thank you again for joining us and we appreciate your interest in Juniper Networks. Thank you.

===== 2008 Q1  (2008-04-24 16:45:00) =====
Executives: Kathleen Bela - VP of IR Scott Kriens - Chairman and CEO Robyn Denholm - CFO
Analysts: Paul Silverstein - Credit Suisse Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Ehud Gelblum - JPMorgan Inder Singh - Lehman Brothers Tal Liani - Merrill Lynch Scott Coleman - Morgan Stanley Sanjeev Wadhwani - Stifel Nicolaus Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome to the Juniper Networks first quarter 2008 conference call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). It is my pleasure to introduce Ms. Kathleen Bela, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Kathleen Bela: Thank you, Shannon. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us today. Here today are Scott Kriens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is restructured slightly differently than in the past. Scott will open with highlights of the business drivers during the quarter. Robyn will then provide a financial review before turning the call back over to Scott for closing comments. As discussed previously, the company is no longer reporting services as a separate segment. Services, revenues, and cost going forward are allocated to our RTG and SLT segments. In addition, we will be providing you revenue information broken out between the service provider and enterprise customers. Before we get started I would like to remind everyone that statements made during this call concerning Juniper’s business outlook, future financial and operating results, and overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of uncertainties and risks. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in those forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including economic conditions generally, or in the networking industry, changes in overall technology spending, the network capacity requirements of service providers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply chain constraints, variation in the mix of products sold, customer perceptions and acceptance of our products, litigation, and other factors listed in our most recent report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. All statements made during this call are made only as of today. Juniper undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call, any events, facts, or circumstances subsequently changed after the date of this call. Also in discussion the financial results today, Robyn will first present results on a GAAP basis, and for purposes of today’s discussion we will also review non-GAAP results.
.: With that, I will turn the call over to Scott.
Scott Kriens:
 : The team and the entire company, Juniper did a very good job this quarter, and we performed extremely well against many of our key metrics. We delivered top line growth, up 31% over the last year, operating profits up 57% over the last year, cash flow from operations up 68% over the last year, as well as strong operating margins. All of which were goals we set for ourselves as the year began. In our diverse product portfolio, our geographic distribution coupled with our high performance networking strategy drew the momentum we saw this quarter, and I will comment more on that in just a moment. As an overall market observation, we see clear evidence that our position in the high performance networking segment of the market enabled us to effectively support our customers' top two priorities - to drive greater efficiency and productivity, while at the same time optimizing their business and network performance. So, let’s get underway and start with the review of the geographies in the markets across both the service provider and enterprise businesses that deliver this quarter's results. On a geographic basis in the first quarter, we saw balance performance across our markets around the world. The Americas represented 51% of total revenues in the first quarter, as compared to 48% in the fourth quarter of 2007, with particular strength in US service providers and key emerging countries in Latin America. Europe, Middle East, and Africa, or EMEA, represented 29% of total revenue in the first quarter, as compared to 33% in the fourth quarter, with strength among service providers in Eastern Europe and Northern Africa. Asia-Pacific or APAC represented 20% of total revenue in the first quarter, slightly higher, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2007 at 19% and highlighted by strength in Japan and China. On a year-over-year basis, we realized growth in all of our theaters with expanding diversification of the business worldwide. We saw strength in service providers markets worldwide, consistent with our expectations for the quarter, and the same was true of our enterprise business in both APAC and EMEA. While we saw some softness in our North American enterprise,, business overall linearity worldwide was similar to what we have seen in previous years, and we saw typical seasonality in the enterprise, but again nothing unusual compared with previous first quarter's in a new calendar year. So, let's now look at the service provider and enterprise businesses, and as a reminder, all of my comments pertain only to the high performance markets, where we are focused. I want to be sure, not to imply that these perspectives include commodity markets or more tactical purchasing decisions that others may see. So first, in the service providers, the service provider business continued to reflect healthy demand for our high performance network infrastructure both at the core and edge of the network. While there were always the individual networks and projects in one phase of growth or digestion, we saw no evidence of weakening demand environment in the US, or any direct impact on planned or in-process network infrastructure buildouts around the world. In good and bad times alike, more and more consumers are turning to the network as a source of critical information and commerce, with, for example online retail sales in the US alone expected to increase from $174 billion in 2007 to over $334 billion in 2012 according to Forrester Research. And obviously growing trends such as social networking are making the network and increasingly popular destination. In the first quarter, the edge represented more than half of our infrastructure business. As in previous quarters, we expect to see this mix fluctuate between core and edge quarter-to-quarter. So starting with the core of the network, we have realized robust demand for the T-series in the quarter. The new T1600 commenced initial shipments late last year and I am pleased to share with you the exiting news of our first full quarter of shipping the T1600. We have booked orders for a 105 units and shipped 77 units to customers for deployment in production networks around the world. And surpassing this 100 unit milestone a little more than a quarter, compares quite favorably to results touted by our competitor, which claimed to the same 100 units accomplishment of a new core router after, a quote only, a full year of customer testing. By contrast, this kind of rapid Juniper adoption is proved positive of the power of JUNOS operating system portfolio strategy, as well as a clear indication of the urgency our customers have to maximize network performance. Another key milestone worth noting is the sense, introducing the T-series core routers in 2002. We have now shipped more 4000 units worldwide, 1000 of which were shipped in 2007 alone, representing deployments in more than 200 production networks around the world. Again, as a point of comparison for those keeping score out there, this represents more than twice the number of 1900 total units shipped by our largest competitor, and this according to their own announcement last month. As an extension of the fieldwork we have been engaged in with NTT in Japan since 2006, Juniper received orders in this quarter from NTT for the initial deployment of routing platforms for its next generation network. Commercial deployment commenced at the end of March, and we will continue to work closely with NTT on this deployment as network demand grows. And as a reminder, obviously we are pleased with this business and the opportunity to share this news with you, but we also expect these deployments will occur in a manner consistent with other NGN implementations around the world, which means over a multiyear period and with no significant impact in any particular quarter. Other T-series customer deployments in the first quarter include Tiscali International Network, the wholesale carrier division of the Tiscali Group in Italy, who announced the intention to scale their core infrastructure with the T1600 and HiNet, a wholly owned subsidiary of Chunghwa Telecom in Taiwan, announcing their intention to expand the capacity of their GigaPOPs with multiple T640 core routers, and these GigaPOPs are ultra high performance points of presence that will support advanced by IP traffic across the entire HiNet network. Shifting to edge of the network, initially shipments of the MX240 commenced in the quarter, as deployments of the MX960 and MX480 Carrier Ethernet services routers continue to gain momentum. PeterStar, a leading Russian telecommunications provider, Spectrum Net, a leading Bulgarian provider, nLayer, a leading North American provider of Internet connectivity and wholesale bandwidth, and Carphone Warehouse, one of the largest independent service providers in the U.K., all announced our intentions to deploy the MX to scale their network infrastructures inline with escalating demand for services. And capping our first year of selling the MX-series, I am pleased to share that the MX business grew by an additional 25% in this first quarter, even after surpassing a $200 million annual run rate in its first three quarters of shipments. We have realized strength across the E and M series in the quarter as well, securing a large number of new E320 service provider customers in emerging countries in EMEA, and a number of service providers in Fortune 500 Enterprise Companies in the US for the M320 and M120 respectively. In the quarter, we also announced the mobile IP/MPLS solution portfolio that includes the new BX 7000 multi-access gateway router, new aggregation capability for the M-series, and a suite of software features intended to simplify the deployment provisioning and management of mobile backhaul networks. Our expanding presence in this mobile backhaul transport segment of the market provides us with an exceptional opportunity in an overall market estimated by a recent Infonetics Research report to grow from $4.5 billion in expenditures in 2007 to $8.2 billion in total in 2010, and within that IP/MPLS and Ethernet packet equipment growing at a rate faster than other elements in that market segment. And finally, from a market share perspective Juniper continued to gain market share in every major product category. According to Synergy Research for the latest quarter reported, which is Q4 of '07, Juniper fortified its number by two positions in service provider routing, and gained share in the core, edge, ERX, Ethernet services, and Multiservice Edge categories, providing further evidence of our ability to execute and deliver significant innovation to our service provider customers. So now shifting gears, I would like to first comment on the market, and then some of the key achievements within the enterprise business. Overall, the demand for high performance network infrastructure in the enterprise market was largely as we expected, with on target results in both the EMEA and APAC regions, and typical seasonality and linearity worldwide. The only softness that we saw was somewhat in the US, particularly in the Federal business. Otherwise, we saw strength across the enterprise business, and continue to see encouraging activities levels and very strong acknowledgement of Juniper advantages relative to competitive offerings. Again, to comment only on the market for high performance networking as supposed to the broader market place, we continue to see opportunity for Juniper as evidenced by our worldwide enterprise business, which grew more than 20% from last year.  In the quarter, our obvious major milestone was the introduction of the EX-series of Ethernet switches, which alleviate cost complexity and risk associated with managing legacy switch infrastructures. The EX-series deliver simplicity, carrier class reliability, and infrastructure consolidation to our enterprise customers, who more than ever tell us their networks are just as critical to them as are those we provide to our service provider customers using the identical time tested JUNOS software. We are pleased to report that following those announcements, both the EX 3200 and EX 4200 switches commenced shipping in the quarter and are being met with an enthusiastic response from both our customers and our partners around the world. We expect to realize revenue as planned in this, now the second quarter, and we will report progress through the year as to the acceptance and momentum associated with Juniper's entry into the Ethernet switch market. In the first quarter, we announced the integration of ScreenOS security services including Firewall and VPN into JUNOS for implementation on the J-series services routers. We also recently introduced family of 10 Gigabit Intrusion Prevention System appliances including the IDP 8200, a series of next generation SSL VPN appliances, including the Secure Access 2500, 4500 and 6500, and the Juniper Networks Security Threat Response Manager. The simplest way to describe these products and services is as the realization of our strategy of innovation, integration and performance, demonstrated in multiple examples across the portfolio, and in a great example of Juniper leverage from our service provider customers in this enterprise market, and this in the form of managed services. Verizon business extended its managed Wide Area Network optimization service offering with the introduction of managed routing and security services based on the Juniper network's J-series services routers. And this adds to services already in the market based on our WX platforms, and provides customers with greater choice and flexibility in advanced Verizon business offerings. And finally, from a market share perspective, Juniper gained share in every major product category. According to Synergy Research for the latest quarter reported, which again is Q4 of '07, Juniper gained shares in high end enterprise routing, and according to Infonetics Research for the same fourth quarter, Juniper fortified its number by two positions in total network security, extended its number one position in SSL VPN, and gained share in the high end firewall and secure routing categories. So, these are the highlights across the markets and the geographies we serve worldwide. In the quarter, we also bolstered the bench strength of our Juniper executive team with the appointment of Dr. David Yen to the position of Executive Vice President of emerging technologies, and the appointment of Michele Goins to the position of Chief Information Officer. David joins us from Sun, and Michele from HP, and both executives have proven track records in delivering innovations and execution at scale. These appointments highlight our ability to attract the best talent in the industry, and we welcome David and Michele to the team. And with that, let me turn the call over to Robyn for a detailed financial review of the quarter. And then, I will come back for change this time with a few financial comments on the outlook we see for the major markets going forward, and then, our guidance for the second quarter. So, with that, Robyn?
 : The team and the entire company, Juniper did a very good job this quarter, and we performed extremely well against many of our key metrics. We delivered top line growth, up 31% over the last year, operating profits up 57% over the last year, cash flow from operations up 68% over the last year, as well as strong operating margins. All of which were goals we set for ourselves as the year began. In our diverse product portfolio, our geographic distribution coupled with our high performance networking strategy drew the momentum we saw this quarter, and I will comment more on that in just a moment. As an overall market observation, we see clear evidence that our position in the high performance networking segment of the market enabled us to effectively support our customers' top two priorities - to drive greater efficiency and productivity, while at the same time optimizing their business and network performance. So, let’s get underway and start with the review of the geographies in the markets across both the service provider and enterprise businesses that deliver this quarter's results. On a geographic basis in the first quarter, we saw balance performance across our markets around the world. The Americas represented 51% of total revenues in the first quarter, as compared to 48% in the fourth quarter of 2007, with particular strength in US service providers and key emerging countries in Latin America. Europe, Middle East, and Africa, or EMEA, represented 29% of total revenue in the first quarter, as compared to 33% in the fourth quarter, with strength among service providers in Eastern Europe and Northern Africa. Asia-Pacific or APAC represented 20% of total revenue in the first quarter, slightly higher, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2007 at 19% and highlighted by strength in Japan and China. On a year-over-year basis, we realized growth in all of our theaters with expanding diversification of the business worldwide. We saw strength in service providers markets worldwide, consistent with our expectations for the quarter, and the same was true of our enterprise business in both APAC and EMEA. While we saw some softness in our North American enterprise,, business overall linearity worldwide was similar to what we have seen in previous years, and we saw typical seasonality in the enterprise, but again nothing unusual compared with previous first quarter's in a new calendar year. So, let's now look at the service provider and enterprise businesses, and as a reminder, all of my comments pertain only to the high performance markets, where we are focused. I want to be sure, not to imply that these perspectives include commodity markets or more tactical purchasing decisions that others may see. So first, in the service providers, the service provider business continued to reflect healthy demand for our high performance network infrastructure both at the core and edge of the network. While there were always the individual networks and projects in one phase of growth or digestion, we saw no evidence of weakening demand environment in the US, or any direct impact on planned or in-process network infrastructure buildouts around the world. In good and bad times alike, more and more consumers are turning to the network as a source of critical information and commerce, with, for example online retail sales in the US alone expected to increase from $174 billion in 2007 to over $334 billion in 2012 according to Forrester Research. And obviously growing trends such as social networking are making the network and increasingly popular destination. In the first quarter, the edge represented more than half of our infrastructure business. As in previous quarters, we expect to see this mix fluctuate between core and edge quarter-to-quarter. So starting with the core of the network, we have realized robust demand for the T-series in the quarter. The new T1600 commenced initial shipments late last year and I am pleased to share with you the exiting news of our first full quarter of shipping the T1600. We have booked orders for a 105 units and shipped 77 units to customers for deployment in production networks around the world. And surpassing this 100 unit milestone a little more than a quarter, compares quite favorably to results touted by our competitor, which claimed to the same 100 units accomplishment of a new core router after, a quote only, a full year of customer testing. By contrast, this kind of rapid Juniper adoption is proved positive of the power of JUNOS operating system portfolio strategy, as well as a clear indication of the urgency our customers have to maximize network performance. Another key milestone worth noting is the sense, introducing the T-series core routers in 2002. We have now shipped more 4000 units worldwide, 1000 of which were shipped in 2007 alone, representing deployments in more than 200 production networks around the world. Again, as a point of comparison for those keeping score out there, this represents more than twice the number of 1900 total units shipped by our largest competitor, and this according to their own announcement last month. As an extension of the fieldwork we have been engaged in with NTT in Japan since 2006, Juniper received orders in this quarter from NTT for the initial deployment of routing platforms for its next generation network. Commercial deployment commenced at the end of March, and we will continue to work closely with NTT on this deployment as network demand grows. And as a reminder, obviously we are pleased with this business and the opportunity to share this news with you, but we also expect these deployments will occur in a manner consistent with other NGN implementations around the world, which means over a multiyear period and with no significant impact in any particular quarter. Other T-series customer deployments in the first quarter include Tiscali International Network, the wholesale carrier division of the Tiscali Group in Italy, who announced the intention to scale their core infrastructure with the T1600 and HiNet, a wholly owned subsidiary of Chunghwa Telecom in Taiwan, announcing their intention to expand the capacity of their GigaPOPs with multiple T640 core routers, and these GigaPOPs are ultra high performance points of presence that will support advanced by IP traffic across the entire HiNet network. Shifting to edge of the network, initially shipments of the MX240 commenced in the quarter, as deployments of the MX960 and MX480 Carrier Ethernet services routers continue to gain momentum. PeterStar, a leading Russian telecommunications provider, Spectrum Net, a leading Bulgarian provider, nLayer, a leading North American provider of Internet connectivity and wholesale bandwidth, and Carphone Warehouse, one of the largest independent service providers in the U.K., all announced our intentions to deploy the MX to scale their network infrastructures inline with escalating demand for services. And capping our first year of selling the MX-series, I am pleased to share that the MX business grew by an additional 25% in this first quarter, even after surpassing a $200 million annual run rate in its first three quarters of shipments. We have realized strength across the E and M series in the quarter as well, securing a large number of new E320 service provider customers in emerging countries in EMEA, and a number of service providers in Fortune 500 Enterprise Companies in the US for the M320 and M120 respectively. In the quarter, we also announced the mobile IP/MPLS solution portfolio that includes the new BX 7000 multi-access gateway router, new aggregation capability for the M-series, and a suite of software features intended to simplify the deployment provisioning and management of mobile backhaul networks. Our expanding presence in this mobile backhaul transport segment of the market provides us with an exceptional opportunity in an overall market estimated by a recent Infonetics Research report to grow from $4.5 billion in expenditures in 2007 to $8.2 billion in total in 2010, and within that IP/MPLS and Ethernet packet equipment growing at a rate faster than other elements in that market segment. And finally, from a market share perspective Juniper continued to gain market share in every major product category.

And with that, let me turn the call over to Robyn for a detailed financial review of the quarter. And then, I will come back for change this time with a few financial comments on the outlook we see for the major markets going forward, and then, our guidance for the second quarter. So, with that, Robyn?
Robyn Denholm: Thank you, Scott and good afternoon. I am pleased to report a strong start to 2008. Juniper met or exceeded all guidance metrics for the March quarter, demonstrating our focus on execution on every level. Our outlook for June and rest of the year remains strong, even factoring in the economic conditions that you all heard lots about. Scott will speak directly to the guidance in a few moments, when I have completed the review of the quarter.  We left 2007 with good visibility into our demand metrics, which include product book-to-bill, deferred revenues, and the deal pipeline, all of which remain healthy, with book-to-bill above one, and deferred revenue increasing $52.7 million over the last quarter. Our strong product portfolios, good geographic and market diversity, and focus on execution in the high performance networking market, all combined to set a good time for the business fundamentals as we exit the first quarter of 2008. Now, on to the review of the results. I'll discuss revenue and earnings on a GAAP basis first, then shift to the non-GAAP discussion, as we dive deeper into operating performance. Total revenues for Q1 of 2008 was $822.9 million, up 31% from the prior year, and 2% above the very strong fourth quarter. Juniper earned net income of $110.4 million on a GAAP basis, or $0.20 per diluted share, up 79% from the $0.11 reported in the 2007 first quarter. Scott reviewed the revenue performance by geography, so let me add some color with regard to the revenue on a segment basis. Total IPG revenues of $621.8 million were up 35% on a year-over-year basis, and total SLT revenues of $201.1 million were up 21% on a year-over-year basis. Within each of these segments, IPG product revenue were up 37% and IPG services revenue were up 23%. IPG results reflect the strong performance of our T-series product, and continued good momentum with our EDGE product in particular the MX-Series. SLT product revenue was up 17%, and SLT services revenue was up 33% demonstrating good performances by SSL, CPN and SSG products. On a sequential basis, total IPG revenue was up 6%. And total SLT revenue was down 9%, which was slightly lower than anticipated due to some softness in the government sector business as Scott described, and what is typically a seasonally leaking quarter for enterprise sales in general. Looking at the markets we addressed, service providers sales was 74% of total revenue, up 8% sequentially and up 35% year-over-year with good growth in the Americas and APAC. Total sales into the enterprise market were 26%, down 13% sequentially due impart to coming off an exceptionally strong fourth quarter in 2007, and up 21% year-over-year, driven by good growth from EMEA and APAC. No single customer comprised more than 10% of total revenue during the quarter. Turning to our non-GAAP results. Total gross margin for the quarter was 68.4% of revenue above our long-term model range of 66% to 68%. Product gross margins were 71.9%, up, 1.9 points year-over-year, and up 0.5 point compared to Q4 of '07. This improvement was a result of a favorable mix towards high margin infrastructure products, particularly in T and M-Series. We also enjoyed a favorable ratio of feature-rich pick service in our of equipment mix, and as Scott indicated, Q1 is also a good quarter for us without a next series, with several large deployments during the quarter. Our performance of the edge in Q1 was solid, while the outstanding performances, several of our core products, heavily influenced margins. We also continued to focus on cost improvements in our manufacturing and operation, and in the quarter, we saw improvement in growth margins due to these ongoing efforts. Services gross margin were 52.5% for the quarter, down 1.3 percentage point year-over-year, mainly due to the timing of product purchases that are required to support the growth of the business, and up four-tenths of a point compared to Q4 of '07 due to our ongoing operational efficiencies. Operating expenses totaled $369.6 million or 44.9% of revenue. This represents an improvement of 2.4 percentage points from Q1 of last year, when expenses were 47.3% of revenue. Operating expenses were up only 3% from the fourth quarter, despite higher compensation expenses associated with [FICA], and other benefits that are seasonally alighted into this first quarter. In particular, we exhibited good control in sales and marketing expense, which clearly did not limit our ability to drive revenues in the period. R&D expenses totaled $160.3 million or 19.5% of revenue. And sales and marketing expenses totaled $178.5 million or 21.7% of revenue, all of which were in-line with our Q4 expenses level. Operating profit for the quarter was very strong in a $193 million, resulting in an operating margin of 23.5% of revenue. This is an improvement of 3.9 percentage points over Q1 of last year. The main drivers of this improvement are the gross margin growth and the leveraging our operating expenses that we have focused on building into the model, while we continue to invest in the R&D and sales and marketing areas of our business. As we highlighted for you at our recent Analyst Day, our operational excellence program, what we called the 4 P’s is designed to reengineer Juniper’s revenue drivers and cost structure, and is fully underway and yielding initial results in some key areas. Expect us to continue drilling down on this program over the next few quarters. And given the general economic condition, you can also anticipate that our cost focus will sharpen accordingly. Looking at our segments, operating margins for IPJ were strong at approximately 31% for the quarter. Good focus on the operations and growth in revenue and gross margin enabled with strong showing for the quarter. So, SLT, being slightly softer than normal seasonal pattern for our enterprise customer segment, resulted in slightly less revenue on a sequential basis than we were expecting. But good focus on our operations resulted in better than expected gross margins and lower operating expenses for the segment. SLT operating margins were approximately 1.5% for the quarter. On a product only basis, the operating loss for SLT in the March quarter would have been about $5 million. Juniper posted non-GAAP net income of a $149.5 million, down slightly with Q4, and 33% above year ago results. These results are factoring in interest and other income of $17.6 million lower both year-over-year and sequentially, due primarily to lower interest rate. The non-GAAP tax rates for the quarter were 29%, diluted earnings per share were $0.27, again flat with Q4, and up substantially over the prior year figure of $0.19. Turing to the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with over $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, up from $2 billion at the end of 2007, and reflecting excellent cash flow from operations in the quarter of $255 million. CapEx totaled $33.4 million in the period, and depreciation and amortization was $55.4 million. DSOs reduced to 40 days from 42 in the fourth quarter, well within our predicted ranges. Our deferred revenue was $565.9 million, up $52.7 million compared with the end of the fourth quarter, and aided by the deferral of an ongoing edge router build-out the one of our service provider customer. At March 31, 2008 Juniper had 6111 employees up from 5879 at the 2007 year end. The majority of the additions were in R&D and sales and marketing. During the quarter, we utilized approximately $53 million to repurchase share of our stock and our share count was approximately 560 million shares. And with that, let me hand it back to Scott, to go through the guidance for Q2 2008 and the 2008 full year.
Scott Kriens: Thank you, Robyn. And as you probably see from Robyn’s review, Juniper's business is in very good shape. Success in top line growth, operating leverage, profitability, and cash, all made it possible by the quality of Juniper's commitment to operational excellence in the focus of our high performance networking strategy resulting in overall growth in continued market share gains. We are continuing to invest in and deliver the innovation necessary to capitalize on our opportunity, and we are investing in the sales and support necessary to provide world class responsiveness to the needs of our customers. We are investing in our partners at both the global level with key strategic relationships, and also at the regional level helping valued resellers improve the performance of their businesses as well. Our relentless commitment to improving company-wide execution is unchanged, realizing the day-to-day improvements that are necessary for us to continue to improve the leverage in our business and to sustain the growth rates, which we are targeting in our plans. Our networking industry leadership is also being recognized. In the quarter, Juniper ranked number three overall in the network communications category of Fortune Magazine’s most admired companies in America annual survey. And number one in the innovation category, and number two in quality of services and products and quality management and people management categories, which serves as a testament to the ongoing commitments of now more than 6100 Juniper employees around the world.  As we stated in coming into the year, we are continuing to see evidence from customers around the world with the high performance networking market is gaining traction and separating itself from the commodity, network connectivity market. Coupled with this evolution of the high performance market, all of us seem concerned in the overall economy in the US and around the world. The way that translates in our market is that in times of uncertainty, business leaders are making more carefully considered purchase decisions than ever before because each dollar spent is studied. We believe the effect of that caution is to direct spending only to the suppliers and the projects that have the greatest impact on the performance of the business, and when that depends on the performance of the network, a high performance Juniper decisions will continue to be made. So, now let's turn to guidance for the second quarter. Guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis. All guidance is forward-looking, and actual results may vary for a number of reasons including those noted in our recent 10-K, as filed with the SEC. A GAAP EPS target is not accessible on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to the charges, which are excluded from the non-GAAP EPS estimates. With customers relying on us more and more, we are proceeding with our plans to grow the business, while at the time being mindful of the economy around us. Our business is more diversified, than it’s ever been in all categories, markets, geographies, customers and products, which allows us to maintain the view, that our financial performance will continue as planned in the second quarter. For the second quarter, we expect revenues of between $845 million to $855 million, and earnings per share of between $0.26 and $0.27, assuming a tax rate of 29%. We expect operating margins in the range of 22.5% to 23.5% of revenue for the quarter. This is a significant improvement over the second quarter of 2007 operating income margins, which were 20.4%, which reflects an ongoing commitment to the operational performance of the company. For the full-year, we remain comfortable with our previous revenue outlook of $3.4 billion to $3.55 billion. And in addition, we are adjusting the range of our EPS guidance from $1.10 per share to $1.13 per share. We expect lower interest rates to reduce interest income by $30 million to $40 million. And despite this reduction in interest earnings, which translates to approximately $0.04 to $0.05 per share, we feel comfortable in raising the lower end of our earnings per share guidance. This reflects our expectation of continuing operational improvements as well as a slightly lower share count of 560 million to 570 million shares. We continue to expect to exit the December 2008 quarter with operating margins of 25% or higher. As we chart our course for 2008, our financial objective remains clear and concise, accelerating top line growth and market share gains, and continuing to demonstrate leverage in the business by growing the bottom line even faster. We believe that we have the visibility across the high performance networking marketplace necessary to make this possible, and we have the commitment across Juniper to drive the intense execution necessary to capitalize on the opportunities in front of us. All of this is possible only with the support of our employees, whose continued commitment and incredible efforts make these results possible, as well as our many partners, customers, our suppliers, and our long-term stockholders. I would like to thank you all for your continued support and confidence in Juniper. And so with that, I will now turn the call over Kathleen to initiate our question-and-answer session.
Kathleen Bela: Thank you, Scott. Okay, Shannon, we are ready to begun the Q&A session of the call.
Operator: Thank you very much. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Paul Silverstein - Credit Suisse: I'm sorry, Scott. Here as I'm trying to think, which question to ask, I guess I'll limit to a narrow question. Alcatel-Lucent had been an issue for you and Cisco in the past. Putting side the market opportunity in front of you in terms of where it's really on the carrier side, can you give us some insight in terms of what you are seeing there, both in particular from Alcatel-Lucent as well as more generally in terms of competitive landscape?
Scott Kriens: Sure, Paul. I don't know that I can add any more color really on Alcatel-Lucent. We just don't see enough of it probably to have any new insights there. The TiMetra acquisition that they made some years ago is a product in the market that we see. But I think on other fronts what we see them in more in a capacity of this as a partner in some of the work that we do together in supportive networks and system integration on that side of the business. So, certainly, the competitive overlap exists in the particular area related to the acquisition, but no real new news there, nothing of significance to report on this side. On the broader front, competitively I think what is happening in the market today and to the extent that others are struggling with some their economic challenges I guess, but I think it is also the beginning of the separation in the marketplace here. We are starting to see the strength of our case; it's partly in some of its product cycles and some of its diversities because clearly we have markets around the world. And I think that's been the strength that has driven success in some of the other larger companies that have delivered results on the technology side in the last couple of weeks. And I think this is probably the most important element that we have seen, is this slice of the overall networking market that we focus on this high performance segment. I don't know. I can't tell you until we watch it happen for every quarter of the year. But thus far, it just doesn't seem to suffer the impact with some of the less strategic segments or more commodity-like decisions are feeling under some of the pressures that are out there. How real or self-inflicted some of these concerns are and I guess we'll find that overtime. In terms of the caution that's out there. But I think the strongest driver for us and where we see the greatest advantage relative to competitors is in the combination of size and speed. We've got the size and the breath to portfolio in coverage. And I think that gives people the comfort to do business with us when they are being more careful about how they spend. And we've got the speed and the innovation and the technology to be able to give them an advantage in their market relative to their competitor. So those are the strongest things we see as drivers and where it isn't being seen to the benefit of others out there competitively. I think, it’s missing one or more of those elements in the alternative approaches.
Kathleen Bela:  Next question, please?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs: Hi, thank you very much. Just wanted to see if we can get a little more detail on your deferred revenue balance, looks like you were surprised there about the 12% quarter on quarter, is there anyway you can break that down a little further? By how much the NTT order you've bidden that versus the MX versus some of the other, I think, you're experiencing.
Robyn Denholm: Thanks Simona for that question. In terms of the deferred revenue, we're happy with the growth, in terms of what's happening in that area. Its first product then services and the color that I gave in terms of the script is, there is one ongoing deal that we're continuing to defer. But otherwise, every quarter, we have new advertisments to the deferred revenue and things that actually get recognized each quarter. So that's how the deferred revenue works. And for the quarter, there isn't any NTT in here. As Scott said, it actually is, there were orders that we do -- that we won in the quarter as opposed to revenue or shipment.
Kathleen Bela: Can I have the next question, please?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ehud Gelblum from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Ehud Gelblum - JPMorgan: Hi. Thank you very much. Just want to confirm a couple of things. Scott at the end when you gave the reiteration of the 25% operating margin guidance for the end of the year, you said it were higher. I heard you said it multiple times in the past, can't remember if you said or higher before. I don't you did, but I just wanted to make that I am hearing correctly that you are higher apart is new and so we can have read into that? Second of all, when you look at your EPS guidance, if I go through the moving parts, you beat by $0.02 this quarter and you're raising the bottom-end of your guidance for that $0.02, you going have--
Scott Kriens: Ehud, you there?
Operator: Mr. Gelblum, your line is still open. One moment please, I'll verify if he is connected.
Robyn Denholm: We can move to then.
Kathleen Bela: Yeah, we can move to then.
Scott Kriens: Let me answer the first half and if Ehud doesn't come back I guess it's a second half. Ehud's first question around whether the 25% or higher comment was that carefully selected, it really for us represents no change in comments we've made in the past regarding our operating margins, which is that the 25% target that we've had exiting the year is a target as you know that we put in place when the year began. And one of the questions, we got at the time was whether that was a stopping point, to whether there was some design decision of ours that that would be the high end of the possibility. And the clarification we offered that time was no. That was a target for the end of December. Whether or not it would go higher actually depends on how the year unfolds on a number of fronts really. Obviously, our performance will have something to do with, but also the opportunities we see out there and the return on the investments that we might make. So, it clearly could go higher than that and there is nothing in our plans to prevent in anyway, but the decisions as to what we will do with the excess proceeds from our improving performance will be decisions we make as the year unfolds. Certainly, that targeted 25% remains intact and I guess at a minimum one quarter more confidence in hitting that target than the goal that we set in the January timeframe.
Ehud Gelblum - JPMorgan: Can you hear me now?
Kathleen Bela: Yes.
Scott Kriens: Yeah. Ehud, I won't guess it's a second half of your question. Go ahead.
Ehud Gelblum - JPMorgan: I actually started singing into phone, so…
Scott Kriens: What about the results too.
Ehud Gelblum - JPMorgan: So what I was trying to do was the work up that Robyn that you were talking about. Since I had no idea of you did here, I didn't hear, so I'll be very quick. You raise the $0.02 bottom; you're yielding to $0.04 to $0.05 headwind on the interest income. And therefore, you're making up for that. Is the $0.04 to $0.05 of extra optimism you have now for that, does that come and continue to strength that of IPG or is it from IPG going back to kind of what it should have been along in the original model and recovering SLT to higher point which one of those? I know that's from last conference call as well, but I'll be interesting to see if you have any other additions in terms of where you think your SLT margins can get to by the end of the year? And then, I did not quite understand you said something after you mentioned the 1.5% operating margins for SLT, I think there was positive 1.5% but you said something about $5 million loss. After that I just wasn't -- interesting run off? Thank you.
Robyn Denholm: I'll answer the last part of that question. So, the operating margin for SLT as a segment including services was a positive 1.5% in the quarter. The $5 million loss represents the approximation of what it would have been on a product only by basis.
Ehud Gelblum - JPMorgan: No, I understand. Thank you.
Robyn Denholm: It is the all disclosure. That was what we were talking about.
Scott Kriens: And then, Ehud, on the guidance side of things, yes, you are correct in the disassembly of that guidance on earnings that we gave. It represents improving or raising the lower end of that range from the previous guidance in January of $8 to today's guidance on the low end of $10. And it also does represent the expectation of recovering approximately $0.04 to $0.05 of lost interest income which comes from our cash balances being negatively effective by lower interest rates relative to the beginning of the year. And our guidance here is been addition to lowering that into -- raising the lower end of the range by the $0.02, we are also raising our overall performance from the business itself in terms of operating results to offset the $0.04 to $0.05 negative impact of lower interest rates. So that comes, I would say from two attributes primarily. One, confidence in our operating abilities and in our execution, both the general execution as well as the 4P's the operational excellence program that Robyn alluded to and that we've talked about in the past. That's one of the two. And then second, it isn't particular to SLT or IPG or enterprise or service provider per se. It is the strength of the market segment. It's really the strength that we see in the high performance segment. We saw greater than 20% growth in our enterprise business, higher growth in that, 30% plus in our service provider business. So we see strong opportunity in both segments. And I guess at this point, no ability to distinguish whether one or the other will be leaving stronger contributor relative to its counterpart going forward. So it's really more I'd say the result of what the feedback we're getting from our focus on the market segment of high performance networking. And then, finally, there is a slightly lower share count as a result of some of the share repurchase. But it's primarily the consequences in vast interest income opportunity and the recovery plan for that is the function of operational excellence and market strength.
Ehud Gelblum - JPMorgan: But given your operating margin is unchanged; we should assume its strengthening the top line. And given that, SLT was weaker this quarter, you wouldn't necessarily have any reason to believe that SLT is stronger. So it's sounds again, falls and due stronger IPG revenue?
Scott Kriens: No, I wouldn't say that. I'd say, we expect to see continued strength in the enterprise business, which should be both SLT performance. And it was again, over 20% this quarter and that's been its average performance over the last four quarter. So we do see continued strength out of the SLT business and the enterprise marketplace. Its not so much top line growth because we didn't really changed our top line guidance, its realization at an earlier stage than we previously anticipated of operating margin improvements as a percentage of revenue that will create the $0.04 to $0.05. So it's really accelerating the benefit of our operational efficiencies.
Ehud Gelblum - JPMorgan: Okay. Thank you.
Scott Kriens: Thanks 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Inder Singh with Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead. 
Inder Singh - Lehman Brothers:  Yes, thanks. I just wanted to get little more color on the adoption that you're already seeing on the T1600, whether that's driving upgrades in your existing customer base or are you selling into some new customers as well? Can you give us some color on the types of products you've start to ship there, whether the T series, maybe a breakdown of how the T Series plays into versus EDGE routers please?
Scott Kriens: Into the T1600 is primarily shipment into existing customers but that's because we already have the top 65 customers worldwide, each one of them has a customer. So given the scale and performance of the T1600 the first the largest 65 customers service providers in the world all of whom are customers are going to be first consumer of it. So, technically speaking it will be into networks that we already have a presence in. In some cases it’s new applications or new deployments of core infrastructure and in some cases it’s also enables further sales of T640, because since its seamlessly upgradeable and people’s knowledge of the existence in the upgrade path of the T1600 and the ability to take all of the interfaces and all of the investment in the 640 and roll it into the 1600 without loss of any that investments allow them to buy 640’s with piece of mind that there is long life to that asset. So, it has multiple benefits to us. With regard to NTT, it’s clearly the NGN build out is at the early stages is driven by the core meaning driven by T-series products, but we are not really at this stage at least have liberty to detail the configurations or the breakdown of that. Frankly, I’m pleased NTT has allowed us to make the comments that we are able to make today just to put the now year old question to rest, but beyond that we have to look to them to make comments on their network in particular. All I can say is, they were pleased to be able -- frankly I tell you there is not much celebration here if any on the subject itself because it’s not really new news. I am just glad to be able talk about it and let you know that it’s happening. So, we are certainly pleased with its confidence NTT is displayed by their decision. So, I don’t mean to say anything else on that front to anything of the contrary. But the role out again, is one of those things its going to happen over multiple quarters in fact multiple years and early roll out of that will begin at (inaudible) with T-series.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Tal Liani - Merrill Lynch: Hello, this is Tal Liani. Hopefully you can hear me properly.
Scott Kriens: Go ahead, Tal.
Tal Liani - Merrill Lynch: Hi, I have a one question with two parts not related, Ericsson and other big resellers if you can comment on revenue contribution and then the bigger question of EX switches, what are your expectations and what’s in the numbers for this year and what are your expectations for next year and if you can relate to modular versus fix configuration switches. How do you see it growing? Thank you.
Robyn Denholm: So, on the first part of the question in terms of revenue from any one of the partners on Ericsson, Alcatel-Lucent and NSN, none of them were above 10% this quarter. All of them were low 10% for our definition and that’s the breakout that we normally give you. So, on the second part of the question, Scott I think on the EX.
Scott Kriens: Yeah, EX, the milestone for this last quarter just completed was to hit the first revenue shipment goal of getting product through our test processes and make it eligible and shipping for production use. As we said and I think this will continue to be true, there are a couple of phases of deployment here. One is for the sale cycle process of getting the product out there and presenting the differentiation it holds and all of that and then that will put us into test and design win exercises or people will go to acceptance practices that they have to check the product out and integrate within their designs and then that will be followed by actual rollouts.  So, we don’t expect as we said in January with the announcement, we don’t expect to see material revenues from it until 2009. Although I expect, there will be some, as we mention there will be some revenue that has come in simply because of product is shipping for production use and there will be some. I guess probably pretty limited cases, where we will see people buying and deploying it in simpler more straight forward networks. But I think the significant or material revenue that we will see, is can be a function of first sale cycles and then design and acceptance cycle. So, we would expect to see that, the material benefit of that contribute in '09 and that's really not changed from what we saw in January at the product launch.
Kathleen Bela: Okay. Next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Coleman with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Scott Coleman - Morgan Stanley: Sure thanks. Just a clarification on the SLT margin, Scott, I think last quarter you said, you wouldn't expect SLT products to go back to a loss in Q1, but on the old reporting scheme it did. So, I am just curious if that was mix related or pricing or it was end-demand related in North America because it would seem that it felt short of what your expectation work from a profitability standpoint?
Robyn Denholm: Scott, I will answer that. In my part of the script what I talked about was, we had a slightly softer start to the quarter. All of the start to the year in terms of enterprise, we normally see a seasonal decline in Q1 and Scott did talk about that last quarter. It was slightly more that what we normally see in Q1 and again referring back to the script today. It was due to some softness in the Federal vertical that we saw this quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sanjiv Wadhwani from Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.
Sanjeev Wadhwani - Stifel Nicolaus: Thank you. Scott, I was wondering on the guidance, you could give us a little more granularity on geographies, what are you expecting in the US versus Europe versus APAC. And then just quick follow-up on NTT, you mentioned the taking the T-series, you're also taking the T1600 or T640, any granularity there will be helpful? Thanks
Scott Kriens: Sanjeev, in terms of the expectations we have with regard to geographic distribution, its always a little hard to tell in terms of the relative contributions, in other words, percent of total contributed by each, because the strength of one can offset another. The beginning of the year is not the same, all around the world, so you'll sometime see Asia fluctuate a bit. We saw some strength in Asia in the first quarter even though that isn't always the case. So, I would expect to continue to see Asia do well. AMEA business has been solid, the enterprise business in particular there has been very solid. So, I certainly expect that to continue and the US was up a little bit in this quarter. It was over 50%, it’s been in the high 40s. It could bounce around a few points one way or another depending on how the others do, but I don't think overall my comment would be, I don't have any macro or micro reason to expect any noteworthy adjustments in the contribution mix, couple of percentage points one way or the other. And frankly, that's the strength of the business, its one of the reasons that we have the confidence that we do to reiterate our guidance for the year and also to give you the improved guidance that we have on the bottom line. With regard to NTT, I'm afraid I can not provide any more color there than what they authorized us to comment on. It is T-series related. The thing that is true though in general and I guess I’ll just carefully not make this comment exactly particular to NTT. But the beauty of the fact that you can buy T640 interfaces and put them in T1600 means that the Chassis decision is painless and that deployment decision is protected. So, if you see somebody make a T1600 choice over a T640, what they’re basically saying is they have a higher total capacity expectation and they want to deploy the higher capacity Chassis on the first day. But if you see somebody make a T640 decision, they may simply be slowing their CapEx spend more cautiously into their network and planning the upgrade to the higher speed Chassis at a future date. And what it really translates to if you were a CFO of one our major service provider customers, you would be being told by your operations organization, and what Juniper can do, is more exactly match your expense to the realized revenue with less of the stair step that would be required competitively. In other words, you don’t have to buy Juniper equipment to ahead of its ability to generate revenue for you, in a way that you do competitively relatively to our offering. So, you’ll see people depending on how carefully they want to manage that line and how far out in front of their growth rates they want to go. In one case choose a T640 Chassis and in other case a T1600, but the complete flexibility of the interface is which is really the highest cost element allows people to make choices one way or the other. And finally from a Juniper point of view, we’re neutral actually. We don’t really push or have a preference one way or the other. Margins are noticeably different one side of the equation or the other and the flexibility that the customers choose doesn’t benefit or harm our business in terms of its contributions.
Sanjiv Wadhwani - Stifel Nicolaus: Got it, thank you.
Scott Kriens: Thanks, Sanjiv.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Nikos Theodosopoulos from UBS. Please go ahead.
Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS: Okay. Two quick ones hopefully. On the EX ramp, I guess the question I have is, with the more caution in enterprise spending in the United States and perhaps some in Europe. Do you think there is going to be a longer sales cycle or testing cycle or do you not see that? And the second question would be, why is the company not going to be or has not been more aggressive with the buybacks, given the low interest rates and low stock price? Thank you.
Scott Kriens: Nikos, on the EX ramp I don’t know what to think of -- first of all, I guess, I'm not sure how much caution there actually is out there. I think we are seeing less of it in our segment and other, so we're probably not as well suited to comment on, what the mood or attitude actually is. It’s possible that caution that does exist could translate into people being more careful about changing horses, if you will. It's also possible that they may put their foot down and stops spending on legacy unstable equipment, that doesn’t meet their needs anymore. So, it could actually go either way. And for us its too early to tell, I think we may know a little more in the second half of the year, there is a great deal when I guess it depends on how you look at it. On the one side of it pent-up frustration on the other side urgency around application deployment and so forth. So I don't know is the I guess not so short answer on that. But I do not have any reason at this point to think it is going to have the major influence. I could argue either side of it and we just enough data yet.
Robyn Denholm: So on the stock repurchase program, Nikos, at the Analyst conference, we announced the maintenance program and the additional $1 billion in terms of the ability to buyback. The two were not directly linked. We can still go it out and buy opportunistically depending on the right circumstances in terms of share price and other uses of cash, et cetera. So that is something that we've talked about previously that we can do at any time and evoke that.
Kathleen Bela: Okay. Operator, we have time for one more question.
Operator: Perfect. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets: Robyn, you voice sounds like you were yelling at the fed sales people a quarter. Maybe if you can help us understand why we shouldn't extrapolate the SLT weakness as more challenges to come? Have you recovered the fed sales that slipped, are closure rate back where they should be, and is the SLT book-to-bill greater than one?
Scott Kriens: Mark, a couple of things than Robyn can talk about some of those specifics. Frankly, I don't know what we'll see in fed this quarter. It is an uncertain time in our government this time a year. So we will see what happens there. I think that at least we don't see reason to extrapolate from what we saw in the first quarter in Federal across the balance of the enterprise markets or certainly the world. There was and there is going to be, I suspect, some continuing concerns. Certainly, we've heard news, you've all are living in the segment where people have announced lay outs within financial services and things like that. So we're going to be obviously, be careful on a vertical basis within the financial services sector in particular. But there as much in this high performance segment and there is as much reason for optimism as otherwise across both the markets in the U.S. and certainly others around the world. 
Robyn Denholm: So, on the book-to-bill, we don't specifically break it out between SLT and IPG. But there is not a huge difference between the two in terms of book-to-bill ratio. So that's -- 
Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets: Got it. That's helpful. Certainly, Robyn, does status of the converter and the impact on interest expenses?
Robyn Denholm:  So that's used to convert in June as planned.
Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Got it. Thank you and good luck
Robyn Denholm: Thank you 
Scott Kriens: Thanks, Mark.
Kathleen Bela: Okay. We'd like to thank everyone for joining us today to talk about our results for the first quarter. And we look forward to meeting you again next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. We thank you much for your participation and we ask that you please disconnect your lines. Have a wonderful and lovely afternoon everyone.

===== 2007 Q4  (2008-01-25 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Juniper Networks fourth quarter conference call.  During the presentation all participants will be in a listen only mode.  Afterwards we will conduct a question and answer session.  (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded on Thursday, January 24, 2008.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Bela, Vice President of Investor Relations.   Please go ahead, ma’am.
Kathleen Bela: Thank you, operator.  Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today.  Today’s conference call replay will also be available as a podcast.  Please see the Investor Relations section of the Juniper Network website for additional information.  Here today are Scott Kriens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Robyn Denholm, Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started I would like to remind everyone that statements made during this call concerning Juniper Network’s business outlook, future financial and operating results, and overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties.  Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including economic conditions generally or in the networking industry, changes in overall technology spending, the network capacity requirements of our customers, the timing of orders and shipments, manufacturing and supply chain constraints, variations in the mix of products sold, customer perceptions and acceptance of our product, litigation, and other factors listed in our most recent report on form 10-Q filed with the SEC.  All statements made during this call are made only as of today.  Juniper Networks undertakes no obligation to update the information in this conference call in the events facts or circumstances subsequently change after the date of the call. Also, when discussing the financial results today, Robyn will first present results on a GAAP basis and for the purposes of today’s discussion, will also review non-GAAP results.  For important commentary on why the management team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company’s financial results, please consult our filings with the SEC.  For a detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results, please see today’s press release.  In general, non-GAAP results exclude certain non-recurring charges, such as amortization of purchase intangibles, impairment charges, and expenses related to stock-based compensation. With that, I will turn the call over to Scott.
Scott G. Kriens: Thanks, Kathleen, and good afternoon to everyone.  As we’ve now completed our full year, I’d like to start with a quick review of the fourth quarter and then I’ll look at 2007 in total and talk about the upcoming 2008 outlook across both the service provider and enterprise businesses, and then following that I’ll turn the call over to Robyn who will review the financial results in more detail and provide you with guidance for both the March quarter and the full year. As we began the year, we had two fundamental objectives for the company:  to establish our growth and momentum in the high performance marketplace as reflected by top line performance and then secondly improve our leverage against those revenues as demonstrated by the bottom line improvements in our operating margins and mark significant progress towards the return to the business model that we’ve targeted for the company, and I’m happy to report today that the progress continues as we march towards both goals. So let’s get underway and start with the review of the fourth quarter results.  From a financial perspective, we had the largest revenue quarter in the history of the company, exceeding our guidance to close the fourth quarter at $809.2 million, up 36% over last year’s fourth quarter and up over 10% sequentially.  Non-GAAP operating margins improved to 23.5% of revenues, representing a more than 200 basis point increase from the third quarter.  This achievement was helped along by a combination of strong fundamentals as well as a number of one-time occurrences which I’ll address as well. We delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.27 ahead of our guidance of $0.24 and reflecting our continued focus on execution, we generated cash from operations of approximately $248 million for the quarter which is another record and brings our total cash balances to just over $2 billion at year end.  Book to bill once again was greater than 1 in the quarter.  Unit sales of infrastructure products totaled $3,318 which is up 13% sequentially and we shipped 70,293 infrastructure points in the fourth quarter, up 14% sequentially.  NSN or Nokia Siemens Networks delivered over 10% of quarterly revenues with 10.9% of total revenue for the quarter and we also saw good results from Ericsson, both for the quarter and for the full year and consistent results from Alcatel-Lucent as well. Overall, indirect sales were 69% of revenues and direct sales were 31%.  On a geographic basis, we saw balanced performance in the quarter across our markets around the world.  The Americas represented 47.5% of total revenue as compared to 47% in the third quarter with particular strength coming from the US and also particularly from Latin America.  Europe, Middle East, and Africa or EMEA represented 33.6% of revenue as compared to 32.5% in the third quarter, with particular strength in Europe, and Asia Pacific represented 18.9% of total revenue, slightly lower when compared to the previous quarter which came in at 20.5%. On an absolute dollar basis, we saw growth in all our theaters with healthy diversification as a business worldwide, and the growth was made possible both by the demand we saw in the high performance networking market and the share gains we saw in nearly all of our markets. So with that backdrop for the fourth quarter, let’s turn our attention to the full year of 2007 and first I’ll review a few of the noteworthy full year financial measures and then we’ll turn to the specific markets of service provider and enterprise in which we compete.  We grew revenue for the year 2007 from $2.3 billion to $2.84 billion which is up 23% over 2006 ahead of both industry projections and the growth rates of our principal competitors in the markets we serve.  We delivered non-GAAP earnings growth in 2007 of 19%, resulting in earnings per share of $0.87 for the full year, and again that’s non-GAAP, and for the full year we generated a record amount of cash flow from operations, nearly $800 million, always a strong signal of the health of a business. We invested approximately $600 million in research and development through the year which is fueling both the current product cycles as well as the portfolio road maps which are the basis for the guidance Robyn will share with you shortly, and we also invested significantly over $600 million in the sales and marketing needed to achieve the growth that we’ve noted and to continue to build on the momentum we’ve generated as we enter 2008. Looking at these results from the products perspective, our SLT product business grew 20% year-over-year from 2006 and 29% from the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. Our IPG product business grew 24% year-over-year from 2006 and 42% from the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to this fourth quarter of 2007.  That is faster than our principal competitors and it serves to underscore share gains for the year and then finally our services business grew 24% year-over-year from 2006 to a total of $509.1 million with steady improvements to gross margin and bottom line contribution as well. I’d like to expand on these results by market and then provide you with some color on the service provider and enterprise markets, as well as our services business.  So first let’s review the key achievements for the service provider business.  2007 was a year of continued progress by service provider customers and the build out of the next generation networks designed to enable quick and cost-effective deployment of the differentiated multi-play services driving new sources of both revenue and profitability. We recognized nearly $1.8 billion in revenue for 2007 from our infrastructure product groups with market share gains in every major product category, and these are according to synergy research, and for the latest quarter reported, which is the third quarter of 2007, we maintained a strong number two position and gained share in service provider routing, core, and in both the ethernet service and multi-service edge.  Driving our revenue performance and share gains are some new market changing infrastructure products introduced in 2007 that are now being deployed in the world’s top 65 service providers. Those products include the MX series family of ethernet services routers that enable service providers to deliver advanced services, including IP TV and video on demand at scale and the MX series includes the MX 960, the industry’s largest capacity and highest density carrier ethernet platform, and more recently shipments of the MX 480 which commenced in the fourth quarter and were met with a favorable response from customers such as Yahoo!  Last quarter I shared with you a data point relative to the MX series, noting that it was one of our fastest ramping new product families and then in the third quarter we achieved the run rate of a $100 million per year business and I’m delighted to provide an update that as of this now completed fourth quarter, the MX series has now crossed over the $200 million per year run rate which is doubling again from the already outstanding third quarter performance. MX customer deployments for the fourth quarter include Elion, a voice internet and data provider in Estonia, and Neo Telecoms, a leading French IP services operator who announced their intentions for deploying the MX 960 in their European IP backbone.  Another obvious point, also important to our product leadership position, is the T1600, which is the industry’s highest capacity and most energy-efficient core router and it delivers first of all an industry-leading 1.6 terabits of throughput, but it does so consuming 30% less power, 30% less cooling, and half the physical space of competitive platforms, and as a result I’m pleased to share with you that the T1600 was the recipient of Internet Telephony’s 2007 Product of the Year. The introduction of the T1600 was a very important proof point for the leadership of the T640 as well, enabling us to drive 50% growth in T series revenue in the fourth quarter of 2007 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2006 and in absolute unit shipments has helped us to surpass the 3,000 unit milestone for T series deployments.  With the T series deployed today in more than 200 production networks around the world, our customers have the confidence of knowing that upgrading currently installed T640 routers to the T1600 can be performed in as little as 90 minutes and without service interruption. In the quarter, Verizon Business announced its intent to quadruple the standard speed of its backbone network connecting major US cities and they deployed one of the first router-to-router 40 gigabit per second circuits carrying live traffic using T series routers and in addition, Taiwan’s leading service provider, Chunghwa Telecom, announced its intent to build their unified core network with T series core routers and this underpinning their fixed mobile convergence and advance services strategies. Another significant industry first and a milestone for the company on the service provider side was the delivery of product development tools and capabilities in support of our open system strategy with the announcement of the Partner Solution Development Platform or PSDP and with the industry’s first Partner Development Platform for a carrier class network operating system, which is JUNOS, the customers and partners now can accelerate their innovation for the deployment of new revenue-generating services with access to the PSDP technology as well as technical and business support through our Open IP Solution development program.  This PSDP is available through an annual licensing program and inaugural program members include Avaya and Aricent. Finally, I’m very pleased to share the results that have just been released by the Infonetics Research people in their report titled “Service Provider Plans For IP and MPLS in North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific.”  Infonetics surveyed 25 of the largest service providers worldwide and the results showed that Juniper was voted the overall IP infrastructure category leader based on top-ranked technology, security, management, service, and support, as compared to our five direct competitors.  This is particularly satisfying for us as it represents the voice of our customers and their preferences for Juniper’s approach to addressing their requirements. So now switching gears, let’s review the key achievements within the enterprise business. First is the fact that we achieved and exceeded our target of profitability in the fourth quarter for the SLT product segment with a profit of almost $8 million for the quarter on product revenues alone, and second is that we continue to enjoy success in the enterprise market not only for security products but for our routing products as well, which I’ll mention in a moment. We are extremely pleased with the outstanding dedication and the execution of the team necessary to achieve this result with our SLT portfolio and as I mentioned earlier, we also enjoyed some year-end opportunities in addition to the typical quarterly seasonality.  The increases we saw were driven primarily by firewalls, VPN, and SSL VPN, and the company was once again recognized for it s leadership momentum in this space with this position in the leader’s quadrant of Gardner’s recently published Magic Quadrants for Firewall, SSL VPN, and WAN Optimization.  We recognized $573.8 million in revenues for the full year 2007 from our service layer technologies group and we realized market share gains in every major category according to Infonetics research. For the latest quarter reported, which is again Q3 of ’07, calendar Q3, Juniper maintained it’s strong number two position in total network security and we gained share in the high end firewall SSL VPN and secure routing categories.  Also in the quarter we announce dour Unified Access Control or UAC 2.1 which advances the product’s access control visibility and monitoring of applications and user capabilities so from a security perspective, Juniper continues to execute on its strategy to provide enterprises with advanced, coordinated visibility and control of applications and users across the extended enterprise. From a security leadership perspective, our IST 1000 with integrated intrusion detection and prevention won Network World’s Clear Choice Competitive Review and did so by sweeping a field of 13 competitors in the unified threat management or UTM appliances that they brought to that competition and Japan’s University of Tsukuba, Dexia, a European banking group, and also leader in financial services for the public sector and Inner Mongolia Power all announced intent to protect their network infrastructure with our Integrated Security Gateway or ISG.  O’Neill, who is one of the world's leading youth lifestyle and surfing brands, is also deploying our SSG products along with the NetScreen Security-Manager to secure their network of retail branch offices across Europe. Also during the quarter we released several new software enhancements for our WX application acceleration platforms that fortify application security without any compromise to network performance, and those enhancements will offer the integration of content distribution and WAN optimization within a single platform. We also gained leverage from our service provider customers into the enterprise market in the form of managed services and a clear example of this was Verizon Business’s selection of our WXC application acceleration platform as the technology to fuel their new managed wide area network optimization service. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, we continue to see very solid traction within the enterprise market for our routing products portfolio with significant growth and IPG shipments to these customers throughout the year.  The overall evidence we’ve seen as we look back across the quarter and the full year for Juniper and the enterprise market tells us that the momentum is strong and that it’s increasing.  We now serve 96 of the Fortune 100 and more than 30,000 customers worldwide.  Customers are inviting us into their decisions and their deployments and they’re looking not only at the best in class product or products that they first became interested in but now across our entire portfolio of solutions for their needs, and with this growth, the leverage is increasing in our business as a result of the improving productivity from our execution. Finally I’d like to reflect on our services business for a moment which is in support of both our service provider and enterprise customers, and specifically there I’d like to highlight commitments to investment and education and career certification programs.  Exiting 2006 there were 5,661 Juniper JUNOS certified networking professionals around the world and in 2007 we initiated a fast track program which is designed to enable experienced networking professionals to fast track to Juniper’s JUNOS operating system certification.  This program proved so successful that the number of JUNOS certified professionals has jumped to 12,083 by year end, which is an increase of 6,422 new certifications of which 3,719 resulted directly from this fast track program, and the tremendous success of the program serves as proof positive that our investments in education continue to bolster our reputation with customers as an industry-leading provider of network infrastructure. So as we look back for some insight from 2007, and then forward to our outlook to 2008, there’s two things that become abundantly clear.  First, the high performance networking market is emerging, and it’s beginning to stand apart from the commodity network connectivity market because there’s different and more discriminating decisions being made by buyers in this high performance market because the quality of the decisions is being seen as directly related to the quality of the businesses these decisions support.  If the performance of the business depends on the performance of the network, then a high performance decision will be made.  Secondly, and related directly to that, the Juniper strategy is working.  High performance networking is real and the distinctions between high performance and commodity connectivity markets are becoming clearer every day. We’re succeeding by delivering networks that matter most to our customers, the networks that have to work.  That is our singular focus.  We believe that because of that focus, we do it better than anyone else in the industry and we’re seeing increasing industry-wide acceptance and acknowledgment of the approach.  We are investing in the innovation necessary to provide network infrastructure that is fast, reliable, and secure. We are investing in the sales and support necessary to provide world-class responsiveness to the needs of our customers.  We are investing in our partners at both the global levels with key strategic relationships and also at the regional levels which is helping many valued resellers improve the performance of their businesses as well. As important as anything else that we do, we are also investing in a relentless commitment to improving company-wide execution, the day-to-day improvements that are necessary for us to continue to improve the leverage in our business and sustain the growth rates which we’re targeting in our plans. Finally, we are investing in our people, soon to be 6,000 employees of Juniper who have brought these results to you today.  Our goal with these investments is clear and unambiguous:  accelerate top line growth and market share gains and improve leverage in the business by growing the bottom line even faster.  We have the visibility across the high performance networking marketplace necessary to make this possible.  We have the high performance DNA in our culture to build on our momentum, and we have the commitment to each other to drive the intense execution necessary to capitalize on our opportunity. All of this is possible as always, only with the support of our employees, whose continued commitment and incredible efforts make these results possible as well as our many partners, our customers, our suppliers, and our long-term shareholders, so I’d like to thank you all for your continued support and confidence in us. So with that I’ll turn the call over to Robyn.
Robyn M. Denholm: Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon.  Juniper enjoyed a strong December quarter, a very good close to a good fiscal year where we saw both revenue growth and operating profit growth improve in the second half.  I will walk you through our results for the fourth quarter and recap the 2007 fiscal year.  We’ll also present our guidance for the first quarter of 2008 and for our full year of 2008. For the December quarter, all key financial measures met or exceeded our guidance as provided on our third quarter call and I am particularly pleased with our operational execution as illustrated by a nearly 3 percentage point sequential improvement in GAAP contribution ledger.  We also achieved profitability of approximately $8 million in our SLT product business for the quarter, delivering on our goal of establishing SLT profitability in 2007. On a GAAP basis, total revenue was $809.2 million in the fourth quarter, up 36% versus last year’s fourth quarter and up 10% sequentially over our strong third quarter revenue performance.  As Scott noted earlier, regional break down of revenue is as follows:  47.5% from the Americas, the EMEA region was 33.6%, and the Asia Pacific region, including Japan, contributed about 18.9% of revenue.  We saw strength across all three revenue categories, infrastructure SLT, and services.  The infrastructure products group continued its momentum, reaching a record high quarterly revenue of $500 million for product sales line.  The strongest product areas were the T, M, and the MX series. In the SLT product group, revenue was $168.4 million for the fourth quarter.  We saw healthy year-over-year growth of 29% and we achieved the same seasonal increase that we were anticipating with sequential growth over the third quarter of 19%, slightly better than what we were expecting for the quarter.  The strongest product areas were our firewalls, SSLs, VPN, and WAN optimization products.  Service revenue was $140.4 million, delivering another solid quarter, up 25% year-over-year and up 9% from the previous quarter, with EMEA services performing very well. For the year, total company revenue came in at $2.84 billion, above the top end of the guidance range that we had increased on our third quarter call, and up 23% over fiscal 2006.  GAAP net income totaled $122.9 million for the fourth quarter, up 73% from last year’s fourth quarter of $71.0 million, and 44% higher than the $85.1 million reported for the third quarter of 2007.  The bottom line growth is a testament to the revenue strength shown across our product group and operating expense management.  GAAP earnings per share on a diluted basis were $0.22, compared to $0.12 in the prior year fourth quarter.  For the full fiscal year, Juniper earned $360.8 million or $0.62 per diluted share. In the rest of my financial recap, we’ll focus on non-GAAP results.  Gross margin was 68%, reflecting a slight moderation from the third quarter and a year ago period.  This was in line with our guidance for the fourth quarter as we had indicated we expected to see a slight decline in the fourth quarter due to anticipated product mix.  With respect to product mix versus the third quarter, there was continued strength in both the M and T series products and the level of peaks versus [inaudible ] were also strong but not as high as the third quarter, versus a year ago, as anticipated, the success of our slightly lower margin products in the MX series and the branch contributed to the overall dilution of the margin.  As we have noted in the past, our long term model calls for growth margins to range between 66% and 68% and we were in the range for the quarter. Services margin has improved year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter due to the economies of scale as our business grows and on growing improvements in our cost structure.  For the fourth quarter, services margins were 52.1%, up from 51% a year ago and up from 51.7% in the third quarter.  Operating expenses were $360.6 million for the quarter for 44.6% of revenue.  This represents a 3.8 percentage point improvement compared with the prior year fourth quarter.  This result was also a 3.3 percentage point improvement over third quarter on a percent of revenue basis.  This clearly demonstrates the operating leverage that is possible in our model as we balance the investment needed to fuel the long term growth of the company and the short term operating margin expansion. Looking at the operating expense components, R&D was $157 million, up 31% from $119.9 million a year ago, and flat with the third quarter.  As a percentage of revenue, R&D was 19.4%, which is down both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis, owing to our strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter.  This reduction in percentage was also contributed to by the schedule of prototypes and in our expenses and by leveraging resources in lower cost regions.  Sales and marketing totaled $174.5 million or 21.6% of revenue, a nearly 3 percentage point reduction over the prior year fourth quarter as a percent of revenue.  Sales and marketing expenses increased $5.9 million sequentially, attributable to the higher commission expense resulting from increased revenue. G&A totaled $29 million or 3.6% of revenue.  In the year ago period, G&A was 3.8% of revenue.  G&A was up approximately $3 million sequentially.  The increase was due primarily to a $2 million charitable contribution to the Juniper Foundation.  Non-GAAP operating income was $190 million or 23.5% of revenue.  The operating income margin improved from 20.2% in last year’s fourth quarter and was also higher sequentially, keeping us on track towards our target of 25% non-GAAP operating margin.  Non-GAAP interest and other income totaled $20.4 million, down from $30.1 million in the year ago quarter, reflecting the lower average cash balances due to the stock repurchases in the first half of 2007.  The non-GAAP tax rate was 28%, consistent with the third quarter.  Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.27 which exceeded our guidance by $0.03.  Share count of $566 million shares was just slightly higher than the $565 million we had predicted on our last conference call. For the year, non-GAAP diluted EPS totaled $0.87, up 19% from $0.73 in the fiscal 2006 year and higher than the top end of our guidance range by $0.02. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the year with approximately $2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short and long term investments.  I’m pleased to report that we generated a record $247.7 million in cash from operations in the fourth quarter, up from $193.2 million in the third quarter.  For the 2007 year we generated $797.6 million in cash from operations, up from $755.6 million in 2006, again demonstrating the underlying strength in the fundamental financials of the company.  Capital expenditures totaled $35.9 million in the fourth quarter, compared with $35.9 million in the third quarter and $32.3 million in the prior year period.  Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $49.9 million in the fourth quarter compared to $48.1 million in the third quarter and $44.4 million last year. Days sales outstanding stood at 42 days at the end of the quarter, up from 34 days in the third quarter and higher than the recent trends but within our predicted range.  As always, DSO is subject to the mix of partners selling Juniper products as well as shipment linearity.  With the fourth quarter, shipment linearity played a larger role than in the September quarter.  Deferred revenue increased to $513.3 million in the fourth quarter from $453.3 million at the end of the third quarter.  This was driven by both an increase in product and services deferred revenue.  The product deferred revenue increase is the result of customer specific deliverables and is another good indicator of the strong underlying demand for our products.  As a reminder, in any given quarter, there are product and services related entries into and out of deferred revenue as required by the GAAP rules. We had 5,879 employees at the end of 2007, compared with 5,661 at the end of September.  This increase was primarily in R&D and sales and marketing and reflects our ongoing commitment to invest in our future technology road map and capitalize on those investments with sound routes to market. Now let’s turn to our guidance for the first quarter and outlook for the 2008 year.  We will continue to focus on our financial fundamentals and please note that it is difficult to predict the level of business in each quarter but we would like to share some data with you.  The following forecast and guidance are non-GAAP and are forward-looking statements.  Please refer to our filings with the SEC for a full statement of associated risk factors. We are entering 2008 with good visibility and momentum in our key demand metric of revenue growth, book to bill ratios, deferred revenue, and our deal pipeline.  Our business is also more diversified than it ever has been in all categories, market, geography, customers, and products.  This combination of factors supports our view that we should continue to deliver good financial performance as we enter 2008. For the full year 2008 we expect revenues to range between $3.4 billion to $3.55 billion with EPS in the range of $1.08 to $1.13. This is using a model tax rate of 29% and a share count of approximately 580 million shares.  We expect other income and expense of approximately $100 million and please note our model tax rate is 1% higher than 2007 as the R&D tax credit has not been renewed at this point in time.  The impact of this increase in tax rate is approximately $0.02 on our EPS estimates.  Regarding operating margins, we expect to see year-over-year improvement in each quarter of 2008 and expect to exit the fourth quarter 2008 at or above our targeted model of 25% operating margin.  In addition, we expect strong positive cash flow from operations for the year. For the first quarter we expect revenue of between $810 million to $820 million and EPS of between $0.24 and $0.25, again assuming a tax rate of 29%.  We expect operating margins of approximately 22% of revenue for Q1 reflecting typical increases in certain employee related expenses such as FICA which begin in the new fiscal year.  This is a significant improvement over the Q1 ’07 operating income margins of 19.6% reflecting the ongoing improvements in the operational performance of the company. With that I will turn it over to the operator for the question and answer session.
Operator: Thank you kindly.  (Operator Instructions)  The first question comes from the line of Nikos Theodosopoulos with UBS.  Please proceed with your question.
Nikos Theodosopoulos: I guess two quick questions.  The first one is I appreciate the guidance for the quarter and the year.  Can you talk about specifically what your targets within your overall margin structure for the SLT business is in terms of profitability this year, and the second question would be we haven’t had a chance to hear you, Scott, speak about the departing CLO.  What are you doing about that going forward?  Is there a new search, what type of candidate are you looking for, if you can shed some light on that. Thank you.
Scott G. Kriens: Sure Nikos, first of all, we have not in the guidance and don’t usually speak to specific SLT profitability.  I would make one comment just for the benefit of some further understanding on SLT though, as we reported the Q407 results that we just are announcing, it recognizes about an $8 million profit on SLT product sales alone.  But for the full year, SLT product and service was profitable in total so as we look at the business, it is profitable with the inclusion of the services and these are obviously services specific to SLT, and as we look forward in ’08, we expect to continue to improve the profitability in both absolute dollars obviously, but also in profit margin contribution on both the product and service businesses, obviously increasing then the total for the year.  If this will tend to not be as significant unless seasonality changes which I don’t think it will, meaning the first and third quarters are typically softer and the second and fourth quarters for us certainly have proven to be stronger, so the contributions to the improvements and the profitability of the business SLT will be greater in the second quarters and in the fourth quarters and obviously we’ll be contributing to making it possible for us to get to and beyond our 25% target in total. Then with regard to Stephen Elop’s departure, there were a significant number of systems and business process improvements that have begun over the last 12 months during Stephen’s time with the company implemented by a broad cross-section of people inside Juniper which has had some impact already and will have more impact as we go forward into next year and beyond, so the team of people involved in the deployment of those process improvements and the systems and IT capabilities that underlie those, as well as the practices in the company that continue to improve, not only are focused uninterrupted on that, but there’s also some growing excitement across the company that there is real measurable benefit to this kind of execution intensity and focus, so that is certainly going to continue. With regard to the position itself, we have already actually retained a firm and we’re going to be looking across the marketplace at candidates and we’ll be filling that position from outside of Juniper when we can find the person that we’re satisfied is a fit for the culture and a fit for the company.  The only final comment I’d make on that is I’ve got a luxury here of a very strong team, not only Robyn’s arrival, Mark Bauhaus, Penny Wilson, and now over 1,000 employees in this last year, so it gives us with our momentum in the systems and processes side the luxury if you will of being sure about the candidates we consider and the decision we make on this front, so if it takes us longer than it might otherwise, I’m confident in the team and I think the results speak for themselves, so we will be working diligently on it and bringing more to you as we complete that search.
Nikos Theodosopoulos: Thanks, Scott.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Evanson with Sanford Bernstein.  Please proceed.
Jeff Evanson: Over the first nine months of 2007 according to your third quarter 10-Q, your allocated facilities and IT expenses grew by about $42 million.  What was the change in the fourth quarter and what do you expect the growth in those allocations to be during 2008?
Robyn M. Denholm: Jeff, in terms of answering that question, you’ll see more data as we publish the K.  The overall expenses growth we talked about in the operating expenses, both IT and facilities are included in those and then they are allocated across the rest of the business group.  In the 10-K as you can see or 10-Q, we have two statements and the services statement that we allocate expenses to, so all of them are included in the operating expense discussion that we talked about today.
Jeff Evanson: And how do those scale with your size?
Robyn M. Denholm: Again as a percentage of revenue, the sales and marketing expenses increased and the G&A expenses decreased in the quarter and R&D also decreased in the quarter.
Jeff Evanson: I guess what I’m wondering is do you have facilities allocated in excess of your current requirements that don’t go up and that’s part of the way that you get your operating leverage that your guiding to over the next year?
Robyn M. Denholm: I’m not sure that I understand the question.  Do you want to repeat the question please Jeff?
Jeff Evanson: Maybe I’ll just follow up with you offline.  Thanks, Robyn.
Robyn M. Denholm: Thank you.  Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Long with Banc of America Securities.  Please proceed.
Tim Long: Thank you.  Just a few questions on the Asia Pacific theater.  It’s been lagging at least on a sequential basis under the other regions the last few quarters.  Could you talk a little bit about what’s going on in that theater?  Is it more the emerging market and what’s the latest status update on Japan?  What do you see with timing and impact of the NGN build there and is that something that you think is most likely to reinvigorate that theater?  Thank you.
Scott G. Kriens: Tim, a couple comments in reverse order here.  As far as Japan and within that NTT in particular, we as you know, at the outset of this year had expected more announcements to be made by the end of the year and those have not been forthcoming and so we’ll now move that expectation into the first half of ’08 but I also think that when we do see them comment more publicly, it will be to describe a more measured deployment over time of the next generation network.  I’m not inferring this from your question but from conversations with others, I think there’s perhaps an expectation that NTT is going to create some huge spike of some kind with some overnight deployments and impacting obviously not only perhaps Juniper if we were to participate but others and actually would be willing to bet that what they’re going to do is a lot more measured over time so it won’t produce the kind of obvious blip in the revenues per se and then secondly I’m not sure what comments of what type they will make publicly on this and obviously we’ll comment only as they do, so what I can say which continues to be true is we are very focused on the opportunity and we spend a great deal of time on it, both myself personally and our whole team, and feel pretty good about our outlook for Japan as we look across ’08.  Then across impact more broadly, clearly strength in China, big opportunities in India, Australia, New Zealand continues has always been a good marketplace for us and continues to be true and the growth in theater there will be leveraged towards those markets, countries, and economies and we also continue to grow our development presence in Beijing and China in particular and see great productivity coming out of there as well as opportunity from increasing our investment in the country itself so that’s at least some color across the Asia theater which I expect to continue to have a good year again in ’08 whether it can outrun the growth in the rest of the world in percentage terms, I’m not sure what to hope for, frankly, but in certainly absolute dollars I expect it to continue to be a good market.
Tim Long: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Merrill Lynch.  Please proceed.
Tal Liani: Hi guys.  Thanks.  Excellent quarter.  I have a few questions on the changes between 3Q and 4Q, sort of the delta in the numbers.  When I look at your sequential improvement in operating profit is about $35 million, I see that your R&D went down by about $8 million so it’s part of it and also SLT profits improved $21 million or $22 million so if I split up I get roughly let’s say to the sequential improvement, and I’m trying to understand these two points, if you can elaborate on the improvement in SLT margin, it went from -10 to +5 almost, so how did you achieve such a dramatic improvement in such a short period of time and also the decline in R&D, what’s behind it?
Robyn M. Denholm: Let me answer that question, Tal.  In terms of overall expenses in the quarter, the expenses increased quarter-over-quarter on a non-GAAP basis by about $8 million in total.  R&D was only $400,000 lower than Q3 so I’m not sure that I understand the first part of the question.
Tal Liani: I may be wrong, so --
Robyn M. Denholm: That’s okay.  So in terms of the total, we did increase expenses by about $8 million.  The largest piece that increased in there was sales and marketing and most of that was as a result of commissions on the increase in revenue.  Specifically on the SLT business, so there were two things that we needed to do, one was to increase revenue on a sequential basis, and we did, it was 90% in the quarter, and we were expecting just slightly less than that, so I think that explains the top line.  In terms of the expenses, we were anticipating reducing the expenses from Q3 to Q4 and that’s what we did do in the quarter.  When you say the trails, there’s the break out of that as well.  That’s the two factors that contributed to the nearly $8 million worth of profit.
Tal Liani: Are you looking in 2008 to buy back more stock?  I think this quarter you didn’t buy any stocks?  What are your plans?
Robyn M. Denholm: So as you know we had approval for $2 billion of stock buy backs.  We completed roughly $1.4 billion of that in the first half of the fiscal 2007 year.  $1.6 billion, so we had $400 million remaining in terms of approval and we’ve not signaled our intention one way or another, with that amount going forward.
Tal Liani: So last question is in your prepared remarks you said that your entering 2008 with excellent visibility, I think this is even the term you used. What’s behind this expression?  Do you have better visibility now than you had before?  Are these long term contracts or is it related to any specific product?  Just more color about the visibility.
Scott G. Kriens: Well Tal, we did say in our remarks and we do have good visibility as we look forward into ’08 across a number of different dimensions, actually.  Part of it is measurable metrics which include things like the pipeline itself, the book to bill ratios, our deferred revenue and product revenue in particular grew by a fair amount here in the fourth quarter, so those are some of the metrics that give us the improvement in visibility, but also the diversity of the business which is probably the strongest point, I’d put that across at least three dimensions.  It’s multiple products from obviously the two product groups of SLT and IPG.  It’s multiple markets from a geographic point of view.  I talked a moment ago about Asia Pacific.  We see opportunities in EMEA, we see opportunities in the United States and Canada and have had significant success in Latin America, for example, so it’s multiple geographies, and then finally multiple market segments, which include vertical markets, the public sector, always a good market for us, and I would note also we completed these results in the last quarter without the benefit of the approval of the Federal budget in the United States, so we think there’s opportunities there with those budgets now approved.  We also saw good contributions from the financial services sector as well as retail and the markets we focus on around the world so geographies, products, and markets all make contribution to our visibility and our outlook so it gives us a pretty good sense of the stability of the demand that we see.
Tal Liani: Thank you. Operator Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Ehud Gelblum with JP Morgan.  Please proceed.
Ehud Gelblum: Hi, thank you.  A couple of random questions that aren’t necessarily related.  First one, can you give us a sense of the split in customer base between carrier and enterprise and specifically at SLT, was it... Generally it’s mostly enterprise but you do have some carrier customers in there.  Can you give us a sense as to how much sort of from each of those and also can you give us a sense of how much T1600 revenue was in the quarter?
Scott G. Kriens: Ehud, there was not very much T1600 revenues. We’ll see that come in Q1 more and even then, by the way, the customers will be testing the product and because of it’s criticality at the heart of the networks, what’s more likely and reflected in what we saw in those fourth quarter where we had the T640 growth up 50% over the fourth quarter of ’06, the confidence in the portfolio that the T1600 brings, as well as the fact that you can take everything out of a T640 and put it in a T1600, allows people to make protected investment decisions which has a couple of translations.  One, it’s easier to buy T640s and two, it’s more relaxing to do that while you test the T1600 even longer, so I do think we’ll see revenue and revenue growth out of the T1600 and if history is any teacher, for me at least, I’ll be pleasantly surprised by that but we certainly created the flexibility for our customers to make protected investments in the T640. In terms of split of business, as we’ve said before, it wanders a little bit just because it’s not always easy to track this precisely because of the definition of the terms but the business divides roughly two-thirds service provider and a third enterprise.  Sometimes that will move up or down.  There are and there has been good growth in IPG products sold into the enterprise markets, even some surprisingly large router products being bought by the major high performance enterprises, and the security portfolio is of an increasing interest in the service provider market because I think there are enterprise customers who, if they can, would like to turn over their security and sometimes even application performance, as the Verizon business product being rolled out as our WX portfolio demonstrates, but an interest in the enterprise market in turning over security and application performance responsibilities to service providers.  We also have business being sold through service providers to enterprises, business being done with service providers who put it in their internal network, in which case you’d actually call it an enterprise, and so it makes it a little difficult and it’s one of the reasons we don’t deliver precision on this, because we aren’t always sure, but the rough distribution of a third and two-thirds between service provider being two-thirds and enterprise being about a third of the totals, is probably a good marker and it may grow in enterprise as a little bit higher percentage of total looking forward.  That doesn’t really, it’s probably false precision to claim that, but it wouldn’t surprise me if it happened.
Ehud Gelblum: Okay.  I’ll assume basically that mix sort of stayed constant from Q3 to Q4.  Two questions if I could.  One, Federal business.  I know it’s somewhat smallish for you but it was an area that you started growing a couple years ago.  I know the budgets haven’t been signed, but do you see any weakness or particular strength out of Federal?  The last time your operating margins speak to that is 2005, you had 28%.  Do you consider, it sounds like you’re going to end this year at 25% plus, do you consider 28%, I don’t care when it happens, over earning?  At that time, in ’05, that seemed to be a little bit too high in the sense that you didn’t have enough money to do R&D or do you think you can safely hit that sometime in the future, 28% without being in an over earnings state?
Scott Kriens: First of all, I will suspend my personal opinions on the impact of the outcome in November on your question but certainly as we saw the difference between the fourth quarter when we didn’t have an approved federal budget and that budget has now been signed or is now approved, that should allow everybody participating in that market -- including ourselves -- to have a little more visibility on projects, commitments and programs that are supported by the new budget. I don’t know; I am not also including in there what sort of other stimulus or other things may be considered by whomever in the future here as it relates to the economy. So we will see. But certainly with an approved budget its in a stronger position than it was last year and we do see, really, a clear opportunity to continue to grow our business in the marketplace of public sector, I would say. It is not just the U.S. federal budget but its public sector around the world; NATO, for example, a number of other successes we’ve had in public markets worldwide continue to encourage us. With regard to operating margins, we are not going to put a limit on making money and if we are in a position beyond 25% to continue to bring money to the bottom line and grow operating margins there is no magic in 28% either. But we are also a $2 billion -- actually now I guess I can say three, being that we’ve crossed over the $3 billion run rate this quarter -- so call us a $3 billion company in a $20 billion market. There are a lot of opportunities that I think our growth this year has demonstrated that with investment and discipline and focus and execution and the things that we are committed to continuing there is a pretty significant opportunity to return on those investments by growing our share in markets which we did in literally almost all markets we participate in worldwide across all products. There is going to continue to be contingent for investment in two areas in particular -- research and development and sales and marketing to take that research and development to market but also we are placing no limits on profitability improving. We have a clear target to get 2% or beyond the 25% and we will take an assessment of the situation there and see if we can push that number even higher without compromising the opportunities.
Ehud Gelblum: I am still attempting to ask you who you think will win in November, but I think I have drop it. Thanks.
Scott Kriens: I can’t even narrow it down, Ehud. I can’t even tell if I care, it’s so complicated but we will see. Thanks Ehud.
Operator: Your next question comes from Simon Leopold - Morgan Keegan.
Simon Leopold: First just general housekeeping, I hope I didn’t miss it. Your usual color on the split between core and edge routing?
Scott Kriens: Sure. Did you want to toss another question on the end of that and I’ll just answer both?
Simon Leopold: Sure, the other one is a little bit more philosophical. Giving us the split by segment on the operating margin is very helpful and its good to see the SLT breaking over that zero percent threshold. Now considering the forecast for the Q1 overall operating margin, I wonder if we can get a little bit of color and thought around how the segment operating margins might trend both in Q1 and through the year. Very specifically, do you see SLT dropping back below zero in the first quarter? Thank you.
Scott Kriens: A couple of things. First, core and edge not a big change this quarter and I think what we continue to see in that dynamic that you reference is this is kind of an oscillation. A quarter will push one quarter and then create capacity to be consumed by the edge and so on. We saw, as I mentioned earlier, 50% growth Q4 this year over Q4 last year in the T-series and at same time we saw our MX business double from a $100 million run rate just last quarter to a $200 million run rate 90 days later. So a pretty good competition for the top growth spot going on there between core and edge, which is good. In terms of operating margins and segments, we don’t see SLT slipping from profitability as we go into this first quarter. It won’t make the kind of contributions in the first quarter and probably -- although I guess we will see when we get to the third quarter -- what I’d make is a relative statement which is it won’t make the kind of contributions to the bottom line in the first and third quarters that it is likely to make in the second and fourth quarters. Obviously there could be an event that changes that, but just borrowing from history it is likely that it will be continue to be true. But even as we look into this first quarter, we don’t see SLT slipping below the line, even if you look at product only. Certainly the product and services combination that comes from SLT is profitable, has been profitable and is only going to continue to be more so.
Simon Leopold: So that would imply that that infrastructure and/or services operating margins take a step down? I am assuming it could be hundreds of basis points based on the guidance then?
Scott Kriens: No, not necessarily.
Robyn Denholm: We talked about expenses going up slightly in the first quarter because of the seasonal impact of [FIC] and other employee expenses.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Sue: Scott, when you are watching CNBC or reading the newspaper do you say, “ha! what recession?” Perhaps you can help us understand how your business correlates to the current economic cycle since you do have more enterprise exposure and also any anecdotal comments from your enterprise customers?
Scott Kriens: Mark, lately I make it a point not to watch that stuff because you kind of feel like its people sort of walking around asking when they are going to die. Sooner or later they are going to be right, but boy it’s going to happen a lot faster if you don’t stop talking about it. From our point of view, and here is where I would say something more seriously that I think is something that I think is true is Juniper could be a dangerous place to look for the answer to this question of marketplace and recession and so on for the following reason. In this high performance networking segment, most of what we are doing with customers is what I think they would term pretty strategic and so as they do look across their budgets and if there are pauses or hesitations or consequences from the overall economic condition -- and just for what its worth, I frankly worry more about oil prices than I would about sub-prime write offs -- but anyway, that’s my own opinion. Whatever the cause of the concern is, it is more likely to reduce their spending on commodity technologies than it is strategic IT projects. Most of the things that we are doing in this high performance market segment are pretty darn strategic to our customers. As a result, the reason we might be a poor place to look for leading indicators is there could be more going on than we see and we just won’t be the first ones to find out about it because when we go out and check with our teams and then I go out and talk to customers about the projects we are working on together, these aren’t likely to be the ones that they are concerned about -- first at least. They may be concerned and we are certainly not insulated from market pullbacks and all the rest of that but we probably won’t see it first. Often as a final point, what people originally buy for offensive reasons for deploying new applications and so forth they sometimes are happy they own for defensive reasons because in difficult times the cost savings of network infrastructure can be a reason to deploy it or to be glad that you own it, even though in different days it might have been purchased proactively for offensive reasons to deploy new applications and new services. I am certainly not saying that we are insulated or that we are not paying attention to the economy, but I am not surprised that we don’t see it in the same way that perhaps some of the commodity participants might run into it just a little earlier than we do, if in fact there are seeing it as well; I don’t know.
Mark Sue: Robyn, does that mean we are back to the glory days of beating every quarter by at least 2%?
Scott Kriens: I’ll tell you Mark, we are going to continue to do our best here and we long ago abandoned trying to manage the expectations that are out there so we will just set our own and away we go.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer.
Ittai Kidron: Congratulations on a good quarter. Scott, I am trying to dig a little bit deeper into your infrastructure revenue. You said if we take the MX product out of the picture, you had a pretty flattish business in the rest of your revenue in the infrastructure. Maybe you can comment on that. Also looking into 2008, just assuming that momentum within the MX product continues and within a couple of quarters becomes a $300 million product run rate it implies that your annual guidance you are expecting nothing more than low teens growth in your core infrastructure revenue on a year-over-year basis which just doesn’t make that much sense to me. May be you can realign my thoughts here. What am I missing?
Scott Kriens: Just one clarification, I am glad you asked the question. When you say low teens growth in the infrastructure business meaning that it should be higher or it is not that sustainable? How do you mean?
Ittai Kidron: Yeah. My expectations would be that router market would be growing still closer to the 20% level rather than lower teens. But again, that number excludes the MX. Excluding MX, you are expecting low teens growth in your core infrastructure business.
Scott Kriens: If the MX were to somehow grow as dramatically and the totals didn’t go up then that would mean it would come at the expenses of the other infrastructure products, I see what you mean. First of all, the MX product did well this quarter certainly but so did T-Series and M-Series in the infrastructure line and that allowed us to grow the overall business 24% for the full year and significantly over same quarter last year as well. So I am pretty pleased with that business. Now that it has tipped the $2 billion run rate as a product business alone – and  again that is before services and we have seen from the industry researchers share gains really across the board. No matter which lens you put on those numbers, I feel pretty good about them. The MX itself has certainly been an incredibly rapid ramp in a very short period of time, without even really yet seeing the impact of MX480 which came to the market last quarter but really the MX960, the high end product has produced most of the result so far, which has been out longer to see a business go from zero to $200 million. What it actually, I think is beginning to confirm from what we see, is in fact that rapid acceptance is a function of people being confident in JUNOSe, the operating system and so they take the MX product; it looks, feels, runs and is featured exactly like the infrastructure they already have at the core in the edge before they put the MX in the middle of it and it’s a no brainer to add and move on with a product that now optimizes in this Ethernet segment. So as I said before, I actually don’t think there is going to be a carrier Ethernet segment worth counting when the history is written here. I think there is an operating system competition going on here and JUNOSe is sort of flexing its muscles here with the success it’s demonstrating in the MX. If that continues to be the case, then we should continue to see MX growth but I don’t think it will come at the expense of the rest of the portfolio because when a customer makes an MX decision they are not really making a hardware decision they are making a JUNOSe operating system decision delivered by an optimized piece of hardware called the MX. So if we continue to see the success of our strategy in that regard, I think we will see it affect all of the products and what the mix of that is and what it does to the total it is too early to tell but I don’t think we’ll see really disproportionate contributions here based on the strategy that we have and actually based on what our customers are telling us about why they are buying.
Ittai Kidron: Can you comment on the two products that disappointed you the most in the quarter? Maybe you could give us a little bit more color on the DX product; what happened there and what was the thought process behind exiting that business?
Scott Kriens: In particular with regard to the DX the comment on that, for those who may not know, we are phasing out that product over the next five years. The DX product is going to continue to be sold to customers over the next six months and continue to be supported until 2013. So its hardly disappearing but we are phasing out our development support and commitment to it because of the opportunities we see in the balance of the portfolio and because of the commoditization that we see in that space. When we look at what we’re really trying to do here in the high performance segment, we’re going to continue to focus our development priorities and really it speaks also to our commitment to execution under the standards that we are setting around performance for the portfolio and focus of our resources. To answer your first question maybe in more general terms, what doesn’t grow as quickly are standalone appliances in the SLT business; that’s not true in every quarter and in all cases but as a rule, when we look at the success of things like SSG or ISG products, products that are integrated security and routing the integrated firewalls and intrusion detection and things like that, those are the products -- really what they become are solutions -- that contribute to the growth and in some cases the standalone products are what our costumers are moving from as they move to the integrated solutions, making a lesser contribution as a result in the integrated portfolio.
Kathleen Bela: Operator, that is all the time we have today so we are going to conclude the call at this point. We would like to thank everyone for joining us and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thank you.

With that, I will turn the call over to Scott.
Scott G. Kriens: Thank you, Kathleen. Now we’ll take questions. Done. Thankyou, Kathleen, and welcome to the team as well, and welcome to all of you whoare joining us this afternoon. Today, I’ll provide my view of what we are seeing in theindustry and then also cover some specifics relative to what drove Juniper'sperformance this quarter, after which Robyn will take us through the numbers. It’s clear that our decision to focus on building the highperformance networks that fuel high performance businesses that we talk aboutso much is being understood in the marketplace. We’ve seen steady demand acrossthe markets we serve, as our customers continue to evolve their networkinfrastructure to support global applications and increase network and serviceexperience expectations. With book-to-bill greater than one and total revenue forquarter of $735 million, which is up 28% from last year, we delivered solidresults across a wide range of metrics and we’re pleased with the momentum thisdemonstrates for our business and our strategy. Revenue, gross margins, operating margins, cash flow and earningswere all strong and exceeded our guidance. In addition, our product andassociated solution story continues to gain traction with several new customersaround the world. Importantly, we’ve announced the appointment of three newmembers of our executive leadership team in the last few months. So with all that said and even with these results and thepositive momentum that they represent for us, it is also true that we stillhave a lot of work to do, as I’ve said before, and that remains our focus. As I look around the world to where we do business, we hadstrength in all geographies compared to a year ago, and importantly we’reseeing validation in the comprehensive solution sale with customers around theworld purchasing bundled solutions to meet their high performance requirements. We saw excellent growth in the Americas, which was up 40%from Q3 of last year, which reflects our focus on service providers, contentand cable providers, as well as major enterprises. And a couple of examples ofthe solutions: Radiant Communications, who supply broadband solutions forbusiness in Canada, deployed M and E-series, SSG and SSL high performanceinfrastructure for a new triple play offering; and Highway, who is one of thelargest privately held ISPs in the Southeast, deployed M and J-series routersto expand their own network and will deploy the J-series and SSG products aspart of their managed network services. And as an important market segment, I am also pleased toreport that U.S. Federal had a strong quarter, with growth of over 15% from theyear-ago period. Business in EMEA was good as well, with growth of 23% from ayear ago. Continued strong business with major PTTs like British Telecom, aswell as alternate service providers and measurable regional and customerdiversification. Turk Telecom deployed the T-series to accelerate delivery ofnew services. Netia, who is a Polish service provider, deployed the E-series toexpand broadband service offerings, and we also saw a strong growth in theenterprise and with our SLT products in the financial services marketplace. For example, JS Investments, a private asset managementcompany in Pakistan, deployed our routing, security, and applicationacceleration solutions to build out their high performance IPMPLS network. And APAC, or Asia-Pacific, was also up, with 13% growth froma year ago. Here we continue to see core network TX build-outs and a greatinterest in the new T1600 from service providers, as well as expansion into thetier two telco markets. We’re providing a greater focus on the enterprise insmaller regions where there’s large opportunity and our major account focus ispaying off as the value and number of enterprise projects increase. In addition, the SSG product family is become well-establishedwith customers such as Kyobo Realco, who is a Korean real estate managementfirm, who deployed the SSG in conjunction with our firewalls to secure linksbetween its head office in Seoul and more than 70 branches nationwide. In all of the geographies, our growth is supported by ourstrong partner ecosystem. NSN remained above 10% of total revenue and wecontinue to have a positive and productive outlook together as we partner withmany customers around the world, and both Ericsson and Alcatel-Lucent continuedto perform well and both partners increased their revenue contribution thisquarter compared to last quarter. NEC, along with a number of regionalpartners, made significant contributions as well. On the enterprise side, we continue to see solid performancefrom our many valued resellers, as well as an increasing contribution frommanaged service offerings like Verizon Businesses selection of our WX platformas a foundation of their new managed, wide area network optimization service,which is used to help distributed enterprises accelerate application deliveryover the wide area and leverage their existing investments and improvedproductivity. So now, moving from geographies to markets, and first to theservice provider market, I would like to make a few comments about what we areseeing in the market itself and then provide some more specific detailsregarding Juniper's growing opportunity here. So first, architecturally, we’re seeing the continuingmovement of our service provider customers to converge next generation networkswith both IP and ethernet as important elements. And increasingly, there’s acommon vision that a simplified and scalable service aware infrastructure is afundamental requirement. A network infrastructure that can scale to supportmultiple virtual services for multiple customers across the entire variety ofaccess technologies, from fiber and copper to coaxial cable and radio waves,and can offer users the experience they expect as they travel between theirhomes, offices, and mobile locations. Service providers are also feeling competitive pressures, asservices converge and challenges surface about how best to monetize thephysical connections and the longstanding relationships they have with theircustomers. They are evaluating their business models and looking at ways tocost effectively and rapidly deliver new, experience-based services thecustomers are increasingly demanding. Richer service offerings like video, both unicast andmulticast, peer-to-peer, as well as web 2.0 traffic, are placing increasingperformance demands on the network infrastructure. And finally, we are seeing increased interest on the part ofboth service providers and their customers in managed services, turning more ofthe responsibility for service levels and associated attributes like securityover to their providers in the form of service level agreements or SLAs. And these trends are driving both core and edge growth in avery symbiotic way, and the requirements for an underlying high-performancenetwork infrastructure are becoming clearer, and therefore the Juniper solutionand the differentiation we provide is becoming more apparent than ever to themarketplace and to customers. In order to leverage these opportunities, we first must continueour focus on innovation. And so on that front, during the quarter we expandedour carrier ethernet family with the additions of the MX240 and MX480, as wellas significant enhancements to the MX960 and the JUNOS network operatingsystem, which runs across the entire routing portfolio. With this expansion and the carrier ethernet marketopportunity projected to nearly double from $3.7 billion this year to $6.8billion by 2011, according to IDC, we are very well-positioned to capturesignificant customer mind and wallet share in this space. We’ve been gaining excellent traction with our customers andI am pleased to say that with this quarter’s MX960 sales, we are now at a $100million annual run-rate after only two full quarters of product shipments -- aclear validation that Juniper's integrated ethernet strategy is well alignedwith the requirements of our customers. And as also remains true, growth at the edge of the networkresults in increased needs at the core of the network, which drove our T seriesrevenue up over 60% year over year, and here again we’re well-positioned withthe recent announcement of the T1600. Most recently, the T1600 earned anInfoVision award in the network core innovations category at the BroadbandWorld Forum in Europe, which took place in Berlin a couple of weeks ago. Andmore importantly, BELNET, a part of the Belgacom Group, has already announcedtheir plans to build their next generation research network with the T1600 atthe core and M-series at the edge. And as service providers begin to demand greater operationalefficiencies from the network infrastructure, we are well-positioned with theT1600 there also, in that it consumes 30% less power, requires 30% lesscooling, takes up half the physical space, with twice the density of competingplatforms. And the T1600 also follows our commitment of reusing hardware andline cards whenever possible to protect our customer’s investment and thecombination is being very well-received in the early feedback from our customers. On a related note, this example of energy savings is one ofthe fundamental elements of our ongoing commitment to the environment and weare making significant strides in improving the energy efficiency of each keyelement in our high-performance network offerings. We recently announced our sponsorship and continuedparticipation in the carbon disclosure project, which is a global, standardizedmechanism by which companies report their greenhouse gas emissions toinstitutional investors on an annual basis. We are very pleased with ourprogress on this front and this will continue to be a focus area across allaspects of our business. And finally in the service provider marketplace, ourinvestment in JUNOS, our operating system, remains a major differentiator andfurther strategic investments in JUNOS will be uninterrupted, expressly at thedemand of our customers as they fully realize the value and benefit of a singlenetwork operating system. Overall, we are pleased with the momentum in the serviceprovider market. As with today’s results, we’ve realized a 33% year-over-yeargrowth, as we sell both our infrastructure and security solutions to wireline,wireless, cable and content service providers. I would like to now make a few comments about the enterprisemarket and the trends we are seeing there. First, the network is becoming aplatform for business speed, innovation, and growth, and a growing dependenceon network business models across industries is changing the role of thenetwork from plumbing to competitive weapon. As companies accelerate the paceat which they will rollout new applications, driven by the service-orientedarchitectures, or SOA, and the web 2.0 trends, their underlying networkinfrastructure must keep pace with the increasing demands of these services. Secondly, enterprises are also focused on reducing operatingexpenses, or op-ex, in order to maintain margins and accommodate growthinitiatives and fuel innovation. With consolidation and virtualization projectsunderway, enterprises will continue to look for scalable solutions that offerefficient resource utilization. Minimizing exposure to risk is also a parallel businessmandate. The increasing reliance of network resources, coupled with aconstantly evolving threat landscape has made managing and mitigating IT riskand maintaining network and resource availability a high priority. For examples of these trends in action as it relates toJuniper, we are very pleased with our high performance networking initiativesin the enterprise, reflected by year-over-year growth of 18%, which includesrouting, security, and application acceleration, and I’ll share some detailsbehind these results. Sharekhan, which is one of India’s top five securitiestrading firms, boosted the performance, the security, and scale of their stocktrading website by deploying our DX load balancing and application accelerationplatforms. And with a market share of 25% in high-end enterprise routing,according to Synergy Research, we enjoy a very competitive position in thesemarkets. A large portion of our service layer technology solutionssold into the enterprise, as we’ve talked about before, are related to ourintegrated solutions. For example, the SSG family showed significant growth ofover 20% quarter over quarter. In addition, we saw good growth in J-series as well as inapplication acceleration, including DX and WX. And earlier, I mentioned therecent win for Verizon’s managed WAN, or wide area network, optimizationservice, which incorporates and shows some momentum with the WX solution, aswell as İGDAŞ, which is Istanbul’sleading natural gas distribution company, who’ve deployed J-series and M-seriesrouters in the upgrade of their wide area network infrastructure. Finally, while we see progress and growth in SLT, thisremains, which is our service layer technologies, this remains an area offocus, where there is work to be done to move towards profitability in thenear-term. We believe our investments in sales and marketing specificallytargeted to increase productivity as well as our development efforts to providemore and more integrated products will enhance our market position in thecoming quarters, and we continue to target profitability for the fourth quarterof this year, based in part on once again seeing the seasonal fourth quarterstrength, which has materialized in prior years. And on the services business, as in previous quarters, wealso saw healthy year-over-year growth, over 20%, from our services business,which is in support of both our service provider and enterprise customers, andour perseverance and our persistence on superior customer satisfaction earns usnew opportunities as an important complement to our product portfolio and ourpartnering strategy. And we will continue to invest here to maintain and improveour reputation as a high quality supplier of critical networking capability. Finally, I would like to comment briefly on the leadershipand the talent development we are building here at Juniper. We are committed,as we have said, to investing in and deepening the bench strength of theexecutive leadership team here to drive us through the next phase of growth andvalue creation. I am pleased to welcome three new executives with strongtrack records of success to key roles within Juniper. The first is MarkBauhaus, who joins us from a 20-year career at Sun Microsystems, where he ledthe company’s key SOA software initiative. And Mark joins us as General Managerof our service layer technologies, or SLT Group, and will have responsibilityfor leadership of the SLT business group, including its overall strategy,product and solution development, revenue growth, and profitability. Secondly, we welcome Penny Wilson, our new Chief MarketingOfficer, who will be responsible for the company’s global marketinginitiatives. Penny joins us from Macromedia and before that, Alias|Wavefrontand Merrill Lynch, and will also be a key member of our executive team withaccountability for creating and implementing comprehensive marketing planscovering all industries, applications, solutions, and services. And in just a moment, you’ll be hearing from our new ChiefFinancial Officer, Robyn Denholm, and Robyn’s background and experience areexactly in alignment with what we’re looking for in a CFO -- strong businessand financial acumen, global experience, exceptional leadership skills to builda world-class organization, and cultural fit, someone who shares values andfits well with our company and its culture and our existing team. Robyn joinsus from Sun Microsystems, where she served as Senior Vice President, CorporateStrategic Planning, and before that in several capacities, including ChiefAccounting Officer for the company. Many of you know that our search for our new CFO has been conductedover several months, and this is a testament to the strength of our existingfinancial team, which has been very helpful, both in the work they’ve done inthe interim and in affording me the luxury of looking beyond the financialexperience that’s obviously required in the role to find someone who will be akey executive in the leadership of the overall success of Juniper across thecompany and the market. So these leaders bring the right combination of capabilitiesand experience that will be essential as we scale the company to meet themarket opportunities ahead and many of you will be meeting with them in thecoming months. So in summary, as I look across both the marketplace andwithin Juniper, it’s simple, actually. There’s opportunity and Juniper hasmomentum, a strong combination. The market is in need of higher and higherperformance networks because when we look across the high performancenetworking opportunities of the enterprise market, more and more businessescorrelate their business performance to the performance of their networks. Andin the consumer and service provider side of the market, more than ever it’sthe network performance that determines the entertainment experience and theinformation delivered in a timely manner to subscribers. And in this use of the term high performance, we mean morethan just speed and capacity, because in addition to being fast, the networkmust be exceedingly reliable, services must be intelligently managed, and thewhole network must be secure. And on these requirements, there can be nocompromises allowed in serving one need at the expense of the other. These nocompromises principles are the fundamentals on which we’ve built ourtechnologies and our entire company to deliver since our first days. Within the company, our team is stronger than it’s everbeen. I mentioned earlier several key new additions we’ve made to the executiveranks and behind that and behind those new executives, they are joining teamsthroughout the company that have demonstrated exemplary commitment andaccomplishments in all aspects of our business objectives. So when you add it all up, our strategy, our products, andour focus both inside of Juniper and across our markets, we’re seeing a trendtowards the financial metrics we expect, both on the top and the bottom line. All of this is possible only with the support of ouremployees, whose continued commitment and incredible efforts make these resultspossible, as well as our many partners, our customers, our suppliers, and ourlong-term shareholders, and I would like to thank all of you for your continuedsupport and confidence in Juniper. So with that, I would like to once again welcome Robyn andturn the call over to her. Robyn.
Robyn M. Denholm: Thank you, Scott. I am very pleased to be here at Juniperand look forward to meeting many of you on the call in the upcoming weeks andmonths. Over the last 60 days or so, I’ve been focused on learning the businessand understanding the levers that drive the top line and the operatingefficiency of the company, and I’m pleased with what I’ve found. My near-term focus is to support a strong finish to thecurrent year and together with Scott and Stephen, finalize the businessplanning for FY08, to ensure that we are measuring and driving the elements ofthe business that will enable us to fully realize the significant opportunitieswe have before us. For today, I’ll review the components of the P&L and thebalance sheet and provide the guidance for the December quarter. I will firstpresent all results on a GAAP basis and for purposes of today’s discussion, Iwill also review non-GAAP results. For important commentary on why themanagement team considers non-GAAP information a useful view of the company’sfinancial results, please consult our filings with the SEC. For the detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAPresults, please see today’s press release. In general, non-GAAP results exclude certain non-recurringcharges, such as amortization of purchased intangibles, impairment charges, andexpenses related to stock-based compensation. Turning to the highlights of the P&L, revenue was $735million, up 10.5% from the June quarter and up 28.2% compared to the prior yearperiod. This reflects solid customer demand for Juniper products and services,particularly within the infrastructure market segment. GAAP gross margin was 68.4%, up from 66.8% in the Junequarter and up from 66.8% for the prior year period. GAAP operating expenseswere $390 million, up from $325.6 million from the prior year period. R&D was $167.9 million, which was up from $123.4 millionin the prior year period. Sales and marketing was $177.8 million, compared to $139.4million in the prior year period. G&A was $29.2 million compared to $24.5 million in theprior year period. GAAP net income was $85.1 million compared to $58.3 millionin the September quarter of 2006. GAAP earnings per share on a diluted basiswere $0.15, compared to $0.10 for the September quarter of 2006. Non-GAAP grossmargin was 69%, up from 67.4% in the June 2007 quarter, and up from 67.7% fromthe prior year period. The increase in both periods is primarily due to thefavorable product mix and, to a lesser extent, lower manufacturing costs. Non-GAAP operating expense rose to $352.1 million, or 47.9%of revenue, up from $312.9 million, or 47.1% of revenue from the June quarter,and up from $266.4 million, or 46.4% of revenue from the prior year period. R&D was $157.5 million, or 21.4% of revenue, which wasup from the June quarter and up from $114 million, or 19.9% of revenue in thesame period in 2006. The increase is due to the continuing investment in ourexpanding product portfolio. Sales and marketing was $168.6 million, or 22.9% of revenue,also up from last quarter due to increased sales headcount and associatedcosts, and up from $131.2 million, or 22.9% of revenue in the same period of2006. G&A was $26 million, or 3.5% of revenue, up slightlyfrom last quarter due to increases in headcount and IT costs, and up from $21.2million, or 3.7% of revenue in the same period of 2006. Non-GAAP operating income was $154.9 million, or 21.1% ofrevenue, compared to $135.6 million, or 20.4% in the prior quarter, andcompared to $121.8 million, or 21.2% from the Q3 2006 quarter. While we are pleased with the recent improvement in ouroperating income performance, there is still much work to be done to achieveour long-term goal of 25% operating margins. Non-GAAP net interest and other income at $17.9 million waslower in the September quarter as compared to the prior quarter, and to Q306,primarily due to a lower average cash balance in the quarter as a result of theshare repurchase activity in the June quarter. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 28%. On a non-GAAP basis, EPS was $0.22, using approximately 561million fully diluted shares. This share count is higher than we anticipated inthe end of the June quarter due to a higher share price in September and theresulting dilutive impact of outstanding stock options. The share count alone negatively impacted EPS byapproximately $0.01 on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. Highlights of the balance sheet include: cash and cashequivalents and short and long-term investments of $1.75 billion was up $376.3million over the prior quarter cash balance of $1.38 billion, primarily as aresult of strong cash flows from operation and proceeds from the exercise ofstock options. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $193.2million, compared to $204 million in the June quarter. Cash flow is downslightly due to a combination of increase in accounts receivable due to thegrowth in the business, offset by the increase in deferred revenue and otheraccrued liabilities. Year-to-date, the company has generated a healthy $549.9million in cash from operations. DSO was 34 days, down from 35 days in the prior quarter. Thecontinued improvement in our DSO reflects strong underlying financials,including the shipment linearity. Going forward, we expect our DSO to rangebetween 35 and 45 days, depending on the mix of partners and shipmentlinearity, a slight modification of our previous target of 40 to 45 days. Deferred revenue was $453.3 million, compared to $450.7million in the June quarter. CapEx was $35.9 million for the quarter, down from $42.7million from the June 2007 quarter, and up from $26.4 million in the prior yearperiod. Depreciation was $26.5 million in the quarter and $19.7million in the same period last year. The increase from the prior year isprimarily related to lease hold facility expansion. Total headcount for the quarter was 5,661, up 226 employeesfrom last quarter, with most new hires in the R&D, sales, and customerservice organization. Now I’ll provide a little bit more color on the business.The total company book-to-bill was above 1 in the quarter, and we recognized revenue on 2,931infrastructure units this quarter, up from 2,458 in the prior quarter. Weshipped 61,728 infrastructure ports, up from 51,824 in the prior quarter. Revenue from our direct sales efforts was 28% of totalrevenue and sales through partners was 72%. NSN generated approximately 11.5%of total [orders] during the quarter, and was the only customer above 10% ofrevenue in the quarter. A geographical breakout; the Americas represented 47% oftotal revenue, up from 43% a year ago, with strength in the U.S. serviceprovider and federal businesses, and in Canada; EMEA accounted for 33% versus34% a year ago, and we saw strength in a broad range of countries, includingBelgium, Switzerland, and Turkey; and in the Asia-Pacific region, whichrepresented 20% of revenue, there was particular strength in India andMalaysia. Turning to products, for the infrastructure products,revenue was $464.7 million, up 34.5% from the prior year period. This growthwas driven primarily by strength in the T series core routers, as serviceproviders continued to build out their core and next generation networks tosupport increasing bandwidth requirements associated with the high bandwidthapplications, such as video. This quarter, the core represented more than half of ourinfrastructure business. We expect to see this mix fluctuate between core andedge, as it has in prior quarters. The healthy mix of T-series products and the growth inM-series, both of which were richly configured, result in very strong grossmargins in our infrastructure business this quarter. For service layer technology products, revenue was $142.1million, up 16.8% from the prior year period. On the subject of our continuingfocus of SLT profitability, we saw a larger operating loss than we hadoriginally anticipated in Q3. This was primarily due to the sequential revenuegrowth being less than we had planned and also due to both direct expenses andcorporate expense allocations being higher than planned. However, as Scott referenced in his comments earlier, we arestill targeting for SLT profitability in Q4. Total services revenue was $128.3 million, up 20.6% from theprior year period. GAAP service margin of 50.0% was down from the 53.5%reported in the same period last year, and down slightly from the 50.6%reported in the June quarter, both of which is attributed to the increase inheadcount throughout the quarter to support the growth in the business. Now turning to the December quarter guidance, guidance isprovided on a non-GAAP basis. All guidance is forward-looking statements andactual results may vary for a number of reasons, including those noted earlierby Kathleen and those discussed in our recent 10-Q as filed with the SEC. AGAAP EPS target is not reasonably accessible on a forward-looking basis due tothe high variability and low visibility with respect to the non-recurringcharges, which are typically excluded from the non-GAAP EPS estimates. For the December 2007 quarter, we are increasing ourguidance. Total revenues are expected to be in the range of $770 million to$790 million, increasing our forecast range for the full year to between $2.79billion to $2.81 billion. Gross margins are expected to be down sequentially off astrong September quarter. Operating expenses will be higher sequentially, butwe expect them to increase at a slower rate than revenue growth and thereforeoverall, we expect steady improvement on operating margins compared to theSeptember quarter levels. Other income and expense is expected to be approximately $20million for the December quarter. We expect an estimated non-GAAP tax rate of28% and a share count of 565 million. We are increasing our guidance for EPS on a non-GAAP basisfor the December quarter to $0.24 and we are also increasing our full yearnon-GAAP EPS guidance to a range of $0.84 to $0.85. With that, I will turn the call over to the Operator for thequestion-and-answer session. Operator.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from theline of Nikos Theodosopoulos from UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Nikos Theodosopoulos- UBS: Thank you. Can you talk about -- I guess the question I hadwas going into the quarter, you had guided gross margins down and they wereactually up quite strongly, so the mix probably was a lot different than youthought. Can you talk about why you think that happened? And secondarily, if you could just make a quick comment onthe short-term deferred revenue. It was only up $3 million. Can you talk aboutwhat transpired there? Thank you.
Robyn M. Denholm: I’ll start to answer those questions and maybe Scott willjump in. So on the gross margin, the mix, there were two things that actuallypositively impacted the gross margin in the quarter. The first was the productmix, as you mentioned, both the T and the M-series product mix in the quarterwere higher than we were anticipating. The other part is the configuration ofthe products that we sold in the quarter. They were much richer configurationsthan we were anticipating. The proportion, what we call [picks] versus[chassis] was much higher than we’d seen in recent quarters, as well as in ourplanning for the current quarter. So that’s on the gross margin question. The second question on deferred revenue, we saw an increasein the services deferred revenue amount basically due to seasonal trends, andthen a slight reduction in the -- a very slight reduction in the productdeferred revenue.
Scott G. Kriens: The only comment I would add to that is just that we’ve seennot only the mix change but also within that, as pick counts go up, moreinterface cards -- the other thing that’s driving this a bit I think is higherspeed requirements and higher performance on a per-port basis. Customers arecontinuing to drive greater capacities through each of the ports, as well asthe total.
Nikos Theodosopoulos- UBS: So your sense was that the carriers or your customersprobably saw a need for a higher port count and that wasn’t anticipated? Isthat basically what happened in the quarter?
Scott G. Kriens: Some of it is port count but some of it is also speed perport, and those are higher margin interfaces than the lower speed ports. Also,I’d expand the observation to include what we see it the high performanceenterprise segment for key financial services, public sector and the like,where I think there we are also seeing the drive to looking for higher speed,higher performance.
Nikos Theodosopoulos- UBS: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ehud Gelblum fromJ.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.
Ehud Gelblum - J.P.Morgan: Thanks very much, guys. Did you mention -- you said that theSLT margin came down. Did you -- actually, could you give us a sense as to howfar it came down and where it is this quarter? I guess it will come out in theQ. It probably is out already. I just wanted to see this number, if you couldhelp us out there with there. Also, if you look at Nokia Siemens, I think it was 18% ofrevenues last quarter. I understand that was obviously out of proportion.Usually it is in the 12% to 15% range. It’s down to 11.5% right now. Can youhelp correlate the decline in the Nokia Siemens from the high point priorquarter and in prior quarters to where it is now, with the fact that youactually were strong in T and M-series? Does that kind of indicate perhaps thatNokia Siemens doesn’t sell as many T and M-series routers? I know they have ahistory of obviously being bigger in the E-series, but if you could just helpkind of put those two things together. Should that be a correlation we shouldbe looking for going forward in how that impacts gross margin?
Robyn M. Denholm: I’ll answer the first part of that question and then I thinkStephen will tackle the second part. So if I look at the SLT business, in the quarter theoperating loss was slightly higher than we were anticipating and that was aresult of two things; the revenue was, even though it was year over year, therewas growth in that business of just under 17%, it wasn’t as high as we wereplanning, so the expenses were higher than we were planning, so that’s whatdrove the loss in the quarter, from a total operating income perspective, oroperating loss perspective. We didn’t comment on the gross margin of SLT. We’ll do thatin the quarter. We’re just finalizing the segment reporting for our SLT and IPGbusiness.
Ehud Gelblum - J.P.Morgan: But in the operating margin itself for SLT, could you giveus a sense as to where that is now?
Robyn M. Denholm: It’s only small -- it’s -- do you mean in terms of millionsof dollars?
Ehud Gelblum - J.P.Morgan: Either one -- percentage or millions of dollars, whicheveryou feel comfortable with.
Robyn M. Denholm: I’d rather wait until we finalize the Q for that.
Stephen A. Elop: With respect to Nokia Siemens and T and M-class, no, I don’tthink there is any correlation you should draw between product mix and therespective large scale partners that we have for the service provider market. As we look at the details behind both what happened thisquarter with NSN and also with Ericsson and Alcatel-Lucent, it’s very muchrelated to the specifics of individual customer deployments and where they happento be in the cycle, so there is not an immediate correlation. I think it justrepresents the lumpiness of these classes of deals.
Ehud Gelblum - J.P.Morgan: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani withMerrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
Tal Liani - MerrillLynch: Thank you. I have two questions on SLT. The first one is ongrowth rates. You grew 15% sequentially, more than 15% in infrastructure, andabout 2.5% in SLT. What needs to happen in SLT for the growth rate toaccelerate? In infrastructure, we’ve seen that the growth was very productcycle kind of driven. Is it the same thing in SLT or is it only time and othertypes of effort? So that’s the first question. The second question is about the margin level. So if SLTmargins were down, or profits and margins were down slightly sequentially, thenit means that the entire improvement is coming from the infrastructurebusiness. So if last quarter you disclosed that you had in the neighborhood of27% operating margin on infrastructure, this quarter, just guessing, I cancalculate it, but probably 29%. How high could it go? Could it go all the wayup to 35% that you had many years ago, or is it a different environment now?Thanks.
Stephen A. Elop: I’ll tackle the first question with respect to SLT in termsof how to drive acceleration in the growth rate and whether it’s, if you like,like the IPG business and product cycle specific. I think there’s a broad product cycle point here that needsto be made, and that is what we are seeing within broadly the enterprisebusiness, not just SLTs, to the degree that we deliver integrated products thatare components of solutions, we see growth rates there at much higher levels.So whereas there’s a number of point products out there amongst ourcompetitors, whereas we have some of those, what we are seeing is the actualintegrated products, like the SSG product line, for example, are growing athigher rates. So clearly it’s part of our strategy to continue to drive integrationof capabilities across the enterprise products, as well as leveraging thestrength of the common operating platform, JUNOS. That’s very much a keyelement of our strategy. So as high performance businesses increasingly demand, forexample, high performance routers, security devices and so forth and want todrive towards lower op-ex, they are going to be looking for that commonoperating platform and that integration both in operating platform and incapability will be a major driver in growth. So I think it’s less specific than a product cycle toproduct cycle thing and more about the longer term aspirations of integratingthose things overall.
Scott G. Kriens: On your second question around what we see for growth in theenterprise market, a couple of comments; one, there is clearly more seasonalpatterns in the enterprise business as opposed to your point, which I’d agreewith, is that product cycles and build cycles tend to be driven by themarketplace and by demand, which isn’t automatically -- we haven’t seen it benearly so seasonal as enterprise, so if you look across service provider andthe large infrastructure builds, they tend to be driven more by the strategiesof the individual operator and then participation of Juniper in those tends tobe driven more by product cycle appropriateness. On the enterprise side, there’s more seasonality in this. Wedid see, as you mention, almost 17% growth in the year-over-year numbers. Andwe see -- one of the reasons we give the outlook for profitability for SLT inQ4 is that we see a much better opportunity for that -- for this quarter thatwe are now in to demonstrate that seasonality on the plus side. In terms of margins and contributions, it’s a little bithard to draw the distinction as purely because the services business representsmargin contribution across all sectors, for example, and SLT products get soldinto the service provider market, as well as IPG products being sold into theenterprise market. So we tend to look at more the business in those ways,because when we go to sell something to an enterprise customer, it’s not purelyan SLT or security solution. If you did try and break it out the way that some of thenumbers would suggest, and to your specific question, can we get higher marginsout of the infrastructure product business, it’s possible but I don’t think themargins on either side of this -- I think we’ll see more of a redistribution ofthis. I don’t think that the service provider margins -- we’ve seen a whole lotof change one way or the other and anything we have seen is kind of lumpy ordriven by individual situations more than it is any particular major statementof a trend across the whole marketplace. I think we’ll see the margins there be pretty constant. [Itmight be] minus again on any given quarter.
Kathleen Bela: Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Evanson from SanfordBernstein. Please proceed with your question.
Jeff Evanson -Sanford C. Bernstein: Revenue was up quite a bit more than the top end of yourguidance range, yet overall expenses grew faster than revenue, and I’m justwondering -- what was the thought process behind increasing them that fast andhow we should expect you to make those decisions going forward?
Stephen A. Elop: The primary decision point behind that is respecting thetension that we naturally have within the business between trying to invest asmuch as we can, quite frankly, to take advantage of the opportunities that wehave against the need to deliver the financial results and the trends thatwe’re looking for. So as we move through the quarters and years and so forthand see opportunities to make investments and take advantage of particularsituations, then we will move to do so while respecting the targets that we’retrying to deliver against.
Scott G. Kriens: I would just add to that by saying it’s kind of a -- we’retrying to serve many masters here. Clearly improving operating margins andfinancial results on the bottom line is a priority and we’ve said that anditerated our continuing guidance here with regard to improving those operatingmargins, but there is a tremendous amount of opportunity surrounding us. Andso, while we have our priorities in clear order, and Stephen iterated those,Robyn talked about those earlier, it is still going to be our focus here ontrying to serve other masters, including customers, who are driving continuedinnovation and see the potential of what we’ve delivered to date and continueto pound the table for more. So it is not going to let us confuse our priorities but weare going to do our best to serve everybody here.
Jeff Evanson -Sanford C. Bernstein: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Coleman fromMorgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Scott Coleman -Morgan Stanley: Thank you. Just one clarification and a question; did I hearcorrectly that you said SSG was up 20% sequentially?
Robyn M. Denholm: Yes, it is. That’s right.
Scott Coleman -Morgan Stanley: Can you just give us an idea of what portion generally SSGis of the SLT business at this point?
Robyn M. Denholm: No, we won’t give that qualification now. Thanks.
Scott Coleman -Morgan Stanley: Okay, I understand. Maybe a question, if I could; so clearthat SLT and enterprise in general came in a little bit lighter than expected.I’m wondering, and that’s within the context of a good federal quarter as well,I’m wondering if, from a macro perspective, if you saw some of your largeenterprise customers pull back on spending as you went through the quarter, ina reaction to whether it was the credit crunch or volatility in the stockmarket. And if that is the case, if you’ve started to see them come back andspend yet.
Stephen A. Elop: So from that macro perspective and having spent a lot oftime out there with customers, I think customers are in an environment wherethey are looking at every purchase very carefully and judiciously and so forth,but I would not characterize a pull-back situation in reaction to specificevents. I think the reason for that is the customers on whom we aretrying to increasingly focus are those that are really driving on highperformance business as a function of their high performance networkingrequirements. And in those cases, it is not about okay, seasonally is this theright time to buy a router or a security device or whatever -- it’s criticalfor them. It’s a part of their business and therefore, they are going to haveto make those purchases regardless of a particular event externally. I can’t say that we saw that in any particular circumstanceas it relates to the patterns in the enterprise business.
Scott Coleman -Morgan Stanley: Makes sense, but why do you think SLT came in lighter thanexpected then? Do you not have the right products? Something obviously came inlight of your expectations. I’m just trying to figure out why.
Stephen A. Elop: To put it in context, overall we grew the enterprisebusiness by 18%, the SLT component by 17%, roughly, and so overall we see veryhealthy growth and we see that growth continuing and expanding as we go into aseasonally strong quarter. As we took a close look at the specific results andsituations and so forth, it really came down to some seasonality factors insome areas, some lumpiness of deals and so forth, and also in overall context,in terms of what we were expecting versus what was actually delivered, it was avery small difference. That was not a huge thing or anything, somethingmeasured in millions of dollars. So we don’t want to put too much of an edge onthat but give you some sense that it wasn’t a dramatic shortfall. It wassomething that was just a bit shorter than what we would have liked to haveseen, but again, reiterating we’re feeling that we’re heading into a strong,seasonally strong Q4 in that business.
Scott Coleman -Morgan Stanley: Appreciate the color, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brant Thompson withGoldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Brant Thompson - GoldmanSachs: I was wondering if you could give an update on the businessspecifically in Japan and what you expect to see there with regard to a timingof the resumption of some of that demand. I don’t know if you can break thatout with regard to what percentage of sales it had run in in the quarter.Thanks.
Stephen A. Elop: We don’t break out percentage of sales on a country basis,but there was no substantial shift or change in mix at that level that’s worthnoting. I think part of your question is specifically what’s happening at NTT.Obviously we have to let the customers comment on the timing of theirdeployments and activities, but we are very confident that our relationships,based on a lot of historical success with NTT and the ongoing maintenance anddevelopment of relationships, that we are very well-positioned to participatethere as that deployment picks up steam.
Brant Thompson -Goldman Sachs: And then, if I could have a quick follow-up, following onsome of the other question with regard to the overall operating margin of thecompany and the timing of dealing with that balance of investing but stillpursuing growth, when you talk about a long-term target of 25%, is that thefull extent that you think the business model can achieve or is that ultimatelya milestone and you think that you can go over it? I’m just trying tounderstand how we should think about that, given that you are demonstrating anability to show gross margins as high as 70% at some point, and a lot of thecompanies in the industry that are able to do that are also able to produceoperating margins that are north of 25%. So if you could provide any kind ofcolor with regard to -- you know, so we think a couple years out. Thanks.
Scott G. Kriens: It is still a hardware business, so I think as we guided alittle bit this quarter, the margins we saw in Q3 I think were a bit of anunusual mix, really. It’s not that we expect them to move around dramaticallyhere, but I wouldn’t expect us to be enjoying margins higher than those that wesaw this quarter. That said, there’s opportunities to improve the business andboth Stephen, Robyn, and all of us are working on that in terms of sharpeningthe execution and the productivity that goes with it around here. The focus we have here is, as I take your question in thecontext of full time horizons, in the immediate term, continued, sustainedimprovement of operating margins, as we’ve shown in the last several quartersis a trajectory that we are committed to. And obviously that depends on beingable to produce the top line that makes that possible, but I’m assuming that wecan deliver on the kind of opportunities that we see out there, then continuedsustained improvement in the operating margins in the short-term is a, I cantell you, a very focused goal around here. In the mid-term, having that march continue to 25% is also apart of the plan, and we’ve been explicit about that and nothing has changed. Ithink once we approach that range and as we have it in site and we see whatkind of a mix of products and what kind of a market we’re in, we’ll make somejudgments about whether and if so, how fast we could look at improvementsbeyond that. But it is important I think in goal setting for us insidethe business as well as to try and give you some color on how we want to runthis business, to set an objective that is beyond the reach of the next 90 daysand that’s the purpose of the 25 target. But also in every 90 day increment tomarch uninterrupted towards that. I think as we start to see the operating margins approachthose ranges, then we will take a look and share with you our thinking aboutwhether we see ourselves being able to climb further beyond that and how thatmight trade off against investments and what have you. The only other comment I’d make about this is one of thethings also very important to us is cash, and we generated over $0.5 billion ofcash in the first nine months here of the business and almost $200 million incash in the last quarter, so along with these metrics that are very importanton a percentage basis, continuing to see solid performance in DSOs, a solidperformance in generating the kind of cash this business is capable of, thoseare also going to be drivers that are not going to be compromised.
Brant Thompson -Goldman Sachs: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ken Muth withRobert Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Ken Muth - Robert W.Baird: The core routing business seemed to have just a greatquarter here and it probably looks like it is accelerating to over 40% yearover year, thereabouts. Could you just give us some insight -- is that beingdriven by new customers, existing customers, cable markets, or any sort ofvisibility there?
Scott G. Kriens: Stephen may have a comment here as well. It’s more bydefinition. It’s largely existing customers because we own the top -- we haverelationships with all the top 40 service providers in the market, so for somedefinition of existing, it will be primarily existing business at the very highend here. That said, it’s an interesting cross-section because itincludes not only the traditional BTs or Verizons or Deutsche Telecoms or NTTs,but obviously in that category of service providers, we also include customersof ours such as Yahoo! or Google or MSN, as well as the major cable companies. So it’s a diverse set, all of whom for the most part, andthis isn’t entirely true, we announced a couple of new relationships in mycomments earlier in some of the emerging markets, but a lot of this is going tobe driven by existing customers.
Ken Muth - Robert W.Baird: Okay, and then just anything, other clarity on the DX andthe WX platforms and just kind of -- are you happy with the success you arehaving there? You’ve obviously come up with some new product portfolios there.How do you look at that market opportunity in front of you?
Stephen A. Elop: A couple of things -- first of all, we are happy with theprogress that we are seeing. I think a couple of message to highlight here, forexample, the recent announcement of WX being adopted by Verizon as part oftheir managed services business, is a really good thing to key in on as itrelates to our strategy of leveraging to a greater extent our most importantpartner, so people who are our customers, there’s a huge opportunity for us toalso leverage them as go-to-market partners, and I think you’ll see more andmore examples of that as we continue here. So seeing those products actually becoming adopted by thosepartners and moving forward is a very positive sign. I think what you’ll alsocontinue to see is the approach we take on integrating capabilities, such asapplication acceleration, into other devices that also today have othercapabilities, so that as opposed to just competing with a single pointcapability like some of our competitors do, we can compete with a broader baseportfolio where, instead of putting in four boxes and a branch, someone’sputting in just one box that solves all problems. It’s a very powerful positionto be and something we’ll be working hard on.
Ken Muth - Robert W.Baird: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Sue with RBCCapital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Sue - RBCCapital Markets: Thank you. Just so we’re clear, SLT turning profitable inthe fourth quarter, is it more a rebound in sequential revenues due toseasonality or lower op-ex within the segment? And any risk that it might dipback into a loss in the March quarter? Or is that impossible, since it’s goingto be onward and forward?
Robyn M. Denholm: In terms of the first part of that question, it is bothfactors. There is a seasonal trend to the revenue. In Q4, it will increasesequentially from Q3. And then the other side of that is in terms of ouroperating expenses. We are continuing to manage those down over the course ofthe quarter.
Mark Sue - RBCCapital Markets: So how quickly can you slow the variable spending within theSLT if the revenues don’t materialize?
Robyn M. Denholm: Since we saw the revenue in the tail-end of last quarterfalling slightly short of our expectations, we have started already to reducethe expenditure in that area.
Mark Sue - RBCCapital Markets: I see. Okay, that’s helpful.
Stephen A. Elop: And just to answer the second part of the question as itrelates to Q1 and what may follow, it is much like our corporate aspirationsfor operating margin. We have a clear vector, a clear trajectory. Some quarterswe may be a bit better than that vector, sometimes a bit worse, but thetrajectory is clear. In the enterprise business, seasonality plays a factor,there’s no question. So Q1 may be a bit more difficult but overall, there’s aclear trajectory of improving that in the same way that we are improvingoperating margins for the company overall.
Mark Sue - RBCCapital Markets: Thank you, gentlemen, and ladies.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sam Wilson with JMPSecurities. Please proceed with your question.
Sam Wilson - JMPSecurities: I’m surprised no one asked this. This one’s for Scott, butcan you give us an update on the competitive environment in general? Do youthink the competitive environment is any different? And can you wrap into thata little bit a discussion about some of your channel partners that have boughtcompanies that offer competitive products?
Scott G. Kriens: A couple thoughts, Sam. First of all, there’s not a wholelot new to report on the competitive front, actually. We have one noteworthycompetitor that we pay occasional attention to, as you know, but primarily thething that’s driven the growth in the business and drives the up-ticks in theguidance and the outlook that you see has been the reaction from the customersto the Juniper strategy. It hasn’t been contrasted so much as it’s just been saidlook, as you guys prove your ability to deliver your definition of thishigh-performance network and it’s all the things we talk about, reliable andscalable and service aware and all that stuff. That’s what we want, and we -- asthey tell us, often, they see us as being the only company capable of doingthat. So it doesn’t mean that we have any disregard forcompetitive forces, because we pay a lot of attention to these things, as anythoughtful company would. But what the customers are telling us is to spendyour energy, Juniper, on delivering more and more of the vision of this unifiedoperating system and the kind of capabilities around it. As it relates specifically to some of the partners, weactually saw in the case of both Ericsson and Alcatel-Lucent, increasingcontribution as compared to the prior quarter, to Q2. I guess what I think that really reflects is it doesn’t somuch matter what sellers want to sell. It matters what buyers want to buy, andso much as any of us on the selling side of this equation might wish for adifferent outcome, and might go to a lot of trouble to try and create that, itstill comes down to what the buyers want to buy. And the message we’re hearingfrom partners who are buying more from us as well as customers buying more fromthem and from us is we like the story. So we’re going to continue to be very mindful of alternativepropositions out there, but as has been successful for us history to date here,the straight ahead look at the customer and what they are telling us to do hasworked so far, and we are here almost three-quarters of a billion dollars perquarter and counting, so we’re just going to keep doing what we’ve been doing.
Sam Wilson - JMPSecurities: Congratulations. Thank you very much.
Kathleen Bela: Operator, we have time for one more question.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Silversteinwith Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Paul Silverstein -Credit Suisse: The advantage of being last -- it’s only five parts. Most ofmy questions really are clarifications of questions that have been askedearlier, if I may. First off, I recognize that you don’t want to tell us whatSSG is in terms of absolute revenue, percent of revenue, but can you give ussome sense for what integrated platforms are as a percentage of SLT revenue?Are we at 50-50? Is it meaningfully less than that? Can you give us some ideaof where they are at?
Scott G. Kriens: Do you want to ask all five parts, Paul, or just go one at atime?
Paul Silverstein -Credit Suisse: Why don’t we do one at a time?
Scott G. Kriens: I think the broader comment I would make is, which isn’tgoing to be quantitative as much as it is qualitative here, what the customersare moving away from is this, what one of them called the other day, the chorusline of unrelated boxes. And some of that we take as an assignment for us too,because part of our business is the provision of standalone products that weoffer as well. But what they are telling us is they can’t scale it, theycan’t operate it, they can’t troubleshoot it, and they can’t rely on it,basically. So whether it’s SSG and its capabilities of routing and security,whether it’s five GTs that integrate wireless access points with security,whether it’s ISE 2000s that integrate intrusion detection and firewallcapabilities, they are literally at this stage really pounding the table on twofronts. One, more and more and more integration, and secondly, whichwe mentioned earlier, I really -- me speaking as a customer -- I don’t reallywant to worry about this at all if I don’t have to, so if someone like Verizoncan come along and give me a managed service solution to this and a servicelevel agreement and just tell me the reliability on a piece of paper I’m goingto get, I’m glad to sign the bottom of that page. We don’t have quantitative breakouts on every definition ofintegrated product because some of that is in the eye of the beholder, but moreand more of what we’re see -- J-series is the same thing. J-series had anothergood quarter, which again is integrating the routing and security capabilities. So we’re seeing it on all fronts. I can’t say we’ve reallyadded it up and separated it from standalone, but the message we are getting inthe market is clear.
Paul Silverstein -Credit Suisse: Scott, I appreciate that, but I guess my specific query,which I trust a lot of us have on this call, would be -- are we close to seeinga real acceleration in the SLT growth rate as the integrated platforms become ameaningfully greater percentage of the total SLT revenue? It’s just hard tojudge in terms of where you are at and what the growth rate outlook is for thisproduct. It seems like there is a significant divergence between your dedicatedfirewall and other platforms. In the integrated products, we don’t really knowwhere you are at in that transition. But I understand that you don’t want togive the breakout or can’t give the breakout, but it would be nice to get somebetter qualitative understanding. But I’ll move on.
Scott G. Kriens: Yeah, let’s. We’ll come back to you on that, Paul, and tryand give you a little more color behind it here as time goes on. What I would say is that even at this growth rate of the 17%for this quarter, we’ve seen growth in our enterprise business in total of 18%in this quarter. We’ve seen higher growth rates of that in prior quarters, butin each case, and in any of these cases, what we are seeing is the growth ratesare in excess of the market. Market growth rates, according to Infonetics, atleast, for network security are 8%, enterprise routing, 13%, and we are postinggrowth in excess of that. We’ll try to provide answers to break out more of thisdetail as we can. We’ll have to be thoughtful about how we aggregate it so thatit doesn’t create more confusion, but what we see clearly is we are growingahead of the market.
Paul Silverstein -Credit Suisse: Fair enough. Where is the bulk of your op-ex investmentgoing with respect to products? Is it in the SLT space or is it evenlydistributed?
Scott G. Kriens: There’s a couple of areas of growth primarily that areimportant to us. One is go-to-market, which is sales and marketing. And theother is the R&D, and R&D has a couple of dimensions. One is continuingto push the envelope on this notion of high performance and the other, which iswhat makes it more expensive at the moment to run the SLT business is there isa dual need for R&D spend, both on continuing to improve the products inthe market, and in some cases even standalone products, because there’scustomer commitments that are very important to us. And at the same time and inparallel, the expense associated with developing the integrated solutions. So if we’re running a business of only integrated productsand we had no standalone examples that were inherited by acquisition or othermeans, or if we are just trying to run a standalone business and we are tryingto pretend like this integrated wave wasn’t crashing over us, then it would beeasier to post a higher performance because R&D would be a lower percent ofspend. So spending across those two dimensions of research anddevelopment, both higher performance and integration, integration, integration,and then go-to-market, which is really just the predictable kind of sales andmarketing which, I might note, as a percentage of revenue, is relatively flateven though it is growing in absolute dollars.
Paul Silverstein -Credit Suisse: Your comments about MX960 in ethernet adoption -- Scott, isthere any risk as you go forward and ethernet becomes a bigger and bigger pieceof business, that pricing and margins are lower in that business? Obviously thenumbers you just put up suggest otherwise, but one of the propositions that thecarriers have been touting is the lower cost of ethernet platforms, or lowertotal cost of ownership. And I guess there’s theoretically greater competitionin the ethernet switch space as opposed to through routers. Does that --long-term, does that have adverse implications?
Scott G. Kriens: I draw one distinction, and it’s in the comments that youmade around the -- because I think you are right on this front, that what thecarriers are, or customers in general, what they are asking for is notlower-priced pieces of equipment. I mean, they’d be happy with that but thereal notion is what you said, which is total cost of ownership. And what we’re providing in the ethernet marketplace inparticular is much more than boxes with ethernet ports on them. They are reallyvehicles through which you can run the JUNOS operating system and create aseamless view across the entire network. And that lowers cost on a bunch of levels, whether it’stroubleshooting, scaling, deploying a feature once in one version of softwareand having it show up everywhere across the network, so increase what they callfeature velocity. There are lots of dimensions here where the cost ofownership, either because you can do more aggressive things in the network andimprove your time to revenue, of if you looked on the other side of the coinand said how can you lower the cost by lowering the operating expense burden ofhaving people all over the world on a 7-by-24 basis trying to chase throughsome checker-boarded confusion of operating systems and spending twice as muchas it should cost you to find the problem. So depending on which way you look at, whether you areplaying offence or defense, I guess, and either way, the integrated solutionand the integrated ethernet is the thing that is driving it, and it is morecost of ownership, to your point, than it is purchase price.
Kathleen Bela: That is all the time we have.
Scott G. Kriens: Paul, if you want to just throw one last one out here andthen we’ll have to close up. I think we’re running out of time.
Paul Silverstein -Credit Suisse: With respect to your comments on Ericsson, Alcatel-Lucent,your OEMs, I recognize they were up sequentially. Can you tell us what thelonger term trend has been over the last four or five quarters? If we looked atbusiness levels today in dollars, is it down meaningfully? Is it roughlyconsistent with where they were four or five quarters ago?
Scott G. Kriens: In front of me, I don’t have the four or five quarterhistory on each one of those. What I would say, if you look at our business intotal, the difference between 70%-plus being done through indirect partners and25, 28, depends on the given quarter, but that percentage of business beingdone direct, that hasn’t changed a great deal. If anything, it’s edged up onthe indirect side. So again, I think it’s much more a function of what thecustomers want to buy, and again a lot of these partners are running multiplebusiness models and much of what generates the profitability in thosebusinesses is the system integrator business model. And in that role, and thereare dedicated executives we have longstanding relationships with who have thesole responsibility of delivering more services business through their systemintegration functions, and those executives and by extension the companies, areunabashedly supportive of what the customer wants to buy and playing the roleof integrator. I can’t really comment on behalf of any individual companybut I think we are going to see system integration become a more and moredistinct attribute of the market. And for us, as we look at the marketplace and what we thinkour opportunities in front of us are, there’s kind of -- you can net it out inthree dimensions. We’ve got the right technology. As I mentioned through someof the additions to the team recently here, we’ve got the right team, and thisis clearly the right time to be in the market with this strategy. So between those vectors really pointing all towards moreopportunity for us, the assignment here is to execute and I can assure you thatthere is a laser focus on that, top to bottom, throughout 5,600 people in thisorganization. And that’s going to continue because the opportunities are whathave us all excited.
Paul Silverstein -Credit Suisse: Thanks, Scott.

Scott Kriens: Thanks, Michelle. Today, I'll be covering two main topics. The first quarter performance for Juniper in both our service provider and our enterprise markets, as well as, some comments about our ongoing work on improving our business processes and our execution across the company and the approach we've taken.  So, first to the results. We're pleased with a number of accomplishments during the quarter, including customer wins, strength of our partnerships, the traction on some new products, and our market leadership position across multiple markets, as well as, the fundamental financial metrics. Total revenue for the quarter was $627 million, which is up 11% from the comparable period in 2006, and our fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.19.  The GAAP EPS for the first quarter, which reflects stock compensation expenses associated with FAS 123 R, amortization of purchased intangibles and other items was $0.11 compared to $0.13 during the same quarter last year. Please see the press release on our website for the complete reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP results.  So within the first quarter totals, let's look initially at the service provider market. We saw a good strength from our infrastructure product groups, as we recognized $385.2 million in revenue, which is up over 6% from Q1 ‘06 and over 9% quarter-over-quarter. Service provider revenue was up 6% year-over-year. Our work in the service provider segment is progressing as planned, as we develop our business with the strength of our incumbency, across the top 30 service providers worldwide.  In this quarter, the Edge represented more than half of our infrastructure business and we expect this mix to fluctuate between core and edge as it has in prior quarters. During the quarter, we saw a good growth in the core due to T-series and TX where we recognized revenue on over 200 units and more than doubled the number of TX units recognized compared with the prior quarter, as more service providers move towards the next generation network or NGN and as new services at the edge like video gain momentum, which places higher bandwidth requirements on the core.  We announced Virgin Media Group, the U.K.'s largest cable operator, who has deployed Juniper's T-series core routers including the multi-terabit TX to upgrade its IP back bone network and through Nokia Siemens Networks or NSN, the South African Second National Operator, Neotel in Johannesburg is building a nationwide IP core network with Juniper M-and T-routers.  Moving to the edge of the network, we saw good a growth in Q1. In this quarter, we saw significant revenue growth in our E-series portfolio, which includes approximately $50 million in previously deferred revenue from Verizon. And as previously indicated in prior comments, we've used this as an opportunity to increase our backlog during the quarter. And to provide you with some more details on our deferred revenue for Q1, we saw total deferred revenue increase to $410 million versus $386 million last quarter, and as a reminder, the deferred revenue is made up of service, channel inventory, and product.  During the quarter, revenue contribution from the E320 was up over 35% from the prior quarter and we also saw in Q1 the largest volume of E320 orders in the products history. We also saw the increasing acceptance of the M-120, which we have been expecting, with revenue up almost 90% from what we saw in the previous quarter.  We also recognized revenues on the MX960, which is our Ethernet aggregation product, and this is the first quarter we've released the product for actual production shipments and so while we have not and would not have expected to see significant revenues in this first shipping quarter, we have come to market on schedule and we expect these revenues to ramp in the coming quarters. The early response from customers on the MX96 has been positive and we're encouraged by the network design activity we see.  On the service provider partner front, we saw NSN contribute almost 12% of revenues for the quarter and we also saw ongoing contributions from Ericsson, from Alcatel Lucent and from NEC. We also recognized over 15% of revenues this quarter from Verizon, primarily due to the recognition of previously deferred revenues, in addition to the business we did with them during the quarter on other fronts. We would not expect to have Verizon again contribute at this level in the normal course of shipments and are revenues that we foresee.  In the product area, we announced a portfolio of Session and Resource Control Solutions, which in plain English, are capabilities used for setting and controlling policy, and the intelligence needed for enabling service providers to ensure a high quality user experience for multi-play and mobile services in next generation networks.  Our customers are telling us that combining open, scaleable, and reliable policy control solutions with our proven IP infrastructure provides us with a distinct advantage in the marketplace. We also continue to see an increasing level of interest in the Juniper Security portfolio, as there are a growing number of service providers using our security products.  For example, this quarter, we announced a win at T-Mobile Austria to secure their traffic with integrated firewall, VPN and IDP solutions, and we were selected by BT or British Telecom to provide routers and security solutions for the U.K.'s defense fixed telecommunications services project and Telia Sonera selected Juniper Networks SSL VPN platforms for enhanced managed security services in Scandinavia.  As a last service provider comment, we continue to be encouraged by the market share as reported by Synergy Research Group in February of 2007, where Juniper is currently ranked Number two worldwide in the service provider or SP market in total SP routing, core SP routing, broadband access and multi service edge, and we attained the Number one position in broadband access based IPTV.  And now moving to the enterprise business. We continue to make progress in this marketplace with approximately one third of our business coming from enterprises, where we today served over 20,000 enterprise customers worldwide. Our enterprise business in total grew 25% in Q1 as compared to the same period a year ago.  Our service layer technologies, or SLT product group revenues were up over 12% from Q1 ‘06 to Q1 '07 at $125 million, and were down by approximately 5% from the fourth quarter of last year, due to Q1 seasonality. Overall, firewall products saw good growth year-over-year and despite Q1 softness, we saw growth quarter-over-quarter in our integrated security products as the ISG 2000, which includes IDP functionality grew at almost 15%, and our SSG family, which grew over 65% when compared to Q4 of last year.  We're also seeing growth in our new family of J Series products, where revenue nearly doubled from last quarter. These results continue to demonstrate what we've seen in the market in prior quarters, the move to integrated technologies is the clear choice of customers across multiple markets.  We saw relatively a flat performance in stand alone IDP and softness in SSL VPN and our application acceleration products quarter-over-quarter, which is due to some substitution with our more integrated products, and also Q1 seasonality, which we would expect.  We remain the leading supplier of best-in-class security solutions with the total of nine industry awards in the quarter. A couple of those from network computing U.K. for the best security products of 2007 for the SSG family and from information security, what they call the Hot Pick for the ISG 2000 with intrusion detection or prevention or IDP.  We also see increasing opportunities for our routing portfolio within the enterprise marketplace, as the wide area network needs of the enterprise customer are the same as those of the service provider: Reliability, scalability, performance, and intelligence needs are equally strategic and when we can point to the largest IP networks in the world and the fact that they are using the same products with the same software we're proposing as enterprise solutions to support millions of users in any given service provider network, the acceptance of Juniper Routing Solutions is accelerating.  To highlight one example of this from the first quarter, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange announced the selection of the Juniper M-series in the rollout of their new institutional regional optical network. This high performance network is designed to position the Philadelphia Stock Exchange to be one of the fastest and most reliable electronic trading venues in the world.  From a channel perspective, VARBusiness and GovernmentVAR magazines recognized Juniper as a Five Star partner for the high quality of our partner programs in the commercial and public sectors. We are committed to our channel partners and the further investment in and development of these relationships and are working very well together.  We continue to maintain strong industry partnerships as well. As we've announced the readiness of the joint solution with Avaya, who have embedded their media gateway and interface modules inside our telephony ready J Series routers for branch office, voice over IP deployments, and Symantec security response team and the Juniper Networks J-Security team are working together to share vulnerability information to block known attacks, and detect known suspicious, and malicious behavior for Juniper Networks stand alone intrusion detection and prevention, integrated security gateway, with the embedded IDP, and secure services gateway customers.  From a market share perspective, we strengthened our Number two position and increased share, in both the enterprise router and high-end enterprise categories, again according to synergy research in February of 2007, and we maintain the Number two positions in total network security worldwide according to Infonetics in March of 2007. We are seeing the acceptance by both customers and partners of our strategy, our products and our solutions, and we're encouraged as we look forward across the coming quarters.  So now, a few comments on the services business, which we report as a combined business in support of both the enterprise and service provider markets. Revenues in the first quarter were $117.2 million, up 4% from Q4 of last year and almost 27% year-over-year due to an increase in the installed customer base. We've also seen improvement in customer satisfaction and customer loyalty scores, particularly from investments in the enterprise in 2006 and resulting improvement in services.  So now, let's take a quick look at the geographies and the sources of the first quarter performance. From a geographic perspective, the Americas represented 47% of total revenue in Q1, up 3% from Q4 '06 due to the strength we saw in the Americas service provider business as well as the strength in Canada.  Europe, Middle East, and Africa, or EMEA, represented 33% of total revenue in Q1 down slightly as a percentage of total when compared to the previous quarter, which was unusually strong at 38%.  We saw particular strength in France and Italy and some good growth in Belgium, Poland, and Portugal, and our investments in emerging markets are paying off as we saw revenue in countries such as Serbia and Montenegro, Egypt and South Africa, and see continued success in Russia, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. Asia represented 20% of total revenue, which is up slightly from Q4, and we saw growth in India and Korea and strength in Australia, Singapore, and Vietnam.  Specifically with regard to Japan, we expect decisions to be made over the next quarter or two on certain NGN networks with some revenue implications for '07. However, the choice of formal public comment and the timing of those network rollouts is up to our customers.  And so now I'd like to provide you with updates on some activities within Juniper and specifically in three areas. First, Juniper's stock buyback program. During the quarter, we announced that the board of directors had approved an increase of $1 billion under the company's share repurchase program.  During the quarter, we used almost $30 million of cash to repurchase 1,520,900 common shares at an average price of $19.16. Further repurchases will be made from time to time as we will remain, as we have been in the past, opportunistic in our buying activities.  Secondly, an update on our executive searches. We've retained search firms in both the CFO and General Management searches and have begun seeing candidates. We will be diligent and focused in completing these searches in a timely manner and will be announcing the results of those searches to you as soon as they've been completed.  Regarding Bob's responsibilities as our CFO, Bob will remain with Juniper and will sign our Q1 financial filings when those activities have been completed which we expect to be within the next few weeks.  Juniper has built a very strong and capable finance organization and will conduct business as usual until a new CFO is in place. And then lastly, a quick update on Stephen Elop's activity as our new Chief Operating Officer over his first quarter with Juniper.  Stephen has begun a comprehensive program across Juniper to focus on our business process improvement, looking first at our planning methodologies, our productivity and information systems and our business practices in a very intense effort to improve our alignment across Juniper. This will be a major ongoing project to develop the necessary scalability to achieve our growth goals for Juniper in the coming years and we're under way on these efforts.  So, to summarize, we remain enthusiastic about our opportunities in both the service provider and enterprise markets, as we've said before, we're a $2 billion company in a $20 billion market, and we understand our markets and our competition. Our job is to focus on our customers, our innovation and our opportunities and to execute.  As maybe apparent to those of you who have joined us for these earnings reports in prior quarters, I've not allocated time today to revisiting our strategy and the market dynamics that make the markets for Juniper clear to us.  We believe that there's plenty of evidence behind the demand for high performance networks printed in the papers every day. Our energy is focused on our execution within Juniper and the customers who make our opportunity possible. We believe this is the best place for us to spend our time and we're committed to realize our potential.  All of this is possible only with the support of our employees whose continued commitment and incredible efforts make these results possible, as well as our many partners, our customers, our suppliers and our long-term shareholders.  I'd like to thank you all for your continued support and confidence in Juniper Networks. And now, before I turn this call over to Bob, and given that this is Bob's last earnings call with us, I'd like to take this time to say thank you to Bob for all of your accomplishments at Juniper and wish you the best in your new opportunity and with that, Bob, I'll now turn the call over to you. 
Bob Dykes: Thanks, Scott. Appreciate that. Our performance of metrics for this quarter reflects the financial strength of our business. As I take you through some of the details metrics please remember that our business will be lumpy by application, by geography as well as by-product mix.  Total reported revenue for Q1 was $620.9 million, an increase of 11% from the prior year and up over 5% from last quarter. For our infrastructure products we recognized product revenue of $385.2 million, up over 6% from a year ago and up over 9% from Q4. We recognized revenue on a total of 2487 infrastructure units this quarter and we shipped 41,607 infrastructure ports, both up from last quarter.  The Service Layer Technology revenue which includes firewall, SSL, IDP and other security products as well as J-series and application acceleration solutions totaled $124.5 million, up over 12% year-over-year, and down approximately 5% from last quarter due to Q1 seasonality.  Now for some more detail on elements within our business. Total service revenue was $117.2 million, up approximately 27% from the prior year and 4% from last quarter. This increase was due to growth in the contracting installed base.  The total book-to-bill ratio was greater than one in the quarter. We expect to see continued lumpiness by theater as quarterly trends fluctuate.  Revenue through our direct sales was approximately 32%, up from Q4 primarily due to the strength in the Americas service provider business.  The non-GAAP references that I'm about to discuss exclude the amortization of purchased intangibles, stock-based compensation, and special charges. Please see the press release on our website for the reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP results.  Gross margin was 67% on a non-GAAP basis, in line with our guidance and down from 68.6% last quarter due to product mix. Service margin was approximately 53.8% versus 51% last quarter, reflecting increased revenue with relatively flat expenses. R & D expenses were $130 million, and accounted for 20.7% of total revenue, which compares to $119.9 million or 20.1% last quarter.  Sales and Marketing expenses were $143 million and accounted for 22.8% of revenue relative to $146.1 million or 24.5% for Q4, but we saw an increase in yearend Commissions and demo equipment spending. And G&A expenses were $23.5 million and accounted for 3.8% of revenue, which compares to $22.4 million or 3.8% of revenue last quarter.  In total, operating expenses were $296.6 million and accounted for 47.3% of revenue, which compares to $288.4 million or 48.4% of revenue last quarter. Operating income was $123.1 million, or 19.6 % of revenue slightly below our guidance and compared to operating income of $120.1 million or 20.2% of revenue last quarter. It is our intention to have operating margins remain above 20% and we will strive to return to that level in Q2.  Net interest and other income totaled $32.9 million compared to $30.1 million last quarter. This increase was primarily due to a high cash balance. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 28%. Non-GAAP net income was down just slightly this quarter to $112.4 million or 17.9% of total revenue compared to $112.6 million or 18.9% last quarter.  Diluted non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.19, flat compared with Q4. On a GAAP basis including FAS 123R compensation expense of $25.9 million and the amortization of purchased intangibles, acquisition related compensation charges, stock option inquiry expenses, and tax related charges relating to the option restatement, that totaled $36.7 million, our operating expenses for Q1 totaled $354.3 million and net income was $66.6 million or $0.11 per diluted share. This is compared to net income of $71 million or $0.12 per diluted share in Q4.  Now, a few comments regarding the Balance Sheet. Cash, cash equivalents, short and long term investments were over $2.7 billion, up almost $100 million as compared with the prior quarter. Cash flow from operations in the first quarter of 2007 was $152.6 million.  Accounts Receivable was $257.8 million and day sales outstanding was 37 days, compared with 38 days last quarter. As previously stated, we expect DSO's to be in the range of 40 to 45 days depending on the mix of partners and linearity. As a reminder of Scott's comments earlier, total deferred revenue was $410 million versus $386 million last quarter compared, despite the recognition of the Verizon deferred revenue.  CapEx was $32.4 million, and depreciation was $22.2 million during the quarter. We ended the quarter with 5099 in total headcount, up from 4833 at the end of Q4. R&D accounted for the largest category of increase.  Now for guidance. We will continue to focus on our financial fundamentals and please remember it is difficult to predict the level of business each quarter but we are managing our financial plan and would like to share some data with you. The following forecasts and guidance are non-GAAP and forward-looking statements. The actual results can vary for a number of reasons including those mentioned in our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC.  For Q2, we are currently forecasting total revenue of $640 to $650 million. This guidance reflects 13 to 15% growth from the same period last year. Our full year 2007 revenue expectations remain unchanged at $2.6 to $2.7 billion. For Q2, we expect gross margins to be relatively flat with Q1 and to fluctuate slightly for the remainder of the year. The expected tax rate for the year is 28%.  We are currently forecasting operating expenses to increase but at a slower rate than revenue growth. We are committed to growing revenue, earnings on an absolute basis as well as cash generation and market share, and we intend to do so at the highest level of operating margin that is practical.  When we return to our long term operating model as a fluctuation of significant sustained revenue growth. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.20 for Q2 and expect our full year guidance to remain unchanged at $0.80 to $0.81. We expect shares in the range of $605 to $610 million for Q2, exclusive of share buybacks.  We are not making any share count projections based on stock repurchases, as a reminder, at current stock price levels the stock buyback program is mutual to earnings in the short-term as the decrease in share count is offset by the decrease in interest income.  Our GAAP EPS target is not accessible on a forward-looking basis due to high variability and low visibility with respect to the non-recurring charges, which are excluded from the non-GAAP EPS estimate.  Now, I would like to take questions, please limit yourself to one question. 
Michelle Levine: Jamie, please instruct the audience regarding the queuing process. 
Question-and-Answer:
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Paul Mansky from Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. 
Paul Mansky - Citigroup: Great. Thank you. Scott, I know service providers certainly driving the boat here as SLT continues to ramp; however there's obviously been a fair amount of discussion out there related to the pace of enterprise spend particularly domestically.  Can you, if you will, spend maybe a few more minutes talking a little bit more about what you're seeing out there on the enterprise side, particularly on the domestic front? 
Scott Kriens: Let me just make sure I understand the question, Paul. Meaning, regarding enterprise spending attitudes and then specifically North American attitudes? 
Paul Mansky - Citigroup: Absolutely, please. 
Scott Kriens: Yes. You know, I would say across the market in total, and I guess this might be a little more true in North America although outside of North America it's going to end up being very country specific based on the economies in those countries.  But if I were to make a general statement and throw North America into that, I think that what we see in some markets is that the increasing realization that the network is a strategic element in realizing the business success that is being sought. And so, it has a positive impact in the following sense, which is that the spend that is allocated for network and I am speaking here more specifically to network infrastructure, is moving from the category of optional or preferred to required.  In other words, we need to reach, if we're going to be able to approve loans in a branch bank in five minutes, then the network is absolutely positively has to be there and we have got to have the ability to prioritize and secure that request from the branch to the data center and back in order to reach the advertised functionality we're using to differentiate ourselves with our customers so just to pick an example, so in that regard, it's moving from something we would like to do to being fundamental to success.  That said, the amounts being allocated in the spend are being managed very carefully, so it's actually in some ways taking on a bit of the character that we see in the service provider market, which is something that service providers call success based spending. In other words, there is an aspiration and a project plan but after an initial deployment, there is a dependency on the success.  In this case it wouldn't be the value-added services necessarily but it would be the success of the underlying application in making a decision to further the spend, so we're seeing strategic commitment, which is a positive but I'd say in many of these cases we're seeing what I'd call success based iterative decisions being made on the timing of the rollouts, and in some of these markets we're seeing that be sooner than later but in other markets we're seeing the customers remain very careful. 
Paul Mansky - Citigroup: Has that stance changed in the last 90 days or so? I mean has it gotten more conservative in the last 90 days? 
Scott Kriens: I don't think it's changed that much, Paul, that I would say. I think this evolution of the network to being much more strategic is something we have seen over the last year, and in many cases by the way in some segments it would have been said the network was strategic obviously long ago but in terms of really seeing what I'd call broad based behavior, there has been a change that we've seen, but I wouldn't say that's the slope of the curve or the attitudes in the last one or two quarters has really made any market changes that we can see. 
Paul Mansky - Citigroup: Great. Thank you very much. 
Michelle Levine: Next question, please? 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nikos Theodosopoulos. Please proceed with your question. 
Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS: Yes, thank you. Can you hear me? 
Scott Kriens: Yes, go ahead, Nikos. 
Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS: Okay. I had a question on the SLT margins. And once the company became current with filings and it became apparent that the SLT business was operating at a loss last year and I guess my question, Scott, is given that the company strategically wants to be in the enterprise, can you give us some kind of metrics, some goals in terms of when this business could be profitable, a timing or how do you manage this business, because it's already been three years in the running and the business is still losing money and I wanted to get your perspective, how long do you think it's going to be before the business can actually start contributing to earnings? Thank you. 
Scott Kriens: One clarification Nikos and then to your question. The reports and the breakouts that you see on SLT are different than enterprise because enterprise, remember, includes router deployments which are characterized or captured in our infrastructure product group performance, so the consequence of that is that you see kind of a disproportion at burden applied to purely the Service Layer Technologies relative to the contributions that come from Infrastructure.  But that said, just aside from the clarification, your point is certainly a good one and yes, there is a gap in the contribution from the enterprise business relative to that of the service provider business.  As we look across 2007, we see the opportunity for the growth of the enterprise business and I'll again draw that distinction, but also within that, the growth of Service Layer Technologies as both being sufficient to generate a positive contribution to the bottom-line and to be a positive contributor to operating results.  In terms of the metrics or exactly how we get there, it will depend a little bit on the -- actually it will depend on two things. One would be absolute growth rate and obviously, the more of that we see and this is true across the operating margin comment I'd make across the entire business.  We have a pretty good idea of what we will spend, and if we see revenue acceleration, then and this is a business wide comment but it's also particular to enterprise and particular to SLT, growth in those areas beyond our current expectations would produce a more rapid improvement in the contribution margins that are made both collectively and individually within these areas, so that's one contributor, or one place to look.  And then secondly, as we start to see this business as it is doing, as we see it start to scale, we believe that there is an opportunity even at the growth rates that we currently project to improve the operating margin contributions as a by-product of the scale of the business.  So if it's pure growth on the top-line that exceeds our expectations, it would happen faster, but even at current course and speed, the scale of the business and the ability to spread some of the costs of marketing and the costs of the development of the channel will allow a contribution to occur even if we don't see growth beyond our expectations, and I'd expect a chance for that to occur both of those to occur certainly over the next few quarters and it's something that we expect to report positively on in 2007. 
Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS: Okay, just to clarify, Scott, then so given the guidance of $2.6 to $2.7 billion in revenues and the $0.80, $0.81 in EPS that you're expecting the SLT margins to turn positive at some point this year assuming the company hits those revenue targets? 
Scott Kriens: Let me, again pars the question a bit. The short answer to the question is yes, but I think exactly what the contributions are as a function of the mix and the 2.6 to 2.7, and the way it's reported as well and the difference between SLT and enterprise.  So in sort of simplest terms the answer is yes, given that we hit those expectations, but more specifically, we'll see a delta in the contribution per the breakouts that you're referencing depending on the mix of the 2.6 to 2.7. 
Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS: Okay, thank you. 
Scott Kriens: Great. Thanks, Nikos. 
Michelle Levine: Next question, please? 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Luke. Please proceed with your question. Mr. Luke of Lehman Brothers, your line is open. Can you check your mute feature, perhaps or pick up your handset? Okay. 
Michelle Levine: Why don't we go to the next question? 
Operator: Absolutely, one moment, please? Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Evanson of Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your questions. 
Jeff Evanson - Sanford Bernstein: Thanks. I was wondering if you could give us a bit more color on your backlog, particularly some ways to dimensionalize it such as sequential or year-over-year growth, percent of revenue? And then maybe also why you guys feel it's beneficial to build a larger backlog at this point? 
Bob Dykes: Jeff, a couple thoughts here on backlog, we did mention a couple of elements here. One, book-to-bill for the quarter was greater than one. And secondly, that our deferred revenues went up from $386 million in the prior quarter to $410 million.  And given that, if we do continue to see the orders exceeding the billings and as the business grows in aggregate, we would expect to see the deferred revenues grow accordingly. We don't detail the character of the backlog because it fluctuates.  But remember that deferred revenues are made up of a combination of service revenues or service commitments with customers that are realized overtime, inventory which is carried in the channel, and as well as the case with Verizon, some product revenues when they are shipped and not recognized immediately.  With regard to what we see, given the opportunity we had this quarter to grow the backlog with the Verizon release from deferred, from the project of 2006, the opportunity to do that allows us to enter the quarter with more backlog available for shipments and that gives us a head-start on being able to tackle some of the efficiencies that we're after and to hit some of the cost targets that linearity can give us and that predictability can give us in running the business.  So, those are a couple of the, a bit of the color and a couple of the reasons behind the building of the backlog with the quarter that we just finished. 
Jeff Evanson - Sanford Bernstein: Thanks. 
Bob Dykes: Thank you. 
Michelle Levine: Next question, please? 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sanjiv Wadhwani of Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed with your question. 
Sanjiv Wadhwani - Stifel Nicolaus: Thank you. Scott, just a high level question, if you're looking at opportunities on the routing side today; are you more enthusiastic today versus quarter ago versus a year ago? And if you are, are there particular areas that are looking better; for example, Edge Routing, Carrier Ethernet, Core routing? If you could just sort of get into that detail that would be great? Thanks. 
Scott Kriens: Sanjiv, I wouldn't say I am anymore enthusiastic now than I've been or any less for that matter really. It's relatively unchanged. There are, within the NGN opportunities as you referenced and as we said this quarter, we shipped over 200 units in the T and TX family of products. And so, certainly across the NGN builds we see opportunity for the business.  Within Carrier Ethernet the MX96O should give us some additional opportunities in those areas here in the coming quarters. As I mentioned, I did see or we did see the shift and we're able to recognize some revenue on it, but it's really at this point still in the stage of being considered in the network designs and being sort of final tested, if you will.  So the slope of that curve and the ability of MX96O to contribute is kind of to be determined in all this. On the Edge, in particular, obviously there was a greater revenue contribution because of the release of deferred. And in fact, what probably will happen, this was yet to be reported to the market share analyst’s in this.  But, given that they track market share on revenue and we've now had this $50 million recognized, it would look, it will likely look to be a big jump in market share, but it's a little bit misleading because and in return the market share loss of last year was a bit negative beyond its actual impact because of the shipments that weren't recognized.  It will now be overcorrected or positive beyond its impact measured quarter-over-quarter because of the realization of the deferred. So, if you kind of draw lines through all of that, we see a pretty good opportunity for the Edge products.  And then finally routing and enterprise, we take both the number two position there. We've had and we also saw some share gains this quarter. So, all of that kind of throwed all in the same soup bowl and stir it up, I'd say the opportunities are there, but I wouldn't say that they are different or better than those that we saw coming into the year. 
Sanjiv Wadhwani - Stifel Nicolaus: Got it. Thank you. 
Scott Kriens: All right. 
Michelle Levine: Next question, please? 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Coleman. Please proceed with your question. 
Scott Coleman - Morgan Stanley: Last quarter, Bob, I think you talked about OpEx growing generally in line with revenue. Tonight you're talking about OpEx will increase at a slower rate than revenue growth as we go through the year. I am wondering, did you overspend what your expectations were in Q1?  Is there something out there that you're seeing that's a little different now that's causing these rates to change or perhaps maybe revenues growing a little faster? I am just wondering, if you can tell us what's changed over the last quarter or so? 
Bob Dykes: There hasn't really been a significant change, but we did indicate in the call that we would increase our margins back up to the 20% range in the nearer term and obviously to a higher number in the longer term as we get strong sustained revenue growth.  So the slower growth in expenses compared with revenue is just reflects the mathematics you have to go through to get there, and we continue to invest very heavily in R&D and the sales organization in order to really drive the revenue growth of the company. 
Scott Coleman - Morgan Stanley: Right. So, which all makes sense mathematically, but why is it incorrect to conclude based on what you said a quarter ago, no change to the top line, that perhaps you didn't spend more, a little more than expected this quarter? 
Bob Dykes: During this quarter, there are a number of goes ins and goes outs that ended up with the number that we have. Obviously, we made the EPS number that we were targeting. We had some very large employee taxed up of really high in the Q1 period that drives an expense jump but we had savings compared with last quarter because sales commission seemed to go down quarter to quarter.  So there were a number of factors that changed that number. As you saw the gross margin also was down a little bit in Q1, but as we said we expect it to stay in that sort of range going forward.  So there just tends to be noise and we've always said that our numbers are going to be lumpy from quarter to quarter. Clearly, we said we were targeting 20% and we expect to get back above that in the near future. 
Scott Coleman - Morgan Stanley: Great. Thank you. 
Michelle Levine: Next question, please? 
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Tal Liani of Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. 
Tal Liani - Merrill Lynch: Hi. First clarification. If I take your reported revenues and I add to it the increase in deferred backlog, which is $24 million or deferred revenues and then I deduct the $50 million of Verizon I am getting a year-over-year decline in revenues and I am getting only slight sequential increase. Is this a proper way, and I am only looking at the routing revenues, infrastructure revenues. Is this a proper way to look at it and if not, why isn't it a proper way.  And second, you grew, if I look at the market growth in routing in ‘06 and again I need to normalize it for the fact that your revenues are 50/50 core and Edge and the market is a different kind of proportion, so if I normalize it, the market grew in the neighborhood of 25-26% year-over-year and you're only growing 6% year-over-year.  Do you think you're going to catch up over the next 12 months with the market growth or should we expect continued market share loss over the next 12-18 months? Thank you. 
Bob Dykes: Tal, I guess first, to the question on deferred revenue and the calculation for it, the deferred revenues at the end of Q4 of last year or a quarter ago were $386 million and that's a number that was reduced by $50 million as a result of the recognition of the Verizon deferral, which had been in there for a number of quarters as you know, but even after the reduction in the quarter of $50 million, there were other additions which raised the deferred revenue by the end of the quarter from the 386 that we entered with to the 410 number at quarter end.  Now, again, remember that that number has product deferrals, service contract deferrals as well as shipments into the channel inventories that don't yet ship out and become recognized for revenue. It's a mix of all of those. So the impact of the recognition of the Verizon deferrals was a reduction to that account but there were other additions, which raised the total by the $24 million that you identified.  So hopefully that helps with that, and then I forgot what was the second half of the question? 
Tal Liani - Merrill Lynch: Maybe just to go back on this, so why you have been… 
Bob Dykes: I am sorry, I remember, Tal. I apologize, so around the share growth. You kind of have to separate markets by not only core and Edge but also by the Ethernet segment, and the Carrier Ethernet and Ethernet aggregation as well as Ethernet metro services.  In aggregate, the market that we participated in grew faster than we did last year. We will see what the actual growth is going into this year but we have the additional opportunity to participate with our MX products in a segment that we really were not nearly as active in 2006. So it remains to be seen what the growth rate actually is of the routing market, but we believe we're in a pretty good position to be able to participate in that growth on an equal footing with the rest of the marketplace at a minimum. 
Tal Liani - Merrill Lynch: And Scott, just to go back to my first question just to understand, so the deferred revenue growth of $24 million, that's like a clean number from quarter-to-quarter, so that's why if I take into account the negative impact of Verizon or the positive but I have to deduct it from the numbers to look at sort of likes to likes comparison. If I look at $50 million on the negative side and plus 24 on the positive side which is the sequential increase from 386-410, why can't I make this adjustment to try and look at your business on the like to like basis on a year-over-year or sequential basis? 
Scott Kriens: Well, we said during the quarter that we did increase our backlog, we didn't say exactly how much, but some of that extra Verizon revenue we said would use to increase our backlog during the quarter and we did that.  And again, Tal, remember that perhaps in the way you're describing it, there was a reduction of $50 million on the Verizon side of it but in aggregate, there were additions of $74 million, there for, the net increase of $24 million, but again remember that $24 million also has within it service contracts and channel inventories so it doesn't purely translate to product backlogs. 
Tal Liani - Merrill Lynch: Thank you. 
Scott Kriens: Great. Thanks. 
Michelle Levine: Next question, please? 
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron of CIBC World Markets. Please proceed with your question. 
Ittai Kidron - CIBC World Markets: Thank you, good afternoon, gentlemen. Scott, can you give us a little bit more color on Japan? It just seems from your commentary and maybe I'm extrapolating too much out of it, it's more likely to see revenue from that region in 2008 rather than 2007 and how do you feel about your competitive position over there? Do you think that has changed over the past quarter?  And second, with respect to your buyback activity, it's been symbolic at best maybe this quarter, what will get you more excited on your own stock? 
Scott Kriens: Ittai, first on the Japan question, the progress over there, I think, is not much changed from what we've commented on previously. Our competitive position at least and here I can only give you really our assessment of it, also has not changed. We believe that we're in a good position to participate in the NGN decisions that are made and in the build outs that follow.  A couple of things that will affect our commentary on it, one, is the absolute timing and actual production deployments, that are made as a result of the customer decisions and obviously to the extent that takes place we would have the impact assuming that we're able to participate then we would have the impact in revenues, but secondly with regard to color around exactly the thinking, and the timing, and the projections and what have you, those comments will be made at really a time of their own choosing by the customers.  And so along with not being completely certain ourselves of what the actual timing and production decisions that will be made by the customers are going to be, we also even with those made when, if, and when they are don't know when they will make comments or provide any sort of direction or clarifications to the market and we're sort of left at the mercy of their decisions to do so before we'll be able to add a whole lot of color to what's actually gone on besides speculation.  But from the point of view of our involvement here, or at least our pursuit of these opportunities, we don't really see change in either the pace or in the level of participation that we would hope to be able to have.  With regard to the buyback, as we mentioned in this quarter that just ended, we purchased about $30 million worth of stock and that translated into the purchase of a million, 520, 900 shares, at an average price of $19.16, and if and as we continue to purchase shares in the buyback activities, those would be reported as required by the company from time to time, but independent of that reporting and just as a matter of our own policy, we wouldn't be providing any commentary or color on those plans, so as required, the comments and the actual purchases would certainly be disclosed. 
Ittai Kidron - CIBC World Markets: Very good. And can you just refresh our mind with regards to your annual guidance, how much you take in Japan into consideration in it? 
Scott Kriens: You know, we expect there to be some revenue potentially available to us as the year unfolds here and so we do in our outlook for the $2.6 to $2.7 billion that we've seen, as well as in our guidance on the $0.80 to $0.81, and actually to reference a question Scott, it adds previously around our growth and whether there's any change in our attitude around that, we reiterated the same guidance on the non-GAAP earnings outlook of $081 to $0.81, so that really hasn't changed.  And we would expect that there is some contribution from Japan in that guidance, but really, as you move out in quarters particularly as we approach the end off this year, it's a bit of I think it would be false precision on our part to claim that there's exactly any one account that we're placing a particular number behind that we're dependent upon. It's one of the things that we hope to be able to use our size and the diversity of the revenue across both geographies and product lines and markets that anyone of these deals could come or go and that we would have the opportunity to replace it from other business and other presence in these markets and geographies. 
Ittai Kidron - CIBC World Markets: Thank you. 
Scott Kriens: You're welcome. 
Scott Kriens:
Michelle Levine: Next question, please? 
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Mark Sue of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. 
Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets: Thank you. Bob, thank you for all your help and good luck to you. 
Bob Dykes: Thank you. 
Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets: The question is back on the enterprise. Most companies are trying to diversify out of the large enterprise and it's correlated to economic spending, you said you're increasing your spending in what is perceived as a slowing market. When do you say we gave it our best shot but IT spending is only growing at 5% and instead focus on what you do best? 
Scott Kriens: Actually, Mark, just a perspective on this. What we do best, in our opinion, is to build high performance networks, and while there may be some questions surrounding the enterprise market in total, the high performance network marketplace, which we determined to be the markets where high performance networks are critical to the success of the high performance business, is a marketplace that we see having opportunity.  And the fact that we've got this capability delivered and running every day in the largest networks in the world, which in the service provider community is the revenue engine of the company, and that we're successful in supporting that.  If in the enterprise or public sector marketplace there's a need for a high performance network to realize the success of a business strategy and to differentiate those customers relative to their competitors, we think that's a pretty good market opportunity for us, and it's also highly leveraged by our existing research and development commitments because the overlap in requirements translates to an overlap and there for a leverage in the market served by the same research and development investment  So in aggregate across the enterprise marketplace, as some of the more commodity like product segments flatten out or decline and frankly as some of that functionality gets integrated, it's kind of un surprising. It's much like in the service provider marketplace, the reason that a service provider goes to an IP infrastructure is because they're trying to drive CapEx down as a percentage of revenue. And if it didn't do that, then there wouldn't be much reason to have a next generation network.  Likewise, in the enterprise marketplace, one of the reasons for the high performance network is to improve the performance of that asset financially, and as a result, be able to attack the cost to the business. So not only are we not troubled by some of the spending outlooks in the enterprise market, we intend to create some of those outlooks by deployment of the high performance capabilities that we have. 
Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets: And Scott, do you think you'll need more components to take in this high performance networking market? 
Scott Kriens: There's certainly a lot of components out there available either for development or purchase, and from time to time I suspect we'll consider that sort of thing, but our focus really is on taking the intellectual property that we have today and the portfolio that we have today and better executing on our integration and our marketing and selling of that capability.  And we draw some pretty stark distinctions between high performance network infrastructure and some of the what I would call consumer electronics that get where user functionality that gets put on the end of that infrastructure, that's a place we don't see a reason for Juniper to participate, so within the infrastructure marketplace, while there's always more that one could imagine doing, we feel like our requirements in the markets that we see is really based more on our integration and development of the capabilities that we have. 
Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets: Thank you. 
Scott Kriens: Great. Thanks, Mark. 
Michelle Levine: Operator, we'll now take our final question. 
Operator: Okay. The next question is from the line of Ehud Gelblum. Please proceed with your question. 
Ehud Gelblum - J.P. Morgan: Got it. Thanks, Bob. First a clarification and question. The clarification there was some issues before between the difference between enterprise and service provider and SLT and infrastructure.  If you could give us a sense as to how much of the break down within SLT and enterprise versus service provider and the same on infrastructure to actually help understanding those businesses a little bit better so it would be great if you can give some insight there.  My actual question has to do with the gross margin, which declined 70 basis points this quarter on the product side and the impact of Verizon. Did the Verizon deferred revenue that you, the $50 million that you recognized, did it have a lower gross margin than normal and so did that have any kind of impact in pulling down the margins this quarter and when it was in the commissions on those Verizon revenues, did they come through in this quarter to match in the OpEx to match the revenues or were they prior when you booked the revenues originally last year. Any information on that would be very helpful. 
Scott Kriens: Ehud, first of all the Verizon deferral being recognized didn't really have any impact one-way or the other on gross margins. It was recognized at what I'd call typical margins relative to the rest of the business or to the mix, so no real difference on that in the gross margin line.  Commissions to some extent were accounted for in prior quarters but some of that's a function of shipment and so it is a function of revenue recognition, so it's not quite fewer in that way either but overall, the margin impact of the Verizon deferrals being recognized was not significant one way or the other. Wasn't really better and wasn't really worse.  With regard to the distinctions between SLT infrastructure and enterprise service provider, one of the reasons we report precisely on SLT and infrastructure as products is because you can, when you get an invoice or a purchase order and send an invoice out with a product number on it, you can unambiguously obviously determine the product type and therefore, we can provide financially sound results that are specifically representative of product.  One of the challenges with enterprise versus service provider and why some of the same specificity is not really available is because you can ship a product to a service provider who resells it to an enterprise customer in one case in which would make it an enterprise, really in terms of in the where used analysis, it would be enterprise business even though your purchase order came from the service provider.  They could put it into a managed service and then sell the tariff services which once again on a where used basis is sort of enterprise but not exactly, or not as easy to determine, and you can also ship product to a service provider who sends you again that service provider base PO but actually deploys it in his own internal network in which case that's really an enterprise.  And so it's not possible or at least let me put it this way, we're not comfortable and we don't think it's possible to report with the same specificity as you can in unambiguous product model numbers, the allocation of revenues between enterprise and SLT or service provider and infrastructure products, so there for, what you see in very specific terms is the reported revenues on a product basis and then what you see in slightly more general terms is the reference to the enterprise and service provider markets.  We are always working to get better visibility so that we can make better decisions here, but it doesn't lend itself to the same precision that the product based analysis does or product based revenue tracking. 
Ehud Gelblum - J.P. Morgan: Okay, I understand. Can you give us a hint though on between the infrastructure and the SLT business which has a higher gross margin, because even though Verizon came in at an average infrastructure gross margin, was that the skew of this quarter revenue wise was certainly towards the infrastructure and that was helped by Verizon. I wonder if that had an impact to your gross margin in this quarter. 
Scott Kriens: The actual standard margins aren't all that different between the two, and so even in a mix, no matter how you cut it actually because if you go to the more detailed question you're asking, no matter how you slice this either Verizon deferrals from the project that are now recognized or potentially disproportion at contribution to infrastructure versus SLT, it's kind of apples and apples and apples. It doesn't really effect things much one way or the other. 
Ehud Gelblum - J.P. Morgan: Okay, a lot of apples there so finally then, what was the main reason for gross margin growing in this quarter? 
Scott Kriens: Yes, we said that that was mix. Various products, well within those categories you're talking about have different margins and then also, we sell chassis and the interface boards separately and they have different margins and so from quarter-to-quarter we have fluctuations and the mix, which between the products and the percentage of interface boards that we sell and that actually causes greater fluctuations in gross margin than the sort of the other factors you were talking about. 
Ehud Gelblum - J.P. Morgan: And we expect that to stay pretty much constant for the rest of the year or at least in Q2? 
Scott Kriens: Well, we said it would stay roughly in those span going forward but there's definitely a range. It's going to be lumpy. 
Ehud Gelblum - J.P. Morgan: Okay. Thank you very much.

Scott Kriens: Thanks, Randi. Good afternoon to everyone, and thank you all for joining us.  Today, I'd like to start with the review of the fourth quarter and then the full year of 2006 for both service provider and enterprise businesses and markets and then look forward to trends and opportunities we see for 2007. And after that, I will then turn it over to Bob to review more of the details of our recent performance and provide you with some thoughts on guidance.  So first to the fourth quarter's performance. From a financial perspective, we had the largest revenue quarter in the history of the Company. We met many of our internal targets and metrics, and we're pleased with the mix of business.  Revenue grew to $595.8 million in the fourth quarter, representing growth of 4% quarter-over-quarter and 4% year-over-year. Both Ericsson and Siemens were each responsible for 10% of the revenue for the quarter, with Siemens being the larger of the two, which has been typical over the past quarters.  And on the balance sheet, cash increased by more than $200 million for the quarter to total cash balances of more than $2.6 billion at yearend. This was made possible by progress in both of our markets, service provider and enterprise. Let's look at each separately, as well as our services business overall.  On the service provider side, we've recognized infrastructure revenues of more than $350 million for the quarter, an increase of 2% from the third quarter. And this was driven by a good balance of business in wireline, wireless, cable and the emerging content providers. These are the segments we track within the general category of service providers. And clearly, all are responding to the market opportunities they see and making decisions accordingly.  On the product front, we saw increasing traction on the multiservice edge for the recently released M120, witnessed by orders for more than 200 units from a variety of customers. And carrier customers are very interested in our new Carrier Ethernet product, the MX960 where we received orders there as well.  We also continued to see a very strong performance from the T-series product line and a very high percentage of network traffic worldwide passing through the Juniper core backbone networks deployed throughout our global service provider customer base. And while E-series' recognized revenue was down due to deferrals and product transitions, orders were solid.  We saw a good growth in security products overall, as I will describe in a moment, when we talk about the enterprise business. But we also specifically saw security products growth in the service provider markets.  While we're encouraged by the early signs we've seen in this most recent quarter, it also remains true that we're in the early stages of several new product cycles. And we'll need to see more design wins, more testing by our customers, and overall more confirmation of our technologies to be convinced of our momentum.  From a market share perspective, Synergy Research Group and the most recent reports continues to rank Juniper as the number two supplier worldwide in total service providing routing, core service provider routing, BRAS or broadband access, and multiservice edge.  So now, let's shift and take a look at the enterprise business. We recognized SLT revenues of more than $130 million for the quarter, an increase of 7% from Q3, which was driven by a good balance of business across each geography as well as strength in our federal marketplace.  The strength was a function of both typical yearend seasonality and solid execution from our enterprise go-to-market programs. Much of this effort was made possible this quarter by the continuing performance of our partners and the improving reliability of our distribution model.  I'll talk more about this in the full year review and the 2007 outlook. On the product side, I won't comment on every product here, as Bob will provide details in a few minutes, but the headline is that routing and security and application acceleration solutions are being sold together and the assumptions on which our development priorities are founded that these trends will continue and accelerate are continuing to play out in the marketplace.  We also remain in the Gartner leader's quadrants in each of the product categories in which we participate, which is further evidence of not just the right technology, but the right technology roadmaps as well.  Overall, we're pleased with our continued momentum in the enterprise market, as evidenced by our number two market share position in both the high-end enterprise routing market and the worldwide security market according to Infonetics Research.  And finally, a few comments on the services business, which we report as a combined business in support of both the enterprise and the service provider markets. This is an easy story to tell, with revenues in the fourth quarter of approximately $113 million, up 6% from Q3 due to an increase in the installed customer base.  Also important here is that we're improving our customer satisfaction levels, an important metric -- it may be the most important metric, actually -- but certainly one that we must constantly increase in parallel with our financial growth to be sure that the Juniper brand is represented properly. And we expect that this aspect of our business will continue to meet our financial and customer goals in both marketplaces.  So with that said about the fourth quarter, I'd like to provide you a perspective of 2006, which was also the year that Juniper celebrated its 10th anniversary. The first thing to know is that there's more to say that we have time for, since our beginnings now more than 10 years ago -- a time during which we have seen astronomical growth, historic downturn with bursting of the bubbles, and lots of lessons learned both before and after.  And so, therefore, I will only offer a few numbers to provide a perspective of where we have come to from literally zero not long ago. Today, we have a total installed base of $8.6 billion across more than 100 countries worldwide, which comes from more than 400,000 units shipped to more than 20,000 customers through the help of more than 9,000 partners.  We've invested almost $2 billion and more than 7,000 person years of research and development during our now almost 11 calendar years of innovation and have a broad portfolio of technology, products and patented intellectual property, with which to enter our next decade as a company.  And our sales and marketing machine has grown to more than 1,500 Juniper employees, and we'll spend more than $0.5 billion dollars in 2007 to further capitalize on our position, in addition, of course, to the many partners that I mentioned earlier.  More recently, and as we look back across 2006, we've intensified the focus on our two markets. We were presented with many opportunities for distraction, both inside and outside of the Company, with industry consolidation, speculation, a typical competition, and as always plenty of declarations from all of the participants.  And in 2006, coming off a year of 50% growth in 2005, we're able to grow our business in 2006 by approximately 12% year-over-year. And very important to our strategy, we were able to generate increases to our cash balances of approximately $650 million in 2006 compared to the cash with which we began the year.  As we discussed late last year, the stock option investigation findings have shown that we should have had better stock option granting processes, controls and oversight in place and we did not. I would like to reiterate that while we can't change the past, we continue to focus going forward on the filing of our financial statements in this first quarter of 2007, further improving the robustness of the company's stock option granting procedures and the ongoing cooperation with government agencies.  As always, we remain focused on our strategy, and the associated execution required to capitalize on our position. In 2006, we sought significant opportunity in the market for network infrastructure and our overall focus as a company will remain on developing the leverage from crosspollination of our technology, between service providers and enterprises, and the expanded presence with both types of customers, which in effect doubles our total addressable market.  In the service provider marketplace, we saw major NGN wins, witnessed by over 2,500 units of the T series installed base in North America, EMEA and selective countries in Asia, as well as numerous multi-play decisions that went in our favor.  As I mentioned in the examples during Q4, we have seen keen interest in our new products and more broadly, the general direction of our portfolio. We would all like to see our new products delivered faster, especially our customers, who have confirmed both the demand for our technology and their alignment with our development priorities.  We have begun to see an increasing level of interest in the Juniper security portfolio and a growing number of service providers using our security products. In fact, a number of service providers buying our security products is up by 50% in the last 12 months. Products for both managed service offerings and outsource solutions for their customers, which is especially important because these value-added examples are highly strategic for providers in their markets.  We delivered the products we had planned to deliver in 2006 and we did so with the knowledge that the length of the development, the testing and the acceptance cycles involved with these products in these markets are long. We'll see as the full year of 2007 unfolds just exactly how these products and programs will translate into revenue growth, but our investment cycle is far from complete, and we have a lot of work to do.  We have made good progress in this last year, and we're building a portfolio in a market with solid demand for IP infrastructure. In the enterprise business, there's also metrics to indicate our progress. We saw growth in SLT revenues of 20% for the year, and with over 20,000 enterprise customers and the investments we made in over 9,000 channel partners, we saw our enterprise business grow more than 25% since the beginning of the year.  This was made possible primarily by increasing momentum in the second half, which gives us better visibility, as we enter 2007. We're coming up on the third year of entering the enterprise market since we made our NetScreen acquisition decision in 2004 and several observations can be made in hindsight.  First, it's taken longer than we would all have liked to get the traction and to establish the go-to-market momentum that we'll ultimately need. And in fact, it's an ongoing project today, even though we've seen good progress in these recent quarters. That said, we have seen the primary principle of the market entry division prove to be increasingly correct. We had the opportunity to leverage our best in class technology and the ability to double our total available market and therefore we remain committed to our strategy.  In fact, year after year, we have been consistently positioned in Gartner's leader quadrants in all the areas and the security in which we focus. Fire wall, intrusion protection, SSL/VPNs, IP Sec VPNs as well as WAN, optimization. And we have also seen standalone products in the market begin to give way to increasingly integrated products as reflected by the success of our SSG and ISG families.  And we are breaking into accounts and developing new partners where we haven't had the chance to participate in the past. A point that underscores the more recent impact of our increased focus of our dedicated resource alignment with the enterprise partners and the customers we serve together.  In the final analysis, at least for the story that's unfolded thus far in the early years, across this enterprise market, a higher degree of difficulty than we anticipated, with growing evidence of the efforts being worth the work and a lot of work to do to realize our full potential.  And for our services business, the foundation that has been built as the source of solid results for the year, we grew the services business a significant 40% from 2005 to 2006. We realize that 25% increase in the number of strategic consulting engagements in the year, as we increasingly assist both service provider and enterprise customers in designing, implementing and optimizing their networks.  And as I said earlier, it's very important that we continue to improve upon our customer service and support as well, and we have done just that throughout the year. As an example, when we surveyed our enterprise customers and asked which of them are willing to recommend Juniper security products to others, we saw double-digit percentage improvement over last year. And in our service provider market, we enjoy satisfaction levels among the highest of any of their vendors.  So while 2006 certainly presented its challenges, it also gave us considerable evidence and confirmation in the assumptions on which our strategy is based. But as we also know, that was last year.  And so with that, let's look forward to 2007, and I'll talk about the challenges and the opportunities we see in what can certainly be called the dynamic marketplace. Our number one challenge, and therefore our priority for 2007, is to improve and scale our ability to execute. We've shown that when we focus, we can do this, and that we can earn the opportunities and the potential that we see as a result of being the best at what we do, and sticking to the markets in which we have differentiation and value to offer that is strategic to our customers.  The first news of 2007 and our first investment of the New Year in delivering on that execution priority is the appointment of Stephen Elop as our Chief Operating Officer, which we announced a few weeks ago. Steven and I have been in discussion about working together for many months. And the fit of his operating skills, his proven track record, and his past experiences in both the COO and CEO roles with public companies, and his alignment with the culture and the values we believe in here at Juniper make him an extraordinary fit for the team and the company. And we're already making strides together in the early days.  Steven reports directly to me and has shared responsibility for the business results and the delivery of the outlook we'll share with you today. And he's directly focusing on daily execution and what we call as operational excellence. And as CEO, I will continue to be ultimately responsible for the company's overall business and financial results and performance, as well as the company's strategy, positioning, communications and our talent development.  In 2007, our strategy remains as we shared with all of you in the past, be the best supplier of traffic processing infrastructure. This is a $20 billion market and we're a $2 billion company. So the headroom and the opportunity we see in our markets remains intact. With that, there's also risk. And we evaluate our risk of success with our strategy on several fronts.  Firstly, technology. Can we leverage our learning and real world experience with continued investment to preserve our competitive advantage? On this front, the short answer is yes. And we see a clear path to leverage our portfolio systems and software, particularly our JUNOS operating system, and barriers to entry in the network infrastructure and integrated security markets are high and getting higher. While competition will always be respected and analyzed here at Juniper, we see and our customers reaffirm that what we do is important to them and where we are going is where they need to go.  Secondly, distribution. Can we get our advantages into the hands of our partners and customers and could we deliver the value proposition over the noise of others in a way that will resonate with buyers? Here we see a market where there's room for a very limited number of suppliers and what we offer is both scarce in the marketplace and strategic to our customers. This reduces the degree of difficulty with distribution, even with the frenetic marketing that we see from others in this industry. So while there's never ending work to do here and plenty to improve upon, as I spoke of earlier, there's more opportunity than risk to Juniper.  So the third risk is demand. If we build it and we take it to the market, do people need it and will they come and then need more of it after that? The answer in numbers is that the market is projected to grow by double-digit percentages for many years for everyone, before any share gain opportunity for Juniper. And every indicator is that demand will increase before it decreases. So this is probably the lowest risk of all. In fact, in a recent keynote, Michael Bell noted that YouTube by itself uses as much bandwidth as the entire Internet did in the year 2000. And that's only one example.  And then, finally in this market and the service provider market in particular, is the risk to Juniper of consolidation. Will the convergence of either suppliers or customers somehow fundamentally impair our ability at Juniper to participate in these markets? Well, first and most straightforward probably is customer consolation, which has been long predicted and is happening as many have forecasted. And the overall effect is to build stronger customers through needed consolidation in markets where scale is important.  Stronger customers make for better markets, as long as there are not more suppliers than customers and overall demand. So when suppliers consolidate, it's also healthy in that as we say here it gets the spectators off the field. It also makes for larger competitors. So we're not naive to think that there's no issue to address.  And so, here's the guiding principle. It doesn't matter what suppliers want to sell. It matters what customers want to buy. And customers who build and depend on their businesses running on the network can't afford to compromise in their decisions about how to deploy and secure that network, and those networks have to be smart, because they are strategic to the success of the business. A dumb strategic asset is a bad business decision.  So that means that the quality of the solution and the underlying technology matters a lot. If this market one day becomes more commodity-like and convenience matters more than performance, then we'll change our strategy accordingly, but not only is that not happening, the needle is pointing in the opposite direction. Networks and the security of the network are more strategic and valuable than ever and in that environment, being the best matters.  And so our strategy will remain focused on what the customers want to buy. These are the rules that we all, the suppliers, must live by and this belief will continue to underpin our strategy at Juniper.  So as we look across our marketplace in 2007, we see more opportunity than risk, and therefore, the need to prioritize the improvement of our own execution. We've made a lot of progress, and we expect continuing evidence of that progress in the quarters to come. And with that said, we still have a lot of work to do.  We will continue to invest and to look outward to capture more of the $20 billion market opportunity that's out there to be addressed. And we'll also continue to look inward to deliver the operational excellence and to invest in the talent we have assembled and the technology that we have developed.  All of this is possible, only with the support of our employees, whose continued commitment and incredible efforts make three results possible as well as our many partners, our customers, our suppliers and our long-term shareholders. I'd like to thank you all for your continued support and confidence in Juniper Networks.  And, Bob, I'll now turn the all over to you. 
Bob Dykes: Thanks, Scott. As a reminder, Juniper is not in a position to announce detailed financial results for the fourth quarter and 2006 as we are in the process of restating historical financial statements. Juniper will not be discussing any GAAP metrics that are affected by stock option expense. Although, we are unable to announce these GAAP metrics, we are providing as much information as possible around most non-GAAP metrics.  Please note that these numbers are preliminary and represent our forecast of what we believe the numbers would be without any impact or changes resulting from the restatement. I would like to reiterate that we intend to file our 10-Qs for the second and third quarter of 2006 during Q1 and come in compliance with the NASDAQ listing qualifications at that time.  As previously announced, NASDAQ listing panel had given Juniper until February the 12th to make these filings to avoid delisting. Recently, the NASDAQ Listing and Hearing Review Council advised us that any delisting determination has been stayed pending further review by the review council. We have been given until March the 30th to submit additional information to assistant their review. We anticipate filing -- our standing SEC filings before that date.  Now, let me get to Juniper's results for the fourth quarter with which I'm pleased. Now, as I take you through some of the detailed metrics, please remember that our business will be lumpy across all key metrics, including application and geography as well as by product mix and market segments.  Total reported revenue for Q4 was 595.8 million, an increase of 4% from Q3. I'm pleased to report that this is the largest amount of quarterly revenue recorded in Juniper's history. For the full year, 2006, revenue was 2.3 billion, an increase of 12% versus 2005. Looking back, you will see that in the last three years, we have almost doubled the size of the business from a revenue perspective. We are very pleased with this achievement and level of growth.  Having been able to report a full income statement on a non-GAAP basis and assuming no incremental stock-based compensation expense, our EPS results are in line with the guidance we provided last quarter of 19 cents. For our infrastructure products, we recognized product revenue of 352.6 million where we saw a 2% growth from Q3. The infrastructure products for the full year compared with 2005 increased by approximately 3%.  The slower than historical review growth is mainly due to revenue deferred from Verizon as well as the NGN pause in Asia. We are pleased, however, with the level of growth we saw in infrastructure product shipments, which grew approximately 12% for the full year of 2006 compared with 2005.  We recognized revenue on a total of 2,452 infrastructure units this quarter, and we shipped 39,326 infrastructure ports, both down from last quarter. The decline is due to a mix of higher end products.  This quarter, the core represented greater than 50% relative to the edge. We are extremely pleased with our continued strength in the core. Here are a few data points. We sold over 200 units of T-series in Q4. In fact, during the fourth quarter, we had the largest number of units booked ever.  For 2006, we recorded over a 0.5 billion in T-series revenue, which is up over 40% from '05. This represents these products as we support NGN build-outs and further reinforces the fact that our customers have accepted the JUNOS operating system and architecture for scaling the core and for based on the market.  On the edge, we saw some good strength with the M120 Multiservice Edge Router, which we announced this summer. And we have already received orders for the M960, which is currently scheduled to ship by the end of Q1.  The service led technology segment performed well. The segment includes firewall, SSL, IDP and other security products as well as J Series and application acceleration solutions. Revenue for Q4 totaled $130.5 million, up over 7% versus Q3 due to typical Q4 enterprise seasonality and the improved focus of our sales effort in penetrating the enterprise market.  Quarter-over-quarter, we saw especially good growth in SSL, IDP and J Series; in addition, the DX and WX warp. We also saw good growth from the ISG 2000 and the SSG family as we are starting to see the market transition towards integrated security platforms. We are pleased with the full year SLT growth of 20% versus 2005, as our investments in sales and R&D are beginning to pay off.  Now for some detail on elements within our business. The total service revenue was $112.7 million, up approximately 6% from last quarter. This increase was due mainly to growth in the contract and install base. For the full year 2006, service revenue was $410.2 million, up 40% from 2005. The total book-to-bill ratio was greater than one in the quarter.  Siemens was a strong contributor in the fourth quarter, representing approximately 13% of total revenue and for the full year of 2006, Siemens represented approximately 14% of total revenue. Ericsson represented 10% of total revenue this quarter. Ericsson revenue was from sales to customers from both Europe and Asia, the majority for core applications.  From a geographic perspective, the Americas represented 44% of total revenue in Q4, up slightly through Q3. The Americas group, 11% from 2005 to 2006. We have a very strong core in EMEA, representing 38% of total revenue in Q4 with particular strength in the UK, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Norway.  EMEA grew 33% from 2005 to 2006, showing good strength across the region. We have seen very good momentum in the areas where we have made investments, including Russia, the United Arab Emirates and other parts in the Middle East.  Asia represented 18% of total revenue, a decline from last quarter due to strength in Europe and the service provider lumpiness. If you may recall, we saw particular strength in China in Q3, given the wins in China telecom and China mobile. Asia was down 4% from 2005 to 2006, primarily due to NGN pause which we've discussed last year.  With regards to Japan, we expect decisions to be made over the next couple of quarters with revenue implications for '07. However, the choice of formal public comment and timing of the network rollout is up to our customers. We expect to see continued seasonality and lumpiness by theatre as quarterly trends fluctuate.  Revenue through our direct sales was approximately 26% versus 23% last quarter, as we saw some strength in our America service provider business. We remain pleased with the expansion and the leverage of our channel presence.  Non-GAAP gross margins were up from Q3, slightly better than expected due to a good mix of products and seasonality. Non-GAAP operating expenses, which excludes amortization of purchased intangibles, stock compensation expense, stock option requiring tax expense and acquisition, restructuring and related costs were up by approximately 8% compared with Q3.  On an absolute dollar growth basis, the primary increase was in sales as we continue to invest in our global sales force. We saw an increase in R&D on an absolute dollar basis, as we focus on internal product integration and innovation. We're also making good progress in the cost reduction efforts.  This past February, at our Analyst Day, I set out a goal for the Company to enter 2007 with 30% of our manufacturing in Asia. And I'm very pleased to report that we have achieved this goal. In 2007, we'll continue to focus on low cost geographies for both the R&D and manufacturing.  Non-GAAP, net interest and other income was up about 8% versus Q3. This increase was primarily due to an increase in our cash position. Operating margin came in slightly lower in Q3, as we increased operating expenses, offset by the one-time credit received in the renewal of the US federal R&D tax credit in December of 2006.  Our 2006 annual non-GAAP tax rate decreased by 1% from 29% to 28% to principally to the renewal, which for our Q4 tax rate down to 25%. I will speak more about our operating margins later in my comments.  Now, a few comments regarding the balance sheet. I am pleased with our cash flow this quarter. Cash, cash equivalents, short and long-term investments creased by $200 million to $206 billion. Net accounts receivable was $249 million, and day sales outstanding was 38 days compared with 45 days last quarter, due to the strength of our internal collections effort and quickly in the R&D for the quarter.  As stated last quarter, we expected DSOs to be in the range of 40 to 45 days, depending on the mix of partners and linearity. Total deferred revenue was $386 million, compared with $346 million in last quarter, mainly due to the increase in service contracts. As a reminder, deferred revenue is made up of service, channel inventory, and product currently unrecognizable for revenue.  CapEx was $33 million. Depreciation was $20.7 million during the quarter. We ended the quarter with 4,833 in total headcount, up from 4,613 at the end of Q3. The majority of the headcount increase was in sales, service and R&D, with almost 50% of the total increase in the low-cost geographies of China and India.  Now for guidance. We will continue to focus on our financial fundamentals and please remember, it is difficult to predict the level of business each quarter but we are managing the financial plan and we would like to share some data with you. We will be providing guidance for the first quarter and for the full year of 2007.  As the business grows larger and more diverse, the performance has become somewhat more predictable and we are able to make a reasonable judgment on longer term horizons.  The following forecast and guidance is non-GAAP and forward-looking statements, actual results can vary for a number of readings including those mentions in the most recent 10-Q filed with the SEC, as well as in the impact resulting from the further restatement.  We expect revenue for Q1 in the range of $615 million to $625 million. For the full year 2007, we expect revenue in the range of $2.06 billion to $2.7 billion. For the first half of '07, we expect to recognize revenue from Verizon of over $40 million.  That was deferred as previously discussed this last year $40 million. We will use this as an opportunity to increase backlog, which improves linearity and predictability of shipments in future quarters.  As a reminder, in any given quarter, there are product and service-related entries in and out of deferred revenue as required by GAAP. For Q1, we expect gross margins to come down from Q4, and fluctuate slightly for the reminder of the year. The expected tax rate for the year is 28%.  We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.19 for Q1 and $80 to $0.81 for the full year. For Q1 and the full year, we expect expenses to grow in life with revenue. As a result, we expect operating margins to stabilize and remain at the current level of approximately 20% in order to sufficiently invest in our growth.  We are committed to growing revenues, earnings and cash generation on an absolute basis and market share and we intend to do so at the highest level of operating margin as possible. We return to the long-term operating model as a function of significant sustained revenue growth.  The book of the investments being made will be in sales and R&D as we continue to focus on internal innovation. The investments have been driven by the demands of our customers and the increasingly strategic network of their networks.  As Scott, discussed earlier, we are confident for the opportunities in a market place. Juniper is a $2 billion company and a $20 billion market. On the service provider side, we see NGN build outs and IP video as substantial opportunities over model for years, based on trends in the enterprise, we have a huge opportunity to leverage our strength in routing, security and application acceleration.  As usual, a GAAP EPS target is not accessible on a forward-looking basis due to high variability and low visibility with respect to the nonrecurring charges, which are suited for the non-GAAP estimates. So that completes my remarks and now we would like to take questions. Please limit yourself to one question. Thank you. 
Randi Feigin: Dave, can you please instruct the audience regarding the queuing process? Dave? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions].  Our first question comes from the line of Scott Coleman of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question, sir. 
Scott Coleman - Morgan Stanley: Sure. Thank you and good afternoon. If I could just ask if you could go over your comments on operating expenses in the quarter. I'm not sure I got all of the details on that. And secondly, I'm wondering if you could help us understand from a partner perspective what your expectations are from Alcatel, Lucent as you go into 2007. Thank you. 
Scott Kriens: Well, what I said on our non-GAAP operating expenses, which is amortization of purchase intangibles and stock compensation expense that they are up approximately 8% compared with Q3. And I said on an absolute dollar basis, the primary increase was in sales as we continue to envision our global sales force and also increased R&D on an absolute dollar basis. 
Bob Dykes: And on the partner side of things with Alcatel Lucent. We continued to see, particularly with John Meyer and the system integration business there, continued opportunities.  One of the things we announced last quarter was the renewal of a three-year agreement, which will take us out over now the next three years with them as partners in both the continuing support of a number of existing networks that we have developed together, as well as opportunities in new markets and new networks.  So we're not unaware of the other aspirations that some of the product groups inside Alcatel Lucent have, but, again, the customers continue to drive us to working together and both companies realize that. Not only have John and I had the conversation but Pat and I as well, but the commitment between the two companies to continue and develop their relationship is ongoing. 
Scott Coleman - Morgan Stanley: So if I could just ask one follow-up, you are obviously guiding for very strong topline growth next year. Is it reasonable for us to assume that revenue through that particular channel is going to grow in line with company expectations a little more or a little less? 
Scott Kriens: Actually, the -- it would probably be false precision to make the -- in guidance we have given more granular than it's been. I don't know -- I don't have any reason to suspect increases or declines, but, you know, the years got a long ways to go and the strength of the guidance that we've given, is not a function of any particular relationship or any particular account for geography.  It actually reflects more the diversity of the business and what we see across the geographies, the emerging markets and countries in the world, the vertical segments we focused on, the service provider, the enterprise. So the guidance is much more a function of that diversity than it is any particular partnership or account situation. 
Scott Coleman - Morgan Stanley: Great. Thanks, guys. 
Scott Kriens: All right, thanks, Scott. 
Randi Feigin: And next question please. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nikos Theodosopoulos of UBS. Please proceed sir. 
Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS: Yes, thank you. I had a clarification and a question. On the Verizon deferred revenue of $40 million, do you expect that to get recognized all in one quarter or spread out over the first two quarters? I'm trying to understand how that's going to flow. And then my question is, you know, given the -- we haven't -- the 10-Qs haven't been filed in the last couple of quarters, can you give us some kind of estimate on the operating margin of infrastructure versus SLT?  If I go back to the first quarter, where the Q was published, you know, you gave us some operating margin in the Qs there. I'm trying to get a sense over the course of the year, what's happened with the margin of those businesses? Have they stayed the same or changed? Thank you. 
Scott Kriens: Well, the fifth item on the infrastructure business, the SLT profitability, you know, we haven't actually provided anymore detail than, you know, we actually been -- because we can't promise those GAAP results. We haven't provided that type of information, but, you know, there isn't any reason to believe that there would be wild fluctuations from the historical, we continue to invest in both areas quite heavily.  So I wouldn't -- I don't think that there is worth while having further granularity than that. And on your first question, on Verizon, we -- as I said, we expect to recognize that during the first half. The time we recognized it, it will probably all happen in one step, but we haven't indicated exactly when that would be. But I do want to stress that we're planning to use that really to help us build our backlog during that period.  So please don't be looking for any one-time blips in revenue. You know we have given our guidance for the first quarter and for the full year and, you know, expect all of those things to be taken into account. 
Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS: Okay. If I could just clarify a little bit, I guess while I was going on that question on the margin and SLT and infrastructure, you know, in the first quarter your operating margin was about 25%, this quarter was about 20%. I'm trying to get a sense that both SLT and infrastructure see a decline in margin from the first quarter or was it skewed to one of those two? 
Scott Kriens: We continue to invest across the board in -- you know, we brought out a lot of new products in the IPG space. We continue to invest in the SLT, well our enterprise sales force, but it partly affects the SLT, etcetera. So, you know, we've been quite aggressive across both aspects of really investing heavily for the growth of our business in 2007. So I don't want to give a specific answer to your question, but you can be sure that we were investing across the board. 
Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS: Thank you. 
Bob Dykes: It's also, Nikos, our last perspective on that for you. That the -- a lot of the investment we make in R&D is leveragable across both markets. And so sometimes precise allocation is a bit, not arbitrary, but it's certainly not scientific as if they were two totally different markets. So the resulting margin contributions are a little difficult to be precise with even as we do look to understand that better ourselves.  And that's actually a strength, because the leverage of being able to make an investment in router development or security development and then be able to present that across both markets is -- is part of the strategy. It's certainly true that they go to market cost, marketing and sales is higher in enterprise and therefore the operating contributions are lower. But it's a little bit hard to split the entire thing for that reason. 
Randi Feigin: Dave, next question please. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani of Merrill Lynch. Please proceed. 
Tal Liani - Merrill Lynch: Hi, guys. Question -- just a clarification and the question. First, any tax credit you had, R&D tax credit you had this quarter? And what is the sort of EPS impact of it, just to adjust your guidance for the year, to compare to consensus, if there was any credit?  My question goes back to the question that, Nikos asked, but I want to ask it in a different way. If you look at the margin evolution since June of '05, your operating margins went down every quarter, operating margin from 28% down to 20. There were some market share losses in router and there was a mix shift to enterprise and you had the buildup of enterprise channels, so all of these factors were in there.  Now you are saying that margins will stabilize at 20%. So what -- what do you expect to change in this equation, in this factors, that drove margins down going forward? What do you expect to change that will drive stabilization of operating margin? Thank you. 
Bob Dykes: So first of all, on the tax credit, as I mentioned, this year will be running with a 29% tax rate, and we indicated that for the full year that tax credit pulled our tax rate down from 29 down to 28%, in the fourth quarter it reduced to 25%.  But before you add that difference back in and say, well, you know, that was a difference that we should have recorded as an overachievement, in actual fact we saw that coming and we deliberately decided to accelerate some of our investments into Q4, so that we would meet the analyst expectations.  So it was a deliberate investment by our part to do exactly what the government intended, which was to use that tax credit to invest in R&D in the United States, and so we are able to do it quite efficiently at the end of the quarter, so I don't think you should add that money back. We anticipated coming down to that and spent accordingly.  With regard to the decline in margin from 28% down to 20% as you mentioned. The way you described it, it makes it sound like the margins were coming down because of pricing or other things like that.  We should note that our gross margins actually stayed very stable, right through this period, so that decline doesn't represent pressure from our customers or pressure from the marketplace. That decline represents a very deliberate effort on our part to increasing investments in the business.  And so just deliberately, we believe that we can hold it at the 20% that I've mentioned here. So we're not under competitive pressures, we are not under pressures from the market. We are deliberately investing in our business to grow through the next few years. So that's what gives us confidence that we can hold it at that number. 
Tal Liani - Merrill Lynch: So the Delta should be going forward what the implied guidance, is that, or the implied direction is that operating expenses going forward should remain at a constant level as a percentage of sales? 
Bob Dykes: That's exactly what I said, yes. 
Randi Feigin: Dave, next question, please? 
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Jeff Evanson of Sanford Bernstein. Please, proceed, sir. 
Jeff Evanson - Sanford Bernstein: Thanks. In your EPS guidance for 2007, what assumptions did you make about share count and in particular the use of the $1 billion share buyback that was approved in 2006? 
Bob Dykes: If we didn't, there is not specific because such a share buyback of these types of stock prices would result in about, you know, no change to the EPS, so you can actually do it either way. 
Jeff Evanson - Sanford Bernstein: Thanks. 
Randi Feigin: Dave, next question, please. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line Tim Long of Bank of America. Please proceed, sir. 
Tim Long - Bank of America: Thank you. Just a question on the Carrier Ethernet side, can you talk a little bit about the MX960, you said you'll be shipping the end of the quarter and you have been taking some orders there. Just give us a little bit of color, are these mostly existing customers?  How much interest has there been so far? And if at all at this point, do you think there's potentially any cannibalization of other Juniper edge products with the Ethernet product going out to the customers? Thanks. 
Scott Kriens: Tim, on the subject of Ethernet and MX960 in particular, it's a little early to know on the question of cannibalization or other impact. Most of it represents new market opportunity. So I -- while there maybe some of that, I don't expect it to be pervasive. And in terms of the early trials and adoptions here, it is primarily within our existing customer base. But then it's also important to remember that the top 40 customers are all Juniper customers.  So it would take a lot of work to find a non-Juniper customer to take it to, and especially in the early days. So I would say, although, we've seen some -- what I call encouraging early activity, that really we have to watch and see the acceptance cycles run through beyond just the first examples of revenue recognition that we expect to see and through full qualification, network design, deployment activities.  So I don't -- I think the jury is going to be out on that until beyond the first quarter even with early revenue recognition. That said, remember, that what's really happening here in the carrier Ethernet segment with the MX960, is the beginning of the end of the entire segment.  Because what we're really deploying is a pervasive operating system footprint that goes across the core, the aggregation, the multiservice edge within that work, and a single operating system footprint that is capable of being deployed from boundary-to-boundary and the service actually eliminates the reason for anyone to make a segmented decision, because that would mean unrelated operating systems, a checkerboard of architectures to try and pass seamless service through, and no one will do that once they see a proven alternative.  So, I don't think the segment disappears tomorrow. But clearly if what we believe to be true continues to play out and the feedback we've gotten materializes in the form of designs and deployments following these qualifications, then we're going to continue to see a lot more opportunity for MX960. 
Randi Feigin: Dave, next question. 
Tim Long - Bank of America: Okay. 
Scott Kriens: Thanks, Tim. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jiong Shao of Lehman Brothers. Please proceed, sir. 
Jiong Shao - Lehman Brothers: Thank you very much. I have a clarification and a question. In your OpEx for Q4, I think, if my math is roughly right, it's about $280 million. How much of that was for the sort of accounting restatement and legal expenses? How shall we think about that sort of going forward when that would taper off?  And then my question is on your guidance -- revenue guidance for Q1, obviously, you know, seasonally not so strong quarter. You're guiding sort of growth. I was wondering if you could expand a little bit on that, sort of -- some of the drivers behind that. Was that because of deferred revenue or is that because of orders you have on hand? Thanks a lot. 
Bob Dykes: Okay. Well, what you got to the OpEx that we have in Q4. There is no expense there for the stock option inquiry. I intend to take that out of our non-GAAP numbers. So that the historical numbers have a good basis for looking at the future numbers. I would normally exclude that type of thing from non-GAAP results. 
Scott Kriens: And then, Jiong on the subject of guidance and the source of it for the first quarter here, you are right, often it can be a somewhat softer quarter seasonally. We'll see if that proves to be true. But our guidance really is a function of two things. One, we do have a little better visibility as we look across the quarter and also that drove the reason for guidance over the full year.  And what we see is diversity. It's contributions from geographies and obviously established markets and countries throughout Europe, Asia and the Americas. And also, there are emerging markets, Eastern Europe, Middle East, the places where we're seeing increasing opportunity. And then, as we look across government, research, education, financial services, various cuts of the vertical marketplace we see opportunities.  So -- and then again, it runs across product in both the security and the routing and the application performance areas and the strength of our position in many of the installed networks and customers both on the enterprise and service provider side.  So I guess the good news is the visibility and the reason for our perspective on all of this, from a guidance point of view is not really dependent on any one particular factor. It -- if he were to -- I suppose look for any downside in all of that, I guess there's also not any one dramatic spike in all of this. So what we do see is, is steadying opportunity and diversity across many, many factors of the business. 
Jiong Shao - Lehman Brothers: Okay. Thanks. 
Scott Kriens: Yeah. Thank you, Jiong. 
Randi Feigin: Dave, next question, please. 
Operator: Yes. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Mansky with Citigroup. Please proceed. 
Paul Mansky - Citigroup: Right, sir. Thank you. A quick clarification and then a question. Going back a few questions ago, you mentioned that you accelerated operating expense investment in Q4. Revenue is obviously up in March. Why shouldn't we be thinking about better than 20% operating margins for the March quarter.  And then longer term, you mentioned several times in the script about, you know, improved visibility and long-term cyclical strength, evidence of past expenses paying off and yet we're talking down operating margins, penning evidence of sustained revenue strength.  Maybe just to help us calibrate our models a bit here, can you give us a sense as to what you consider sustained strength either in absolute dollars or growth rates? 
Bob Dykes: So with regard to the Q4 flowing into the Q1, it's really the same reason that we had that spending increase in Q4 really raised to our plans for Q1. We've indicated that we're already invested in those business for growth.  We are a $2 billion company and a $20 billion market. And we have just a tremendous opportunity to invest in those business and gain market share on both the service provide and the enterprise side. And so, you know, we already spending against that objective of staying above the 20% operating margins.  So it's really, you know, there is always more things you can invest in than you could afford. But we think that we can optimize shareholder value by making these investments and continuing to grow our market share on both of those areas.  And, you know, again, I would reiterate that our gross margin has stayed reasonably stated. I mentioned that it might decline a little bit in Q1, but relatively steady during the year. So despite the increased visibility, it's our investment and our intention to make those investments that's causing us to say that that net operating margin is the most appropriate one to be guiding to.  Scott, would you like to add anything? 
Scott Kriens: Well, you know, Paul, I was just going to say, I asked that same question actually when people came to me with their spending plans. But the answer that I got back that was most compelling was here is the particular customer who is requesting this capability or this support or this coverage. And it was marquee customer after marquee customer.  And so what we set as a priority was growing absolute revenue, growing absolute operating income as opposed to percentage, and then growing and continuing to sustain the strong cash flow. And with that, we are also able to control the reporting of these kinds of numbers to grow market share.  And it isn't that the model and the operating percentages don't matter, and thus to Bob's point, drawing the line at 20% operating margin, but really the quality of the customers and the urgency of their requests is what convinced me that this is the right way to drive the business, presuming that we can deliver the absolute growth and sustain the cash flows from the business that we demonstrated in this most recent quarter, and then also as we are guiding to on our outlook for the year. So essentially, that's the thinking here and thus the guidance. 
Paul Mansky - Citigroup: All right. Thank you. 
Bob Dykes: All right, Paul, thank you. 
Randi Feigin: Dave, next question, please. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Daubenspeck of Pacific Crest Securities. Please proceed. 
Tim Daubenspeck - Pacific Crest Securities: Yes. Just maybe, you know the clarification question. Clarification, are you still committed to the $1 billion buyback? And the question is, is this a change in your gross margin outlook for the company?  You kind of said that Q1 gross margins would be down and do you still think, you know, 25-plus Op margin is the long-term target? 
Bob Dykes: So with regard to the buyback, that was announced last July, and it that would depend upon the market conditions at the time. So you know, when we executed on the last buyback, it was on -- either as -- among opportunist basis and so we will see how that evolves.  With regard to the gross margin outlook, actually, what I indicated isn't actually a change to our outlook because I've indicated previously that we expected a gross margin decline.  We have actually been surprised with the strength that we've been able to achieve with that our gross margins, so it really isn't a change. The 25% you say, there still is our objective to get back up to that number when we see strong sustained revenue growth. 
Tim Daubenspeck - Pacific Crest Securities: Thank you.  Randi Feigin:: Dave, we have time for one more question, please. 
Operator: Absolutely. The last question comes from the line of Mark Sue of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead, sir. 
Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets: Thank you. Scott, the top line growth numbers for 2005, what are you assuming for market growth. There's some indication that router growth may accelerate you know 15% because of video. Is it a market growth story, when it comes to Juniper routers or is there a specific plan to regain market share? 
Scott Kriens: Mark, the growth numbers of that compound growth numbers and the forecasts that I've seen across the next couple of three years depending on who you ask are somewhere in the low to mid-teens. And we are in the growth -- the guidance we've given or represent growth between 13% and 17%.  So its quiet possible there will be some share growth on our part assuming perhaps false supposition in all those guesses over the course of the year for years to come. But I think that what we see in the market -- and this is really the heart of why we see the opportunity as we do here. There is an escalating strategic value to the portfolio and the expertise that we have.  It's increasingly important to our partners and to our customers and to the customers of our customers, both employees and their customers in the enterprise marketplace as well as obviously subscribers in the service provider marketplace.  So the thing that drives us to the growth guidance we've given and to the strength we see in providing the visibility across all of 2007 is really the belief that while there is plenty of activity, there is consolidation right, left and center going on and there's marketing like crazy going on out there, there really still remains a very compelling strategic need for an increasingly scarce resource, which we are fortunate in enough to be building here and to have then building across, as we mentioned, now almost 11 calendar years and 7,000-plus person years of development.  And so while there's plenty of surrounding activity and commentary here, what we see is remaining completely and utterly focused on both execution, the accountability that goes with that execution and the demands that are being placed on the Company by these marquee customers I mentioned.  Those priorities drive, what Steve and myself, the management team here and now almost 5,000 people get up and do every day. And we see all of that translating into opportunity to perform and depending on how the market takes shape potentially to outperform.  So we're going to stay focused on the customers and on the things in which we believe and I'm sure the market share will take care of itself. 
Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you, and good luck. 
Scott Kriens: Thanks, Mark. We'll talk soon. 
Randi Feigin: We'd like to thank you all for your participation today. There will be an audio replay available of this call in the investor relations section of our website.

Operator: Welcome to the Juniper Networks third quarter financial results conference call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, October 18, 2006. I would now like to turn the conference over to Randi Feigin, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Randi Paikoff Feigin: Thank you, Gina. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me is Scott Kriens, our Chairman and CEO, and Bob Dykes, our CFO and Executive Vice President of Business Operations.  Today, Scott will provide some insight on the trends we have seen and expect to see in the service provider and enterprise markets, as well as discuss the fruits of Juniper’s innovation and, as a result, our opportunity and market position.  Following Scott’s comments, Bob will provide you with the progress we have made on the independent options investigation, some financial statistics for the quarter ending September 30, 2006, as well as outline some of our financial goals for the remainder of the year.  We will then open the call up for questions.  Before I turn the call over to Scott, I would like to remind you that the matters we will be discussing today may include forward-looking statements and as such, are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements, including those risks and uncertainties discussed in our most recent 10-Q filed with the SEC.  We will also be discussing some preliminary non-GAAP financial information but, due to the pending stock option investigation, we are not presenting complete GAAP financial statements, including a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP items.  However, a description of these items excluded in the non-GAAP financial information can be found on our investor relations webpage. Juniper Networks assumes no obligation and does not intend to update forward-looking statements made on this call.  Scott, I will turn it over to you. 
Scott G. Kriens: Thanks, Randi, and good afternoon, everybody. Today I will discuss the trends we see in the marketplace, as well as our status in both the service provider and the enterprise markets, and then I will spend some time discussing the announcements we made this morning regarding our carrier ethernet strategy and our new carrier ethernet portfolio, as well as some of the innovations across other areas of the product line. I will then turn it over to Bob to review more of the details of our recent performance and to provide you with guidance for the remainder of the year.  First, to the quarter’s performance, from a financial perspective, we are pleased to have met our targets, with revenues of $573.6 million, reflecting growth of 5% from Q3 of last year and 1% from the previous quarter in 2006, especially given the typical challenges of seasonality during the third quarter. For the first nine months of 2006, our business has grown approximately 15% when compared to the first nine months of 2005.  We are also very pleased with our cash generation of over $166 million during the third quarter, allowing us to build our cash balances to more than $2.4 billion. At the current contribution levels, we are generating over $0.5 billion in cash per year. This makes as strong a statement about the health of Juniper as any, I might add.  This cash has been generated from our success in both the service provider and the enterprise markets, so let’s look first at the service provider, and then we will talk about the enterprise.  We are seeing several trends in the service provider market today. We continue to see growth in IP traffic on service provider networks as a result of peer-to-peer interaction, broadband usage, video, and the increasing reliance on the IP network as a mission critical business tool in the strategies of our service provider customers and of their enterprise customers.  The quality and type of traffic is continuing to change from generic delivery of information to high demand voice and video, where managing traffic characteristics like latency and quality of service become increasingly important and play to the foundation and differentiation of what we can offer.  Just in the last week, with the Google and the YouTube news, we have seen the escalating importance of video on the network experiences of users and service providers.  The evolution of the worldwide demographics for consumer and user driven content, such as MySpace, is extending well beyond the school-aged population, increasing the opportunity for everyone involved.  We could cite other examples, but really the most compelling point is that today, almost no one debates these trends, their potential and their reliance on IP infrastructure for their success. With this assumption safely in hand, we also have a couple of beliefs about the Juniper opportunity and our position.  Our first belief: the service providers network requirements are becoming clearer and therefore, the Juniper solution and the differentiation we provide is becoming more apparent than ever to the marketplace and to our customers. We expect to see a continuing wave of NGN build-outs, with decisions made in favor of Juniper.  Our second belief, which defines the marketplace we are serving and is the basis for the strategy we are following, we define the market as: Today, industry followers measure these segments separately, as if they were standalone markets long-term, which we do not believe they are. They are elements of a single converging market, which we call IP infrastructure, and it is this total solution that will be required to meet customer demand.  To serve this market requires an operating system which can scale to meet capacity and volume of users and traffic, deliver the reliability to be mission critical, the intelligence to handle security and awareness of the traffic being delivered, and the performance to do all of that fast enough to meet the expectations for the experiences users demand when they dial a phone number or click on a movie site.  We rely consistently on our Junos operating system to meet these needs, and this is the power of our differentiation, relative to others, and the key to our opportunity to protect and extend our lead in the market.  Today, we announced another element of that strategy -- the MX960, which expands our Junos footprint into the multi-billion dollar, and rapidly growing, carrier ethernet segment of the IP infrastructure market.  Because the MX960 will run the same Junos operating system that our existing core and edge products run today, the MX960 is proven at scale on the first day it ships, and it joins an installed base of almost 30,000 M and P series routers deployed in hundreds of service providers around the world. Because we designed the MX960 from the ground up, it sets new benchmarks for density and corresponding price performance.  The early response from customers and industry experts has been extremely positive. Today, we change the game in this marketplace. No one has the proven reliability, the scale, the performance, and the integrated functionality we now deliver, and this matters a lot to our customers.  While on the topic of continued innovation, we have also seen very strong customer enthusiasm and acceptance of the E320 broadband services router, due to the recent enhanced capabilities and densities equating to better price performance and setting another benchmark for our customers, and raising the bar for the competition. This is represented by orders of almost 400 E320 units since the product was introduced.  Our next generation silicon, called the i-chip, was delivered in our new M120 router, which provides a denser and more cost-effective system. This is extremely compelling, given it is once again deliver Junos to the market in a smaller and a more competitive form factor.  Evidence of the impact of our innovation has been reflected in many ways. Our partners continue to endorse our approach, and both Siemens and Ericsson each represented greater than 10% of total revenue for the quarter.  Siemens sold our products in over 40 countries to some significant service providers, including DT, or Deutsche Telekom, Telstra, Telecom Italia, and Bell Canada.  Ericsson’s strength came from a wide range of activity across Asia, Europe, and the Americas, with shipments to more than 20 countries during the quarter, including large deployments at China Telecom and China Mobile. In addition, our ongoing relationship with Lucent and in turn, Alcatel, remains solid and we will continue to leverage our joint capabilities under a recently signed agreement and extension with Lucent.  We continue to be encouraged by the market share, as reported by both Informatics and Synergy Research Group, where Juniper is currently ranked number two worldwide in every major service provider market in which we compete, including total service provider routing, core service provider routing, broadband access, and multi-service edge.  Now, let’s switch gears to the enterprise market. Every day, we gain a clearer understanding of the similarities and the differences between the service provider requirements and those of the enterprises, and we continue to have a significant amount of R&D leverage across both customer segments.  First, to the trends in enterprise and the evolution to what is being call the real-time enterprise. The real-time enterprise faces two critical sets of simultaneous demands on the business. First, agility to meet business requirements, to move the business quickly based on daily economic or other factors, and second, intelligence, or the ability to protect users and information and, at the same time, deliver reliable state-of-the-art services across the enterprise, around the world in real time.  A survey conducted by The Economist recently asked business leaders of more than 4,000 companies in 23 countries to describe how business will change over the next five years and speed of execution was identified as the key management challenge, with more than 80% of the respondents saying that technology will be critical to supporting their company strategy.  Nearly 60% said IT is becoming more of a competitive tool rather than simply a driver of cost efficiency.  The powerful trend we see to deliver this speed of execution is the move by our customers to drive productivity through SOA. According to Gartner, SOA, or service oriented architectures, will provide the basis for 80% of new development projects by 2008 and yet, the interesting statistics provided by CIMI Corporation are that only 20% of enterprises have adequate SOA infrastructure.  So with these trends underway, let’s talk a minute about our beliefs as we pursue this opportunity.  There is an escalating awareness of the importance of the network in the SOA architecture, including performance, scale, resiliency and intelligence, and we believe that all of these attributes must be performed and delivered simultaneously without compromising any of the others. We see this every day.  Needless to say, it is a complex problem which changes quickly and has strategic importance to the business. These requirements are what Juniper has delivered against in response to demand among our service provider customers, and it is again the opportunity to differentiate as we compete in the enterprise market.  This is our sweet spot, and it has been for the last eight years. We believe there is another similarity that is even more powerful in the enterprise market than it has become thus far in the service provider market. There is an increasing value being placed on Juniper integration. This is evidenced by the continued success of our ISG platform, which is a product where we combine firewall and intrusion detection and prevention capabilities, and our SSG products, where we have brought together best-in-class firewall and security technologies with the best WAN routing capabilities.  All this adds up to an opportunity that we define as the power of the portfolio, and its power measured by both the breadth of the offerings, but equally important to our customers is the best-in-class quality of each element, and the integration of those elements.  Finally, they insist on a critical mass of resource and capability in areas like service and support. So when you add it up, Juniper is safer and more scaleable than point product companies, and better than the end-to-end proprietary solutions otherwise available, and this is a powerful and a unique combination.  Returns from the marketplace confirm our approach. We saw a very satisfying quarter from a revenue perspective, with growth of approximately 4% from Q2 of this year, and 13% from the third quarter of last year in our SLT products, which are sold primarily into the enterprise market.  The mix of our enterprise business is similar to last quarter, growing approximately 12% from the third quarter of last year.  Our new and integrated ISG products that I mentioned earlier have allowed us to regain the number one high-end firewall position at 35%, according to Infonetics, and we now have an expanded family of SSG products, which we recently enhanced with nine new offerings at lower price points and with more powerful combinations of highly integrated functionality.  You will see more from us in the area of integration, and we expect the integrated portfolio to become an increasingly larger contributor to revenue over the next several quarters.  Also of note, and for the first time, Juniper has taken over the number two slot in worldwide network security, according to Infonetics, and we remain number one in worldwide SSLVPN markets, with over two times the market share of any other vendor in this space. We moved up a market position with our intrusion detection, or IDP products, as well.  Earlier this week, we also announced several new enterprise data center products. On the WAN optimization front, we introduced the new WXC590 and new versions of our operating and management systems. In addition, we introduced the DX3280 and 3680 platforms, and a new version of the DX operating system, which broadens the suite of products and functionality across the data center application acceleration and load balancing market places.  In addition, we have already seen good interest from the enterprise for our new M120 router, which we believe will further enhance our number two high-end enterprise routing position worldwide, where we currently enjoy 28% market share, according to Synergy Research Group.  These new data center products and features, coupled with the new M120 router, provides a best-in-class comprehensive solution for enterprise data centers.  As an endorsement of our best-in-class products, coupled with the ability to provide a comprehensive solution, we have repeatedly been listed in Gartner’s leaders quadrant for every security area we focus on, and today, that is five in all -- intrusion prevention, the SSLVPNs, IP sec VPNs, or virtual private network capabilities, enterprise firewalls and, for the first time, they published the WAN optimization leaders quadrant, and we are there as well.  We continue to increase the profitability and penetration, with now more than 10,000 enterprise customers worldwide, and in addition, we now have products deployed in 90 of the 100 largest enterprises, with major wins like the M&J series products recently announced at the Philadelphia stock exchange, and the DX product at Dow Corning.  Our innovation and market momentum have also allowed us to build partnerships with other market leaders, such as Symantec, with whom we announced a key relationship this last quarter. Our joint solutions will be based on open standards and will deliver better security intelligence, faster response for security threats, and comprehensive coverage of the threat landscape.  Since the announcement, we have seen good reception from the market place, and we are working hand-in-hand to capitalize on the opportunities we are seeing. This is the kind of partnership that has the same power to influence our growth as the many successful partnerships we have enjoyed across the service provider marketplace since the early days of Juniper.  In summary, I would like to offer a perspective on both the challenges and the opportunity.  We are very enthusiastic about the opportunities, but with that, there are, of course, some challenges. One is balancing the investment opportunity with the business model. Similar to last quarter, we are currently experiencing a reduction in our operating margins as a result of investment in the enterprise opportunity, but we are a $2 billion company in a $20 billion market, with opportunity everywhere. Some of that opportunity just cannot be ignored.  Also on the enterprise side is the challenge of increasing our visibility with customers, as there are still a significant percentage of enterprise buyers who either have not heard of Juniper, or have heard of us but do not understand that they can get the same reliability and functionality that we build for service providers at price performance matched to enterprise needs.  With service providers, the NGN decision cycle continues to be a factor in the timing of these opportunities, as evidenced by Japan’s continued deliberations, and we continue to work hard there without the immediate realization of the financial opportunities, which we expect longer term.  Finally, the evolution of IPTV and the associated service decisions, including topology and network designs, also affect the timing of our opportunity. Rollouts or trials in Singapore, Hong Kong, India, Korea, Taiwan and Japan are going ahead, but each market is different and each requires a unique approach to service mix and resolution of regulatory issues.  Addressing these challenges is well worth the effort, though, because it positions us for significant opportunity.  First, we remain strategic to our customers, with the right products, the right technology, and subsequently, the right solutions profile for a market which continues to demonstrate demand in the markets we serve.  Secondly, we focused throughout 2006, even with the many obstacles and doubts of others that have been placed in our path. Focus has been applied with execution and demonstrated by the delivery of several system products and, even more important but probably less visible from the outside looking in, several major software releases.  With our execution, our opportunity has improved. We said we would develop an improved edge response, and we delivered significant enhancements to the E320 in areas of capacity, performance, and scale. It is now the highest capacity platform of its type in the marketplace.  We said we would develop ethernet, real ethernet purpose-built for the carrier marketplace, and we have done that already with a family of ethernet interfaces for our M and T series products, and today, we make a dramatic statement on this topic with our new MX960, again the highest capacity platform in its class.  We said we would leverage and integrate our best-in-class security portfolio, and this month, we expanded once more on that deliverable, with the new extensions to the SSG family.  We said we would use our technology differentiation and match it with an unwavering commitment to the enterprise customer and to the go-to-market demands which must be served. Today, we are number two in worldwide security and number two in enterprise routing, also worldwide.  So when you add it all up, here is the bottom line: Juniper has more pure opportunity and a better answer than any company that we see in our market today. Our challenges are all well understood. Our technology and our vision are clear, and are being very well-received by our customers, and our focus and execution will be relentless.  These many successes are only possible with the support of our employees, whose continued commitment and incredible efforts make these results possible, as well as our many partners, our customers, our suppliers, and our long-term shareholders.  I would like to thank you all for your continued support and confidence in Juniper networks.  Bob, I will now turn the call over to you. 
Robert Dykes: Thanks, Scott. Before I review our results, I would like to provide a summary of the status of our stock option investigation. As previously announced, our audit committee has reached a preliminary conclusion that the actual measurement dates, for financial accounting purposes, of certain stock option grants issued in the past differ from the recorded grant dates of such awards. Consequently, we will need to restate historical financial statements to record additional non-cash charges for stock-based compensation expense.  We previously announced that we have missed the deadline to file our 10-Q for Q206, and we received a letter from NASDAQ indicating that the company is not currently in compliance with NASDAQ’s listing requirements. There are also implications on our convertible notes due to the delayed 10-Q filing, which I will talk about in more detail when I discuss Juniper's balance sheet.  On September 26, Juniper appeared before the NASDAQ qualifications panel and presented a plan to get back into compliance. The panel has not yet rendered a decision.  Our investigation is ongoing. However, it is our firm intent to file our 10-Q and any necessary restatements before the end of the year. Juniper is committed to resolving these issues as expeditiously as possible.  Similar to the second quarter, Juniper is not in a position to announce detailed financial results for the third quarter. Juniper will not be discussing any GAAP metrics that are affected by stock option expense. Although we are unable to announce these GAAP metrics, we are providing as much information as possible around most non-GAAP metrics.  Please note that these numbers are preliminary and represent our forecast of what we believe the numbers would be without any impact or changes resulting from the stock option investigation.  Now let me get to Juniper's results fort the quarter, which I am pleased to say are in line with the guidance we provided.  As I take you through some of the detailed metrics, please remember that our business will be lumpy across all key metrics, including application, geography, as well as by product mix and market segments.  Total reported revenue for Q3 was $573.6 million, an increase of approximately 5% from the prior year, and up slightly from last quarter. Year-to-date revenue is up 15% compared with 2005.  Had we been able to report a full income statement on a non-GAAP basis, and assuming no expenses related to the options investigation, our results are in line with the guidance we provided last quarter of $0.18.  For our infrastructure products, we recognize product revenue of $345.6 million, down slightly from Q2. We recognized revenue on a total of 2,791 infrastructure units this quarter, and we shipped 46,398 infrastructure ports, both up from last quarter.  This quarter, the core represented greater than 50% relative to the edge. We are very pleased with our continued strength in the core. Year-to-date, we have recorded over $400 million in T series revenue, which is up almost 50% from ’05. This represents the momentum of these products, as we support a next generation network build-outs and further reinforces the fact that our customers have accepted the Junos operating system and architecture for scaling the core as the best in the market.  The service layer technology segment performed well. This includes firewall, SSL, IDP, and other security products, as well as J series and application acceleration solutions. Revenue for Q3 totaled $121.7 million, up over 4% versus Q2, due to improved focus of our sales efforts in penetrating the enterprise market and some great new customer wins.  We saw growth in firewall, in particular the SSG product line, and WXNDX products. SSL for this quarter was relatively flat. IDP standalone and J series were down.  Now for some more detail on elements within our business.  Total service revenue was $106.3 million, up approximately 33% from the prior year and 7.8% from last quarter. This increase was due mainly to growth in the contract and stored base.  The total book-to-bill ratio was great than one in the quarter.  We had some very strong contributions this quarter, as Siemens represented 13% and Ericcson 11% of total revenue. We saw particular strength at Deutsche Telekom with Siemens, as well as China Telecom and China Mobile through Ericcson.  From a geographic perspective, we have a healthy mix. The Americas represented 43% of total revenue in Q3, down slightly from Q2. However, Asia increased to 23% from last quarter, and EMEA remained at 34%.  In EMEA, we saw strength in Norway, Poland, and the United Arab Emirates, with particular strength in Germany, Spain, the U.K. and Sweden. In Asia, we saw growth in New Zealand, Korea and Japan, and particular strength in China, given the wins of China Telecom and China Mobile. Asia was still below historical levels, primarily due to the NGN pause, which we have been discussing this year.  With regard to Japan, as we have stated, we expect decisions to be made over the next couple for quarters, with revenue implications for ’07. However, the choice of formal public comment and timing of the network rollout is up to our customers.  We expect to see continued lumpiness by [quarter] as quarterly trends fluctuate.  Revenue through our direct sales was approximately 23% versus 25% last quarter. We are pleased with the expansion and leverage of our channel presence.  Non-GAAP gross margins were up slightly from Q2, which were slightly better than we expected, due to a good mix of products and an increase in service revenue.  Non-GAAP operating expenses in total were up by 4% compared with Q2. On an absolute dollar growth basis, the primary increase was R&D, as we focused on internal innovation. We saw a small increase in sales and marketing as we continue to invest in our global sales force.  Non-GAAP net interest and other income was up about 20% versus Q2. This increase was primarily due to higher interest rates and an increase in our cash position.  As expected, operating income came in as planned, and as a percentage of sales, flat with Q2. I will speak more about our operating income later in my comments.  Now, a few comments regarding the balance sheet. I am pleased with our cash flow this quarter. Cash, cash equivalents, short and long-term investments increased by $167 million to $2.4 billion. With regard to cash, as you know, on our balance sheet, we have $400 million in zero coupon convertible notes. Because we are late in filing our 10-Q, bond totals can, if they choose, call in the bonds if we have not filed the 10-Q by October 24, 2006. At this moment, we do not expect the bonds to be called in, as they are currently trading above par. However, should this happen, Juniper obviously has sufficient funds to pay our bond totals, given our cash position of $2.4 billion.  Net accounts receivable was $285 million, and day sales outstanding was 45 days, compared with 40 days last quarter.  As stated last quarter, we expect DSOs to be in the range of 40 to 45 days, depending on the mix of partners and linearity.  Total deferred revenue was $346 million, compared with $309 million last quarter, mainly due to the increase in service contracts. As a reminder, deferred revenue is made up of service, channel inventory, and product currently unrecognizable for revenue.  Cap-ex was $26.4 million, depreciation was $19.7 million during the quarter.  We ended the quarter with 4,613 in total headcount, up from 4,347 at the end of Q2. The majority of the headcount increase was in sales, service, and R&D, with over 35% of the total increase in the low-cost geographies of China and India.  Now for guidance. The following forecasts and guidance are non-GAAP and forward-looking statements. The actual results can vary for a number of reasons, including those mentioned in our most recent 10-Q filed with the SEC, as well as any impact resulting from the completion of the stock option investigation.  We expect revenue for Q4 in the range of $590 million to $595 million.  We expect stable gross margins in Q4 and expenses to grow in line with revenue.  The expected tax rate remains at 29%.  We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.19 for Q4.  As discussed previously, in the short- to medium-term, operating margins will be driven below our long-term model of 20% to 30% into the low-20s in order to invest in our growth. The bulk of the investments will be in sales and R&D. We will return to our long-term operating model as a function of significant sustained growth.  As Scott discussed earlier, we are confident of our opportunities in the marketplace and also recognize that there are challenges we face. Juniper is a $2 billion company in a $20 billion market.  On the service provider side, we see the next generation networks and IP video as tremendous opportunities over multiple years. Based on trends in the enterprise, we have a huge opportunity to leverage our strengths in routing, security and application acceleration.  As usual, the GAAP EPS target is not accessible on a forward-looking basis due to high variability and low visibility with respect to the non-recurring charges which are excluded from the non-GAAP estimates.  That concludes my remarks. Now we would like to take questions. Please limit yourself to one question. Thank you. 
Randi Paikoff Feigin: Gina, if you could please instruct the audience regarding the queuing process so we can take questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Tal Liani, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. 
Tal Liani - Merrill Lynch: The question I have is one on the quarter, but one clarification on your announcement today with the MX960, so on the quarter, can you describe the trends in routing? You went through all the strong points, but if I look at expectations for routing revenues in the quarter, total revenues are in line to slightly better, but routing revenues are below expectations and SOP and services is above. What is happening within routing where it comes a little bit below expectations?  Second, on the MX960, you spoke about the specs. Would you mind to discuss the gross margin characteristics of this? Will it have any impact on the company or is it going to be at this sort of corporate leverage? Thanks. 
Scott G. Kriens: Tal, sort of in reverse order to your questions, the MX960 will generate margins consistent with other products, so we do not see any impact there.  With regard to the trends, the trends that we see I would say are difficult to attach to any given 90-day period in terms of router product revenues. Also, from what we see and from the opportunities around some of these NGN decision criteria, we think this will play very well to the design center of the entire portfolio, and what actually the MX960 represents is another layer in that portfolio, not so much because of its standalone ethernet capabilities, which all by themselves we think are best-in-class, but what it actually does is it changes the market.  What we are really talking about is an infrastructure market for which we now have an aggregation component called the MX960, but it is the same Junos operating system footprint that now goes across the core, across the edge, and now across aggregation as well.  The trends that we see there are what give us the confidence that we have, and also as we watch NGN unfold and the architectural requirements just align so well with what we do, that creates the enthusiasm for the opportunity.  I think the key will not be looking at it over a given 90 days, but watching its impact on our revenue velocity as we watch some of these NGN decisions come to bear, and also as we see the MX product go out into the marketplace. 
Randi Paikoff Feigin: Next question, please. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nikos Theodosopoulos, UBS Warburg. Please go ahead. 
Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS Warburg: Yes, can you hear me?
Scott G. Kriens: Yes, go ahead, Nikos. 
Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS Warburg: Thanks. My question is on the services business. Over the last several quarters, this business has been dramatically outgrowing the growth of the product part of the business, so I wanted to see if you could elaborate on why that is happening and if it will continue to happen. As part of that, you mentioned in the dialog that the gross margin was helped by a mix towards services. Historically, this has been a lower margin business versus the product business. Could you elaborate on what you meant about services mix helping the gross margin being up sequentially this quarter? Thank you. 
Scott G. Kriens: A couple thoughts, Nikos. First of all, the services business has not really been a margin drag on performance in the past. Maybe we can perhaps clarify that some more offline, but it has been a similar contributor, I would say, so there is certainly not likely to be a dilution as a result of it.  There are a couple of things that drive the services growth. One is we continue to mine the installed base in the enterprise for opportunities to develop our services business and the enterprise marketplace continues to be, and probably will continue to be, a pretty rich source of opportunity for the services business.  But also remember that as we do recognize product revenues in growing the product business, by accounting practices, we have to accommodate services as a component of that, so it will tend to cause there to be strength in the services business, as a matter of categorizing what in many cases are really decisions and wins brought about not only in this quarter, but obviously since it is ratable over time, wins in prior quarters that translate into the distribution of revenues across services in order to remain consistent again with accounting practices.  Some of the services revenue strength that you see coming through the business is a result of the product wins and the decisions that have been made in our favor over the last couple of years, showing themselves in the form of services revenue growth as sort of a distribution consequence, meaning distribution of revenue in the accounting consequence. 
Randi Paikoff Feigin: Next question, please. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Evenson, Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. 
Jeff Evenson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc.: You mentioned during the commentary that you recently extended your contract with Lucent. I was wondering if you could give us a bit more color on that, particularly when it was signed and what the relationship entails. 
Scott G. Kriens: Sure, Jeff, I would be glad to. We have many common customers with Lucent, obviously not the least of which are companies like BT, or Embark here in the U.S. Significant customers of both Juniper and Lucent, or Alcatel Lucent now.  The extension in the contracts that we have signed over the coming years that have been recently renewed are examples of the commitment that both companies have to providing the service, the support and the system integration to these major customers, as well as continued access and supply of the product to those customers, where that is part of both the contract relationship or the opportunity that we see together.  From out point of view, and I will be careful here not to speak on behalf of Lucent or Alcatel in this, but in our perspective, this continues to be a strong partnership opportunity for us. It is not pure in the sense that it is without some potential overlap, but we are very confident in the strength of our products to win the favor of our customers, and when that happens, we are also very comfortable in working through this relationship on a long-term basis, so the renewal of the contracts simply continues and really reinforces in unambiguous terms to our common customers that the strength of the relationship is intact. 
Jeff Evenson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc.: Does the contract include going after new customers together?
Scott G. Kriens: Sure. They will have full rights to the product and we will work together in opportunities to continue to sell those products to both existing and new customers, so there are not constraints of any kind. 
Jeff Evenson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc.: Thank you. 
Randi Paikoff Feigin: Next question, please. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of [Yoon Yongchul], Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead. 
Yoon Yongchul - Lehman Brothers: Thank you very much. Can you hear me okay?
Scott G. Kriens: Yes, go ahead. 
Yoon Yongchul - Lehman Brothers: Great. I have a question on the op-ex. First, a clarification. I thought I heard, Scott, you mention that the operating margin was lower sequentially than Q2. I also thought I heard Bob said it was sort of flat. Just clarify on that. Going forward, I understand as you invest in different products, making significant investments, but in terms of the timeline, at what point do you think next year in ’07 when they start to see the operating margins start to trend back up to sort of the mid- to high-20s? Thank you. 
Scott G. Kriens: A couple of things. Certainly as we see the opportunity, there has been a wealth of new products here that have come out in the last three to six months, and as recently as today’s announcement, but nine new products in the area of our secure services gateway, our SSG products, the M120, the E320, the MX960, new chips, new software.  I would not say -- it really is not the case that we just saved it all up, but for some reasons, these things come in clusters and over the last several months, there has been a lot of product rollout.  We certainly expect and are beginning to see the likelihood of those products getting some traction and making some contributions in ’07. It is hard to say exactly when and by how much, and also difficult to say what that would translate to in operating margin contribution as a percentage.  What I would say, and perhaps the best way to describe our priorities here, are to grow revenues, obviously top line, number one. To grow our operating contribution on a dollar basis, to grow absolute operating income, number two. Number three is to grow market share.  We see, and as I went through in some of the numbers, we are very encouraged by our market share position, and by the continuing separation between what I will call the rest of the market and what we see as our opportunity.  As long as we can grow revenue, grow operating income on a dollar basis and grow our market share, we will be serving our priorities in the short- to mid-term. Clearly long-term, an operating model which has operating margins at the 25% or above level, is, has been, and will continue to be a strategic goal of the company’s. It would be something we could achieve in the very short-term, actually. We could do it next quarter, but it would be done at the expense of the market share opportunity and some of the product innovation we have rolled out. Ultimately, that would mean it would come at the expense of the top line revenue growth, or the absolute operating income growth that we see as a $2 billion company in a $20 billion market.  Short- to medium-term, those will be our priorities. Longer term, we continue to be focused on the operating model of the 25% plus, and that continues to be a commitment we have to our shareholders. 
Randi Paikoff Feigin: Next question, please. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Sue, RBC. Please go ahead. 
Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets: Thank you. Scott, if we exclude NTT’s network upgrade, how would you classify overall router demand? Is it very -- is it selective upgrades? You mentioned the growth in IP traffic. Is it accelerating, and is it necessitating more routers?
Scott G. Kriens: You know, Mark, I think I would say it this way, which is the router demand is improving, or increasing on two dimensions. One is quantity and one is quality. It might be improving or increasing more in the quality dimension, actually, with a couple of wildcards.  Let me explain all that.  Certainly the demand for router or network quality is increasing, probably most of all. In simplest terms, of course, as you know, it translates into meaning high quality video, audio and voice services without interruption, and a lot of the delay sensitive traffic, and also the mission critical business traffic, the secure encrypted traffic, the demand for high quality traffic processing is going up probably more than anything.  What actually drives the quantity demand is going to be very interesting to watch, especially with, for example, the YouTube acquisition, or proposed acquisition being one sort of newsworthy observation of the last week. If you take a lot of video traffic in a network, you already get a big impact on total demand, because it is a huge multiple of e-mail and other traffic we can type at the rate of a character per second. But even more powerfully, from a network design standpoint, if you go to peer-to-peer video, such as YouTube where people are blasting traffic from anywhere to anywhere at video levels on a per image basis, the demand for that traffic changes dramatically in terms of the quantity.  It is kind of like -- a simple example or analogy, it is kind of like a freeway where you did not just get on the freeway going into the city in the morning and going home at night, but you got on it from every on ramp all at the same time going everywhere all at once. Imagine the size of the freeway you would need to do that, and that is exactly what YouTube or peer-to-peer, high volume traffic does to network designs and to capacity requirements.  It is both capacity and quality of traffic, but I would say at this point, we are still watching peer-to-peer video to see how mainstream it becomes, and the traffic quality demands of security and these other delay sensitive services, those are very real and very present today.  I think I would characterize the demand more powerfully on that front, but if it happens in peer-to-peer, watch out. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brant Thompson, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Brantley Thompson - Goldman Sachs: Scott, if I could just circle back to one of your near-term and medium-term priorities of absolute operating income growth, I know it is difficult to forecast when revenues return, at what rate, these types of things, but a lot of decisions you make around your R&D investments, your beefing up of your sales channels, is something you can have some visibility around.  Is there anyway you can give us a gauge as to whether or not your op-ex increases that we have seen over the last couple of quarters, our rolling run-rate, is going to continue at this run-rate for the next 12 months? Is this the run-rate we should assume is just necessary to sustain the investments, or have we kind of peaked in terms of some of that acceleration and the growth, while it will still be good, it will slow down a little bit.  Could you give us any kind of color around where you see that?
Scott G. Kriens: A little bit, or let me do my best at it. I think that, as I mentioned, the absolute growth is the higher priority to us than the percentage is, but to your point, we would like to see operating expenses grow more in line with revenues, meaning not to outpace them.  The real answer as to whether that will be what happens is a function of the slope of the revenue growth curve. If we see sustained, and particularly if we see increasing rate of growth in revenues, then I think it will be easier to imaging that outpacing the op-ex growth.  If, for whatever reason we did not see that, then I suppose the first thing we would do is go back to our strategy and make sure that we were still seeing the same assumptions and still carried the same beliefs, and that the importance of the IP infrastructure was not something we were overstating, for example, or the security was not becoming less important, or that there were not maybe fewer people getting on the network, or that the network mattered less to business success.  If we saw some of those things happen in contrast to what we believe currently, then we might batten down the hatches here more aggressively. But as long as we see the demand for what we do, and especially across, as we look across the enterprise market, this is probably the interesting thing to us, is it is starting to look more and more like déjà vu all over again.  It is mission critical, scalable, highly reliable, highly intelligent, high performance networks that define the success of the customer. Now, you could insert service provider, customer responding to the Internet demand eight years ago when we first came to market, and that would be Juniper. You could insert the word enterprise before customer in today’s world and the importance of SOA and some of the statistics I mentioned about the migration, the network dependent application development and you have today’s world, but behind that, the infrastructure requirements are the same.  Today, when we walk into an enterprise -- I had this experience in this last quarter actually, in New York. We walked into one of the major financial houses and had a discussion, and they said you need to realize that if we are going to rely on Juniper, that you have to support -- I guess let me not be specific, because it was not a public discussion -- call it hundreds of thousands of employees and so, are you prepared to work at that scale? We said considering it is the same operating system and the same products that support 7 million people in Germany or 8 million people in Korea, we feel pretty comfortable we can commit to hundreds of thousands in your enterprise.  That was quite a powerful statement to be able to make.  I guess just a long-winded way of saying we continue to see compelling alignment between opportunity and capability, and that is going to continue to drive our investment thesis, but it is also fair to go all the way back to your point precisely, it is fair to expect that to translate into revenue growth, and as it does, to be prudent financially in managing our op-ex, and in the process, being mindful of the business model and operating margins, not only operating income on an absolute basis, but also operating margin on a percentage basis.  It is a function of growth and it is something obviously we are going to watch closely here every day. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold of Morgan Keegan. Please go ahead. 
Simon Leopold - Morgan Keegan & Co.: Thanks. I was hoping we could go back and revisit the Japanese market, and maybe give us a bit more color. Specifically, what I am looking for is whether or not the work you are doing there is in partnership with NEC, who you have worked with in the past, and also if some of the timing of progress in that market is related to the fact that NTT is on an April fiscal year, if that is a boundary condition.  Just real quick, if you could give us an update in terms of the session border control features that came from the Kagoor acquisition. You have talked about integrating those in the past. Just a quick update on where you stand on that, too. Thank you. 
Scott G. Kriens: First, to the Japan question, NEC is an extremely important partner of Juniper's, and has been, as you know, for some time, and is going to continue to be. I do not see any correlation between their April fiscal year-end as any kind of a boundary, or even a condition, really. It is driven by -- the opportunities and the timing of these things are driven really by the customers, and I do not see the April fiscal being an issue.  The NGN and the opportunities, and I will be, actually, I think it is two weeks or three weeks, I will be having [tunyaki] in Tokyo, talking about these very things in great detail, so needless to say, we are paying a lot of attention to this.  As I mentioned in the challenges, some of the comments I made about the challenges, it is the challenge that we are not seeing the reportable results appear at the same time as the investments necessary to participate in this market, but Japan alone as a country has approached near 10% of Juniper's revenue in prior periods, and its importance to us really cannot be overstated.  This is an investment decision that we are committed to in a market that we have been and continue to be very successful in with partners like NEC that matter to us a great deal. We are going to stay very focused on that.  To your second question with regard to session border controllers, or SBCs, this is clearly functionality which we see as a feature. It is really not, other than on a niche basis in the short-term, it is really not a product category. It is feature and functionality within the IP infrastructure, and that is our development priority.  I do not think that is different than a lot of what look to be product categories today, but in time actually are not. Word processing looked like a product category or a market not that long ago, and it turned into a feature. I think you are going to see a lot of that happen in networking over the next 12 to 36 months. A lot of what appear as niche products, in fairness, they appear out of necessity, if there is something particular they can offer, but it is just hard to imagine they have any destiny except to become features within the infrastructure.  We have a friend of ours down the street here who exerts a fairly large influence on that marketplace and has the same opinion, so it would be surprising to see any other outcome in the medium- to long-term, and certainly with regard to session border controllers, or session border control technology, it is a feature of the IP infrastructure, in our view. 
Randi Paikoff Feigin: Next question, please. 
Operator: One moment, please. The next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein, Credit Suisse First Boston. Please go ahead. 
Paul Silverstein - Credit Suisse First Boston: Thank you. Scott, just a couple for quick clarifications. On the last question, on the SBC, have you already integrated that into the router, or is that still to come? 
Scott G. Kriens: You know, Paul, as we sit here, I do not know if I can tell you exactly what we have announced, so my comments will be careful at this point. Its functionality we think is very important and its capabilities, which are in the marketplace today, being supported by Juniper in some very important customer situations, and that is clearly going to continue. Its evolution over time is, as I mentioned earlier, functionality within the infrastructure.  Perhaps we can follow up. I am not sure exactly what we have announced, so I will not preclude what we may have said publicly, but if that helps, that is -- it is in existence. It is important. It is supported in customer accounts and it is going to continue to be a function that is important to us. 
Paul Silverstein - Credit Suisse First Boston: Scott, to your point last quarter in talking about the shift to integrate, in the enterprise SLT, to integrated platforms from standalone. Can you give us an update? I think you mentioned last quarter integrated was up, standalone was down. Can you tell us where integrated is as a percentage of your total SLT revenues, and what you saw this quarter in terms of those two trends?
Scott G. Kriens: You are making me look bad, Paul. You are asking me all these questions I cannot answer.  I do not know the answer to your question in percentage terms, but I do think, as you mentioned, we commented on this last quarter. It is true again this quarter, that we have seen -- while we saw, for example, SLT or our service layer technology grew about 4% quarter over quarter, our firewall products, our SSL, SSG, these products that integrate intrusion detection, prevention, routing, firewall capabilities, those are all the products that contributed to the growth. For example, our standalone intrusion detection product was the one that was down, and even our J series, although it was partly down because it had a strong quarter last quarter, so some of that is a little bit of a misleading snapshot, but a lot of the growth we have seen in the routing functionality is coming from the SSG products because they integrate state-of-the-art security with wide area routing functionality as opposed to standalone.  I do not know that I have -- I cannot tell you because I do not exactly the percentage distribution of that change, so some of this is more of a comment anecdotally, but clearly, as we look across the demand for the integrated products -- and it is not just the integrated products that we see making up a higher percentage of revenue. If you went through the customer requests and the line item enhancements we call them here, but they are basically when a customer says we want the product to do more different things than it does, if you went through and combed that list of requirements for future development priority, my gut feel is you probably would find 80% of those driven by requirements for integration.  So it is reflected not only in the mix, but it is reflected in what will be our priorities, because those are the inputs we use to make our development decisions. As a result of those deliverables, as they occur over time, I think we will see even more power demonstrated here.  I also think, as probably a final marker to try to find some quantitative evidence, is this quarter we finally took over the number two spot in worldwide security. That is largely due to the fact that have integrated comprehensive solutions and on a comparative basis, relative to a standalone security providers that previously occupied these spots in market share. That is the reason they do not anymore, the integrated proposition. 
Paul Silverstein - Credit Suisse First Boston: One more real quick one, Scott. On the MX960, any thoughts in terms of the extent you get your routing business growing again, how much of that growth will come from MX960? What is the timing and scope of that making an impact on your revenues? Related to that, you mention that you do not look at the business over any 90-day period. I appreciate that, but your routing business now has been down three consecutive quarters. It is almost down 10% from the fourth quarter peak. Is there any larger trend going on? I understand the opportunity that is out there. I understand the 960 fills a big hole, but any insight you can give us on that?
Scott G. Kriens: I think the two things I would say about that, Paul, one, we do see the -- I guess first of all, just some specifics. The MX960 will be eligible for revenue in the first quarter of next year, so it should begin to make contribution at that point.  I am not sure what rate of contribution it will make or how quickly it will do that. We tend to look at the market a little bit differently, because I think we are not in a position to declare this until we watch product shipments and outcomes of decisions materialize.  I actually think that what you will see with the MX960 is far more than just our participation in the carrier ethernet market segment. I think it is going to be the end of the carrier ethernet market segment, because what there is is a market for IP infrastructure, and we have an operating system footprint that runs across the core, the edge, and now the aggregation layer.  I think aggregation will be increasingly driven through ethernet, because it is fast and it is simple and it is cheap, and that is how it has won all of the contests it has entered at 1, 10, 100 megabit, 1 gigabit, 10 gigabit in the past, and it is probably why it is going to be so powerful here.  It is not a segment. It is just a vehicle on which the IP infrastructure, in our case, Junos, gets delivered. So we tend to look at the marketplace as a market for the operating system with delivery vehicles, as opposed to the hardware on which it is delivered.  Then, let’s see, with regard to revenues in total on the routing side, remember the difference between reported revenues and shipments and deferred revenues. What you see on a reported basis, as we talked about, is less than what has been shipped and paid for, by the way, on a recognized plus deferred basis. Would we like to have seen everything grow faster and we would like to see the NGN pause disappear, or the MX products show up sooner, certainly but strategically, I am probably more confident today than I have ever been. 
Randi Paikoff Feigin: Gina, we have time for one more question, please. 
Operator: Perfect. Our last question comes from the line of Tim Daubenspeck with Pacific Crest. Please go ahead. 
Tim Daubenspeck - Pacific Crest Securities: Thank you very much. My question is around the E320. You talked about in the prepared remarks, 400 units shipped. That is a pretty big number, relative to some of the numbers I think you were talking about at Global Com, substantially higher than some of the numbers that you were talking about units shipped at Global Com. Could you just talk about how much of an impact the new ethernet interface upgrade had? When can we start to see really some of the contribution on the revenue side from some of these unit orders? Thank you. 
Scott G. Kriens: You know, the interesting thing, Tim, is certainly the new interfaces and the densities have helped, but a lot of those shipments and the impact of those elements has yet to be felt, because we have not been shipping that functionality, either the enhancements to the interface capability or the absolute capacity that now allows us to have the highest capacity platform in the market.  Those are not capabilities that have been shipping for long enough to really be the major drivers behind the units that have been shipped. Now, some of that is a function of people believing those are coming and buying units in advance, knowing those will be made available, so it is not -- that is why it is a little bit hard to be black and white about it.  The shipments have probably I would say not yet really represented the opportunity that exists with the now comprehensive functionality that has been delivered.  There is a lot of demand still worldwide for broadband access, for DSL access and for capabilities that are enabled by the E series products. There is also an installed base out there for us that is quite significant in the many millions of DSL customers we support in these different countries, so that is clearly a driver for some of this as well.  We believe that this E series product line and the 320 in particular, this is a flagship capability for the company, and one which is going to be a significant contributor for many quarters and many years to come and is going to be a very strategic differentiator because of its strategic importance to customers.  I am very encouraged, both by what we have seen and by the potential for what we see going forward. I guess perhaps this is a summary on the quarter and on the status of what we see in total. It is really I think a reflection -- I made these comments in the scripted remarks, but we have set out through the course of this year to deliver on a number of fronts, and what is being demonstrated here over the last weeks and months are the fruits of that labor in terms of the delivery of those capabilities. Some of it is visible in the form of products that you can touch, platforms like these enhancements to E320, the M120, the SSG products, the MX960. Some of it is not so available to touch but potentially more powerful in the operating system integration and enhancements that run across these, and some of it is probably even less visible from the outside, but at least as compelling from the inside, which is the business practices and some of the organization design, and some of the personnel that we have deployed, and the talent that we have recruited in certain areas and the focus that has given us on the enterprise market.  When I line up all of that, it becomes the source of our enthusiasm for the opportunity. The timing of it all and forecasting of it all and realization of it all in the form of quantifiable results is now our assignment, and that is what we are going to work very hard on over not just the balance of ’06, but it is the focus of planning that is already underway for ’07.
Randi Paikoff Feigin: Great. Well, we would like to thank everyone for your participation today. There will be an audio replay available of this call on the investor relations section of our website. In addition, you can call 800-633-8284 and enter the reservation number 21305676. Again, the phone number is 800-633-8284, reservation number 21305676. We currently plan to report fourth quarter 2006 results the week of January 29th in 2007. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to call the investor relations department. Again, thank you for your participation on the call today and have a nice evening. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect all lines.

Operator: Welcome to the Juniper Networks Second Quarter 2006 Financial Results Conference Call. During this presentation all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards we will conduct a question and answer session. At that time if you have a question please press the “1” followed by the “4” on your telephone. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, July 19, 2006. I would now like to turn the conference over to Randi Feigin, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Randi Feigin, Vice President of Investor Relations: Thanks Alister. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. With me is Scott Kriens, our Chairman and CEO, and Bob Dykes, our CFO and Executive Vice President of Business Operations. First, Scott will review the service provider and enterprise trends as well as an update on our position in both the service provider and enterprise markets. He’ll provide a quick review and update on our product announcement and directions and then cover our market share across the various segments. Following Scott’s comments Bob will provide an overview of our current reporting status, some financial statistics for the quarter ending June 30, 2006, as well as outline some of our financial goals for the second half of the year. We will then open the call up for questions. Before I turn the call over to Scott, I would like to remind you that the matters we will be discussing today may include forward-looking statements and as such are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements, including those risks and uncertainties discussed in our most recent 10-Q filed with the SEC. In addition, the company’s audit committee has not completed its review of stock option matters. There can be no assurance that the outcome of that investigation will not result in a change to or restatement of financial results provided by the Company for this or any historical period or that the Company’s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2006, will be timely filed. We also be discussing some preliminary non-GAAP financial information, but due to the pending stock option investigation we are not presenting complete GAAP financial statements including a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP items. However, a description of the items excluded in the non-GAAP financial information can be found on our Investor Relations web page. Juniper Networks assumes no obligation and does not intend to update forward-looking statements made on this call. Scott, I will turn it over to you.
Scott Kriens, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Randi, and good afternoon to everybody. Today along with the update of the quarter I would like to discuss the trends we see in the market place as well as our status in both the service provider and enterprise markets and provide a quick review and an update on our product announcements and directions, and then cover our market share across various segments, after which I will turn it over to Bob to review more the details of our recent performance and provide you with some guidance for the second half of the year. I would also like to make a quick comment on the limited ability we have to discuss second quarter financial details. The audit committee and their financial and legal teams, independent investigation regarding the stock options, has not been completed. However, the committee has reached a preliminary conclusion that the actual measurements dates for financial accounting purposes of certain stock option grants issued in the past differ from the recorded grant dates of such awards. Our audit committee’s goal is to conduct an independent, comprehensive, and conclusive investigation. Until that investigation is completed we are unable to offer additional comments on their progress, but in the meantime it’s our objective to provide you as much financial information as possible. And while we are unable to provide detailed GAAP financial results, we will outline the preliminary non-GAAP results for the quarter, and as Bob and I will discuss, the quarter was largely in line with the results we expected to see and the guidance we provided in April. So with that all that said, this is an excellent opportunity to demonstrate how we are running the business today, and we’re running the company exactly as we always have, focused on customers and innovation and executing to deliver the product portfolio, the partner success, and the financial results necessary to capitalize on our opportunity in the market place. From a financial perspective, we are pleased with our revenue of $567.5 million reflecting growth of 15% from the second quarter of last year and we’re exceptionally pleased with our cash generation of $200 million in this recent quarter allowing us to build our cash balances to over $2.25 billion. This cash has been generated from our success in both the service provider and enterprise markets, so let’s look first at the service providers and then we’ll talk about the enterprise. Our business with service providers this quarter was once again solid, up about 18% over the second quarter of last year, and as a reminder this does not include the $25 million to $35 million of deferred revenue from shipments to Verizon, which Bob will discuss shortly. We see an expanding opportunity in the service provider market place, and I will talk in more detail about how we divide this market. We focus on four separate segments within the service provider market, which include wireline, wireless, cable, and emerging service providers, and each of these segments has a similar destination and vision but with different priorities for their network infrastructure investments. The wireline operators where we see continued strength and demand for our products are accelerating their drive for the multi-play solution and the services and differentiation they can demonstrate are clear. The emerging players such as Google, MSN, and Yahoo are driving for the enhancement and personalization of data and customers and using the intelligence of the IT infrastructure to help them achieve this, and these continue to be good opportunities and a favorable segment for Juniper. The mobile or wireless operators are focused on cost savings in their infrastructure and the delivery of mobile services including video and music to an expanding subscriber base as well, and this was a solid growth area for us in the second quarter. The cable operators are competing with other providers for the multiple demands of both the consumer and business customers, and while the priorities differ the ultimate motivation is the same, which is to build the valuable and a comprehensive relationship with the customer, and in so doing improve the confidence and loyalty of that customer to the brand of their service provider. We do, however, still see a lot of work ahead for both Juniper and the operators in the deployment of next-generation networks or NGNs as evidenced by the work underway in Japan. As we’ve discussed previously with regard to Japan, the timetables remain in our judgment delivery of both decisions and equipment in late 2006 and early 2007. And the short-term challenges of migration to the next generation are visible across the market and the difficulties both economically and operationally of delivering both the old and the new simultaneously and without interruption are substantial. This is being done with technology like MPLS, IP Version 6, Voice-over-IP, IPTV in the multi-play architecture which is at the center of our competitive advantage and our experience, and it’s being delivered with increasingly pervasive consumer technology such as Razors and iPods with streaming services for World Cup highlights and the latest music videos, all of which are spreading around the world at increasing rates of speed as well. But one thing is clear, there will be more services, more security, more multimedia, richer experiences, and with it all an accelerating urgency to reach the goal of a highly reliable next-generation IP network offering intelligent services of scale and doing so at the lowest incremental cost, and this is exactly what we built the company to do. It’s the source of our optimism regarding the second half and beyond, and it remains the opportunity which we’re best positioned to serve and our customers continue to confirm this with us every day. Much of our success continues to be through the benefit of our many strong partners and we remain well balanced across the globe. Siemens again represented greater than 10% of total revenue during the quarter, attributed to service provider wins at FastWeb and Optus and elsewhere, and though it’s in its very early stage we see an opportunity to further develop the Siemens relationship as a result of the recently announced Nokia-Siemens NSN, which should bring expanded coverage for our partnership in both the wireline and mobile markets. We saw substantial growth from Ericsson during the quarter which contributed to our growth in the mobile market segment, and in addition we saw a strong quarter from NEC and a continued contribution from Lucent. In addition, for the first time in almost two years, and in fact since the third quarter of 2004, Verizon represented 10% of total revenue, and again this does not include the large deferral we discussed last quarter. This represents the fundamental strength of Verizon’s reliance on Juniper to deliver robust IT services as well as the continuing opportunity within what is now Verizon business, the former MCI. This is a great opportunity brought about by industry consolidation in as much as the new Verizon has generated a larger contribution to our revenue than the sum of the two separate companies. This includes a broad range of Juniper solutions for multiple applications for both businesses and consumers. We also signed a significant partner agreement during the quarter with Microsoft solidifying a global agreement to deliver high-performance security solutions that enhance protection for IP and IPTV networks, services, and applications. We are collaborating to provide end-to-end security with superior levels of quality and reliability to address the current and emerging needs of our service provider customers, and with this agreement Juniper can offer IPTV network security solutions to customers of Microsoft TVs, IPTV edition. Geographically speaking and with specific reference to business in the second quarter, we saw strong performance in EMEA with wins such as FastWeb for IPTV and Telge Energi in Sweden for the E320 broadband services router and a solid quarter in the Americas with the Verizon contribution I referenced earlier and the announcement of T-Series deployments at Global Crossing. And while A-PAC was a big slower this quarter as we expected, we did see continued demand for IP Version 6 in Japan, Korea, and China as the sheer number of subscribers and devices increased dramatically and consumer demand remains uninterrupted. This makes our demonstration of 40 gigabit per second technology with NTT, which was announced last quarter, even more important in servicing these bandwidth requirements as well as the fact that we have sold over 300 T-series platforms to over 20 customers in Japan alone resulting in a market share of approximately 47% of the Japanese Core routing market, according to IDC. And to support these expanding requirements, we continue to invest to deliver new products. Just this Monday we announced the M120, which again raises the bar for the intelligent multi-service Edge and builds upon on M-series install base of over $2.5 billion of products. At Global Com we introduced the first phase of our Ethernet portfolio to provide high-density, low-cost Ethernet to existing M- and T-series routing platforms allowing customers to increase service capabilities while dramatically improving the economics in the delivery of our technology. You will see more from us in this area through the next 12 months. The E320 broadband services routers are now deployed in several tier one service provider networks including some of the largest IPTV and Triple Play networks in the world, and the products are conformed to comply with two key industry open standards, TR101 and Layer2 Control Protocol or L2CP, which demonstrates our ongoing commitment to open standards and open technology. And further to that point, we also announced the creation of the Open IPTV and multi-play initiative to enable providers to use open standard Juniper technology to better deploy IPTV and multi-play services. All this ultimately adds up to market share and according to Gartner Juniper is currently ranked number two worldwide in the major service provider markets in which we compete including total service provider routing, core, edge, and broadband. We’re number two in worldwide service provider routing with 24% market share, number two in world wide core service provider routing with 35% market share, number two in worldwide edge service provider routing with 18% market share, and number two in the worldwide broadband market share with 35% share. For now let’s switch gears to the enterprise market, both to talk about markets and customers as well as trends. Here we saw a very satisfying quarter from a revenue perspective with growth of approximately 5% over the first quarter and 27% from the second quarter of last year in our SLP products sold primarily into the enterprise market. And we see a continuing shift from the single function appliance businesses to the integrated platforms such as our integrated secure gateway and our secure service gateway or SSG. Also, enterprise customers continue to turn to MPLS to build their private corporate backbones replicating the designs we’ve seen in the service provider market, and this is predictable as their requirements of reliability, security, scale, and services are every bit as critical as those of the service provider, and the proven scalable production experience of the JUNOS operating system gives us a big advantage in this market. We also saw encouraging signs within segments of the enterprise market as well. First with WAN optimization, many enterprises are starting to explore and deploy this technology more aggressively, particularly on leased lines and international circuits. Bandwidth savings of 50% and throughput gains of 2.5 to 10 times normal are possible with application aware devices focused on Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, and others, and we saw good growth during the quarter for our WX products. Second, in the area of data center centralization, consolidation of corporate data and applications required to secure information, comply with government regulations, and the reemergence of the centralized data center are key trends we see gaining momentum, and this serves not only our application performance solution but our enterprise backbone routing business as well. Third, consolidation of CPE devices; the complexity of installing many separate products at branch locations for routing, security, and application acceleration is beyond the economic reach of many IT departments and outside the skills and interest of the customer facing personnel in these remote branch locations. The enterprises are looking to consolidate any new build outs with simple to deploy products and in many cases looking to service providers to assist, and this is where we have seen demand for our ISG and SSG products among others as integrated innovation drives evaluation of products in this space. Partners remain central to our enterprise success and our channel strength and reseller momentum continues as well with now over 6800 partners worldwide. And in the geographies, first in the Americas, we saw a solid quarter with accounts like MGM Mirage and Methodist Hospital where the complete solutions of firewall and security capabilities as well as our application acceleration products were central to our success. And in EMEA, we had our strongest enterprise quarter ever with wins such as UKERNA, which is the 10 gigabit backbone for the United Kingdom’s research and education network and the Finnish Defense Forces who deploy the M-series to enable a new MPLS backbone. And in A-PAC we saw continued contribution with solutions for the distributed secure network needs of accounts such as Commonwealth Bank in Australia and Esquel, the global apparel manufacturer, though our overall results in this region did not equal the growth that we saw elsewhere in the world. Within Juniper we continue to increase our focus on the enterprise market as well. We invested substantially in our service organization to improve our support of customers and partners, and recently we expanded the role of Frank Vitagliano who came to us from IBM after 33 years as an executive in the enterprise market place. In addition to worldwide channels, Frank’s role now also includes direct ownership of all U.S. enterprise operations, which is our largest source of revenue in the enterprise market place and a bellwether for the industry worldwide. All U.S. enterprise facing resources are now aligned in a unified organization and combined with our worldwide strategy, development, and program function we have all the ingredients to drive enhanced teaming, market coverage, and ultimately our increasing enterprise success. From a product perspective, we delivered visibility in reporting enhancements to the WX Central Management Systems software and introduced our next-generation intrusion, detection, and prevention or IDP platforms as well as the NetScreen security management software designed to provide increased application visibility and control across the network. And earlier this week we announced the first new set of features on the Odyssey Access Client and Steel Belted Radius products since the close of the Funk acquisition, which addressed the needs of enterprises worldwide that rely on secure, high-performance wired or wireless networking. And our resulting market share again defines the source of our enterprise optimism. Juniper is ranked in the top three worldwide in SSL VPN, total firewall, and high-end firewall, according to Infonetics. Number one in worldwide SSL VPN with 28% market share, and Juniper has been the leader since the inception of the category and our share is over twice any other vendor in the market, number three in worldwide network firewalls with 12% share, number two in high-end firewalls with 33% share, and we hold the number two high-end enterprise routing position worldwide with 30% share, according to Synergy Research Group. Juniper was recently recognized once again in the leader’s quadrant for the Gartner Network Firewall and IPSec Magic Quadrants, and Juniper is in the leader’s quadrant in all the Gartner magic quadrants in the security markets in which we compete --SSL VPN, firewall, intrusion protection, and IPSec. Enterprise again represented approximately one-third of total revenue during the quarter going approximately 10% from the second quarter of last year. So, in summary, we are focused and we are executing. This has been the strategy and it will continue to be, and we will refine our participation in the enterprise market where in particular this is showing the most encouraging signs in the EMEA theater, and we expect this example to be increasingly replicated in our other geographies as well, specifically with our recent alignment in the U.S. The overall outlook is positive in the service provider market place with the accelerating acceptance and deployment of IT infrastructure worldwide and the service provider market remains a source of Juniper’s strength, with both EMEA and the U.S. leading the way. In A-PAC, the NGN progress continues and we know we are responsible for delivering the evidence of our success here with the NGN decisions in the future. We have the continuing priority of operational excellence both in the improving Juniper efficiency and productivity internally and the innovation and delivery of our expanding product portfolio to customers and partners worldwide, and we’re very pleased and proud to be recognized with the recent addition of Juniper the S&P 500 Index, a reflection of the current strengths and the continuing opportunity that we have as a company. These many successes are only possible with the support of our employees whose continued commitment and incredible efforts make these results possible as well as our many partners, our customers, our suppliers, and our long-term shareholders, and I would like to thank you all for your continued support and confidence in Juniper Networks. Bob, I’ll now turn the call over to you.
Robert Dykes, CFO and Executive Vice President, Business Operations: Thanks, Scott. Before I review our results, please remember, as discussed earlier, our audit committee has reached a preliminary conclusion that the actual measurement dates for financial accounting purposes of stock option grants issued in the past differ from the recorded grant dates of such awards. Accordingly the company believes that we’ll record additional non-cash charges for stock-based compensation expense but is not yet able to determine the amount of such charges or the resulting tax and accounting impact of these actions for which periods, if any, would require restatement. Therefore, Juniper is not in a position to announce detailed financial results for the second quarter. Juniper will not be discussing any GAAP metrics that are affected by stock option expense. These include GAAP, cost of goods sold expenses and therefore gross margins, operating expenses, cash flow, and mini-liability accounts on the balance sheet. Although we are unable to announce these GAAP metrics we are providing as much information as possible around most non-GAAP metrics. Please note that these numbers are preliminary and represent a forecast of what we believe the numbers would be without any impact or changes resulting from the stock option investigation. Now let me get to Juniper’s results for the quarter with which I am pleased. As I take you through some of the detailed metrics, please remember that our business will be lumpy across all key metrics including applications, geographies, as well as byproduct mix and market segments. Total reported revenue for the second quarter was $567.5 million, an increase of approximately 15% from the prior year and relatively flat from the last quarter due to the deferred revenue from Verizon that we are not able to recognize this quarter. I will provide more details on Verizon shortly. The first half of ’06 grew 20% compared with the first half of ’05. Had we been able to report our full income statement on a non-GAAP basis and assuming no changes as a result of the options investigation, our results are in line with the guidance we provided last quarter including a one single effect of using a higher tax of 29% versus 27%, resulting in an EPS of $0.18. As you know, Congress has not yet passed the R&D Tax Bill and as we said on our last call, should this happen the implication will be $0.01 less per share in the second quarter, because our tax rate would be higher. For our infrastructure products, we recognized product revenue $352.2 million, up 6% from a year ago and down 3% from the first quarter. We recognized revenue on a total of 2632 infrastructure units this quarter, and we shipped 38,715 infrastructure ports, both up from last quarter. This quarter the core and the edge represented relatively equal amounts of our infrastructure business. We are very pleased with our continued in the core. In fact, we sold our 2000 T-series product during this quarter, which further reinforces the fact that our customers have accepted the JUNOS operating system and architecture and stating that core is the best in the market. I am very pleased with the performance of the service layer technology group. This includes firewall, SSL, IDP, and other security products as well as J-series and application acceleration solutions. Revenue for the second quarter totaled $116.6 million, up over 27% year-over-year and up 5% versus the first quarter due to improved focus of our sales efforts and penetrating the enterprise markets and some great new customer wins. We saw strength in J-series, firewall, and particularly the ISG 2000 and WX products. The SSG continues to gain good customer acceptance. SSL for this quarter was relatively flat. Now for some more detail on elements within our business. Total service revenue was $98.7 million, up approximately 42% from the prior year and 6.5% from last quarter. This increase was due mainly to growth in the contact install base. The total book-to-bill ratio was greater than one in the quarter. Siemens was a strong contributor in the second quarter representing approximately 15% of total revenue, and we are very excited that Verizon represents 10% of total revenue as discussed earlier. This revenue is based on reported revenue and does not include revenue that has been deferred this quarter. As you may recall, in our last conference call, we said that in the second quarter there will $25 million to $35 million of revenue that we could not recognize. The actual deferral came in within this range. Although the revenue has been deferred, we have collected almost all of the cash due. As we said on the last call, we expect to recognize this revenue in the first half of ’07. When we are able to recognize this revenue we will use it as an opportunity to increase backlog and to improve linearity and predictability of shipments in the future quarters. From a geographic perspective, the Americas represented 47% of total revenue in the second quarter, relatively flat from the first quarter. However, we saw good growth in Brazil and Canada. Europe, Middle East, and Africa represented 34% of total revenue in the second quarter, down slightly from 36% last quarter. As you may recall, we recognized a significant amount of revenue from British Telecom last quarter. In the second quarter we saw strength in Germany, Italy, Sweden, United Arab Emirates, and Poland with particular strength in France and the Russian Federation. Russia is an area where we have been recently investing and we can see this investment is paying off. Likewise, the Middle East is growing and a successful market for us where we continue to invest. Asia represented 20% of total revenue, up from last quarter but below historical levels primarily due to the NGN pause, which we have been discussing this year. We saw good strength in China, Australia, and Taiwan. We expect to see continued lumpiness by theater as quarterly trends fluctuate. Revenue through our direct sales was approximately 25%, consistent with last quarter. We have seen growth in our distribution channel as we maintain the expansion and leverage of our channel presence. We had a good mix of products this quarter and our non-GAAP gross margins came in line with expectation, which was down slightly from the first quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses in total were up by a low single digit percentage compared to the first quarter. On an absolute dollar growth basis all categories grew; however, sales and marketing increased the most as we continue to invest in our global sales force especially in China, India, the Middle East, and Russia where we see good growth opportunities. Non-GAAP net interest and other income was up about 18% versus the first quarter. This increase was primarily due to high interest rates and an increase in our cash position. As expected operating income came in as planned and as a percentage of sales fell slightly from the first quarter to a percentage of revenue that is in the low 20s. I will speak more about our operating income later in my comments. Now a few comments regarding the balance sheet. I am very pleased with our cash flow this quarter. Cash, cash equivalents, short and long-term investments increased by $200 million to $2.25 billion. Net accounts receivable was $251 million and day sales outstanding was 40 days compared with 48 days last quarter. We are pleased with the improvement as we saw better linearity this quarter. Moving forward we expect service to be in the range of 40-45 days depending on the mix of partners and linearity. Total deferred revenue was $309 million compared with $283.8 million last quarter, mainly due to the Verizon deferral. As a reminder, deferred revenue is made up of service, channel inventories, and products currently unrecognizable for revenue. CapEx was $25.2 million. Depreciation was $18.6 million during the quarter. We ended the quarter with 4347 employees in total head count, up from 4164 at the end of the first quarter. The majority of the head count increase was in sales, service, and R&D with about a third of the total increase in the low cost geographies of China and India. I would now like to make some comments regarding goodwill. Because of the decline in Juniper’s market capitalization since March 31, 2006, we are evaluating the carrying value of certain long lived assets consisting primarily of $4.9 billion of goodwill recorded on the balance sheet at 02/30/2006. Pursuant to accounting rules, the majority of the goodwill was recorded based on stock prices at the time merger agreements were executed in and out. I expect we will record reductions in the carrying value of goodwill and long lived assets for the service layer technology segment of approximately $1.3 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2006. Should Juniper’s market capitalization decrease further, it is possible there could be additional reductions in goodwill in future quarters. Now for guidance. The following forecasts and guidance are non-GAAP and forward-looking statements. The actual results can vary for a number of reasons including those mentioned in our most recent 10-Q filed with the SEC as well as any impact resulting from the completion of the stock option investigation. We expect revenue for the third quarter in the range of $570 million to $575 million, though we expect to see some of the usual summer seasonalities. We expect the fourth quarter revenue to grow to the range of $585 million to $595 million. We expect stable gross margins in the third quarter and expenses in both the third quarter and fourth quarter to grow in line with expenses. The expected tax rate remains at 29% given there has been no congressional resolution on the R&D tax bill. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.18 for the third quarter and $0.19 for fourth quarter. Juniper’s priority is to grow revenue, earnings, and cash generation on an absolute basis and second to grow market share. It is our objective to do these both at the highest level of operating income possible. We are committed to these priorities and to maximizing shareholder value. However, in the short-to-medium term, operating margins will be driven below our long-term model of 25-30% into the low 20’s in order to invest in our growth. The bulk of the investments will be in sales and R&D. We will return to our long-term operating model as a function of significant sustained growth. Juniper is a $2 billion company in a $20 billion market. On the service provider side, we see the next-generation network and IP video as tremendous opportunities over the next years. Based on trends in the enterprise, we have a huge opportunity to leverage our strengths in routing, security, and application acceleration. With respect to expenses, we are continuing to take measures to reduce our cost. I would like to announce today that we have signed on Flextronics as our third major electronic manufacturing services company in addition to Selectica and Plexus. Flextronics will provide new production introduction, manufacturing, and distributed services on a global basis for many of our products. The breadth and depth of the global services offered by Flextronics will help speed our movement into China, which will provide significant cost leverage going forward. We are very excited about this new relationship. As usual, our GAAP EPS target is not accessible on a forward-looking basis due to high variability and low visibility with respect to the non-recurring charges which are excluded from the non-GAAP estimates. Now I would like to take questions, please limit yourself to one question. In addition, as I said earlier on the call, the Order Committee’s internal investigation related to stock options is not complete. Therefore, we cannot make any comments related to the investigation or any financial metrics which we have not been able to already provide. Please keep this in mind when you ask you question. Thank you.
Randi Feigin, Vice President of Investor Relations: Alister, can you please instruct the audience regarding the queuing process?
Operator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to register a question please press “1” followed by “4” on your telephone. If you are using a speaker phone please lift your handset before entering a request. Once again, to register a question press “1” followed by “4”. One moment please for the first question. Our first question comes from the line of Nikos Theodosopoulos from UBS, please go ahead.
Nikos Theodosopoulos, UBS: Thank you. My question on the guidance for the fourth quarter, I’m trying to get a sense. If you look at the guidance that you gave, it kind of suggests little year-over-year growth, I’m trying to understand, is that assumed that a potential recovery of Japan is pushed out into 2007, just trying to understand that. And I know you can’t comment on the investigation, but is it possible to share given that you have found evidence of the misplacing of the options the period that it occurred, what timeframe did this occur at Juniper? Thank you.
Scott Kriens, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: Nikos, hi it’s Scott. With regard to what we see in the second half, especially as we look out into the fourth quarter timeframe, it’s a little early to know what the composition will be of all that revenue in much granularity. There is the potential for there to be recognizable revenue from NGN decisions in Japan, but it could well be that we see decisions towards the end of the year and even if it is more of the revenue recognition associated with NGN activities becoming part of the’07 model as opposed to the end of ’06. That’s not the only component of what we see as growth opportunity in the second half of the year. Some of it is a function of product cycles and products like the M120 and the integrated security appliances or security products that we think will be contributors in an increasing way as we see more rollout, more acceptance, etc., and some of it is also a function of continued investment across the field organization as we see markets like Middle East and Russia in some of the outlying market segments, as well as just continued general strength in IT infrastructure and demand for IT services. So, it’s not any one place in particular that we see the opportunity, but specifically with regard to NGN it wouldn’t be surprising to see the bulk of the recognition of revenue associated with any success we might have there in the end of the fourth quarter and early first quarter of ’07. With regard to the status of the investigation, as we said, it’s not finished and what we have been told by the audit committee and as a result of the legal and accounting team of independent investigators is that they have information with regard to the difference between the dates of record shown by the company on certain option grants and the actual measurement dates that would or should be used for accounting purposes. They have not elaborated beyond that and it’s not really appropriate for us to do so either obviously. We don’t know until they do the extent of these changes and whether or not it will be material. Because it affects options which as you know live over multiple years, it’s also hard to know exactly the periods in which any consequences would be recorded or any financial changes might be necessary. So, it’s also not really possible yet to nail down exactly the timeframes. What is clear and the audit committee’s objective in all this is really to do three things, and it’s really to drive against three priorities -- to deliver an investigation which is independent, comprehensive, and conclusive, and having achieved those three objectives obviously to conclude the whole exercise as rapidly as possible. So that is what they are doing and this is the information that they have provided us thus far.
Nikos Theodosopoulos, UBS: Okay, thank you.
Scott Kriens, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Nikos.
Randi Feigin, Vice President of Investor Relations: Next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jiong Shao with Lehman Brothers, please go ahead.
Jiong Shao, Lehman Brothers: Thank you very much. I was wondering if you could please talk about the overall enterprise demand environment? You did very well in your enterprise division in the June quarter. Some of the other large tech companies have come into the region and there was still a little bit lengthening of sales cycle in the month of June, and I was wondering if you could please provide a little bit color on that. Thank you.
Scott Kriens, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: Sure, I think what we saw in the enterprise market more than anything else was, at least in the segments that we serve which maybe not exactly the same as others whose comments you may have referenced, but within what we see there are a couple of trends. One is that the market demand for integrated capabilities is increasing and we saw that reflected in particular within the strength of some of the products that made up what we call our SLT segment. Growth in the ISG 2000 firewall capabilities and J-series, our SSG products, and our 5GT, these are all products whether it’s routing and security they are integrated, security and wireless, intrusion detection and firewalls, but all examples of integrated capabilities in the product portfolio and that’s where the source of the growth and the strength in the business came from. And consequently, the other side of that is seen as well, which is some softness in the standalone products, and this is something that we saw in standalone capabilities within our own portfolio, standalone IDP for example, but also I think it’s reflected by what we’re seeing others in the industry comment on, who run primarily standalone appliance businesses, I think it confirms this. And certainly from what we hear from our customers repeatedly, the demand that they have is for capabilities that can be deployed easily and that can be maintained and operated remotely and that have a much more integrated footprint in order to lower the cost of operation over time, particularly in many of these remote environments. So, those are trends that we saw. Finally, one more I guess I would want to mention, which is more on the routing and infrastructure side, which is an increasing demand for the technology associated with it, which would be MPLS, but what it really translates to is it’s an increasing demand in enterprise backbone requirements that they really be equal to the kinds of characteristics that we see drive demand in the service provider market. Same technology that results in scalability, reliability, intelligence, etc., all of the characteristics that would drive a Verizon or an NTT are available in exactly the same operating system bit for bit with the one that’s in use in a multi-million subscriber environment in those places and with the same standards for reliability is what’s available and therefore in demand in the enterprise market, and it’s why we have seen the growth to the 30% market share in the enterprise backbones that we referenced earlier.
Jiong Shao, Lehman Brothers: Great, thank you.
Randi Feigin, Vice President of Investor Relations: Next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson with Citigroup, please go ahead.
Alex Henderson, Citigroup: Thanks. In the last quarter you deferred a bunch of revenues from Verizon and extensively that was the reason why in a seasonally strong quarter your business in the service provider segment decelerated quite sharply and in fact declined sequentially. Can you give us some sense of whether you are continuing to defer in the third quarter and why? If you are not continuing to defer in the third quarter, why wouldn’t you see a sequential increase in revenues as your normalized sale rate should theoretically rebound to the level that you were at before? Simultaneous with that, can you talk a little bit about why, given your business is slowed to a slight single digit growth rate year-over-year, you are being forced to expand your sales and marketing and R&D efforts, yet at the same time you are saying you get deferred revenues from this Verizon contract to “bumper your backlog” or bill backlog to improve visibility. I would think that the other actions you are taking ought to give you acceleration in your business that would allow you to actually show accelerated growth as opposed to being forced to build a backlog for visibility. It seems like you are awfully defensive on your outlook.
Scott Kriens, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: Alex, let’s see if I can untangle that question a little bit and come back to me if this doesn’t address the gist of what you are asking here. What we saw in particular in the second quarter here just completed, we saw what is now Verizon — obviously the combination of Verizon and MCI of Verizon business — the combined company actually contributed more in the second quarter than the two standalone companies did in the first quarter. So one of the things that’s interesting about that is there are a lot of questions if not concerns sometimes about consolidation and what that means and whether that is a negative for the suppliers, and it may well be for some of them. But if you are supplying the next-generation technology and supplying the technology that fuels the growth, I actually think we have the potential for the opposite to be true, which is where the two companies come together, become stronger, and the demand actually goes up. And we did see, again, a greater total demand or total revenue contribution from Verizon than the sum of the two separate companies in the last quarter, even absent the deferred revenue as we mentioned. As we look out over the balance of the year and as we look at the opportunities to grow the business, we’ll see how both the summer seasonality unfolds as well as what the end of the year brings us with regard to the trends around the market worldwide, the coming on stream of some of the NGN decisions that we mentioned earlier, the returns on some of our investments. We have made investments — this is a little bit more enterprise than services — but investments in the Middle East, in UAE, in Saudi Arabia, in Russia, and in many cases and in particular in the service provider markets when we do make additional investments for additional coverage, these are long-term sales cycles, so it is not something that turns around in 90 or 180 days. So, when I look at that and I look at it coupled with the product portfolio and the rollout that we see of both the current and the looming products, there is a lot of opportunity for us to grow this business, and yet at the same time one of the things to touch on your question of the handling of the Verizon deferred, one of the things…I suppose a couple of priorities I would put around all the opportunities here…one is we want to create sustained and predictable growth in the business and we want to be able to do that in absolute dollars in the areas of revenue and cash and earnings, and we clearly want to demonstrate that in market share and achievements in that measurement, and then we want to do that, as we said, the highest operating margins possible. But, we are going to focus on sustained and predictable growth of the business and if it creates opportunities for us to capitalize and be more aggressive in some of the realization of either the product competitive advantages that we see or the return on investment in the market segments or the return of some of the buying factors associated with things like NGN, then obviously we will capitalize on that. And at this stage here in July as we try to look out over the balance over the entire year, we have to just wait and see as it comes into clearer view and when we get closer to the end of the year and then into the first half of ’07.
Alex Henderson, Citigroup: Could you just answer the question whether you are in fact continuing to defer in the back half?
Scott Kriens, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: Sorry, forgot that part of it. No, the Verizon deferral itself that took place in the second quarter we don’t expect it to come out until the first quarter of ’07. There are always going to be continuing deferrals and if they were of a significant magnitude and if it was meaningful as was the Verizon deferral in the second quarter, we would comment on those specifically. But it doesn’t mean that there won’t be continued deferrals in any number of account situations of a lesser degree that are just part of the ongoing nature of the business. So if it is was something of the magnitude that we saw in the second quarter then we would comment on that.
Alex Henderson, Citigroup: And if I could just add, you didn’t answer the prior person’s question on whether you saw any weakness in the enterprise seasonally in the month of June, I think that was unanswered?
Scott Kriens, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: That’s like not asking two questions but asking the other guys question, but let me touch on that. You are right, I didn’t comment on that. We don’t really comment on linearity per se on a month-by-month basis. I’m not sure what the reference may have been made. We would always like to see the linearity be better in enterprise business because it often is more backend loaded than we would like. That said, our DSOs were down to 40 days in this quarter that just completed and obviously that’s something with which we take a lot of confidence, and I’m sure that it’s going to be a perpetual exercise to try to do more business in the first month of the quarter than we do in the third. And as we mentioned also, we do see guidance and have given guidance for growth in the third quarter and the fourth quarter.
Randi Feigin, Vice President of Investor Relations: Next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tao Liani with Merrill Lynch and Company, please go ahead.
Vivek Arya, Merrill Lynch and Company: Thanks, it’s Vivek Arya on Tao’s behalf. My question has to do with operating expenses. Let’s say we get towards the end of this calendar year and you do not quite see the NTT, NGN revenues for example in the first quarter; let’s say they are pushed to the second quarter or third quarter for some reason, what levers do you have or what controls do you have on your operating expenses to make sure that they are also reigned in proportionate to your revenue outlook?
Scott Kriens, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: Vivek, primarily what drives our OpEx growth is the stand in R&D, which is not really available to be moved around a whole lot on a quarterly basis, at least not without impact that would be substantial. Some of the sales and marketing perhaps, but even then we are making investments in embedding ourselves in sales cycles and in markets, so there are always some things that you can do to move it around a bit, but I think the better answer to your question would be really to reflect that we have an expectation of operating margins in this low-to-mid 20 range until we see the sustained growth that Bob had mentioned earlier. So, I would say that the situation is reflected in the business model adjustments that we commented on. Clearly, we can make temporary decisions around hiring and things like that that can always be tactical, but I think we actually reflected the concern in the operating model comments that we made earlier.
Vivek Arya, Merrill Lynch and Company: And just to clarify, you said you do expect to see some NGN revenues from NTT in the fourth quarter of this year?
Scott Kriens, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: I didn’t comment specifically on NTT, but NGN itself and the possibility of revenues exists in the back half of the year, but it’s a little early to know whether that…we are still in the process of watching and competing for business there actually, so it’s premature for us to try and time the realization of both decisions and revenues until we get a little closer to it.
Vivek Arya, Merrill Lynch and Company: So your fourth quarter guidance does not include any specific revenues from NTT?
Scott Kriens, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: I think Vivek, what we had said is that we’re not able to be that granular in our outlook, is to be able to describe the exact composition of the guidance. The reason that we have the optimism and the guidance and that we see the chance to grow the business into this $585 million to $595 million range in the fourth quarter is not a function of a specific transaction. It’s more a function of what we see as a broad cross-section of strength in the integrated products across the enterprise, the enterprise backbone routing position, the growth in IT demand, the strength of our install base, the M120 and the Ethernet products that we have rolled out, and the investments in the sales force. So it’s really much more broad brushed into be a function of a single transaction.
Vivek Arya, Merrill Lynch and Company: Okay, thanks.
Randi Feigin, Vice President of Investor Relations: Next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Daubenspeck with Pacific Crest Securities, please go ahead.
Tim Daubenspeck, Pacific Crest Securities: Thank you very much. You made a comment earlier about the Siemens relationship and kind of how the Siemens relationship was developing, now you see opportunities with Siemens and Nokia combination, is that kind of a hunch or have you had specific conversations with Siemens post the announcement about that relationship?
Scott Kriens, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: Tim, we’ve had obviously conversations and meetings actually, and that said we have a very good and ongoing business with Siemens which we have a lot of confidence that will continue. I think the expanded opportunity that NSN presents, the Nokia-Siemens combination presents, is an opportunity to expand our footprint with the strength of the combined relationship, particularly the market share that the combined company has in the mobile market place, but it’s exactly what that would translate to and what will be required to do that, and it’s premature for us to say. I think they have several months ahead of them in preparation for the actual completion and closure of the deal and so there are a lot of things that certainly we couldn’t comment on that are hard to predict that will take place over the next several months before we would really be able to nail things down. But in the meantime, the relationship we have with Siemens continues and it is one in which we have continued confidence if many, many accounts and a lot of opportunities with current customers.
Randi Feigin, Vice President of Investor Relations: Next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Subu Subramanian with Sanders Morris Harris, please go ahead.
S. Subramanian, Sanders Morris Harris: Thank you. I had a clarification on the expenses from the guidance. I didn’t quite hear what you said in terms of expense growth. And then the other question is on E320 requirements, specifically I think Verizon, can you just tell us where you are in terms of some of the deliverables on the technology side for the E320? Thanks.
Robert Dykes, CFO and Executive Vice President, Business Operations: Regarding the expenses, what we said is that we expect stable gross margins in the third quarter and we expect expenses in both the third quarter and the fourth quarter to grow in line with revenue.
Scott Kriens, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: Subu, with regard to the Verizon situation, the deferral at Verizon is a function of the project itself and not product in particular. So, the product shipments that have been made there is what creates the deferred revenue, but the conditions and the business requirements associated with the project are the source of the requirement for the deferrals from an accounting point of view. And as Bob mentioned and just a reminder, we have collected the majority of the cash associated with those shipments as we speak. I don’t want to speak for Verizon particularly here, but I think it reflects some of the confidence that collectively we have in the project.
S. Subramanian, Sanders Morris Harris: Scott, are there any other important things over the next 6-12 months on the E320 which you need to have to be on the top of the IPTV market?
Scott Kriens, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: Certainly, I would say probably there is a perpetual need there, in the IPTV market, and there is a reason I say that is because we actually don’t see this as an IPTV market place. What our customers are telling us is that it’s a multi-play market, and the multi-play market has IPTV as a component, but a standalone IPTV service is no better. Some would argue it’s not even as good as the cable television service today. The real strength of IPTV as one of the elements of a multi-play market initiative is to give a reason in a bundled service proposition to enhance customer loyalty and revenue per user. So, the real market demand here is for architecture that can do the intelligent traffic processing for voice, video, fixed, mobile, data capabilities in this single integrated multi-play infrastructure and associated architecture. So, if I look at the list of requirements and requests for enhancements on both our operating system and our product portfolio across the boards, the more we deliver and the more that we bill, the more the requests come in to make it even better, and to us that’s really quite a positive, because what it says is that the demand for innovation is actually accelerating. And as long as that is true, given the strength and innovation that we have, then we see the continued opportunity to differentiate, and as long that’s true then our ability to grow our markets and deliver on our financial performance is increased as well. So, we see it as quite a continuing requirement and one which we are glad to see.
Randi Feigin, Vice President of Investor Relations: Next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Samuel Wilson with JMP Securities, please go ahead.
Samuel Wilson, JMP Securities: First, a clarification. On the Verizon contract that’s finished for the second quarter, that revenue is deferred, you recognize it in the first half of ’07 and there is no follow on business from that contract, therefore there are no expected deferrals from that specific Verizon contract in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And then my actual question is on the ERX platform versus the E320, the E320 kind of being the new generation, how does is product transition going, how do you feel that the E320 is doing competitively in the market place? Just an update on that product line.
Robert Dykes, CFO and Executive Vice President, Business Operations: No, we didn’t say that the Verizon contract was short lived. We have an ongoing business, lots of business with Verizon as you see from the statistics we earlier reported, so you should not take this as being something of a second quarter event. We merely didn’t refer to what would happen in the third quarter because that hasn’t happened and things evolve over time. So, we haven’t made any comment on deferral in the third quarter but we have a long relationship with Verizon and have sold a lot of products to them, expect to do so in the future.
Samuel Wilson, JMP Securities: When Scott answered Alex’s question he said specifically you did not expect Verizon deferrals in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, there maybe other accounts you defer from but no Verizon deferrals in the third quarter and fourth quarter.
Robert Dykes, CFO and Executive Vice President, Business Operations: No, I think you misheard, Scott didn’t say that. We didn’t say that there would be either. We simply didn’t comment on that point because we made the point that the deferral in the second quarter was an unusually large number and worthy of commenting on. Normally from quarter to quarter we won’t comment on specific customer deferrals, so we don’t to create that precinct, in fact we clearly said that when we did it at the start of the second quarter it was just a one-time event because it was such a large number. But what Scott did say in his comments and we’ve said previously is that every quarter we have some deferrals. It’s just the nature of the type of accounting that we are under these days that is 972 accounting, sort of the software type accounting that requires deferrals of some nature on a regular basis. So, we simply didn’t make a projection for the third quarter, but I certainly would want to project that we continue to sell products to Verizon during the third quarter.
Samuel Wilson, JMP Securities: There’s total confusion here now about specifically large material deferrals of Verizon in the third quarter and fourth quarter, because there are two things that have been said on this conference call, now you are saying there are expectations there could be deferrals and earlier when Scotty answered — I’m not trying to put words in your mouth, Scott — you basically said there would be, so we are just figure out which way the company is thinking here.
Robert Dykes, CFO and Executive Vice President, Business Operations: I’m sorry about that, but our guidance is in line with the revenue that we’ve reported and our guidance is all around reported revenue, not around any deferrals. So, you really shouldn’t be looking for deferrals as a fact that’s on top of the guidance, etc., we will be guiding to the recognized revenue.
Scott Kriens, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: And Sam, sorry if it is confusing you, let me see if can also help clarify. The significance of the deferral in the second quarter was such that we commented on it specifically by customer because of the size of it. The thing that we don’t see happening in the third quarter is for that coming out of deferral and becoming part of recognized revenue, and we think that’s for the first quarter of ’07, but on a lesser basis, meaning much smaller numbers than on any particular transaction or project than what we saw for Verizon in the second quarter. Deferrals kind of come and go on a regular basis. So, if some stuff that’s been deferred that comes out, there is other stuff that gets deferred and goes in. Sometimes it creates noticeable net changes in deferred balance which is actually made up of several other things. Sometimes it doesn’t, but the second deferral will not materialize as revenue and we don’t expect until the first quarter of next year. In the third quarter and fourth quarter, it’s highly likely that we will continue to see ins and outs to the deferred revenue as a result of products that either come out for revenue recognition or go in and become deferred for some reason or another in particular accounts, and Verizon could well be one of those. And if there were to be other shipments against this same project, then the same treatment would apply. We just don’t typically comment on smaller numbers, it’s the large amount in the second quarter that required the commentary.
Samuel Wilson, JMP Securities: Got it, okay.
Scott Kriens, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: And then let me not forget the second half of the question around E320 competitiveness and the ERX itself and then 1440 and others. One of the things that is actually good, I guess or I suppose that could work either way, maybe it’s good or bad, but one of the realities is that especially in many of these large production networks where there are literally millions of subscribers online with a particular technology, in many cases it’s ERX, it’s a very long drawn out process for people in the service provider networks to make changes to the production network to next-gen products or even to new products in the same family. So, I think that we will actually see for quite some time continued shipments of 1440s and ERXs in general into the market place into many of these existing and in some cases new accounts as well, and then we will also see coming online increasingly the E320. It has been deployed in a number of networks and we see that demand continuing and we see the growth opportunity for it continue. But I think at the same time that we will see growth in new markets or new opportunities and in some cases where they’ve gone through the testing and operational cycles, they will roll it into existing ERX install bases. That will happen at very differential rates and there will be a lot of ERX install base in environments where the operational stability and the deployment and the growth rates are such that it’s just too difficult to make rapid adjustments for new products. In many cases, these service providers will actually move quite carefully and as a result quite slowly. So, I think we are going to see both products live long lives. I think that was the question, if I answered that all Sam.
Randi Feigin, Vice President of Investor Relations: We have time for one more question and then Scott is just going to summarize real quick. Operator, one more question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Morgan Keegan, please go ahead.
Simon Leopold, Morgan Keegan: Thank you. I wanted to revisit the Verizon discussion briefly just for a clarification and then the real question. I will start with the real question. You’ve talked about the opportunities in Japan and NGN. I wonder if you could talk about this in terms of market share and your expectations, of what happens in 2007 timeframe as that project ramps, are you gaining market share, holding market share or losing market share? And then the clarification I’m looking for on the Verizon activity is trying to understand whether there are some interim milestones that we should be looking for prior to the first half of ’07 to help us understand the trends of the deferred revenue and the ongoing activity with Verizon? Thank you.
Scott Kriens, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: Simon, I’ll go in reverse order and answer that question first. The major interim milestone that I would look for in this is the collection of the cash and that’s largely complete. After that, other than just the passage of time and the delivery against the conditions that create the deferral in the first place and the success of the project, there’s really not a whole lot else to be said about it. But I think in any of these situations, and in fact it’s sort of a broader than this comment I would say in general, it’s one of the reasons why we focus a lot on our cash generation and our cash flow, the best way to determine the satisfaction of your customers is when they pay you, and obviously we also will work very hard to satisfy the other conditions and to be able to recognize revenue and all that, but payment usually constitutes a useful milestone in terms of satisfaction. Actually, other than that, without all the conditions and evolution of the project, there is not a whole lot I would say to be said about that. And then with regard to NGN and the market share thing, certainly as some of these conditions and opportunities surface market share will be up for grabs. How much of changes and what it creates in terms of the differential opportunity for one company or another, I guess it depends a little bit on what some of the decision making philosophy is around, in some cases for example dual sourcing. It’s kind of an ironic thing. When we started this company 10 years ago we used to argue that sole sourcing was bad and dual sourcing was good and that was one of the reasons to talk to Juniper. Now we find ourselves in many cases arguing the opposite of that point, which is why you need a second source just to buy an inferior product and comfort your procurement department. So sometimes, nevertheless, dual source demand drives opportunities for more than just Juniper and one of the cases for example that we saw the dual source requirement play a role was in the BT21C network for example. And what’s interesting and what I think is more telling, although sometimes it’s harder to spot exactly and many people will make claims, but in initial decisions in NGN — and this isn’t a specific comment on individual deals — often times at the initial stages the customer will say let’s try some of both, and the real winner or who ends up with the 80% and who gets the 20% of the project over time ends up being determined over time. They don’t always award it 100/0 or even 80/20 on the first phase, so I don’t know what will happen in the specific cases here. I suspect it’s going to create opportunity for more than just Juniper even if we demonstrate far and away the superiority of our capabilities. It doesn’t mean it won’t still create opportunity for the second place finisher, so we will have to see how it unfolds. But the real winner will be determined as the project rolls out, because then it will actually shift to one or the other. So that said, we’ll wrap up with a couple of thoughts here. I think obviously what we see as an opportunity for the company as we look out across the second half, we see an opportunity to grow the business in the third quarter, we see an opportunity to grow the business even further in fourth quarter, and we see an opportunity to generate significant cash over those periods and as we look out across the horizon beyond the guidance that we’ve given, we continue to see the opportunity to deliver on cash and cash flows, and it’s one of the reasons why we announced the billion dollar stock buyback coincident with this release. Clearly, we have the requirement to satisfy the conditions of the ongoing investigation and get that solved to the point that we can enter the market and actually execute on the authority that has been given to us by the board, but what we really see here is an opportunity to continue to grow this business, and frankly aside from all of this accounting whether you talk about goodwill or deferred compensation or deferred revenue or anything else, we’re more inclined every day just to run the business by counting the cash, and the cash flow in this business is strong and that probably says more than anything about the reason behind the buyback authorization that we announced today as well. So, we are going to continue to focus, we are going to continue to execute, and the opportunities continue to look larger today than yesterday and larger tomorrow than they are today. So, with that thank you all for your time on this call and obviously we’ll be in touch over the coming six months as well deliver on the results.
Randi Feigin, Vice President of Investor Relations: And there will be an audio replay available of the call on the investor relations section of our website if you are interested. You can call 800-633-8284 as well by listening to the audio replay. And the reservation number for that is 21298192. Again those numbers are 800-633-8284 and reservation number is 21298192. We currently plan to report the third quarter results in the week of October 16, 2006, and if you have any additional questions please feel free to call the Investor Relations Department. Again, thanks for you participation today.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and I would ask you to please disconnect your line.

Operator's Instructions:
Randi Feigin, Vice President of Investor Relations: Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. If you have not yet seen the press release it can be retrieved at www.juniper.net or of at First Call or Business Wire. With me today is Scott Kriens, our Chairman and CEO; and Bob Dykes, our CFO and Executive Vice President of Business Operations. First Scott will begin with a high level overview of our first quarter performance from several different perspectives, and then he will spend time discussing the market dynamics around the world given the recent changes and speculation. Following Scott's comments Bob will provide further detail on the results for the first quarter ending March 31, 2006 as well as an outline of our financial goals for the second quarter. We will then open the call up for questions. Before I turn the call over to Scott, I would like to remind you that the matters we will be discussing today may include forward-looking statements and as such are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements including those risks and uncertainties discussed in our most recent 10-K filing with the SEC. We are also presenting some non-GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP items can be found on our Investor Relations web page. Juniper Networks assumes no obligation and does not intend to update forward-looking statements made on this call. Scott, I will turn it over to you.
Scott Kriens, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Randi. Today I will be talking about the first quarter performance as it relates to partnerships, geographies and product trends, and then I would like to spend the remainder of my time discussing what we see in both the enterprise and service provider markets. And particularly in light of the recent transactions that have been announced by some of the players in the industry on both the service provider and equipment sides of the aisle. So first to the results. We're pleased with a number of accomplishments during this quarter including the customer wins, the strength of our side by side partnerships, the traction of new products and our market leadership position across multiple markets as well as the fundamental financial metrics. Total revenue for the quarter was 566.7 million; up over 26% from the year-ago period and fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.19 up from $0.16 for the same quarter last year. GAAP EPS for the first quarter which reflects stock compensation expenses associated with FAS 123R was $0.13 compared to $0.13 during the same quarter last year. Without the associated stock compensation expense GAAP EPS would have been $0.15 versus $0.13 in the year-ago period. And as always please see the press release on our website for the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. So, let's start with partners. Our high-tech sales model, with our side-by-side open solutions partner approach, continues to be a strong differentiator for us as our customers have the ability to buy best in class products from Juniper while at the same time were able to partner with a complementary portfolio of products and services. During the quarter Siemens represented approximately 15% of total revenue which is a reflection of the continued strength of that side-by-side relationship specifically in areas like IPTV with wins at T-Com in Germany and FastWeb, as well as The Edge for the BT 21C network in the U.K. We're also very excited about our joint development and the research lab that we built in Germany with Siemens which allows customers to try specific network architectures and configurations prior to initiating live services. Lucent Technologies represented approximately 10% of total revenue during the first quarter as well, which as many of you know is an unusually high level of contribution from Lucent compared to prior quarters, and this was primarily due to a large shipment and subsequent revenue contribution from BT for the 21st Century Next-Generation core network deployment. It is also worth noting here that Pat and I have talked subsequent to the announcement of the proposed Lucent/Alcatel merger and the relationship between the companies has not changed; we'll continue to focus on serving customers' needs together. We also continue to see good support from our other global partners including Ericsson, NEC and Avaya, as well as solid channel performance from Ingram and other distributors and several thousand resellers worldwide. We will continue to maintain strategic relationships directly with our customers as we have in the past. Now let's look at the geographies. As we look at the global landscape we see a variety of trends and endorsements from our customers as it relates to these trends. In the Americas the content aggregators are becoming increasingly important players. We already enjoy very good relationships and supply major networks to customers like Google, Yahoo and AOL, and this quarter I am very pleased to announce that we've been awarded a major network decision by Microsoft who selected our T-series for their core network expansion to further enhance the MSN network and its role in content and service delivery for Microsoft. This is an extremely strategic network for Microsoft and its plans for the future, and Juniper will focus intensely on this partnership to demonstrate the power of the intelligent network in these emerging business models. We see continued demand for our core routers with other notable wins this quarter including Cox Communications who chose the T-series to upgrade its entire core for the second phase of its national backbone evolution as well as service provider demand for our security portfolio as MaxCom Telecommunications in Latin America is using our firewall and IPSec VPN product to protect their network infrastructure against security threats. From the U.S. enterprise side, the Sharper Image, the specialty retailer, is completely redesigning its network across 190 stores, and its headquarters as well with a wide range of firewall and IPSec VPNs, SSL VPNs and our WX appliances. Sara Lee is using a variety of our products as well including our SSL VPN's, WX, NS 208s and ISG 2000 with intrusion detection and protection. And in support of Homeland Security and the needs of the Department of Defense, we along with our partner SI International are supporting the Air Force Space Command where the Command will be deploying Juniper's M series, J series and Circuit-to-Packet products. And the leading Canadian daily national newspaper, the Globe and Mail, has deployed our secure access SSL, VPN and IDP products throughout news bureaus spanning seven of Canada's major cities. In EMEA, which was the strongest region in the world, we saw significant business driven by IPTV wins as well as Next Generation Network build-outs. Some highlights include T-Com, the fixed network division of Deutsche Telekom deploying our E and T-series products in one of the world's most advanced networks to deliver IPTV, video-on-demand and other services to customers throughout Germany, and this is yet another great example of the key role we play in IPTV networks worldwide. And RTL television, Germany's leading TV station is upgrading its broadcast distribution network with our M-series multi-service edge routers to ensure quality of service and scalability for live broadcast content. On the Enterprise side in EMEA, DaimlerChrysler is utilizing our SSL, VPN, and WX products, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or NATO, is securing its global network with our IDP solutions. And wins in environments like these are really the ultimate testimony of the quality of our security products. Asia was tough as forecasted, but we're comfortable with the trends we see as carriers move towards the NGN or Next-Generation Network infrastructure. We had success at Telstra, and Korea Telecom and while Japan is still soft due to the NGN pause and we still expect it to continue, we do believe that we're well positioned at both NTT and KDDI in their Next-Generation Network planning and rollout. And we also remain the sole source provider of broadband equipment at PCCW for IPTV services, which remains the largest IPTV network in the world. Other wins of note are China Telecom Shanghai, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of China Telecom, which is scaling its core IP network with the T-series and our TX Matrix multi Terabit routers. And in looking at enterprise wins in Asia, Daunte is upgrading its network in Asia with the M-series to expand the cross regional IP Version 6 Research and Education Network. And the State Bank of India, India's largest and leading bank, has selected the WX and has since experienced a 5X performance improvement reducing file transfer times from more than five minutes to less than a minute. So now let's drill down on the product front. As we look across our business and product terms, the infrastructure products represented 64% of total product revenue, and service layer technology products, or SLT, represented 20% of total product revenue during the quarter with the remainder attributed to service revenue. Infrastructure product revenue was up over 19% from Q1 of '05 to Q1 of '06. And during the quarter we saw significant growth in the core due to T-series and TX where we recognized revenue on over 200 units as more service providers move towards NGN and as new services at the Edge like video gain momentum placing higher bandwidth requirements on the core. In addition, we recognize revenue for the first time on our OC768 interface, where the delivery of production quality 40 gigabits per second technology continues to demonstrate our market leadership. And just a comment on how customers evaluate these types of decisions. Every time you see a customer like MSN or China Telecom make a T-640 or a TX decision, rest assured that they're endorsing the product strategy for many years to come. These decisions to deploy current products are also a judgment of all competing suppliers and the sustainable advantages of their respective technologies as a requirement for fundamental network decisions like these is that they perform for many years to come. In terms of the Edge, we saw strength from a bookings perspective, which will result in increased shipments in subsequent quarters. However, we had some softness from a revenue perspective. With that said, we expect a majority of revenue on a large Verizon deal to be deferred beyond the first half of this year and Bob will talk more about this in a moment. In addition, we're investing in significant enhancements to the competitiveness of the E-series and Edge portfolio, which we expect will reestablish product momentum in the second half of this year. And last, but certainly not least, in the Juniper service provider portfolio is the importance of policy management across the network infrastructure. We deliver this control through our SDX or service delivery exchange, which now supports more than 90 major customers worldwide as well as services for 10 million subscribers globally. And moving on to our service layer technology, or SLT, this portfolio was up over 26% from Q1 '05 to Q1 '06. During the quarter we saw growth in our intrusion detection and protection, or IDP, as our ISG product gained momentum in service provider accounts where we were the best high performance security solution service providers can deploy for IPTV networks, and this is a significant differentiator relative to competition. We also saw strength in the new SSG as well as our DX products this quarter with nice growth over Q4 of last year. We saw relatively flat performance in total firewall, SSL, and J-series although we did close our largest J-series deal to date in EMEA, which we will be shipping throughout 2006. And we saw some softness in WX where we've already started to see a pickup in Q2 for the WX product line. I mentioned SSG earlier. In February we introduced the secure services gateway series, or SSG, which is a new line of high performance firewall and virtual private networking platforms which brings together the best security and best routing elements from Juniper. We've seen a significant amount of traction with customers in the first two months of availability with both orders and shipments ahead of our early projections. The SSG rivals the prior success of our recent 5GT platform in its first days and appears to be headed for similar importance in the marketplace as customers validate our strategy of delivering integrated branch solutions with no compromise between security and routing performance. So markets. Now I would like to spend a few minutes looking at the markets, both enterprise and service provider, and let's start first with the enterprise. As we work with our enterprise customers, they are tasked with the responsibility of evolving from a local campus which is basically a physical wiring project to a global campus where the physical network is replaced with the virtual infrastructure and the landscape changes dramatically. The solution requires more intelligent, more reliable, more scalable and more secure solutions. Obviously this plays to Juniper's strength. For these network attributes are at the center of the advantage we enjoy in the many major global networking decisions that are awarded to Juniper in the marketplace every quarter. And as is true in the service provider marketplace, there is a need for strong side-by-side partnerships with complementary suppliers, and we'll be talking more about examples of our activity and approach in this area in the weeks to come. To provide some data on Juniper's progress in this marketplace, we continue to see approximately one-third of our business coming from enterprises where we've provided product or service to over 10,000 enterprise customers in 2006 thus far, and in addition, routers sold into enterprises were a similar percentage of infrastructure product revenue as last quarter, remaining in the low double digits. And finally, we've made significant investments in the talent at Juniper and increased our focus on efforts to further develop the Juniper brand in the enterprise. In the last quarter alone we've added several senior and experienced leaders to the enterprise marketing organization as well as increased our brand investment in events like the NCAA college basketball tournament here in the U.S. and elsewhere in local markets around the world. We remain enthusiastic about the enterprise market and are very pleased with the feedback of customers and partners alike in their support of our continuing market penetration. The establishment of new customers and expansion of our install base increases our strengths in the enterprise market every quarter. So switching gears to the service provider market, I would like to spend some time here actually, given that there has been a lot of activity in the last quarter with the AT&T BellSouth move, and of course, the Lucent/Alcatel announcements. And with these proposed transactions some unavoidable confusion and speculation as well. The easiest way to stay clear about the dynamics in the market is to remember that these are changes in ownership structure, not changes in market requirements. The way Juniper stays clear on our priorities is to remain focused on those market requirements, understand what the customer needs, and how to deliver it. Look at what is being built no matter how the technology companies combine to build it or how the service providers combine in search of the best way to operate it. So let's look not at strategy. We've spent plenty of time on that subject on previous calls. But let's look instead at the actual network requirements and what that means to Juniper. What is being built is often labeled as NGN, the Next-Generation Network. But what does that mean, and technically what is it, who plays where, and who is in the best position, and why? Think of the NGN as a four-stage model, the core, the edge, aggregation, and access. And it's all about building a multi-service IP infrastructure across those elements. One physical network largely transported via fiber optics and packets being virtually managed across that fiber, all addressed with the IP format and the services represented in the payload of those packets being personalized virtual services for both consumers and businesses. Let's look at each of the elements. The core is the backbone, and probably the easiest to identify. And this is the domain of core routers where Juniper was born and where today we have 35% to 40% of the market in continued growth and success. The edge is where the subscribers are managed and in conjunction with the core where responsibility for the virtualizing, prioritization and the personalizing of services occurs. And this is where the broadband services router or E-series technology plays, and where we've had the majority market share for several years and we're committed to maintaining our leadership position going forward. Then there is aggregation, a switching function where the traffic is physically aggregated and passed on to the network intelligence I described at the edge and the core. And this aggregation layer is where the most confusion exists today because Juniper does not have the majority share of this carrier switching market today, and those who do are calling their switches routers adding to the confusion. And then finally just to finish the model, the access is the entry point where the cable from the customer equipment literally physically connects to the network. And so here is the important point as we see it. Think of the network as having primarily two ways to deliver functionality, hardware and software. The software or the network operating system, ours is called JUNOS is where to find the value-add. The network wide intelligence, the service differentiation, and ultimately the ability to assure the rich user experiences delivered from the network operating system. This is the most critical component at the core of the network, and proliferates from there out to the outer layers. And from the other end of the network the access and the aggregation layers where physical connections are made, the technology is primarily a hardware device with minimal and local software. The heart of our technology strengths and the fundamental advantage for Juniper is in the ownership of the network operating system. This is the global intelligence, and the sometimes overlooked asset in our portfolio. We're one of only two companies who can offer network-wide intelligence and control via a network operating system, and Juniper is the supplier with the most mature and stable of these operating systems. I will spare the arguments about why JUNOS is best in class here but every time a customer like Microsoft selects Juniper they're confirming this assertion more than any other statement that could be made about Juniper's competitive advantage. So the reason for the long explanation and the architectural distinctions is to make three points. When ownership restructuring is taking place as it has and likely will continue, remember that what is needed by both service providers and technology companies doesn't change. NGN, the multi-service infrastructure is the difference between winning and losing and those who partner and supply, and those who operate a multi-service NGN will win, and those who don't will not. On the technology side of things, the heart of the NGN starts with the network operating system, and the ability to deploy that global intelligence throughout the network. Don't be confused in the short-term by marketing campaigns from outside the core of the network by hardware vendors. No network market has ever been won from the outside in. And the battlefield is littered with debris from access and hardware companies who have tried. And finally and very important for Juniper to remember is that just because Juniper has a technology and market position rooted at the core of the network and history on our side doesn't mean that we will automatically win the rest of the war. What it does mean is that as we execute and as we move our network operating system footprint across the layers of the network, we have the opportunity to demonstrate fundamental advantages; advantages in ease of operation, consistency of service delivery and feature support, and ultimately increased velocity with which new services can be delivered at lower cost of ownership. What we need to do and are doing is driving our operating system advantages across a larger and larger array of systems and platforms, and we fundamentally believe that as we do we will present compelling advantages over hardware companies. So, in summary, we are as excited as ever about our opportunities in both the service provider and enterprise markets, and we continue to innovate in light of both of these priorities, and as we do the needs of the networking technology continue to converge as the reliability, scalability, security, and performance requirements of both customer types align more and more every day. What remains unique to each market is the distribution, go to market and channel support required, and we're very excited about the additions of talent we've made in the enterprise market and the continued strength of our brand and customer base in the service provider market. We are a $2 billion company in a $20 billion market. And our challenge is to focus on our customers and our opportunities and to execute. No one questions the opportunity that's ahead of us, and the potential of Juniper to realize the magnitude of that opportunity and the work of recent months and the priority for the foreseeable future will be to remain focused and to let our execution speak for itself. All of this is possible only with the support of our employees whose continued commitment and incredible efforts make these results possible as well as our many partners, our customers, our suppliers, and our long-term shareholders. I would like to thank you all for your continued support and confidence in Juniper Networks. Bob, I will now turn the call over to you.
Robert Dykes, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Business Operations: Thanks, Scott. Our performance of metrics for this quarter reflect the financial strength of our business. As I take you through some of the detailed metrics, please remember that our business will be lumpy by application, by geography, as well as by product mix. Total reported revenue for Q1 was 566.7 million, an increase of approximately 26% from the prior year and within our guided range. However, it was down slightly from last quarter due to seasonality. For our infrastructure products, we recognized product revenue of 363 million, up approximately 19% from a year ago, and down 3.8% from Q4. We recognized revenue on a total of 2,336 infrastructure units this quarter, and we shipped 35,879 infrastructure ports, both down from last quarter due to seasonality. This quarter the core again represented more than half of our infrastructure business and we were very pleased with our ability to almost double the revenue of our T-640 and the TX series products compared with the prior quarter. This further reinforces our contention that many customers have accepted Juniper's operating system architecture for scaling the core as the best on the market. The service layer technology revenue which includes firewall, SSL, IDP and other security products as well as J-series and application acceleration solutions totaled 111.1 million, up over 26% year-over-year, and substantially higher if you factor in the great performance we have had providing service contracts on this business. Compared with last quarter product revenue was flat. However, we did see an increase in SLT units shipped. Q1 revenue represent some seasonal weakness offset by improved focus on our sales efforts and penetrating enterprise market, some great new customer wins, and excellent acceptance of the new SSG product. Now for some more detail on elements within our business. We focus our go-to-market efforts separately by service provider and enterprise. As you know, we have been achieving good customer wins in the enterprise arena. So, while our service provider business grew approximately 10% year-over-year, we grew our enterprise business by over 40% year-over-year. Total service revenue was 92.6 million, up approximately 63% from the prior year and 6.5% from the last quarter. This increase was due to an increase in professional services and resident engineer revenue as well as the growth in the contract install base. The total book-to-bill ratio is greater than one in the quarter. Siemens was a strong contributor in the first quarter representing approximately 15% of total revenue, and for the first time since we began our partnership with Lucent, they represented 10% of total revenue in the quarter. Both of these partners benefited from Juniper winning a significant portion of British Telecom's core and edge Next Generation Network. More than half of Lucent's revenue contribution was from our BT 21-C shipment which enabled them to contribute 10% to total revenue. We do not expect Lucent to exceed 10% of revenue moving forward because this quarter the BT shipment was especially large, and they put down the foundation of the 21-C network. We expect British Telecom's requirements and therefore shipments through Lucent to be more linear in future quarters. From a geographic perspective, the Americas represented 46% of revenue in Q1 relatively flat from Q4 '05. Europe, Middle East and Africa represented 36% of total revenue in Q1, up from 31% last quarter with strength across the region. Asia represented 18% of total revenue, a decline from last quarter, primarily due to the NGN pause which we discussed last quarter as well as seasonality in China due to the Chinese New Year. We expect to see continued lumpiness by Sara as quarterly trends fluctuate. Revenue through our direct sales was approximately 26%, down from last quarter as indirect sales grew due to the growth in our distribution channel as we maintained the expansion and leverage of our channel presence. The non-GAAP references that I am about to discuss exclude the amortization of purchased intangibles, stock-based compensation and special charges. Please see the press release on our web site for the reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP results. Gross margin was 67.9% on a non-GAAP basis inline with our guidance and down slightly from 68.5% last quarter due to product mix. We expect gross margins to be lumpy as a geographic and product mixes fluctuate going forward. Service margin was approximately 54% versus 52% last quarter reflecting economies of scale. As a reminder, all of the operating expenses include a full quarter of expenses from the Funk acquisition. R&D expense was 103.7 million and accounted for 18.3% of total revenue, which compares to 97.7 million or 17% last quarter. While we're keeping tight control over our investments, we had higher payroll taxes early in the New Year, and we're continuing to invest in R&D to ensure that we have products positioned to optimize our share of the upcoming Next-Generation Network infrastructure growth and the opportunities we see to make significant inroads with the enterprise market. Sales and marketing expenses were 121.8 million and accounted for 21.5% of total revenue, which compares to 124.9 million or 21.7% last quarter. The decline primarily relates to commission expense where Q4 had a peak as it was a yearend and a new plan was introduced for 2006. This is partially offset by some growth in the sales force. We continue to invest in our high test model for the enterprise opportunities where we have already started to see the return on investment as well as the continued channel and partner investment and brand development. In G&A expenses were 19.6 million and accounted for 3.5% of total revenue which compares to 16.1 million or 2.8% of total revenue last quarter. The increase mainly reflects the reduction of bad debt expense that benefited Q4. In total, operating expenses were 245 million and accounted for 43.2% of revenue which compares to 238.6 million or 41.5% of revenue last quarter. Operating income was 140 million, or 24.7% of revenue compared to operating income of 155.4 million, or 27% of revenue last quarter. This does put Q1 operating margins just under our long-term model of 25%, but I would like to reiterate what we have said earlier. Our investments made in 2004 and 2005 will pay off as we have a pipeline of new products being delivered over the next twelve months, and we must continue to invest, albeit prudently, in 2006 to take these products successfully to market including sales and marketing to the enterprise as well as service providers. Net interest and other income totaled 19.7 million compared to 17.9 million last quarter. This increase was primarily due to higher interest rates. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 29%. Non-GAAP net income was down for the quarter to 113.4 million or 20% of total revenue compared to 119.6 million or 20.8% last quarter. Diluted non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.19 compared to $0.20 in Q4. On a GAAP basis, including FAS 123-R option expense of 23.1 million and amortization of purchased intangibles and acquisition related compensation charges of 26 million in Q1, our operating expenses totaled 290.8 million and net income was 75.8 million or $0.13 per share. This compared to net income of 105.5 million or $0.17 per share in Q4 which did not include stock compensation expense. For purposes of comparison with prior periods which were reported without stock option expense, GAAP results in the first quarter of 2006 without FAS 123-R, would have been $0.15 per share compared with GAAP results in the first quarter of 2005 of $0.13 per share. Please see the press release on our website for GAAP to non-GAAP results. Now a few comments regarding the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents, short and long-term investments were over 2 billion. Cash flow from operations in the first quarter of 2006 was approximately 83 million. This is down from our previous trends as a result of the adoption of FAS 123(R) with tax benefits from the exercise of employee stock options totaled 56.1 million are included in cash flows from financing activities. Such amounts were historically included in cash flows from operations. Thus, non-GAAP cash flows from operations in the first quarter of 2006 were 139.1 million including the tax benefit from the exercise of employee stock options which were previously included in the operating cash flows. Please see the press release on our website for the reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP results. Accounts receivable was 304.8 million and day sales outstanding was 48 days versus 43 days last quarter. This is above our target range of 30 to 40 days because a component shortage which was resolved at the end of Q1 caused some Q1 shipments to takes place towards the end of the quarter. Total deferred revenue was 293.8 million. As a reminder deferred revenue is made up of service, total inventory, and product currently unrecognizable for revenue. CapEx was 18.2 million, down significantly from Q4 reflecting a temporary reduction in the amount of test equipment being purchased. We expect higher levels of capital spending in future quarters. Depreciation was 17.2 million during the quarter. We ended the quarter with 4,164 in total head count up only slightly from 4,145 at the end of Q4. Now for guidance. The following forecasts and guidance are forward-looking statements and the actual results can vary for a number of reasons including those mentioned in our most recent 10-K filed with the SEC. First, I would like to state that our number one goal is to grow revenue and earnings and to deliver that growth within our operating model. We remain comfortable with the long-term model of producing gross margins in the 66% to 68% range and operating margins in the 25% to 30% range. You can expect to see current operating margins return to our long-term model as a function of revenue growth. In Q2 we are currently forecasting total revenue of 560 million to 570 million. This guidance of 560 million to 570 million reflects 14% to 16% growth from the same period last year. In addition to this guidance we have received orders and expect to ship and receive cash normal terms on additional product to Verizon for which we will defer approximately 25 million to 35 million in revenue and in accordance with our accounting policies. We currently expect gross margins in the range of 67% to 68%. As I stated previously, our long-term non-GAAP gross margin target remains in the range of 66% to 68%. We currently are forecasting operating expenses to increase by approximately 5 million in Q2, mainly due to R&D spend that is being pushed out to Q2 from Q1 and selected sales and marketing investments. That being said, there are areas where we are not spending and more importantly looking for savings including holding marketing and other programs flat, keeping IT, finance and manufacturing flat by moving responsibilities to low-cost countries, reducing manufacturing costs by offshoring as well as offshoring R&D to countries like China and India. Again, although we've been paid on normal terms, we will be deferring 25 million to 35 million of Verizon revenue, whether the shipments to be included as revenue in Q2 we would be within our long-term operating model. I would again like to reiterate our commitment to the 25% to 35% -- 25% to 30% operating model over the long-term. And we expect shares in the range of 610 million to 615 million and approximately $0.19 of non-GAAP EPS. This forecast is based on the assumption of the R&D tax credit being reinstated by Congress during Q2 and made retroactive to January 1st which we expect will be the case based on prior years' treatment. This will put our first half tax rate at 27% and we would then expect to continue with that rate for the full year. If this tax credit doesn't get reinstated there will be an impact of up to $0.01 on EPS for Q2. A GAAP EPS target is not accessible on a forward-looking basis due to high variability and low visibility with respect to the nonrecurring charges, which are excluded from the non-GAAP EPS estimate. As a final comment on guidance, we will provide guidance for the second half when we report next quarter consistent with our past practices. We would like to reiterate what we have said in our last call, which is that we see growth picking up in the second half more likely towards the latter part of the year given traditional seasonality trends. I would also like to emphasize that we will spend strategically and focus on the areas that have given us strong return on investment for the intermediate and long-term. We will continue to focus on our objective of delivering high quality financial metrics. One last topic I would like to cover. As many of you are aware, we have filed a proxy statement relating to next month's annual stock holders meeting. One of the items we are requesting approval for is a new 2006 equity incentive plan. This new plan is intend to do replace two existing stock plans and to reduce the overall number of shares availability for future grant by the Company. We believe our success over the last ten years is due to our highly talented employee base and that future success depends on the ability to attract and retain high caliber personnel. Our Board believes that the proposed 2006 plan is necessary for us to continue to offer a competitive equity incentive program. If approved, the 2006 plan will be a critical factor in attracting, retaining and rewarding the high caliber personnel who are essential to our business. Now we would like to take questions. Please limit yourself to one question.
Randi Feigin, VP, IR: Jason, if you can please instruct the audience regarding the queuing process for Q&A.

Operator Instructions:
Q - Nikos Theodosopoulos: Yes. Thank you. I had a question and then a clarification. On the deferral of the Verizon revenues of 25 million to 30 million, can you explain first of all, why there will be the deferral given that this is an existing customer? Is there a new product involved here and do you expect the deferral to all come in the third quarter, or will it be spread out in the second half of the year? And then just a quick clarification. You mentioned that Lucent was a large customer because of the T. Siemens is also a reseller of that. I'm wondering was there a larger than normal recognition there or was that not a factor on the Seimens' revenue? Thank you.
A - Robert Dykes: To answer your second question first, we mentioned both Seimens and Lucent but it was clearly a bigger impact on Lucent. With regard to the first question, we didn't explicitly say what products we're talking about here, and we don't intend to. It is our normal accounting practice to make deferrals, and probably we're not going to go into the details of why we make deferrals from time to time. But we have done this from time to time with multiple customers over the past few years, and we'll continue to do so, but I don't want to get into the specifics of why we do it at one point or another. But suffice to say this is our normal accounting practice and we've done it in the past as well. We don't expect to recognize the revenue that we're deferring out of Q2 until the first half of '07.
Q - Nikos Theodosopoulos: Okay. But historically, usually these deferrals are related to new product. Can you elaborate if it is a new product or you're not willing to talk about that at this point?
A - Scott Kriens: Actually Nikos, it is not always related to new products. It’s related, I think of it more by projects and sometimes not even new projects. But it’s more project driven inside these accounts when they deploy projects with particular criteria. Sometimes in order to comply with that criteria there are deliverables that result in accounting treatments of deferral. So these are really based more on contractual obligations between customers and ourselves and not necessarily tied to any new product although new products are sometimes a source of deferral that we may take on for our own reasons regardless of the customers. In this case it is customer specific and so it's really more related to the obligation on a per customer basis not to a product basis.
Q - Nikos Theodosopoulos: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Evanson from Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.
Q - Jeff Evanson: Deferred revenue to Verizon, what assumptions did you have about deferred revenue when you gave your first half revenue guidance in the previous conference call?
A - Robert Dykes: We did not have specific assumptions on that subject at the time.
Q - Jeff Evanson: And just one clarification on Asia, over the last five quarters Japan has been between $35 million and $71 million revenue approximately. What was Japan this quarter?
A - Robert Dykes: It was below 10%, but we haven't given explicitly what it was.
Q - Jeff Evanson: Thanks.
A - Scott Kriens: Jeff, I just had one more piece of color on Japan for you if it helps. We actually saw some uptick in Japan, although it tends to be for a function this time of year with the year end, the Japanese year end than any other factors, so we saw some strength in Japan relative to Q4, but not associated with the NGN and other pause activities that we have spoken about in the past. I think those still await proof later on in the year.
Q - Jeff Evanson: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ehud Gelblum from JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.
Q - Anderson: Anderson in for Ehud. I had a question on the service layers technology business. The revenue in that segment has been a little bit flattish now for a couple quarters. And it sounds like you're starting to see some momentum in your channel strategy. I guess two questions related to that. First, when could we expect to see a step up in the revenue rate of that business, and second, if you could provide any commentary around some of the recent acquisitions, Parabit, Redline, and Kagoor and Funk, that would be very helpful.
A - Scott Kriens: A couple separations if it would help. One is we do see some opportunities for the SLT business to continue to improve as we look out over even just the second quarter let alone over the balance of the year. It is also important to note that the SLT portfolio is up a little more than 26% year-over-year from Q1 of last year, some of that is contribution, and to go through some of the directional trends here on the product lines. We saw strength in the DX, which was a Redline product. That was stronger this quarter than the quarter before. We saw some softness in the WX relative to last quarter. That was the Parabit product prior to the acquisition but we've already seen some recovery in that WX product in this early part of Q2. So we are encouraged by that. Funk has a full quarter of revenue, which is up slightly since it was not a full quarter last year. We didn't complete the acquisition until the end of the November timeframe. But again, that's as we have said from time of acquisition there that's really a technology move for us and continues to be an opportunity for us to integrate in our unified access control strategy. That's that one, I don't know if I am forgetting one other than you may have asked about. I think those are most of them. And again -- oh, the other is this Session Border Control technologies and the Kagoor acquisition from some periods back, and again also that as we talked about in the past continues to be focused really on technology integration and those activities continue.
Q - Anderson: Okay. So it sounds like that business might be up sequentially?
A - Scott Kriens: You're talking about SLT in total?
Q - Anderson: Yes. I am talking about the group in total.
A - Scott Kriens: Yeah, we do expect to see growth in SLT as we look out across the both the quarter and the year.
Q - Anderson: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Coleman from Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. Please proceed with your question.
Q - Scott Coleman: Great. Thanks, guys. I am wondering if you could walk us through the customer perspective of J-series versus SSG? Whether you would expect the new platform to cannibalize the old or why a particular customer might look at one product versus the other?
A - Scott Kriens: Sure, Scott. I would be glad to and I actually should -- it helps me go back to something that I didn't include in the earlier question about SSG which is -- for those who may not follow all the acronyms, the Secure Services Gateway product or SSG was announced in the middle of the first quarter and it's really world class security technology with routing and wide area functionality combined and integrated, and it has had a very good ramp in even the first month and a half or two of Q1. We've seen it exceed our expectations on units ordered as well as shipped. So we see that trajectory and the opportunity for that to continue to contribute obviously as we look forward. So that we're very pleased with both in -- and answer to the previous question about the composition of SLT revenues and also to your question specifically, we see that as very good growth product. I think the difference I would describe and this will be a little bit broad brushed just for the sake of brevity on the call here. Between the SSG and the J-series products, the SSG is premier security technology with wide area routing capability, and then operates in a lot of different configurations or different network designs. The J-series product is really targeted as an end point customer or customer premise equipment and potentially stand alone routing capability. While it has security functionality within it, we've seen some of the early traction with this product be a function of service providers delivering services and using this as end point technology and premise based delivery of the virtual service from the service providers, so it's a slightly different design focus, and network design objective that the two products serve. We don't have a particular requirement for one or the other of them to dominate shipment volumes relative to alternatives that we have. It's really more providing the full breadth in the portfolio. Some cases the priority will be on high performance security functionality, and a routing network infrastructure, and in that case, and then that's really the driver behind the traction in the SSG, and in some case it will be more a function of services, termination from a service provider point of view, and end point routing capabilities in which case having JUNOS as it runs within the network infrastructure running on the end point is an attribute that a service provider values quite highly in delivering services. So, if that helps, that's kind of the way we separate it, but we really don't have a requirement for one to -- or for there to be a particular balance or an objective that there be X percent of one or the other in the mix as we go forward. To us it will all roll into SLT revenues. However it breaks out is fine with us.
Q - Scott Coleman: Great. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jiong Shao from Lehman Brothers. Please proceed with your question.
Q - Jiong Shao: Thank you very much. I should have two clarifications if I may. How much of the Verizon $25 million, $30 million deferred revenue is in the deferred revenue on the balance sheet? And Bob I thought I heard you saying, you said in your original first half guidance, is that right, you said you do not have expectation for this part of the business as it relates to the Verizon?
A - Robert Dykes: First of all, the 25 million to 35 million is just Q2 activity. That doesn't relate to anything that might be on the balance sheet at the end of Q1, which in fact was a small amount. The second question just to reiterate what I said before when we gave that guidance for the first half we did not have any specific thoughts about particular customer deferrals like this.
Q - Jiong Shao: But it was part of your guidance, the Verizon you were looking to ship certain amount of products to Verizon?
A - Robert Dykes: Well, you know, when you're putting the forecast together for the whole half, though you have ideas about a whole range of customers that might be part of that revenue, you can't specifically say it was a particular set of customers because those orders selectively booked in effect, those are the orders we're talking about here weren't booked even during the first quarter for the most part. So we provide guidance for the first half based on our experience of what's happened in the past and our general knowledge about what might happen during the first half of the year, but we didn't have specific knowledge to provide specific, just say we knew exactly where our customers were going to be and how much was going to be from each customer nor how much deferral might be from each customer.
Q - Jiong Shao: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Tao Liani from Merrill Lynch and Company. Please proceed with your question.
Q - Vivek Arya: It’s Vivek Arya on Tao’s behalf. Bob, just a clarification. Did I hear you say that Verizon deferred revenue will be in the first half of '07 and then my question is really for Scott. Of your sales through Lucent have you had a discussion on potential channel conflicts when it comes to edge routing revenues? Those when Lucent and Alcatel do get together they will have the metric portfolio and the Riverstone portfolio. So have you discussed issues of potential channel conflicts with that?
A - Robert Dykes: To answer your first question, yes, I said we expect that we would recognize the revenue during the first half of 2007.
A - Scott Kriens: And then Vivek, on the evolution of the whole combined Lucent/Alcatel proposed transaction, what we really talked about, whether it’s Pat or others within the organization, the real, I suppose commentary would have to come from them as they sort some of these things out over the next several months as to what their intentions would be. I wouldn't pretend to speak on their behalf here. Just to reflect the conversations we have had and what we see here and what we understand, and so let me -- I suppose couch it that way, and also explicitly to the conversations we have had about this, there is a clear commitment on the part of partnership here both Pat and I as well as the Company continue to support customers together. One of the other things that we've talked about is that the Lucent/Alcatel company combined represents one of the largest system integrators in the world completely independent of its manufacturing arm. And so here I will diverge from discussions there and just offer you my opinion, which is I think the result of this is likely to be quite positive because what it represents is a business which will demonstrate the power of system integration. And much as IBM has done with its business or as an EDS or others in the system integration business do routinely, the business model requires that the integrator provide the customer the best in class technologies and operate with independence and place the best interests of the customer at heart. So, I think this is actually a great opportunity for equipment manufacturers in general to see the emergence of system integration as a more distinct industry. Probably a final comment on this subject would be just a reminder which is, if you remember it’s important to remember the business service providers are in which is the transportation of network traffic, and if you're in the transportation business, you could equate it to being in the airline business where they transport passengers. If you're going to be in the airline business you better fly the airplanes that burn the least fuel and carry the most passengers and travel the longest distances or you'll be out of the airline business pretty quickly. So networks and network operators have to operate networks that carry the most traffic, the greatest distances with the least cost and the highest security, and that is then what they will turn to integrators to deliver. So we continue to be strategically confident in that fact because it is economically obvious, and what I think will happen as we will continue to see the emergence of system integration as an industry and I think that will continue to support our strategy and we'll see some distinctions continue to materialize in the marketplace between integrators and manufacturers just by pure requirement for both business models to survive. So that's not a specific prediction, and I am not so presumptuous as to claim Lucent/Alcatel's eventual destiny here. That's for them to decide. But we strongly believe in the, with the correctness, or the accuracy, or defensibility of our strategy in this arena.
Q - Vivek Arya: Thanks. And when do you expect Japan to recover, just a final question? Thanks, Scott.
A - Scott Kriens: It is a little hard to predict exactly. We do see some activity in the second half of the year in Japan that should be encouraging. It is a little hard to guess at the timing of some of the actual decisions, but we see, I would say at a minimum, equal or better opportunity for our potential in the Japanese market as the comments we made in the January call when we first outlined the pause. I think there is a great opportunity there, and it absolutely requires if you will to go back to my analogy the best airplanes, and that's usually a place where we fly pretty high.
Q - Vivek Arya: Thanks, Scott.
A - Randi Feigin: Next question, please. Jason. Next question, please.
Operator:
Operator Instructions:
Q - Steve Kamman: A couple questions. One on the Japan side. Can you just talk through the NGN transition there and when you see that kind of starting to roll through and then, can we expect to see the same thing in Korea, Taiwan, Europe, U. S. and just kind of, anything you can talk us through on a more multi-year basis in terms of what they're trying to do there? I don't think a lot of people appreciate it. But more on the specific side is on the E-series and stuff at Verizon are you going to be able to link JUNOS onto that or is this still in the context of the existing E-series software or are you going to be any rebuilds on the software there?
A - Scott Kriens: Well first of all, Steve, thanks for the clarifying question on the NGN thing. It’s really there is a, I guess I wouldn't call it unique over time, but that’s a moment there is a distinct condition in Japan which isn't a function of routers. It’s actually a function of the network build out there. There are over 3 million fiber drops to the home in Japan, and that is more fiber to the curb or to the home in a country or per capita than exists anywhere in the world, and so it’s actually what happens when the tributaries are capable of those capacities is it quickly strangles a network design because the peer to peer traffic and the upstream and down stream capacities that can flood the network are massive. And there is a really powerful sort of combinatorial effect when you have multiple tributaries suddenly moving at light speed converging on a network design or a core infrastructure. So Japan has hit a problem here as a function of build-out before other countries in the world or other markets really because of that. Now, in a place like Korea where you really can serve a big percentage of the Korean market by serving the city of Seoul itself which has got 20 million people in it, and as many of those people live in high rises, you can hope to approach some of the same density or some of the same performance through the sheer density, but even then there is not as much peer optical capacity on a subscriber basis. So I think, we see the Files project at Verizon is an example of commitment it fiber build-outs and obviously you see high capacity and high bandwidth access strategies being deployed in different technologies around the world. And the difference I think is just that they're much further along in Japan, and so it puts more pressure on the NGN question more quickly. But presumably as households require multiple simultaneous HD video downloads or downstream feeds, because they're going to be two or three people in the home watching and somebody else recording something and meanwhile someone else is downloading music or surfing the net and grabbing images and a few other people are on the telephone, it is representative of what's going to happen market wide. So I think we will see it, but it will happen at differing rates. On the Verizon thing in particular, we don't really have a comment to offer on the specificity of the situation, but again it is more -- I wouldn't think of it so much as a function of product. The E- series product is being deployed there. It has been. And it will continue to be. It’s more a function of the customer requirement and the accounting practices that follow, so I wouldn't treat that as an indicator of a particular technology shift. It is really much more project related within the network itself, and within the project itself.
Q - Steve Kamman: All right, Scott. Thanks very much.
A - Scott Kriens: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Sue from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Q - Mark Sue: Thank you, to Scott. What are some of the key points that will make this second half better than the first half? Is it seasonality, geography, new products or better execution, and I ask this on the flip side. You do have larger targets. You do have moving parts with deferrals and increasing their ability as they move along in the year with respect to your partnerships. Or if I can ask a different way in the June quarter the bottom.
A - Scott Kriens: Well, we will wait and see about all of that. As you know it is hard to know. Let me take the question and look at pieces of it. We see as we mentioned the 560 to 570 guidance for Q2 is exclusive of the $25 million to $35 million deferral which when combined would put us at or above the original guidance we gave. I guess I use that fact as representative of the fact that we feel like we're tracking to the outlook and the expectations that we had coming into the year. It’s a little hard to sort through some of the seasonality questions. For example there certainly is that factor in Q1 because it is always a slow starting period. It is likely that the summer period will cause some of the same kind of conditions which is why we do still see growth in the second half of the year. But we're cautious about the exact timing of that more as a function of typical seasonality than anything specific that we see on the horizon. I think that what we see for us in terms of opportunity here is really twofold. Clearly people are continuing to deploy services across these networks, and I call it services as opposed to products. Because products follow, but we sold over 200 T series products this quarter alone. We sold a little over 100 of them in Q4 of last year, so quarter-over-quarter that's doubled. And that people aren't buying capacity except on what they call a success basis, so they wouldn't be adding that many more T series products to the core infrastructure or TX's at China telecom for terabit purposes without there being services running across these networks. And all of that kind of ripples through to the edge and to the end points where J-series or SSG or other products could be, so I think some of the indicator that is we can see continue to give us the confidence that the services are being deployed and the services are being consumed. What we needed to do to fuel our growth is two things. We need I would say broad execution, and that means across many dimensions in the Company. We need to continue to be focused. This Company has in the 2005 year grew more than 50% year-over-year, and our challenges or the things that we have to do, we often say it this way in Juniper, are largely contained in the four walls of these buildings, and we don't need any more market than we have. We have got plenty of market out there. We don't need any more intellectual property. We don't need more technology. We don't need although we would always welcome, we have a lot of customers. We've got wonderful partners, and great partnership structures, a lot of talent here. What we need to do is execute and deliver, and the good news in that is that the destiny of our success is all in our own hands. We don't need an outside force here, and at the same time the challenge is described equally which is that it is up to us. So it doesn't mean we're not going to continue to be aware of the market and what's going on by any stretch, but what we need to do is within the four walls of these buildings, and that's just to focus and go execute. We have plenty of product initiatives. We'll spend -- the vicinity of $400 + million this year on R&D, and that's not for nothing so you know there is a lot of deliverables coming, and there is a lot of opportunities to consumer when it gets here, so. We have a lot of work to do, but I would rather have it be work in our own destiny or our own control than being dependent outside the Company, so I am not sure if that answers all your question. That's what we see as both challenge and opportunity.
Q - Mark Sue: Sounds like a yes.
A - Scott Kriens: That's a yes if that's a way to say it. Yes, we see a lot of yes in the future.
Q - Mark Sue: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Long from Banc of America Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Q - Tim Long: Can you talk a little more about the competitive environment and any changes you may be seeing particularly at the edge of the network and can you comment on what type of new functionalities or new products you may be designing to reestablish your position in this market?
A - Scott Kriens: A good way to think of it, Tim, or a way we think of it is that the -- and it is really part history and part our own belief as well here, if we look at the way networks or the network marketplace has been won or lost in the past, whether it is service provider or enterprise, either actually I think the same, a network market is ultimately directed from the inside out. It is driven from the core, and it is driven from the fact that the network -- I call it network operating system, and I mean that with sort of small O, small S because it is an operating environment. But the intelligence that is responsible for the heart of the network functionality is in our opinion the strategic high ground, and from there, there is a requirement to deploy products, or if you think of it in terms of software and hardware, think of it as hardware vehicles or systems which deliver that functionality and intelligence to different price points in the network. And traditionally and just classically, is its business school case study stuff, there is two ways to approach a network market. You can take hardware out at the end points of the network and attack from the outside in, and you can take an operating system position from the center of the network and attack from the inside out. Nobody has ever won attacking the market with hardware from the outside in, in the networking game. And in our opinion, no one ever will. It doesn't mean that there aren't moments in the sun and there aren't claims and temporary opportunities or even a role for hardware in the network, but it is ultimately a tactical commodity-like role of physical connectivity. And the intelligence and ultimately the opportunity to direct and control the activities in the network are done by the users from the core and the center of the network out, and as a result the suppliers of the network intelligence from the inside out and from the core to the end points those are the suppliers who have the advantages. So the challenge for us or the assignment is take that intelligence and populate all of the points in the network on which you can place it, and it could operate. And if you do that, you have got a long-term strategic opportunity because that's permanently unavailable to the hardware vendor from the outside in. You have got to own the core of the network in order to have an opportunity to own the edges long-term, and this is again nothing taken for granted here. We have a lot of work to do, but the thrust of our direction here is to take the strength of the network operating systems that we have, and use it to populate the rest of the network. When we do —
Q - Tim Long: Can you comment on what new functionalities you will be focusing R&D on at the edge of the network? You mentioned you would be spending more on trying to reassure your position in that market.
A - Scott Kriens: It is not so much functionalities in those places in the network. Again, remember, it is hardware based. So, it is much more about density and cost. And so it’s taking the functionality we already have and delivering it at different densities in different cost points. And when we do that, people who have hit cost points who don't have the functionality and the intelligence that resides within the core operating system will see their advantage evaporate. I wouldn't describe it so much as features and functions. We have the features and functions. We just need to go on a systematic, methodical march to deploy that at densities at price points, that lower end product has temporarily grabbed, and it is imminently executable in our opinion.
Q - Tim Long: Thank you.
A - Randi Feigin: And we have time for one more question please.
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Brant Thompson from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Q - Brantley Thompson: Scott, I guess two things. First just to circle back to one of the original questions on the call about why the Verizon revenues got ended up in deferred revenues, if there is any further clarity on that? And then second you talked about a new product that could help reinvigorate the second half. Could you just talk about how that's going to come to market? Is it something that's been in trial with customers already or will it be going into trials? And any other color around that would be useful. Thanks.
A - Scott Kriens: Brant, not a whole lot more to offer that probably hasn't been said on the Verizon deferral. It is project based. It is something we see likely to remain in deferred until the first half of '07. And yet I suppose the one reminder about that that's worth noting is these are -- this is a function of accounting treatment, and what will happen is we will ship the product. It will be shipped with normal terms, and on the invoices for payment, and payment will be received by Juniper, so this is not an issue of whether we're going to ship the product, whether we're going to deploy the product or whether they're going to pay for the product because we believe all of those things are going to happen, and most all of that, the orders is necessary to ship against that 25 million to 35 million are in-house as we speak on this call, so this is, I guess George Bush said this once, the difference between cash and accounting. If you count the cash it's simple. If you go to the accounting rules it gets a little more complicated. So those are probably things I would remind on the Verizon deferral question. With regard to products, we didn't really comment specifically on a product. What I would say when you spend $400 million on R&D in a calendar year, there is going to be new product coming at a regular rate. And it really addresses several things. Density and cost is one of the things I spoke about a minute ago. Competitiveness of the products that we have, and adding to the performance and the capacity of those products. Furthering advantages that we have in the core of the network. Really if there was a way to generalize you would say it like this, because this is really the hard problem. It is trying to deliver the intelligence and the performance of the technology at the same time. If you think of what these networks have to do as we start zipping HD television and other real time services where delays of milliseconds turn into quality problems, you have to be incredibly tight in your tolerances with regard to delays and therefore performance. But at the same time you've got to interrogate every bit in the network deeply to make sure that it is safe to send in the first place and if the person sending it to is authorized to receive it. So you have this really painful combination of how do I look deep into this traffic while I send it at megabits or terabits per second. If you had the ability to relax one of the two, send it slowly and look carefully, or send it quickly and look casually, you could do either one. The problem is that neither of those two tradeoffs are acceptable. So almost every development we are doing here falls into one of two camps. Either integration of technologies in order to consolidate and this is in the security market what we see for example being critical. It's the integrated security solutions that win the game here and we have seen plenty of examples even in the last few weeks of the decline of the standalone companies and products in this space, so our spend is on integration and/or the combination of performance and intelligence being delivered at the same time in the same systems, and that will translate into products on a number of fronts. Really on a perpetual basis, and often we will defer any public disclosures on specific products like SSG for example until they're in customers hands. You certainly can rest assured when you do see a customer make a T series decision or really many of the decisions that are made around our portfolio, those are decisions made based on those customers asking a lot of questions about the road maps and the products and the portfolio that is going to be available overtime because they're making a decision for many years, and so each one of those decisions is an endorsement of the technology and the direction and probably the best indicator we could give until we actually announce products.

Operator: Thank you and good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us this afternoon. If you have not seen press release it can be retrieved off of www.juniper.net or First Call or Business Wire. With me today is Scott Kriens, our Chairman CEO; and Rob Dykes, our CFO and Executive Vice President of Business Operations. Today Scott will begin by reviewing Juniper’s fourth quarter and the full year 2005 performance. He will then spend the remainder of his time outlining how we will use our accomplishments in 2005 to leverage our success into 2006 given the current market trends as it relates to our long-term strategy. Following Scott’s comments Rob will review the detail financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ending December 31st 2005 as well as outlining our financial goals. We will then open the call up for questions. Before I turn call over to Scott, I’d like to remind you that the matters we will be discussing today may include forward-looking statements and as such are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements, including those risks and uncertainties discussed in our most recent 10-Q filings with the SEC. We are also presenting some non-GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP items can be found on our Investor Relations web page. Juniper Networks assumes no obligation and does not intended update forward-looking statements made on this call. Scott, over to you?
Scott Kriens, Chairman, CEO: Thanks Randy and Happy New Year to everyone. Today I’ll be talking briefly about the fourth quarter and the full year performance for 2005 and then I’d like to spend the majority of my time focusing on how we can leverage the accomplishments in 2006 and beyond. Last quarter I spoke about the foundation we built and as I look back not only across the last year but over the last 10 years as we approach the celebrations of our 10 year anniversary next week actually. There have been tremendous accomplishments and successes to mark our progress and we are going to continue to leverage these experiences based on the trends that we see in 2006 and beyond. So firstly the results. We had another solid quarter, our 14th consecutive quarter of growth and as you’ll once again see this is reflected in the metrics we’ll review today. Revenues, earnings, cash, customers and market share all grew as we continue to outperform in all of our target market. Total revenue for the quarter was $575.5 million, up over 5% from last quarter and fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.20 up from $0.19 last quarter. GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.17 compared to $0.14 last quarter and GAAP EPS for 2005 was $0.59 versus $0.25 last year. And please see the press release on our website for the reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP results. These results are reflection of our direct sales efforts as well as the contribution of our key strategy partners and resellers. And as we look across the full year I’d like to share both our strategy with regards to our partners as well as some numbers, which represent our success in delivering results in support of that strategy. We believe in open standards, and using partnerships to broaden our reach and best serve the evolving requirements of our customers and as many of you know we have a number of key strategy partners including Ericsson, Lucent, Siemens and NEC in Asia. And in addition we announced this morning a formal agreement with our new strategic partner Avaya to deliver secure converged communication solutions to enterprise customers worldwide. These partners has been instrumental in building relationships with our customers and we remain very excited about the strength of these partnerships as we enter 2006. This side-by-side approach with its support of open standards continues to be well received in contrast with end-to-end proprietary alternatives. And it is also important to understand that with our high touch model each and every customer has a Juniper representative who is responsible for direct contact with them as we sell side by with our strategic partners. In total the revenue generated from these four strategic partners grew almost 40% from 2004 to 2005, more specifically the full year growth rate for Ericsson, Lucent, Siemens and NEC were approximately 57, 32, 44 and over 100% respectively, and Siemens contributed greater than 10% of total revenue during the fourth quarter as well as for the full year of 2005. We are also pleased with the product balance across our business. For Q4 the infrastructure products represented 77% of total product revenue while service layer technology products represented 23% of total product revenue during the quarter. From a geographic perspective last quarter, we saw a strong growth in the Americas and Europe including developing markets in Latin America, Middle East and Eastern Europe in areas like Bulgaria and Russia among others. However, we saw a softness in Asia specifically within Japan due to a pause in the build out of its next generation networks or NGN as decisions are contemplated at many of the major carriers and the market prepares for the next wave of bandwidth and services expansion. This is a very exciting time in Japan we will talk more about in just a few minutes. Finally for the quarter we invested in both the market and product development areas announced several new products during the quarter, we are once again recognized as a leader by the industry analysts and realize significant accomplishment in expanding our broader channel presence. So for a quick look back across the full year of 2005, I would like to point to some numbers and some highlights, which has helped our growth, and extend our success. We grew total revenue to over $2 billion, up over 54% from 2004 and nearly tripled the revenue of only two years ago. This is a major milestone and accomplishment for the company. Fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.72, up 64% from $0.44 last year and more than a four-fold increase from two years ago. We are generating cash from operations of almost two-thirds of a billion dollars per year ending 2005 with over $2 billion in total cash and investments. Currently the business generates approximately $2.5 million of cash from operations every business day. In the marketplace, we again grew significantly faster than our competitors year-over-year, allowing us to further establish our brand and gain market share in various segments of the market. As an example we were the leaders in Gartner’s Magic Quadrant in all four areas: Firewall, IPSec VPN, SSL VPN and IPS: our Intrusion Prevention Systems, and we are in the No.2 slot in the high-end enterprise router market according to Synergy Research Group, up from 0 in 2004. And in addition we maintain the No.2 position in the service provider EDGE routing category and have done so for more than 13 consecutive quarters according again to Synergy Research Group. And we did all that by expanding our market presence globally and are now doing business in more than 75 countries around the world. We expanded the breath of the channel, growing our sales through the distribution channel by approximately 160% and the number of quality channel partners to over 6000. One example of this success is Ingram Micro, a major distributor of Juniper Solutions whose business now makes them our third largest partner. And we did all of this by staying true to our mantra, which is “Focus”. In the words of our customers we did what we said we would do and this is what the company and Juniper brand is known for in the market making and meeting commitments. We introduce thousands of new software features and a number of major releases throughout the year across several best-in-class platforms including the Multichat, ETX, Matrix and the E320 broadband services router and our infrastructure portfolio. And our security portfolio we introduced the ISG 2000, the SA 6000 and many other products as well as the unified access control, which is an industry leading open standards architecture that helps protect customers existing investments by providing security to the networks and the equipments that has already been bought. And in addition we continue to invest in innovation and we’ll do so again 2006. In 2005 we spent over $300 million in research and development for the ramp of new product cycles, which you’ll see delivered over the next 12 months and we will spend over $400 million in 2006 to both meet our customer requirements and to further extend our lead in the market. So all of that innovation is pointed at some major trends in the marketplace. So let us talk about some of these trends that we see as we enter 2006. From a customer perspective, the network requirements are converging along with the networks primarily along three types of users. There are the traditional carriers, who are now expanding from their stronghold in the physical network with direct access to the subscribers to the delivery of network services for those subscribers in the form of triple and quadruple play capabilities in voice, data, video and wireless. And secondly, there is a new age providers: Goggle, Yahoo, and others who battle for command to the website and the home page preferences from which the user will launch his enquiry into the network for both personal and entertainment needs. And then thirdly, we see the business of our enterprise network customers now more than ever running with an increasing dependency on that network to connect to employees, customers, suppliers and partners in a more sophisticated model of virtual costs and benefits. Among the traditional carriers there’s a wave of next generation network planning, as the migration for multiple standalone legacy networks to a single converged infrastructure accelerates. And I mentioned a slowdown in Japan earlier, this is why we’re seeing the major service providers in Japan who are some of the most aggressive builders of fiber from the network infrastructure all the way out to the home, experience the greatest needs to plan for the next generation of capacity, performance and reliability as they serve an increasingly network literate user population who demands the latest services. And there’s much to be learned here as we believe Japan will set an example of what is and will increasing be happening in other countries of the world as they grow. The second wave of build out will be lumpy but it is enormously important strategically, as it will unlock a level of scale and performance that will fuel creativity and expansion of the entertainment and services offered in years to come. Other examples of these kinds of decision include China Telecom in Asia, the Files project at Verizon and the BT 21C network currently underway in the UK. 2006 will be a year of decisions, planning and some rollout as carriers around the world are in various stages of growth and acceptance by their subscribers. And these decisions will also fuel the continued expansion of broadband wireless and mobility both in the area of DSL and cable, cellular as well as WiFi and will see the continued confirmation that there is only one single infrastructure built around IP, which will support these access technologies as last mile solutions connected to a single network. Obviously this also has implications for the traffic and user profiles on these networks as well. We saw online shoppers spend over $30 billion in this just completed holidays season, which is an increase of 30% this year over last on a very large number, and Ovum has a consulting house that surveys trends, predicts that within the next 10 years the majority of all holidays shopping will be shifted online. There are more than three million songs a day being downloaded from iTunes and more than 8 million videos have been downloaded from that site in the last three months alone. And the growth of use at sites like Goggle and eBay speaks for itself. In the enterprise market, requirements are moving closer to those of traditional service providers everyday: banks, governments, retailers and other businesses large and small demand the same, always on reliability and simultaneous high performance and security as was once reserved for the larger service providers, and this is being delivered through MPLS and other technologies exactly as it is being designed for the service provider. And this consistency is seen as a huge benefit for Juniper in the competitive assessments that are being done today. Security continues to evolve both as a sophisticated requirements in an enterprise network and as a service provided to enterprises through the managed service offerings of the carriers. Application performance and network requirement to ensure the user experiences protected as business processes move online is more strategic than ever, and our capabilities in both website and wide area optimization are big differentiators for Juniper in the marketplace. All these demands are being placed on the network with the expectations that multiple services: voice, data and video will seamlessly and intelligently be supported transparently to users. With expectations are that they will simply click and the device in their hands will respond as needed. And this is easy to say but harder to do and even harder still to do it with the operational simplicity that’s required to scale reliably. So if we couple our accomplishments in 2005 with the trends that we see moving into 2006 what then Juniper Networks going to do. And I offer you two perspectives on this today, from an internal perspective we continue to evolve Juniper as a company and we need to remain agile while focused in order to take advantage of the trends I just outlined. The sheer number of our customers and the visibility and importance of their relationship with Juniper is increasing and their expectations of Juniper are increasing as well. They expect not only best-in-class technology and products from us but integrated and focused answers to their business needs. We must maintain our focus on our service provider and enterprise customers and then organize Juniper product and investments within those priorities. So in that spirit we have evolved our organization as well, with the formation of two business teams: the service provider business team, and the enterprise business team. Both teams will be responsible for the success of all our products and services for the respective customer segment and each will represent the full power of the portfolio to their respective customers. In addition we announced some organizational changes as part of a structured succession plan, which supports these new business teams and you probably already seen the press release outlining the new appointments. And we are very excited to show-off the bench strength of the company with the recognition of Eddie Minshull, Jeff Lindholm and Kim Perdikou, each of whom has several years of senior management experience at Juniper and have all taken key executive assignments. And we are also glad to report on our potential as seen from outside the company as we welcome Paulette Altmaier to Juniper in a key executive role with her wealth of experience, reputation and proven success in the industry. But what really matters is beyond how we organize inside the company, it’s what our talent and focus allows us to do in the marketplace on behalf of our customers, so I’d like to describe first our approach and then our strategy. First, our approach. Our primary goal is the build the Juniper brand and to expand on our trusted relationship with our customers and to provide them the answer to their strategic needs. We are measuring our success and setting our goals for our sales teams in terms of absolute growth and increasing our presence in the process. Winning the game, as we have for the last three plus years is the target we prioritize and exactly which product score the points in any particular quarter is the secondary measurement. This is why we’ve organized around our service providers and enterprise customers and beyond our individual products and our 2006 goals are stated in terms of customer mind and wallet share and whatever mix and products and services are necessary to achieve those goals. All of our customers whether we talk to service providers or enterprises required carrier class reliability. The lines are blurring but this where our opportunity and our leverage are becoming actually clearer than ever because they all need traffic processing infrastructure to succeed, and this placed to our advantage as we’ve seen in the classic enterprise market where we do approximately one-third of business today. As you also know this represent only a small scale of this market and that’s a large opportunity looking forward while our strength in the traditional and emerging service provider market continues to be the foundation of our innovation and growth. Our strategy and the tactics remain the same as they have been since the inception of the company 10 years ago. Our strategy simply stated: Juniper is the best supplier of Traffic Processing Infrastructure for the delivery of Virtual Networks Services. And our tactics: focus and execution as always. The strategy is easy to explain; the networking industry consists of four parts as we see it. The electronic devices we all use, the laptops, cell phones, PDAs, iPods, etc., in short all the users tools for the sending and receiving of information and entertainment. And this is equipment in the category of consumer electronics, high volume standards based, low margin, low cost. Secondly, the entertainment which comes from the movie studios and the music artists; and thirdly, the information which come through the corporate data centers and the websites and the search engines; and finally all of that traffic is eventually sent through the physical networks, the copper and optical cables, the radio base stations and the satellites in the sky. Each of these four elements: devices, entertainment, information and transport is interoperating so that when the user of the device clicks they get their answer. But none of those elements: the user, his device, the entertainment, the information or the physical cable knows anything about each other and they never will and that is where the Traffic Processing Infrastructure comes in. We at Juniper setup the infrastructure that knows the source and the destination of all the billions of people and devices and that’s where the Internet protocol or IP comes in. Then we process over that infrastructure, that’s where we apply the security for example, and then we intelligently manage the traffic itself so that the Voice over IP phone call gets there quickly and with high-voice quality where the pipe opens wide enough for the HD movie or the credit card gets encrypted for the safety of the online commerce. Put it altogether and you have the Juniper strategy: Traffic Processing Infrastructure. Every time you click, we add value. So now lets move it from the strategy and the structure to this specifics and I would like to close with three specific examples, one each for the Traffic, the Processing and the Infrastructure and in doing so answer the top three questions we’ve received from investors over the recent months. Let us start with the traffic. We’ve received a lot of questions about IPTV, one of the most topical types of traffic lately and one that has been marketed hype and claimed as their own by a lot of company’s. But let me give you some facts. According to Ovum again there are about 2.5 million IPTV subscribers on the planet today with the two largest networks in the world representing approximately 600,000 of those subscribers at PCCW in Hong Kong and FastWeb in Italy both running on Juniper Networks infrastructure. In addition to those 600,000 subscribers we’re currently operating in 14 other IPTV accounts worldwide with products deployed in 10 of those networks and trials in four others and if successful we will then be deployed in those as well. You might not know this if one were to judge by the declarations being made about IPTV. But if you separate the market in hype and instead look at the actual traffic and where Juniper operates in the network today, we are doing what we say we will do: focusing on the real customers, supporting the real subscribers. And as an example of the strategy this is the traffic part. So next onto the processing and the network security that’s enabled by processing that traffic from within the infrastructure. Another frequently asked question pertains to our growth in the security marketplace. We began with the security products in mid 2004 and if look at growth in the second half of 2004 when we began officially in the market and compared to the second half of 2005 just completed for an apples-to-apples year-over-year comparison we have grown the security business by over 30%. As I mentioned earlier we occupied the Gartner Magic Quadrant in many areas and are the only company to occupy that quadrant with four separate security offerings in the market today. We’ve grown faster than virtually all of our competitors and significantly faster than those with only standalone security products to offer. The market is evolving and it is moving to integrated networks security solutions, which favors Juniper as we’re integrating the best-in-class products and expanding the functionally of existing products at the same time. Stay tuned for more examples of progress here as we are very excited about the upcoming developments we have in this space. And this is an example of execution in the processing elements of the strategy. Processing of traffic for the delivery of the value-added service of network security. And finally to the infrastructure itself then to the last then the most commonly asked question, which relates to our leadership position in the core. And this is the easiest question of all. We shipped over 100 T640s in the last 90 days alone and we are now shipping the TX Matrix multichassis products as well which quadruples the capacity of the T640 with the roadmap to expand dramatically beyond there. I believe that’s about the same number of units our nearest competitors’ claims to have shipped in total over the last 2½ years. And more importantly the T640 ships with battle-tested and proven reliable modular software that has literally millions of hours of runtime production hardening. And I can tell you that matters when the entire business depends on the rock-solid reliability of the software. So that is the infrastructure story. So put it altogether: the IP traffic leadership, the security processing market leadership, the core backbone infrastructure product leadership, and you have our strategy in action. The best supplier of traffic, processing, infrastructure for the delivery of virtual network services. And more importantly the focus on only that, which is the reason that as we complete our first decade, and in doing so cross over the $2 billion mark in revenues generating approximately $2.5 million of business of cash every business day, we’ve enjoyed the success to make this possible. Strategy, Focus and Execution. So in summary, there are a lot of people in this market with a lot to say, and we have all got to get used to that for the next few years. In fact we can be comforted by all the marketing and the hype that will be thrown around because that’s how you can tell there’s real opportunity. And everybody wants to a piece of it. And that’s a really a sign of the disrupted change that’s underway. For many here Juniper is on the companies that ignore all of that and stay focused on the customers and the strategy, which is where this game will be won. We’ll continue to be prudent financially as well protecting our financial objectives and balancing them along with our strategy and our technology lead and our customers. We’ll invest surgically and will measure carefully and constantly, and this will multiply to many times more than that as a result of our discipline to focus on areas where we can add value. We are at the intersection of opportunity through which the entertainment and the information must travel on its way to the devices and the users to deliver value and every time you click we’re there. We have an obligation to our customers, and an opportunity to deliver to our shareholders, and will continue to realize that opportunity as we enter the second decade of Juniper’s execution. Our strategy puts us right where we want to be in the middle of it all: the traffic, the processing and the infrastructure. We couldn’t be more excited about our position and the encouragement we’ve received from our customers, service providers and enterprises to accept their invitations to sit at their strategic planning tables with them and to play a larger and larger role in the network future. And we fully intend to deliver on their trust in Juniper Networks in 2006 and beyond. All of this is possible only with the support of our employees whose continue commitment and incredible efforts make these results possible as well as our many partners, our customers, our suppliers, and our long-term shareholders. I’d like to thank you all for your continued support and confidence in Juniper Networks. Rob, I will now turn the call over to you.
Robert Dykes our CFO and Executive Vice President: Thanks Scott. I am pleased with all of the financial metrics for the quarter, which I’ll review in detail. However, please remember that our business will be lumpy by application, by geography and as well as by product mix. Total reported revenues for Q4 was $575.5 million, an increase of over 5% from last quarter and almost 34% from the year prior. For 2005, revenue was $2.064 billion, up over 54% from 2004. We are pleased with the quarterly growth in our infrastructure products, recognizing product revenue of $276 million, up over 5% from last quarter and up over 25% from last year. For the full year of 2005, our infrastructure products grew 40% from 2004. We’ve recognized revenue on a total of 2,643 units this quarter and we shipped 40,183 ports, which was up from last quarter. This quarter the core again represented more than half of our infrastructure business which is primarily driven by increased capacity requirements that Scott referred to. This mix continues to affect the oscillation between the edge and the core and is likely to be a continuing phenomena given the specific service provider requirements. The service layer technology revenue, which includes Firewall, SSL, IDP and other security products as well as J-series, Session Border Controllers and application-accelerator solutions totaled $112.5 million. That reflects an increase of about 3% from the last quarter. We are very pleased with the normalized year-over-year growth for the quarter of 25% for security products and 26% including service. As Scott discussed earlier we are focusing the business on customers, specifically service providers and enterprise. From 2004 to 2005, our service provider business grew approximately 53% and our enterprise business grew above 58%. We would also like to share some qualitative information with you regarding each of the market segments. In aggregate service provider technology was flat, we saw growth in the high-end Firewall, SSL VPN, IDP and J-series was relatively flat performance in Session Border Controllers and Application Acceleration Solutions. On the other hand, we saw softness in the low-end and mid-range firewall and a minor contribution from Funk, which closed prior to the end of the year. Total service revenue was $86.9 million, up approximately 9% from last quarter. This increase was due to the increase in professional service revenue, i.e. is training, resident engineers and consulting as well as the growth in the installed base under contract. For the full year of 2005, service revenue was $293 million, up 69% from 2004. The total book-to-bill ratio issue was greater than 1 in the quarter. Siemens was a strong contributor in the fourth quarter representing approximately 14% of total revenue in the quarter and approximately 14% for the full year of 2005. From a geographic prospective the Americas represented 47% of total revenue in Q4 and the growth was driven by increased competition for Triple Play and Quad Play service offerings. The Americas grew 54% from 2004 to 2005. Europe, Middle East and Africa: EMEA represented 31% of total revenue in Q4 with strength across the region including Spain, Finland, France, Greece, UK, Italy and Poland. EMEA grew 60% from 2004 to 2005. Asia represented 22% of total revenue. The decline for last quarter specifically associated with decline in Japan as well as softness in Hong Kong and Korea, which is primarily due to NGN, which Scott discussed earlier. However, looking back at the last 12 months, Asia was a strong contributor in 2005 growing 49% from 2004 to 2005 and Japan grew 30% during that same period. We expect to see continued lumpiness by sierra as quarterly trends fluctuate. However we are pleased with the geographic balance and even with that we continue to generate. Revenue through our direct sale was approximately 30%, up from last quarter and was a refraction of the strength with our service providers in the America’s, what we saw directly with the remainder going to our global and country specific distributors and resellers. We continue to be pleased with the growth in our distribution channel as we maintain the expansion and leverage of our channel presence. As a remainder, all enterprise orders were required to be put through a channel partner, this policy was established to provide a channel complex with the direct sales force. Gross margin was 68.5%, inline with the higher end of our expectations and down slightly from 68.7% last quarter. We do expect gross margins to be lumpy as the geographic and product mixes fluctuate going forward. Service margin was approximately 52% versus 51% last quarter, reflecting an increase in the service revenue. The non-GAAP preferences that I am about to discuss exclude the amortization of purchased intangibles to pay compensation, restructuring the payments and in-process R & D. Please see the press release on our website for reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP results. As a reminder, all of the operating expenses include one month of expenses from the recent Funk acquisition. So R&D expenses were $97.7 million, and accounted for 17% of total revenue, which compares to $90.5 million or 16.6% last quarter. This increase is due to the headcount growth with recent acquisitions and increased programs given our focus on internal development. We continue to invest in both standalone as well as integrated products in order to satisfy our customer needs. In addition, we invested on expanding on our global R&D efforts, specifically in China and India. Sales and marketing expenses were $124.9 million and accounted for 21.7% of total revenue, which compares to $116.2 million or 21.3% last quarter. This increase is due to headcount growth including recent acquisitions and an increase to our high touch model for the enterprise opportunities where we’ve already started to see the return on investment as well as continued channel and partner investments and brand development. G&A expenses were $16.1 million and accounted for $2.8% of total revenue, which compares to $17 million or 3.1% of total revenue in the last quarter. Operating expenses were $238.6 million and accounted for 41.5% of total revenue, this compared to $223.7 million or 40.9% of total revenue in the last quarter. Total operating income was $155.4 million or 27% of total revenue compared to operating income of $156.4 million or 27.7% of total revenue in last quarter. Net interest and other income totaled $17.9 million compared to $14.7 million last quarter. This increase is due to the increase in our cash balances as well as higher interest rates. Our effective tax rate was 31%. Non-GAAP net income increased for the quarter to a $119.6 or 20.8% of total revenue compared to $114.7 million or 21% last quarter. Diluted non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.20 versus $0.19 in Q3. For 2005, non-GAAP net income was $430.6 million or 20.9% of total revenue compared with $238.6 million or 17.9% from 2004. On a GAAP basis, which includes the amortization of purchasing the intangibles, the employee compensation, restructuring and payments and in-process R&D of $35.2 million in Q4. Our operating expense totaled $277.1 million and net income was $105.5 million or $0.17 per share compared to net income of $84.1 million or $0.14 per share on Q3. For 2005, GAAP net income was $254 million or 17.2% of total revenue compared to $135.7 million or 10.2% from 2004. Now few comments regarding the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents, short and long-term investments were over $2 billion. We are extremely pleased to announce that we generated almost $200 million in cash flow from operations during the quarter. And as a reminder, we used approximately $100 million in cash to acquire Funk software. Accounts receivable was $269 million and day sales outstanding was 43 days versus 40 days last quarter. This is slightly above our target range of 30 to 40 days due to our product mix shift, which caused the component shortage at the beginning of the quarter. Total deferred revenue was $252.8 million, which is made up of service, channel inventory, and product, currently unrecognizable for revenue. CapEx was $39.3 million, up significantly from last quarter due to engineering combination of Doordarshan, India infrastructure and lab equipment and depreciation was $15.4 million during the quarter. Last quarter, we stated that we will be more aggressive with our stock repurchase program, we specifically made the decision however to use approximately $100 million of our cash to purchase Funk software and we will be purchasing common stock. We will continue to look at repurchasing common stock opportunistically. We ended the quarter worth 4145 in total headcount, up from 3784 people at the end of the last quarter, with approximately 140 of the increase coming from Funk software. In addition, we invested on all areas of the company to support and scale the strategy that Scott outlined earlier. Before discussing the guidance, I would like to state that our No.1 goal is to grow revenue and earnings and to deliver right growth within our operating model. We remain comfortable with our long-term model of producing gross margins in the 66% to 68% range and operating margins in the 25% to 30% range. The following forecast and guidance are forward-looking statements and the actual results came vary for a number of reasons including those mentioned in most recent 10-Q filed with the SEC. Now for our goals and guidance. We will again use the same time horizon in which we provide guidance as we did in 2005, specifically the first quarter as well as the first half. We’ll continue to focus on our financial fundamentals and please remember, it is difficult to predict the level of business each quarter but we are managing to our financial plan, and we would like to share some thoughts with you. In Q1, we are currently forecasting total revenue of $565 million to $575 million. This guidance reflects over 25% growth from the same period of last year and takes into account seasonality in the Americas, given a new calendar budgets of our customers that has not been finalized as well as softness in Asia, specifically Japan, which Scott and I referred to earlier. We currently expect similar gross margins to those we reported in Q4 and therefore we are giving the same guidance range as last quarter of 67.5% to 68.5%. As I stated previously our long-term gross margin target remains in the range of 66% to 68%. We are currently forecasting operating expenses to increase by approximately $8 to $10 million in Q1, mainly due to increased R&D investment. Investments in R&D forms a two primary categories: first programs which we committed to in 2004 and 2005, which are long-term development programs comprise of simultaneous investment in both standalone product development programs as well as integrated products. Second, we allocated a couple of million in a proactive way given the opportunity that we see ahead. In addition we’ll have our full quarter of expenses from Funk software as well as an increase in software expenses. That being said there are areas where we are not spending and more importantly looking for savings including holding marketing programs flat, keeping IT flat by moving responsibilities to India, reducing manufacturing cost for off-shoring as well as outsourcing R&D to countries like China and India where 25% of our R&D workforce is now located. This puts Q1 operating margins at the lower end in our 25% to 30% long-term operating model. But I would like to reiterate what Scott said earlier, we believe our investments made in 2004 and 2005 will payoff as we have pipeline of new product being delivered over the next 12 months. We must continue to invest albeit prudently in 2006 to take these products successfully to market, including sales and marketing to the enterprise as well as service providers. I would like to emphasis that we will spend strategically and focus on the areas that give us return on investment for intermediate and long-term. We are also lowering the tax provision in 2006 to 29% to reflect the global distribution of revenue and our investment of those earnings outside the United States. And we expect shares in the range of $610 million to $615 million and approximately $0.19 of non-GAAP EPS. As we previously disclosed, this includes $0.01 adverse effect, due to unrecognizable Funk revenue given purchase accounting rules in the full quarter of Funk acquisition expenses as well as associated strategic investments we made in Q1. For the first half of the 2006 we expect revenue in the range of $1.15 to $1.16 billion, which is up over 20% for the same period a year ago and non-GAAP EPS up $0.38 to $0.39. We see expanded growth opportunity in the second half of 2006 given the expected up tick in the NGN buying as well as our new product cycles gaining momentum. Consistent with our prospectus we’ll update our first half guidance after the completion of the first quarter and provide second half guidance upon completion of the first half. The GAAP EPS target is not acceptable on a forward-looking basis due to high variability and low visibility with respect to the long recurring charges, which are excluded from the non-GAAP EPS estimates. I’d also like to give you advance notice of some minor changes we will be making in 2006. First in Q1 will be required to report GAAP results including options expense and given our goal which is to be transparent, we will provide the details you need to do your analysis on Juniper. However, we will continue to focus our financial objectives based on the pro forma results. And since I’m on the topic of option expensing, the Board of Directors approved an amendment to accelerate their scheme of options granted for the price include to or more than $22 per share, within post sales restrictions excluding officers and directors. Second, effective Q1 the Session Border Controller product family, which represents just over $1 million in the quarter just completed the revenue has moved from the service layer technology products group to the infrastructure product group, given the integration of the technologies that are underway. This will be reported accordingly in Q1. Finally we could do to focus on our objective of delivering high quality financial metrics. Now we would like to take questions, can you limit yourself to one question.
Kathy Durr, Vice President, Investor Relations: Brian, can you please instruct the audience regarding the queuing process.

Operator Instructions:
Q - Nikos Theodosopoulos: Yeah thank you very much. I guess, I had clarification and a question, my clarification was the comments that you made on Siemens. I think you said they were 14% for the year in the quarter given prior disclosures that you have given in your Q’s, if they were 14% for the year, I can’t – it doesn’t seem like it could be as high as 14% for the quarter. So if you can clarify that. My question is on the guidance, the first quarter guidance is pretty clear. On the second quarter given all the projects that you see and the ramp of Japan, why wouldn’t we see a slightly stronger second quarter after it’s seasonally down first quarter? Thank you.
A – Pradeep Sindhu: On the Siemens numbers, there is huge revenue recorded is what we have. So I will, it will rule a bit while some more on, why you think is there that difference? With regard to the second quarter guidance, we are seeing some very good program rollouts during this year but we believe it’s prudent given the NGM port etc. that we provide the guidance that we do and then we will see how things evolve as we move forward.
Q - Nikos Theodosopoulos: So it’s basically the timing of the NGM spending ramps, you see it coming, but its just not clear whether it will be second quarter or third quarter or first quarter, it's the timing question here?
A – Rob Strugeon: Nikos, it's got a couple of things, I think it is a timing question as to some of these rollouts. And some of it is trying to get at the magnitude of the services rolled out across these NGMs and some of that growth rate and things like IPTV, some of it is looking at the, particularly some of the volumes of video demand and music demand. I know, you know, the impact of the type of service here on the network infrastructure is dramatic. You can have thousands, millions of people e-mailing and you can dwarf that with the small number of HD movies. So part of what makes it unclear for us is to is to what the magnitude of some of this next generation network infrastructure rollout is going to be is trying to gauge the service mix across it. And I guess all of us see more and more and more demand for the kinds of services, which seem no difference in an e-mail to someone who simply attaches the photo for example, from their cell phone. But for those of us in the infrastructure business, a few photos is worth 100 of phone calls. So that’s the other part of it. It’s just not being sure what mix we will see things like images and music and movies start to populate the infrastructure. But it makes a big difference in mix and that translates into big difference in capacity demand. And then also intelligence needed in the infrastructure so those are all things we just going to wait and watch and see.
Q - Nikos Theodosopoulos: Okay, thank you.
A - Robert Dykes: And then to your question on the Siemens, the numbers for Siemens in Q1 was 13%, Q2 was 16%, Q3 12% and Q4 14% and in the full year it was 14%.
Q - Nikos Theodosopoulos: Thank you.
Kathy Durr, Vice President, Investor Relations: Next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ehud Gelblum at J.P. Morgan, please proceed with your question.
Q - Ehud Gelblum: Hi, thank you. My question has to do with the acquisitions that you made earlier in the year between Redline, Kagoor and Peribit Network types of things. You went through some detail, great details on the service provider technologies. And in my calculations it looks like they were roughly flat, most of the acquisition in there and the next thing was up a little bit. How do you see in your revenue guidance for the next couple of quarters, I had actually expected those to be a real bit stronger, they sell on to the enterprise, they are usually a little bit more of an end of calendar year fresh for those. Do you expect those products, I guess, Netscreen as well as the acquisitions to stay relatively flat and maybe will they pull back in a weaker Q1 as well or shouldn’t they actually be growing with, as you kind to get further in, like NGM share in this market?
A - Pradeep Sindhu: Couple of thoughts Ehud, first on year end, we actually have not seen or didn’t see in the year end just completed the kinds of budget flush or year-end activities and that in some years, although we actually haven’t seen that for few years, really so, I guess, that’s still something that we all remember but it isn’t something that we have seen in the couple of years and we really didn’t see at this year either. But to your point about the – to the mix of revenues we look out over the first half of the year, it's quite likely that we will see growth in many of these individual examples, we the application performance technologies, I think will continue to see some strength in various of the security categories and clearly the need for some of the features or the functionality that’s in particular capabilities around optimizing website, managing for distance links like that is relevant. But the thing that affects us a little bit on this also is partly by design and that’s the function of how we are managing the compensation incentives and how we are motivating the field organization. And its even more highlighted by the change, we’ve formalized in the rest of the company organization here this entering the New Year which defined the rest of the business, the way we motivate the sales force which is go into an enterprise account and secure a percentage of their mind share and market shares as a customer of ours. And we don’t motivate the sales force specifically to do that by selling three firewalls and four WAN optimization devices and two routers. We just give them a number to go into an enterprise account for example and established Juniper presence. And so as a result, it distributes their focus more based on the brand presence we are trying to achieve and that is really what translates into the growth of enterprise as you saw, I just talked about here. It doesn’t necessarily translate into a condition where every player on the team scores on every play. And we aren’t really trying to do that, we are really trying to make sure that the brand grows and that the enterprise presence and our strategic presence in the account grows. And if that were to happen all with firewalls, or all with routers or all with application performance products at any instant in time and that will be fine. And in the last quarter it happened more on the products we identified around the high-end of the firewall business in SSL and IDP and was relatively flat. It will probably shift around a little bit next quarter but I just like you to have some color on the way we are measuring and motivating the efforts that we’ve got underway.
A - Robert Dykes: And I would like to point out, if anyone gets the wrong impression they have that, year-over-year the security business grew 25%, I just want to reiterate so we did see some very good growth rate, we are very pleased with the performance of that business.
Q - Ehud Gelblum: That was apples-to-apples for Netscreen, that doesn’t include the acquisition?
A - Robert Dykes: Yes, it’s also normalized for some of the accounting impacts. So the actual numbers if you would see, if you looked at the financial results it will be lot higher than but for actual accounting results that’s normalized for real activities.
Q - Ehud Gelblum: And last thing, do you have what Funk contributed this quarter?
A - Pradeep Sindhu: We have given exactly that numbers, just a minor amount. We really acquired Funk more for the technology going forward than first revenue contribution. I think it's going to be a significant contributor in our technology on a forward-looking basis.
Kathy Durr, Vice President, Investor Relations: Thanks Ehud. Operator next question please.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Stephen Kamman, of CIBC, please proceed with your question
Q - Stephen Kamman: Thank you, two quick, main question is on the enterprise business, sort of that, whatever you are calling at, it looks like particularly last quarter that actually came in on an operating loss and I guess you had pretty significant increase in unit chips about 46%, but I am assuming that that was bundling. Can you just about talk about sort of how you are going to evolve that in terms of bundling products going forward? And then the only other question is, the accounts payables are pretty significantly and just any comments you can provide on that?
A - Robert Dykes: First of all on the enterprise business we don’t actually report the profitability of that independent so I am not sure where you get in-
Q - Stephen Kamman: Mentioned in 10-Q.
A - Robert Dykes: That was SLP. The enterprise business overall includes a quite of the IDP products and in overall we have a significant sales force dedicated to that and we would generate a profit overall. And again those fourth quarter as well.
Q - Stephen Kamman: Okay and then on the SLP business, it was, again a negative 15% operating margin even though revenues were up 8%, you had 46% increase in unit shipped, so the question, I guess is what was going on there and what happens going forward?
A - Robert Dykes: What is going on Steve is that we are making a significant investments in our sales organization to grow our enterprise business necessarily a portion of that and so we are already driving that plus we have some significant investments on the R&D side in that business. And so probably overall that is an area for focus for us, it is an area for us to really generate some growth in the future periods.
A - Scott Kriens: And also Steve, its Scott answering just answer up the second question you asked about DSOs. The DSO’s were 43 days this quarter versus 40 last quarter so it’s up slightly partly a function of some later in the quarter shipments out of manufacturing because there is some supplies issues but no more major concern on our part there, and we still expect to be within our guidance going forward. And again the difference between SLP and Enterprise is just a clarification is really around the same point that we want to emphasize is that we are really driving the business towards the total portfolio and enterprise and which obviously includes a several $100 million of routers that get sold into that market as well as the SLP so, its hopefully be helpful for everyone as we get this clarified more based on the customers than less on individual slices of the product portfolio.
Q - Stephen Kamman: Okay yeah I thought that I had got confused there. Thanks very much.
A - Scott Kriens: That is alright, thanks Steve.
Kathy Durr, Vice President, Investor Relations: Not a problem. Next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Scott Coleman at Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Q – Scott Coleman: Sure, thank you. Scott when you are looking at IPTV deployments, particularly guys like PCCW and FastWeb, is there a way you can help us understand bandwidth capacity requirements there and where you – if you tend to see it more at the core first or more at the edge, how do those deployments go about?
A – Scott Kriens: It’s a great question with unfortunately long answer, but the short version of it is, at the moment we see more linear of what I’d called balanced impact on infrastructure with these types of services meaning that the TV or the video services have launched from the core infrastructures and delivered out through the network. I mean it has sort of an equal burden as it travels but where the network architectures are going and one of the things that I think it’s going to be a fairly dramatic differentiators overtime is something called multicasting and its ability to essentially ship one copy from the core and then start replicating as you move up the tributaries. And its only part of the intelligence that will be applied in the networks as they become more heavily loaded with different type of services and traffic. And this is where I think what’s going to happen in the early days of this, which is the networks because the volumes of these news services are fairly low, this is easier to throw bandwidth at it, but as the volume of - the number of types of services and the volume traffic that is generated by video and other of these things and streaming services versus bulk download services and thinks like that, if that increases the networks going have to get increasingly clever, architecturally and operationally in order to handle that so, it makes it really difficult this is part of the question you know Nikos was asking as well: how do you really know what the mix of service impact is going to be on these networks? And it’s a hard question to answer because depending on the sophistication that’s deployed the networks will become more intelligent, and the impacts will be less but in the first days you’ll see a lot more impact while people just simply throw bandwidth at the problem, and we are seeing more of that today than we assume the real intelligence that’s being designed. And that a big part of this whole next generation network consideration that we’re seeing take place in places like Japan where they’ve got 3 million fiber to the home customers, and they are starting to realize that you can’t roll services out in bulk form at those kind of bandwidth with the tributaries without putting more intelligence and design consideration in the infrastructure so, I mean it’s a kind of thing that we are seeing go into some of the ripple or redesign across the marketplace, and I think we are going to see that continue here over the next year or two as we see this types of services increase.
Q – Scott Coleman: Great thanks
Kathy Durr, Vice President, Investor Relations: Operator, next question please.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Subrahmanyan at Sanders Morris. Please proceed the question
Q – Natarajan Subrahmanyan: Thank you. My question is on the infrastructure business. When we look at the first half of the year, and some of the guidance in there, can you talk about our competitive factors having any impact at all in guidance, is it primarily these delays in Asia which are causing you to kind of moderate the rate of growth or competitive factors having any impact especially at the edge of the network?
A – Rob Strugeon: Subu, we don’t much change in the competitive situation, it is definitely the case but some of the design pause if you will or refresh is going on and the thinking in Asia has a lot to do with what we see and as much as anything in places like Japan and Korea and elsewhere you see there is a tremendous, like its almost embarrassing speaking of it from here in the United States, how far behind we are or maybe said in the favor of some of these countries how far ahead they are, and not only the rollout of services but the willingness and the options and the comfort with the users and the population have with gaming and instant messaging and movies and music and things like that on all kind of devices the portable to the home and others. And so they are a lot - those are significant consumers are the kind of things that we provide and when they pause and rethink some of this it has more of an impact, but I think the competitive landscape is largely the same, there is people out there trying to bring the cheapest solution to the party and there’s other people who trying to bring the biggest catalog to the party and so we’d like to think of ourselves as competing with the best and were competing with those with the most and those with the cheapest, and that hasn’t really changed and I don’t actually think that it will much. I think we are going to continue to see competitors in this market and we are going to continue to read a lot of press releases and hear a lot of promises and a lot of claims be made. So I’d expect that its not only to continue but probably the volume will probably go up on this kind of stuff in ‘06 but when you get down to network decisions in a short-list and the deployments we haven’t seen much change.
Kathy Durr, Vice President, Investor Relations: Operator, next question please.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Mark Sue at RBC Capital Markets, please proceed with your question.
Q - Mark Sue: If I look the large plan performance by the major telcos for IPTV the new DSM to be going to large system integrators, so many discrete component to work hand-in-hand with each other, what does that mean for Juniper, do you scale the business and make more acquisitions to a have end-to-end product portfolio or do you just focus on the routing component?
A – Scott Kriens: Actually Mark, it is going to be interesting to see what the rollouts really become, because there is a couple of I think fundamental contradictions in some of the claims that are being made. End-to-end if you disassemble that assertion is essentially a codeword for proprietary, because if its truly end-to-end and there is some benefit in it being end-to-end that’s because there is something unique about the pieces and the way they work with each other and they will only be unique if they were proprietary, I don’t think any of the operators I have spoken to in the last 5 years and its probably getting more intense not less are interested in proprietary solutions. So when someone says they’ve got end-to-end open standards that’s an oxymoron, if it’s end-to-end then there is some benefit in that then it is not open and if there is the benefit then its proprietary, which is followed by another oxymoron, which is the manufacturer system integrator and either your system integrator, which means you’re an honest broker putting together the ideal elements from the market at large and presumably an open standards way or your manufacturer in which case there’s no coincidence that your recommendations as a system integrator equal all of the things that you manufacturer. And I don’t think that’s lost on any of our customers either so again it is the difference between I think a lot of coincidence that are being made and a lot of multiyear and multibillion dollar declaration that we’ve all read and what’s actually going on when you add up the number of IPTV subscribers and the people that are serving them, I don’t disregard the fact that our customers and our service providers are looking for more comprehensive solutions though we tend to believe that what they are looking for are side-by-side solutions and BT 21C is probably a great example where Junipers partnered with Lucent and Siemens in both the core and the edge and BT itself is also coordinating across other companies including our competitors to deploy technologies. I think if we were to look at that example as one it’s probably the more practical example of the kinds of things that I think are actually going to succeed. So you know if you take the part some of these assertions even on the face value of what’s been said it doesn’t make sense in the minds of the customers so I think what you’ll see as a net of all that is continued increasing, in some cases we’ve seen contractual requirements for open standards and for us that will allow us to stay out of the business in building consumer devices for example or stay out of the business of building optical terminals and things that don’t have anything to do with traffic processing infrastructure, but be a very incredible solution for the infrastructure that ties those spare of pieces together and I think that focus is what has been and is going to continue to be the key our success
Kathy Durr, Vice President, Investor Relations: Next question please, operator.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shah Wu at American Technology Research, please proceed with your question.
Q - Shah Wu: Yes just a housekeeping question. Regarding Funk software, how do you plan to recognize the ramping for that, will it be would put under or will there be a separate line item, or will it be under the kind of traditional areas? Thanks.
A – Robert Dykes: Yes, Shah it’s going to be reported as SLP revenue and profitability.
Q - Shah Wu: Would you might, is it going to be on the service layer?
A – Robert Dykes: Yes. Service layers.
Q - Shah Wu: Okay thanks.
Kathy Durr, Vice President, Investor Relations: Brian, Next question please, operator.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Zhou with Lehman Brothers, please proceed with your question.
Q - John Zhou: Thank you very much. My question is on new product for this year, I think you mentioned that you have a pipeline of products for this year. I was hoping could you please expand a little bit for sort of the direction and the sort of type of products particularly in a routing space for core routers and edge routers, what are some of the features on new things you are working now and the timeline for that?
A – Scott Kriens: John, the product announcement themselves and the specifics behind those will be forthcoming as we go out through the years so that will be the time we speak in detail but generally speaking what we see is the opportunity for further interrogation and further interrogation of security capability along with the network capabilities and as far as the broader infrastructure portfolio it goes across two dimensions, which need to happen in contact with one another and that would be performance and intelligence. One of the things which its relatively easy, I guess none of this is really simple, but it is relatively easy to improve performance as long as you leave the processing requirement in a simple state and it is relatively easy to do complex processing as long as you don’t have do it very quickly. But what’s very difficult to do is sophisticated traffic aware of processing on high performance infrastructures where reliability is in the case of some of our defense industry deployments is life-saving and that triumphed of need accomplish simultaneously is what drives the portfolio. Most of the translation of that into specific features from someone outside the industry or not deep in the engineering and technology would be very obscure. But once the work is made or when one looks much closer into what that actually takes to do in some of those features and what they mean it is really quite critical to the decision cycle so I think broadly speaking its integration and then it’s the combination of performance and intelligence and these are things that we think we’ve got some unique, intellectual property which is the part of it, but actually what we have this more unique or what’s more valuable to us as we deliver on some of these things as we have practical working experience with systems and billions of hours of runtime of that experience or let us do somethings that we think others are going to have a little time for figuring out.
Q - John Zhou: Do you have new products new edge or core orders for the year, I am sorry?
A – Scott Kriens: Again we will make specific announcements on the products at the time of their availability but you’ll see us with quite a lot to say this year.

Q - Jeff Evanson: Scott, I have at least heard in a few conference calls talk about the blurring of distinction between enterprise and service provider products. Yet today I heard you talk about the widening organization around the enterprise team and the service provider team. I am wondering if you see some execution opportunities by separating the teams or if there are other issues involved in doing that?
A – Scott Kriens: Great question actually Jeff, let me clarify the distinctions. In a short answer, some usually better the longer one but I cannot give you a shorter one. The short answer is it’s the difference between products and distribution. The conversions you talked about and that as we see is around the product and technology side of things, the need for the reliability and the intelligence and the traffic awareness and the security and all those kinds of things. Those are very much converging and whether the end-user is a subscriber of a public network or an employee of a public network or a soldier in a tank for that matter and we serve all three of those customer types. The infrastructure requirements for performance and security range from what I call important in the service provider for example in the business case to really important in the tank. And so that technology and other things required to do that are quite common, the distinction between the enterprise and service providers piece of this is more on the distribution side and on what it takes to work through the channels in the distribution and reseller relationships that are needed especially with a wider range of products and a larger transaction volumes in the enterprise as well as on the service and support side, where in a case of a major enterprise account it is actually similar both dedicated and major account teams as well as dedicated service and support attention but even in those accounts and certainly in the small medium businesses or medium businesses really where we tend to look more, that the expectation of a more complete handling of their requirements and less technical expertise less operational focus, and then of course you would seen in the service providers, so that’s really the distinction between focusing the business teams, and also a more completely managed and integrated solution from a portfolio standpoint in a enterprise or other environment then would tend to be more self-integrated, more managed in the case of a service provider.
Q - Jeff Evanson: And proof from that the R&D organization both be still organized around capabilities, or some other structure but not necessarily around service provider or enterprise?
A – Scott Kriens: But that’s exactly correct, there is still an infrastructure product group, a security product group and an applications product group, those are unchanged but they now become part of two virtual teams for purposes of go to market exercise one for enterprise and one for service providers and so you are exactly right
Q - Jeff Evanson: Thank You
A – Scott Kriens: Thanks Jeff.
Kathy Durr, Vice President, Investor Relations: Next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the Christin Armacost at SG. Cowen & Co., please proceed with your question.
Q – Lucas Gwenky: Hi this is Lucas Gwenky for Christin, my question is related to a comment you made at the end of your prepared remarks on the session border controller being now categorized in infrastructure group, did that occur at this quarter I think you might have said next quarter will be the first quarter and if so does that mean that that it is not being sold separately any more?
A – Robert Dykes: It’s Q1 that we are make you the change, so in Q4 we reported in the SLT product group and as to the products it is still a standalone product at the moment.
Q – Lucas Gwenky: So I guess that would bring the question why move it?
A – Robert Dykes: Well we talked about how we implement towards having more integrated products down the road and so we saw thought it is best to move it into that group, from a product point of view.
Q – Lucas Gwenky: And then separately you know you’ve disclosed, the new business unit service provider enterprise, are you going to provide any kind of more quantitative details around that going forward?
A – Scott Kriens: Luke, couple of thoughts, first of all, final part on the session border controller technology, as we talk about we made the acquisition as the company that brought that to us, it always been targeted as an integration activity or integration priority for us, so and that is really the destination of that technology in the industry. But separately in terms of reporting we will likely end up still reporting as we described by product groups that one of the problems with enterprise and service providers is customer type from a pure financial reporting point of view, its not so easy to know, through one or two tiers of distribution exactly what the type of customer is and even within the service provider in case you can have a service provider buy the product and puts it in his own network and sells it sells it as a service, that same customer can buy it and use it internally and the affect the enterprise and can also distribute it and sell it to someone else either as a managed service or as a transfer title, so it gets a little bit difficult from a pure accounting standpoint to be precise about the business but what we do, and what we will do here in just providing as more details as we go forward and as much details we can and obvious is report on both on the products which would be very specific as obviously we can identified by products numbers, and then report as we see it on the business as a percentage of total in service providers and enterprise so, look for both it is only possible to be specific to a certain degree in the customer types.
Q – Lucas Gwenky: Okay and then finally the service layer technology, what is the next service layer technologies that you are considering, you know either developing or acquiring?
A – Scott Kriens: In maybe like the next acquisitions or?
Q – Lucas Gwenky: Well just internal development?
A – Scott Kriens: Well I would say, obviously something that we can really comment on and we will watch and see how the year unfolds but I think its really more in this category of technology, its more a function of integration and to trying to take capabilities and bring integrated solutions to bear so most of our efforts will be focused on doing that over at least the near-term.
Kathy Durr, Vice President, Investor Relations: Next question please.
Operator: Our next question come from the line Alex Henderson at Citigroup, please proceed your question.
Q - Alex Henderson: Thanks. There has been a article written in China paper and pick up for light reading that the Siemens is interested in acquiring data networking product line from Harbor line, am not asking for you to comment on whether that is going to happen or not, it is obviously has been announced but, the speculation around Siemens especially backing away from USA distribution partner is obviously been out in the field , can you address the relationship you have with Siemens and what do you expect that or give us example of how that business with them is continuing and whether its strengthening or weakening?
A – Scott Kriens: Sure can, Alex, on the subject to relationship in general its a strong as it is ever been and those relationships are always a function I guess on multiple dimensions, one is that the field and operating levels country-by-country there is deep long term trust built between account teams that are working together and places like BT 21C and things like that, and actually lots, lots of others, as you can see reflected by their continued strength as the percent of total revenues so, at that level there is great strength and depth and I would say concrete port around those relationship and the trust. And that is actually one of the things that takes as you know may take a few years to get there, and because the account team is don’t start out trusting third parties with their own accounts and today we have got very good and strong relationship there. Furthermore when that relationship moves up the ladder, with Thomas and the people that run the company and the divisions that are involved here those are relationships that are also long standing and quite strong so, we have every confidence in the Siemens relationship and what we sees is opportunities for both companies going forward and I can’t speak for them obviously as you say I wouldn’t but I certainly - we view this as a very strategic relationship and have every indication to support that from that every conversation we ever had with them.
Q - Alex Henderson: If you were to look at the Harbor line, is that a complimentary line to your line, if hypothetically it was acquired?
A – Scott Kriens: Well we don’t I don’t actually know whole what about Harbor because, we don’t compete with them, you have heard and read some of these things but your reference in that had been speculated but, I really don’t, since we don’t compete or see them at any of the deals or markets or business that we do, I can only give you the kind of things that I suppose you can find on their own website about what they do, it just isn’t something that we see in our markets.
Q - Alex Henderson: Also if you are not competing with them then anybody selling them would have to be either complementary which certainly wouldn’t become replacement to your product line.
A – Scott Kriens: Yeah. As far as, certainly that if there was anything that they had the offer that would be competing it is in something it is ever been seen in any competitive deals we are aware of.
Q - Alex Henderson: Thanks
A – Scott Kriens: Sure thanks Alex.
Kathy Durr, Vice President, Investor Relations: We have grace time for one more question.
Operator: Thank you our final question comes from the line of Samuel Wilson at JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Q - Samuel Wilson: Good afternoon everyone. Quick question on allocation of capital, the equivalent 17% of market cap in cash, you are generating $200 million in free cash operations last quarter, realistically how much cash do you need in a realistic manner to run the business and if you have excess cash, kind of why are you buying back stock as it is too low, and kind of you said would on last quarter conference call?
A – Scott Kriens: Well, Sam, you are right in your observation, there is over $2 billion in cash and we generate almost $200 million in the last quarter, so we are certainly, I guess we are pleased on a couple of dimension with that, those number first of all that the fire power it gives us. But secondly it is actually in my view at least it is the ultimate measure of customer satisfaction which is that they pay you and it is the ultimate measure of the health and strength of the business as it generates cash, so we are continued to be laser focused on the creation of it and to start with that point and in case for example of the recent acquisition of the Funk we chose to use cash for that acquisition instead of the equity as an example of what we have the cash for in order to avoid the issuance of more shares for in that case for that acquisition, so we will see what the market presents going forward as we mentioned in remarks as is still true today there is an authorization that we have that has been given to us by the Board that allows us to do more repurchase if we were to choose to do so and then we will watch and see what the market brings and see there in terms of that kind of opportunities or other considerations that we might use cash for in place of equity. But on the front end of end it though one of the things that everyone should expect as this business is going to continue to be strong generator of cash because to me ultimately that is the measure to help in success of the company and so it is kind of a - it is a primary metric for us around here.
Q - Samuel Wilson: I completely Scott, I guess what I am asking is how much cash do you need before you start to look like the bank?
A – Scott Kriens: Well that depends on who you ask. I guess, if you ask my friend here Bob he likes cash. So he would want more of it, if you ask me I might spend a little more of it. But It’s a careful consideration and all seriousness to look across the industry. I think we are watching some very turbulent time in the market and there are not going to be the number of companies standing a year from now that there are today in my opinion. Most of those probably are not go away and stay away. But there may also be opportunities for us and there aren’t, necessarily acquisitions that could be joint development, investment partnership, marketing opportunities, we have done all of those in our past and want to be armed to do any or all of those things going forward. So it is something that we will continue to evaluate on a regular basis, we have the approvals and the resolve and if we do choose to do simply in the market and buy shares but we also have the experience of using a cash for other purposes, ultimately to the same end of avoiding more share issuance and we are certainly mindful of trying to balance that equation, so we will see what happens over the time to come.
Q - Samuel Wilson: Thank you.
A – Scott Kriens: Thanks and take care.
