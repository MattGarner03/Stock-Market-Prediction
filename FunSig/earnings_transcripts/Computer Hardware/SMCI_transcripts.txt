In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today's press release and in the supplemental information attached to today's presentation. At the end of today's prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session for sell-side analysts. I will now turn the call over to Charles.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Michael, and thanks to everyone for joining us. As previously announced, our fiscal Q3 net revenue totaled $4.6 billion, coming in lower than our original forecast. This decline was primarily due to customers waiting and evaluating AI platforms between the current Hopper and the upcoming Blackwell GPUs, leading to delayed commitments. We expect many of these engagements to materialize in the June and September quarters, strengthening our confidence in meeting our long-term growth targets as we close out this eventful fiscal year. Despite macroeconomic conditions and tariff impacts, our ability to expand market share in IT and AI remains strong. On the earnings front, our fiscal Q3 non-GAAP EPS stood at $0.31 per share, compared to $0.66 last year. This decline was largely driven by a one-time inventory write-down of older-generation GPUs and related components, while the new platforms are finally ramping quickly now. Although our quarterly performance did not align exactly with our expectations, we successfully fulfilled our commitment to regaining financial regulatory compliance. At the same time, we continue to enhance technological innovation and development, which resulted in the successful high volume delivery of our new generation AI products at the end of March. Looking ahead, some major groundbreaking new innovations are set to service the market in this quarter and the new fiscal year especially with our coming soon DCBBS. With a clear time-to-market advantage, Supermicro once again leads the AI infrastructure technology and DLC solutions. This strong position enables us to explore new opportunities and expand market share. During the quarter, we achieved volume shipments of air-cooled 10U and liquid-cooled 4U NVIDIA B200 HGX systems, both are exactly the first to market again, as well as GB200 NVL72 racks. Additionally, we started to offer AMD MI-325X solutions to further broaden our AI portfolio. Leveraging our system building blocks, we will again offer time-to-market on the upcoming new platforms, such as NVIDIA B300, GB300 and AMD MI-350 platforms this summer, for customers seeking leading technology, more optimized, higher-density, and greener AI solutions. Built on our strong foundation of technology leadership, building block solutions, and green computing DNA, we have been deeply focused on developing the industry’s first end-to-end AI/IT datacenter total solution. We are now about fully ready to share this exciting news with the market in the coming days by launching our brand-new Datacenter Building Block Solutions, we call it “DCBBS”, featuring our second-generation system liquid cooling technology, we call it “DLC-2”. With DCBBS, we are able to dramatically shorten customers’ efforts to build a datacenter, reduce their cost, and most importantly make their datacenter better quality and performance, greener and with higher availability. DCBBS consolidates critical components -- including (AI) server systems, storage, rack PnP, all different kinds of switches, DLC systems, water tower or dry tower, chilled door, power shelf, battery backup unit (BBU), onsite deployment, networking design, cabling, and datacenter end-to-end management software and all different scopes of services — into a streamlined process. The true value of DCBBS lies in its ability to reduce power consumption, optimize space, and decrease water usage, delivering up to 30% lower TCO. More importantly, it accelerates new datacenter deployments and upgrades existing datacenters in a matter of months or even weeks, rather than many quarters or years driving significant improvements in datacenter time-to-deployment (TTD) and time-to-online (TTO). One of the key components of DCBBS is our industry-leading DLC solutions. Supermicro remains at the forefront of driving industry adoption of DLC technology, setting new standards for performance, efficiency and sustainability. Last year, we shipped 4,000 100kW AI racks equipped with DLC, helping our customers reduce energy costs by up to 25%. We are committed to doubling this volume in the coming year, further amplifying the impact of green computing. With the upcoming DLC-2 technology, Supermicro will be able to deliver even greater savings and benefits to our customers. For example, it saves power and water up to 40% and reduces data center noise levels down to about 50 dB, that is almost as quiet as a library. We are going to announce the details in the coming days. Green computing can be everywhere, and with our DLC-2 solutions, we are making that vision a beautiful reality. Our long-term investments and leadership in DLC have solidified a sustainable competitive edge, providing economies of scale and keeping us far ahead of the competition. Our global operations continue to expand, with our new Malaysia campus begin shipping products to partners. Meanwhile, our facilities in Taiwan and Europe are scaling up their capabilities and capacity, providing customers with flexible options for their logistic choice and minimizing their cost during these market uncertainties. To further strengthen support for key partners and align with government initiatives, we continue to expand our U.S. domestic manufacturing capacities including new facilities in the Midwest and other locations. These strategic expansions will allow us to meet rising demand while continuing to enhance our commitment to quality, security, and TCO, TTD, and TTO. In summary, fiscal Q3 was dynamic and productive. We successfully navigated financial challenges while continuing to strengthen our leadership in product and technology innovation. Our first-to market advantage in AI infrastructure, along with the expanded reach of DCBBS and advancements in DLC technology, further solidifies our industry position. I remain highly confident and optimistic about our long-term strong growth and market share gain. However, near-term macroeconomic and market uncertainties make it difficult to precisely forecast the pace of technology adoption. Despite this, I am confident that we will close the fiscal year on a strong note. Given the current conditions, we anticipate Q4 revenues of at least $6 billion and will resume providing a broader forecast range once we have more clear visibility. Before passing the call to David for the financial overview, I want to thank all of our partners, customers, investors, and Supermicro team members, and express my deep appreciation for their continued support. With that, I will now turn the call over to David.
David Weigand: Thank you, Charles. Fiscal Q3 2025 revenues were $4.6 billion, up 19% year-over-year and down 19% quarter-over-quarter. Q3 revenues were down quarter-over-quarter as certain new platform decisions by customers moved some sales into Q4 and later. AI GPU platforms represented more than 70% of revenues with AI GPU customers in both the enterprise and cloud service provider markets. Our design win pipeline remains robust, and we expect continued growth in Q4 as we ramp up production of our Data Center Building Block Solutions (DCBBS) based on new GPU platforms. As a leading U.S. technology company, we focus on extensive rack-scale and DCBBS technology and capacity investments in the U.S. which is complemented by our investments in Taiwan, Netherlands, and Malaysia. As Charles indicated, we have a flexible global manufacturing footprint to meet our customers’ needs, and we continue to closely monitor the rapidly evolving macro and tariff environment. During Q3, we recorded $1.9 billion in the enterprise/channel vertical, representing 42% of revenues versus 25% last quarter. This was up 3% year-over-year and up 38% quarter-over-quarter as we saw strengthened enterprise adoption of new AI and CPU platforms. The OEM appliance and large data center vertical revenues were $2.6 billion, representing 57% of Q3 revenues versus 75% in the last quarter, up 35% year-over-year and down 38% quarter-over-quarter. Two existing CSP/large data center customers represented 22% and 14% of Q3 revenues. Emerging 5G/Telco/Edge/IoT revenues were $48 million or 1% of Q3 revenues. Server and Storage Systems comprised 97% of Q3 revenue and Subsystems and Accessories represented 3%. By geography, the U.S. represented 60% of Q3 revenues, Asia 30%, Europe 6%, and Rest of World 4%. On a year-over-year basis, U.S. revenues increased 3%, Asia increased 77%, Europe decreased 3%, and Rest of World increased 83%. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, U.S. revenues decreased 28%, Asia increased 76%, Europe decreased 69%, and Rest of World increased 45%. China continued to represent less than 1% of sales in Q3. The Q3 non-GAAP gross margin was 9.7%, down 220 basis points quarter-over-quarter from 11.9% in Q2 primarily due to higher inventory reserves for older generation products, lower volume and accelerated costs to enable time-to-market for new products. Q3 Operating Expenses on a GAAP basis decreased 3% quarter-on-quarter and increased 34% year-over-year to $293 million. On a non-GAAP basis, Operating Expenses decreased 5% quarter-over-quarter and increased 30% year-over-year to $216 million. Q3 non-GAAP operating margin was 5.0% compared to 7.9% in Q2 due to the lower revenues and gross margins. Other Income and Expense for Q3 was a net expense of $31.7 million, consisting of $13.4 million in interest expense principally from convertible bonds and other losses of $18.3 million principally from a non-cash $30.3 million loss on the amendment of the 2029 convertible bond and adverse foreign exchange impact and other miscellaneous expenses offset by higher interest income. The GAAP effective tax rate was 5.1% resulting in a GAAP tax expense of $6 million for Q3. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for Q3 was 15.5% resulting in Q3 non-GAAP tax expense of $36 million. Q3 GAAP diluted EPS of $0.17 and Q3 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.31 was lower than our guidance due to the lower revenues and gross margins. The GAAP fully diluted share count for Q3 was 622 million and the non-GAAP fully diluted share count was 636 million. Cash flow generated from operations for Q3 was $627 million compared to cash flow usage of $240 million during the previous quarter. The Q3 closing inventory was $3.9 billion, which increased by 7.6% quarter-over-quarter from $3.6 billion in Q2 as we prepare for higher shipments in Q4. CapEx was $33 million for Q3 resulting in free cash flow of $594 million for the quarter. During the quarter, we amended the terms of our existing 2029 convertible notes and raised $700 million in gross proceeds in a new 2028 convertible note from the existing convertible investor group. The proceeds from the new convertible note offering will be used to strengthen our working capital, enable continued investments in R&D and expand global capacity as needed. The closing Q3 balance sheet cash position was $2.54 billion, while bank and convertible note debt was $2.49 billion resulting in a net cash position of $44 million versus a negative net cash position of $479 million last quarter. Turning to the balance sheet and working capital metrics compared to last quarter, the Q3 cash conversion cycle was 124 days versus 104 days in Q2. Days of Inventory increased by 3 days to 81 days compared to the prior quarter of 78 days due to key component purchases for higher expected Q4 shipments. Days Sales Outstanding increased by 9 days quarter-over-quarter to 56 days while Days Payables Outstanding decreased by 8 days to 13 days. We are closely monitoring the macro environment, tariffs, and the technology transition to new platforms. The outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 ended June 30, 2025 we expect net sales in the range of $5.6 billion to $6.4 billion, GAAP diluted net income per share of $0.30 to $0.40 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $0.40 to $0.50 Given the dynamic environment, we are being prudent and expect gross margins to be approximately 10%. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $319 million and include $74 million in stock-based compensation expenses that are not included in non-GAAP operating expenses. The outlook for Q4 of fiscal year 2025 fully diluted GAAP EPS includes approximately $63 million in expected stock-based compensation expenses, net of tax effects of $18 million, which are excluded from non-GAAP diluted net income per common share. We expect other income and expenses, including interest expense, to be a net expense of approximately $16 million. The company’s projections for Q4 GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per common share assume a GAAP tax rate of 14.9%, a non-GAAP tax rate of 16.5%, and a fully diluted share count of 628 million for GAAP and 642 million shares for non-GAAP. We expect CapEx for Q4 to be in the range of $45 million to $55 million. For fiscal year 2025 ending June 30, 2025, based on the Q4 guidance above, we are expecting revenues of $21.8 billion to $22.6 billion. Michael, we’re now ready for Question-And-Answer-Session.
Michael Staiger: Victoria lets go to Question-And-Answer-Session.
Operator: Of course. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Samik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe for the first one. I know in your prepared remarks you mentioned that the macro is making forecasting a bit tougher and you're talking about prudence in your guidance itself. But maybe if you sort of share what you're hearing from your customers. Are customers already talking about pulling back some orders or is there any change in customer order trends that you're seeing because of the macro? And given just where we stand relative to the June quarter already we are month and I would assume you would have more sort of visibility into the June quarter rather than having to put sort of some level of consumerism in. So have you seen a lot more volatility in terms of customer orders recently to drive that prudence in terms of the revenue outlook for June and have a follow up please. Thank you.
Charles Liang: Yes, very good question. Basically June will be our traditional strong quarter and for sure the tariff and the macro economy uncertainty that concern some customer. But at this moment we see a strong order. So I believe we will have a strong quarter for June and September. Next fiscal year will be even stronger because our new product, especially Blackwell, is fully in volume production now. So we gain more and more order for Blackwell and expect stronger start from now.
Samik Chatterjee: Okay. Okay, got it. And maybe before my follow up on the gross margin side. Previously you have talked about margins improving as you start ramping new products, whereas you sound the guidance itself implies a bit more cautiousness on that front. Has there been a change in the pricing landscape for the new products that you're seeing in the market or is this more about the tougher pricing environment for Hopper based products? Thank you.
Charles Liang: I think it's a combination of concern about tariffs and so conservatism there and also with some, obviously also some impact from the changeover in technology platforms.
Samik Chatterjee: So just to clarify, so in terms of the changeover that is driving some headwinds to the gross margin, the changeover itself from Hopper to Blackwell.
Charles Liang: That's. That's correct. So as you, as you come off of some of the older platforms, you have, you have more price competition and as we said, we had some delayed decisions because of these technology platform changes. And so that's really impacting that along with tariff uncertainty drives a little bit more prudence in setting margin expectations.
Samik Chatterjee: Got it. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Michael Ng: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more midterm about your demand outlook. Are you, and apologies if I missed it, but are you reiterating the $40 billion revenue target for fiscal 2026, and perhaps you can talk a little bit about any changes that you might be seeing from a demand perspective, aside from the timing of the technology platform transition and the macro and uncertainty. Thank you.
Charles Liang: Yes, we remain very confident with our midterm and long-term growth. So especially Blackwell product line, we have a very strong demand and also our coming soon DC BBS data center building blocks total solution. We see lots of customers really interested in our data center total solution. So demand growth will keep strong and yes, the tariff and some macro economy uncertainty. We at this moment do not provide guidance for fiscal year 2026. But when it's the visibility become more clear, we will share at that time.
Michael Ng: Great, thanks Charles, that's very helpful. And just as a follow up, can you talk about whether or not you're seeing differences in demand between HGX versus NVL 72 racks? Any differences there either in customer demand or your ability to fulfill demand on either product? Thank you.
Charles Liang: Yes, we see strong demand for kind of GB200 NVL 72 and B200 liquid cooling. But customer liquid cooling data center basically a little bit dead. So that's why they are waiting there, waiting a little bit more than what we expect. So but however the solution, their data center will be ready very soon and we to see our schedule is getting much more exciting now.
Operator: Thank you for your question, Michael. Our next question comes from the line of George Wang with Barclays. Your line is now open.
George Wang: Oh hey, hey, hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Hey Charles, just a kind of question on the GB300. Any differences in terms of value add from Supermicro, just in terms of customization and potentially more services attached, presume, as media potentially open up the components kind of for more open standards for the GB300 that could lead to better margins for Supermicro. I mean, do you agree just any kind of puts and takes there?
Charles Liang: Yes, I guess whenever. The new technology is always putting more chance to Supermicro. As you know, our B203HGX system, for example, we are forced to have a product available and demand is strong. So B300 and GB300 for sure we expect a very strong demand. And with our very mature liquid cooling solution, we have DRC solution start to ship last year 4000 RAC and this year with our DLC 2 DLC revision tool, it offer even better power saving, water saving and also much better internal noise level. Right. So we believe GB300, B300, our technology advantage will be even more clear. And we are excited to see B300 GB300 coming very soon in the summer, the coming summer.
George Wang: Okay, great. Just a quick one if I can squeeze in maybe for David and also for Charles. Just in terms of pop [ph] to customers this quarter combined the percentage was a bit lower versus last quarter. So is this because of quarter-to-quarter kind of lumpiness, volatility or is there anything else kind of you want to call out in terms of customer contribution a bit lower?
Charles Liang: Yes, I don't, I don't think there's any trend, George. It's just timing of shipments. But we don't, we don't have any concern about.
George Wang: Yes, yes, yes. Just kind of follow up any outlook for the top two customers kind of in the next few quarters, any high level thoughts and any other kind of customer set you guys are expanding to kind of you can talk about?
Charles Liang: Yes, we believe our business will continue to grow much faster in the coming quarters. I hate it to mention, but still, I mean in December quarter, last year and March quarter we got some impact from the cash flow from the 10K impact, but that's already behind, behind us. So now we have a much better cash flow and we are ready to grow much quicker now, especially with the new technology.
Operator: Thank you for your question, George. Our next question comes from the line of Asiya Merchant with Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Asiya Merchant: Great, thank you for taking. Okay, great. Thank you for taking my question. So I know there's a lot of uncertainty with tariffs, etcetera, but is there something that you can talk to us or kind of see how investors AI diffusion rules? There's a lot of investor angst around that. How are you guys thinking about your visibility and how the order should flow through given AI in AI diffusion could impact or possibly could impact your revenues. And then I have a follow up. Thank you.
Charles Liang: Yes. At this moment we see our demand continue to grow and that's why we continue to expand our facility in USA, in Taiwan, in Malaysia. So overall our technology didn't age especially. I mean we did, we do continue to see the demand, well, continue to grow strongly.
Asiya Merchant: Okay, great. And then on growth.
Charles Liang: I mean [Indiscernible] may impact the demand a little bit, but overall we will continue to get much share.
Asiya Merchant: Okay. And then if I may, on gross margins, again, can you just help us understand like how you're thinking about, you know, the margins, especially as you expand on your DLC version two, just how we should think about gross margins in 20, calendar 20, fiscal 2026. Sorry.
Charles Liang: Yes, so we're not, we're not going to give forecasts for next year at this meeting. But what I can tell you is that we have, we have published before what our target margins are. But right now we've got some of the headwinds of like you mentioned that the diffusion rules coming up in mid-May. We have tariffs that we are, that we have to, we have to get, find our way through. And so, those things are, are certainly headwinds. But on the other hand, we have, we still have the majority of our business from U.S. customers. And so we're, we're a U.S. based manufacturer and so we think that we're well positioned in the marketplace on all of those fronts. But we don't. We also being a first to market provider of the latest solutions, we also think we have an edge there. So we think that we're as best positioned as someone in the marketplace can be.
Operator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is now open.
Ananda Baruah: Hey guys. Yes, thanks for taking the questions. Really appreciate it. I guess. Yes. Two if I could, I guess this would be for Charles and for Dave. You guys made mention of ongoing ramp as Blackwell supply comes on. And so should we assume that that means September quarter looks up sequentially from the June quarter? And just along with that, this is not my follow up. But just like along with that, like when the during hopper ramp you had like, you had multiple quarters. That's not accurate yet. Two quarters of 70% sequential growth you had a 40% sequential growth quarter during the hopper ramp. So not like a forecast but are those. You have 30% up here in June off of a soft March. So I guess the question is order of magnitude can you be up? Are you saying you'll be up September quarter again as Blackwell ramps and those sort of copper order of magnitude sequential increases, Charles, sort of through cycle. Is that the type of thing that you sound so excited when you talk excitedly about the Blackwell potential? Is it that kind of order of magnitude that you think is possible to get back to at some point as you go through black Blackwell cycle? And then I have a quick follow up as well. Thanks.
Charles Liang: Yes, thank you for your question. Yes, you are right. I believe March quarter we were solved. The major reason because technology transition. Not just people waiting for a Blackwell solution, but also we have a lot of write down for product line. Right. So looking forward I hope we can repeat Hopper history kind of start to grow from June and September and December quarter. I believe so. I hope so.
Ananda Baruah: Okay, that's great. And my follow up is actually more of a technical question. So you mentioned in your prepared remarks Charles, about liquid cooling the HGX B200. And the question is how many HGXs B200 and then I guess if you want to give an early, early comments about the B200 the X how many, how many HGX is are you actually seeing you can stack and liquid pool. And I guess I'm wondering like how many GPUs are folks able to stack and liquid cool with HGX. I'm interested in seeing how close you can get, folks are getting that to the, to the NVL72. Thanks. That's it for me. Thanks.
Charles Liang: Yes. For Hopper, as you know air cooler work fine, but we like to prove we want to establish the deep cooling technology. So we try to promote aggressively deep cooling for hopper. And we successfully ship about 4000 rack DLC to the market. And so far the 4000 rack run very reliable customer -- our DLC solution a lot. So we gained lots of experience and now our DLC solution is much mature than last year. And that's why we further prepare to promote DLC2. Our DLC2 second generation DLC will outperform the first generation and we will have a big promotion in next few days or next few weeks. So with Blackwell our DLC solution is fully ready and we will provide a basic DLC solution to the world to help a customer save power, save water, save money and also improve data center performance. So we have a very strong confidence for liquid cooling, especially for Blackwell and future [ph] product.
Operator: Thank you for your questions. Our next question comes from the line of Nehal Choski with Northland. Your line is now open.
Nehal Choski: Hi. Thank you. Just want to make sure I understand the inventory reserve that occurred in the March quarter and then is there any expectation that there will be inventory reserve in the June quarter and is that part of 10% gross margin guidance?
David Wiegand: Yes. So the as mentioned in our pre release and also in this release, the inventory reserve reduced our margin by about 220 basis points. Most of that was caused by taking a reserve for some of the older inventory products. And so the certainly we're watching very closely our inventory products. However, as mentioned, the main, the substantial reason for the reduction, for the expected reduction in margin is really caution or prudence regarding tariffs. I want to point out that by the way that we've through three quarters we have 16.2 billion in revenues. That was versus last year's four quarters of 15 billion. And so we're very happy with where we are in the performance cycle and even though we expect even better.
Charles Liang: Yes. To simplify, I would like to share. I mean for March quarter we have a 200 point impact from the reserve. Right. But June quarter maybe I hope only 100 point or less and September quarter I hope close to zero.
Nehal Choski: Okay. And so just this inventory reserve that you're taking as a charge. That basically means, I mean you look at the impact of 200 basis points for a March quarter that basically equates to $100 million. And then you had a billion dollar shortfall on revenue. And so does that basically mean that, some percent of that shortfall just isn't finding a new home or does that mean that that shortfall is being resold in the June and September quarter at a lower price?
David Wiegand: Yes, So I mentioned that some of the, some of the revenues that we expected in Q3 were platform decision based. So that means actually that people are moving to the newer platforms in the upcoming quarters. Okay. And so what that means is that in cases where people change their minds on platforms, we have to write the expected realizable value of those, take a reserve for those and do our best to sell them at more competitive prices.
Operator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Tanwanteng with CJS Securities. Your line is now open.
Jon Tanwanteng: Great. Thank you for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could expound on that platform decision A little bit more. Is it customers declined to take Hopper and decided to move to Blackwell. Was it something else? Is that what I'm hearing? And was it due to, design or demand or performance considerations or was there something else going on with maybe like data center constraints or something like that?
Charles Liang: Yes, our customer base a little bit different from the other competitor. Right. Most our customer kind of technology leading company. So that's why new product is very sensitive to them and this thing is now Blackwell solution is fully ready. So we are excited to ramp it up stuff up now.
Jon Tanwanteng: Okay, great. Charles, I also want to touch on something you mentioned before. Just with one of the biggest U.S. server manufacturing operations, can you just talk about your relative strength there in positioning in U.S. domestic manufacturing versus your competitive set and how much of an advantage is that? When you are seeing tariffs going up across multiple industries, is that providing you any more additional demand or is that too hard to see right now?
Charles Liang: Yes, I mean as a USA company, we are able to, especially manufacture in Silicon Valley, we are able to respond to new technology much quicker and efficient than others, especially with a better performance, a better solution like a DLC2. Right. And as to tariff impact, because the tariff program is not quite settled down yet. So we are watching carefully and try to adjust our logistics, our operation as efficient as possible. Good thing is we have a huge operation in USA and in Taiwan and in Malaysia now as well. So when tariff program settles down, we should be able to quickly respond to optimize the best solution for customers.
Operator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes to the line of Nicholas Doyle with Needham and Company. Your line is now open.
Nicholas Doyle: Hey guys on for Quinn Bolton. Thanks for taking my question. Can you just talk about your supplier allocations? Are you seeing the same GPU allocations for Blackwell as you have for Hopper? How has your supply changed as more competitors enter the market? Thank you.
Charles Liang: Yes, still some allocation matter, right? Kind of some customer 1 Blackwell right away and we had to wait for allocation. So that situation is a little bit better than a half time frame, but still some constraint there.
Nicholas Doyle: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your question. Our last question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is now open.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes, sir. Yes, thanks for taking my question. I'm a little bit confused with capacity. I see in the slide that capacity has remained around 5,000 racks per month. But your CapEx has been pretty aggressive. Can you help me reconcile the CapEx and existing capacity? And I have a follow up question.
Charles Liang: Yes, our capacity remains very huge. 5000 rack per month. And then 2000 rack can be GB200 NVLR72 kind of high performance drag. And so we are very fully ready for when a demand ramp up. And that's why when Blackwell become more mature, much better year rate, and we are fully ready for that, especially for our DLC2 much better deep cooling solution.
Mehdi Hosseini: But Charles, how does that 5,000 rack per month today compared to like six months ago?
Charles Liang: Indeed for USA we have a 5,000 rack per month since six months ago. But now we are growing in Taiwan and Malaysia, Netherlands as well.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay, thank you for clarification. Sorry. Go ahead, Go ahead, David, go ahead.
David Weigand: Oh, I was just going to say we haven't, we haven't fully enabled Malaysia as of yet, which that we will be by the end of this year. It will be fully enabled for rack, largest rack production. Yes, I think that's what you were driving toward.
Charles Liang: You have the facility now in about July. July will be very ready.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay, thank you. Where are we with the CFO search?
Charles Liang: When company continue to grow, for sure we need more manpower so we continue aggressively looking for more talent, including shareholder position.
Operator: Thank you for your questions. That concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation and enjoy the rest of your day.

===== 2025 Q2  (2025-02-11 17:00:00) =====

This call is being live broadcast on the Supermicro Investor Relations website and is being recorded for playback purposes. An archive of the webcast will be available on the IR website and is the property of Supermicro. Our third quarter fiscal 2025 quiet period begins at the close of business, Friday, March 14th, 2025. And with that, I will turn it over to Charles.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Michael, and thank you to everyone for joining us. We have some important updates today on our financial filings, operational progress, technology innovation, and business opportunities, as we cross the midpoint of the fiscal 2025. I’ll begin by reviewing some key financial highlights from the December quarter. Our preliminary fiscal Q2 net revenue is projected to range between $5.6 billion and $5.7 billion, marking a 54% year-on-year increase at the midpoint. Despite some negative impacts on cash flow and market misperception due to the 10-K delay, we achieved an average market quarter. Driven by sustained AI demand from both existing and new customers, our growth trajectory for fiscal year 2025 remains promising. Highlighted by the beginning of our transition from Hopper to Blackwell GPUs, we expect the growth in new generation platforms to accelerate as supply ramps this quarter and beyond. We have confidence that our calendar year 2025 growth could be a repeat of calendar year 2023 if not better, assuming the supply chain can keep pace with demand. Our preliminary fiscal Q2 non-GAAP earnings was in the range of $0.58 to $0.60 per share, versus $0.56 last year, representing approximately a 5% year-on-year growth. Non-GAAP gross margin was approximately 11.9%, and non-GAAP operating margin was approximately 7.9%. Margin was temporarily under pressure due to the 10-K delay disruption, the new product R&D investment and customer and product mix. In a separate press release issued today, we announced a private placement of $700 million in new 2.25% convertible senior notes due in 2028 to support our rapid business growth immediately. We have also privately amended a portion of our existing convertible notes due in 2029, with all investors participating in the amended notes. This will support our growth including Supermicro 4.0 initiatives, Datacenter Building Block Solutions DCBBS and some brand-new GPU platform architecture design. Before diving into the details of our operational progress, let me begin by sharing an update regarding our financial filings. Our financial team and our new auditor BDO have been fully engaged in completing the Audit process. Based on our progress to-date, we are confident that our fiscal year 2024 form 10-K and the first two quarters of fiscal year 2025 Form 10-Q will be filed by February 25th, 2025. As previously stated, the Special Committee found no evidence to support the former auditor’s reasons for resignation. However, over the past two quarters, we have added senior leaders in corporate communication, operations, finance, legal and compliance departments. We will continue to add more top experienced leaders to build a stronger corporate foundation for our rapidly growing and expanding global business, including the CFO, CCO and other positions. As you know when a company quickly grow 4 times business in three years like Supermicro, adding more senior leaders is also a natural requirement. Especially, we know, we will continue to grow strongly in the future. Moving on to our technology progress, we are excited to announce that our NVIDIA Blackwell products are shipping now. We have begun volume shipments of both air-cooled 10U and liquid-cooled 4U NVIDIA B200 HGX systems. Meanwhile our NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 racks are fully ready as well. Utilizing our system building blocks, we are going to soon offer more brand new platforms for customers seeking further optimized, higher density and even greener AI solutions. While most key component are ramping at full speed, it will take some time to fulfill our current AI solution backlogs. Some customers also need more time to finish their DLC data centers build out. At the same time, we see strong new demands keep coming in from enterprises, CSPs, sovereign entities, and hyperscalers. We are expanding and enhancing our total liquid-cooled datacenter infrastructure solutions featuring the latest DLC technology, exemplified by the xAI Colossus, the world’s largest liquid-cooled AI Supercomputer. Supermicro is the disruptive leader in driving industry-wide adoption of DLC technology, which reduces customers' OpEx and achieve green computing. We expect more than 30% of new data centers worldwide to adopt liquid-cooled infrastructure within the next 12 months, driven by the rapid and continued growth of AI. Green Computing deserves to be everywhere in the world. Our DLC long-term investment and leadership provide a sustainable competitive edge and economies of scale, far ahead of competition. Supermicro’s Datacenter Building Block Solutions consolidates servers, racks, networks, storage, water towers, software management, on-site deployment, cabling and service for an end-to-end solution. The true value of Datacenter Building Block Solutions is to save power, reduce space, and decrease water consumption, resulting in up to 40% lower TCO for our customers according to our TCO calculation. It accelerates new data-center deployments and helps modernize existing infrastructure in weeks or months, rather than quarters and years, significantly improves datacenter TTD and TTO, time-to-delivery and time-to-online. We are expanding our Datacenter Building Block Solutions to include more key subsystems quarter-after-quarter and will become a true one-stop shop data center partner to the whole industry soon. On the production front, our new Malaysia campus will soon ship products to our regional partners. Our Taiwan and European production capacity are also growing significantly. In Silicon Valley, we are rapidly expanding our manufacturing sites to increase our DLC rack-scale production capacity. The U.S. campuses boast an impressive 20 megawatts of power, enabling us to produce over 1,500 DLC GPU racks per month in the U.S. To better support our key partners and align with current government initiatives, when needed, we are also ready for other domestic manufacturing expansions in various regions across the U.S. These strategic expansions will ensure we meet the increasing demand for our products and services, while maintaining our commitment to key partners for quality, security, TCO, total-cost-of-ownership TTD and again time-to-delivery, and TTO, time-to-online. To summarize, we have been a product and technology leader in the IT industry for over three decades. As we continue strengthen our internal operations and expand our U.S. and global manufacturing footprint, we aim to turn these progresses into value for shareholders, customers, and partners. Our first-to-market advantage of delivering the most innovative AI infrastructure technology with Blackwell, coupled with exceptional product quality, service, software, networking, and security with Datacenter Building Block Solutions, will continue to reinforce our partnership as the premier US-based datacenter infrastructure solution provider. With our expanding technology leadership and today’s AI trend, we believe it will result in a similar growth trend for us like 2023. With that, I am confident we will finish this fiscal year strongly with revenue in the range of $23.5 billion to $25 billion and I believe we have potential to reach $40 billion for fiscal year 2026. Before passing the call to David for the financial overview, I want to thank all of our partners, customers, investors and Supermicro team members, and express my deep appreciation for their continued support. With that, I will now turn the call over to David.
David Weigand: Thank you, Charles. Please note that these numbers are preliminary and unaudited, and subject to change upon completion of review by management, our audit committee, and additionally, our independent audit firm has not completed its review procedures with respect to such preliminary financial information. So to start, we again expect Q2 fiscal year 2025 revenues in the range of $5.6 billion to $5.7 billion, up 54% year-over-year. Again growth was driven by demand for air-cooled and DLC rack-scale AI GPU platforms. AI-related platforms again contributed over 70% of revenue for Q2 across enterprise and cloud service provider markets. The Q2 non-GAAP gross margin is approximately 11.9% versus 13.1% last quarter due to lower margins from product and customer mix. And you'll recall that on the Q1 earnings business update call, we guided down 100 basis points for this quarter. The non-GAAP operating margin is approximately 7.9% which excludes $82 million in stock-based compensation expenses versus 9.7% in Q1, due to those lower gross margins. Other income and expense is approximately $8 million, consisting of $15 million in interest and other income offset by $7 million in interest expense. The tax rate is approximately 15% for GAAP and 17% for non-GAAP. GAAP net income were range from $315 million to $325 million and non-GAAP net income $375 million to $392 million. Non-GAAP net income excludes $63 million in stock-based compensation expenses, net of the related tax effects of $19 million. GAAP diluted EPS is approximately $0.50 to $0.52 versus prior guidance of $0.48 to $0.58. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is approximately $0.58 to $0.60 versus guidance of $0.56 to $0.65. We expect a GAAP diluted share count of 636 million and a non-GAAP diluted share count of 647 million. The closing inventory was approximately $3.6 billion versus $4.9 billion last quarter. CapEx was $28 million. Cash used in operations was approximately $240 million versus cash generated from operations of approximately $409 million in Q1. Supermicro began the second quarter with approximately $2.1 billion in cash and recorded approximately $320 million in GAAP net income for the second quarter. Cash was provided from lower inventory and other sources totaling $1.5 billion. And the company used cash to pay down accounts payable by $1.2 billion, we realized higher other receivables from purchase rebates and prepaid inventory of $484 million. We had increased accounts receivable of $335 million, we also reduced bank loans by $346 million net, and we incurred capital expenditures of $28 million and had other uses of cash totaling $87 million. This resulted in a reduction in cash during the quarter of $660 million, thereby ending the Company’s second quarter fiscal year 2025 quarter with $1.4 billion in cash at the end of December. Now I want to point out, we have continued to prudently manage our working capital and for the month ended January 31st, 2025 we ended with approximately $2 billion in cash. Turning to the balance sheet and working capital metrics compared to last quarter, the Q2 cash conversion cycle was up -- 104 days versus 97 days in Q1. Days of Inventory was 78 days compared to the prior quarter of 83 days. Days Sales Outstanding for Q2 was 47 days versus 42 days last quarter while Days Payables Outstanding was 21 days compared to 28 days last quarter. In a separate press release issued today, we announced a private placement of $700 million of new 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2028, and we privately amended our existing $1.7 billion Convertible Senior Notes due 2029. The Company is reconfirming that no previously issued financial statements require a restatement. The Company, however made certain adjustments to the preliminary unaudited results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 that it announced on August 6, 2024. The adjustments recorded in the results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 include an increase in net sales of approximately $46 million, an increase in the cost of sales of approximately $96 million, which includes a charge due to an increase in inventory reserves of approximately $45 million, there was also an increase in operating expenses of approximately $5 million. Until the Company’s fiscal year 2024 financial statements are filed, the Company is required to reassess its accounting estimates for financial reporting. The charge for inventory reserves results from an unanticipated decline in the market value of certain components that were held in the Company’s inventory or on non-cancellable purchase orders at the end of fiscal year 2024. Collectively, these changes resulted in a downward adjustment to the previously announced preliminary unaudited fiscal year 2024 and fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per common share of approximately $0.09 that’s based on post-split diluted shares outstanding basis. The foregoing adjustments are to previously announced preliminary unaudited financial results and, as such they do not constitute a restatement. For the third quarter of – our fiscal 2025, we are expecting net sales in the range of $5 billion to $6 billion. We expect the GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 12%. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses to be up approximately $17 million sequentially and GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses to be a net expense of approximately $12 million. We expect GAAP net income per diluted share of $0.36 to $0.53, and non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $0.46 to $0.62. The company’s projections for GAAP and non-GAAP net income per diluted share assume a tax rate of approximately 10.7% and 12.7% respectively, a diluted share count of approximately 642 million shares for GAAP, and a diluted share count of approximately 653 million shares for non-GAAP. The outlook for Q3 of fiscal year 2025 GAAP net income per diluted share includes approximately $65 million in expected stock-based compensation expense and other expenses, net of related tax effects of approximately $17 million, which are excluded from non-GAAP net income per diluted share. So again I want to point out, revenues for the trailing four quarters are between $20 billion and $21 billion. And for the fiscal year 2025, we are updating our revenue guidance from a range of $26 billion to $30 billion to a new range of $23.5 billion to $25 billion. So we are very happy to announce that the company has raised money through the issuance of new bonds, and we will continue to improve our liquidity as our growth requires it. I want to end by saying that the final financial results reported for this period may differ from the results reported here, based on the review by BDO, our new independent registered public accounting firm. We expect to complete our fiscal year 2024 audit by the February 25th filing extension date that we have been granted by Nasdaq. So, Michael, turn it back to you.
Michael Staiger: Sandra, we'll now take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Ng with the company, Goldman Sachs. Michael your line is now open.
Michael Ng : Hi, good afternoon. Two questions for me, if I could. First, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the $40 billion fiscal 2026 revenue outlook. What informs your confidence there? If you could shed any light on backlog or pipeline or product road map that is informing the outlook, that would be great. Thank you.
Charles Liang : Yes. I mean our product line continued to grow. We have industry standard product line plus lots of [chip set] (ph) including some confidential product under development. And we have a customer engaged with us for those projects. So this year, even 10-K today, we grew about 60%. Last year we grew 110%. So the coming year, fiscal 2026, at this moment, we believe at least, we will grow 65% at least. So that's, I believe, a very conservative estimation. And the past in production capacity. I mean, USA now, our utilization rate only about 55%. Taiwan utilization rate only about 60%. Malaysia utilization rate still about 1% only. So there are lots of room to grow for us.
Michael Ng: Great. Thank you, Charles. And just as my second question, I was wondering if you could talk about the mix of Blackwell and Hopper servers in the quarter, not looking for anything specific, but was it different than what you may have expected? Was Hopper stronger? Was Blackwell affected by any supply chain constraints? Thank you.
Charles Liang: Yeah, we have both already, right? Hopper was sure, has been a very mature product, H200, for example. And then Blackwell, we have a GB200, fully ready in production. And then for B200 HGX, we have a 10U air cooler, fully ready for production, and then 4U liquid cooler fully ready for production. And we already accumulated some good volume backlog, back order, and continue to see lots of new order coming. So I believe -- we do not share the detail about the percentage. But basically, for sure, more and more customers like to have a B200 and GB200. But we have all of them ready.
Michael Ng: Thank you for the thoughts, Charles. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with the company Loop Capital. Ananda, your line is now open.
Ananda Baruah: Hey, good afternoon, you guys. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on what's a pretty solid print in deliverance of news here. I guess two if I could. The first is just on gross margins. Dave, what's a good way to think about June Q gross margins in the context of your guide? And then just sort of the second one there, this is the second part of my first question, I have a follow-up question as well. What's a good way to think about gross margins through the Blackwell cycle? This is obviously a key question for people and they want to remove the concern off the table that there could be material margin pressure through the Blackwell cycle. So those two, and then I have a follow-up. Thanks.
Charles Liang: Thank you for your question. For sure, when product becomes mature, like H100, H200, then we had to face price competition strongly. But for Blackwell, doesn't matter GB200 or B200, For sure, whenever they are new products, our margin will become much better. And especially talking about liquid cooling, we believe DLC or overall liquid cooling, market share, will grow all the way to 30% or even more in the next 12 months. And in terms of liquid cooling, in the last 12 months, I believe we have offered a majority of global liquid cooling. So when faced with a Blackwell opportunity, most of the customers that go for liquid cooling. I believe we have a much better position. [It can] (ph) just throw a point on there. Hey, look, let me just add that while they are focused. Most of us are focused on the gross margins, but rightfully so. But don't miss the critical point that we're driving operating margins above our targets that translates into shareholder value.
David Weigand: So, Ananda, this is David. One thing I would add is, if you look back, if you look back to what happened with H100, as Charles mentioned, Supermicro was the once that had -- company that had a stable platform and which became a market leader. And so that helped our margins as they crept up to 18.8%. Now, of course, we're targeting, we said we target 14% to 17%, but the question is, to your point on Blackwell, what will the competition be able to deliver? And I think that's going to be a big indicator of margins. We feel like we're in pretty good positions because we've already been, yeah.
Ananda Baruah: Yeah, appreciate that guys. And then the follow up is on the REV Guide. Charles, the $40 billion. So a couple things. You mentioned calendar year 2025 could be similar to calendar year 2024, which is about 40% growth. So that would suggest maybe $8 billion on average in the September, December quarter of revenue. And then the $40 billion, the at least $40 billion for fiscal 2026 would tend to suggest maybe at least $12 billion on average the March and June quarters of 2026 fiscal year? So is that sort of what you're talking about? And then what gives the confidence, I guess, what's the thought process underpinning that $40 billion and those kinds of rep quarters? And is it GPUs, as well as custom ASICs as the TAM opens up? So just kind of a customer question there as well. Thanks. That's it for me.
Charles Liang: Yeah, thank you. Again, whenever there are new technology, we have a good chance to grow, right? Kind of like this time, Blackwell, right? And kind of DLCC liquid cooling. And again, we have a much higher capacity ready for liquid cooling compared with the market. Last year, we grew 110%.And this year, basically, we grew we will grew about 60-something percent. Next year, fiscal year 2026, I believe 65% is a very conservative estimation. And personally, I hope we can grow more than that, but that's to be conservative.
Ananda Baruah: Thank you. Thanks guys really appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with the company JP Morgan. Samik, your line is now open.
Samik Chatterjee : Yep. Thanks for taking my question and have a couple of questions as well. Maybe just to start off, Charles, I think the Last time you mentioned, which was in 2024, that we could expect sequential revenue increases in the medium-term on a quarterly basis. When I sort of look back at it in hindsight, it looks like what derailed that sequential growth to some extent was the product transition from Nvidia in going from one product generation to another which also drove some change in customer behavior. As you're thinking about the revenue target here for $40 billion for fiscal 2026, I mean, is there an underlying assumption that you won't see a similar customer behavior change towards the next generation product as Nvidia goes through a transition again in that timeframe, or is there something that I'm missing in that sort of overall product transition that we should expect from your GPU supplier? And then I have a quick follow-up.
Charles Liang: Yeah, I mean for calendar 2025, for example, I believe we should be pretty able to repeat 2023 history. In 2023, [H193] (ph) launched and we are ahead of competition. So we grew very well. In 2025, calendar year 2025, we are facing the same opportunity now, except before our old air cooler, and now it's duke cooler. And in terms of liquid cooling, especially DLC, we have a major market share, and we have a huge capacity, 1500 rack per month capacity ready. And we already have many customers already approved. They are difficulty in data center and getting ready to deploy in high volume. So once Blackwell in volume production, I believe we will have strong growths. And now we are just preparing, diligently preparing all the logistics including the system enclosure, thermal solution, for sure GPU supply from our vendor NVIDIA. So we are well prepared and once logistic ready, we are ready to ramp up our growth.
Samik Chatterjee : Okay, can we follow up on that? Go ahead.
Charles Liang: Plus, I mean, we are spending more effort in Asia and Europe now in 2023-24 most of our market in USA But now our team in Asia and Europe becoming a much ready much stronger to grow much share in Europe and Asia as well.
Samik Chatterjee : Correct. And Charles, I'll just follow up with a question that I'm getting from investors today after the [prayer] (ph), which is when we look at that sort of $40 billion revenue target, how confident are you about achieving that revenue target with the current customer engagements that you have relative to what you need in terms of additional customers and new customer engagements to get to that revenue that you're targeting. If you can share your thoughts on that, please.
Charles Liang: Thank you. Yeah, in last few years, our growth have been very strong, except our 10-K interrupt, right? So in that 4 months, 5 months, we suffered a 10-K impact. So, our growth will be slowed down. But we will fix 10-K filed in very soon. And cash flow won't be a problem anymore. So, the product is strong. Capacity here, customer is ready. So, I believe $40 billion forecast is a relatively conservative estimation.
Samik Chatterjee: Thank you. Thanks for taking the questions.
Operator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Ruplu Bhattachary with the company Bank of America. Ruplu, your line is now open.
Ruplu Bhattachary: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is on gross margin. Overall, do you think industry margins are now under secular pressure given more competition from other AI server manufacturers? And is liquid cooling really a competitive advantage which you can charge more for, or is that also becoming commoditized since it looks like everyone seems to be offering their version of liquid cooling? So David, how are you thinking about the long-term gross margin range for your business? And I have a follow-up on revenues.
David Weigand: Certainly. So what I would say about gross margins are that, number 1, what we count on Ruplu is being the first to market with the very best solutions. And so right now, we have a shipped GB200, for instance. And we're very confident in its quality as a product. And that's really what helps to drive good margins. So it's not just liquid cooling, it's really it's stable systems that have high quality, high reliability and also really the best performance. So I think that our abilities in liquid cooling were already demonstrated in the prior quarters. And it is really our Datacenter Building Block Solutions, which give us a plan for the future. And so we have a lot of things planned for the future, but Datacenter Building Block solutions are one of those where we offer a lot more solutions for the complete data center at all levels. So again, we haven't changed our target margin. And yes, there is competition. There's always going to be competition. But I think that if you look at how we've performed historically and our ability to engineer in all the latest technologies, I think that's our moat, that's our advantage.
Charles Liang: Yeah, let me add a little bit. I mean, the DLC, everyone talking about they have a DLC solution, but how many competitors really have a DLC people even in high volume? I guess it's very minimal. Last year, I believe we shipped at least 60% of our worldwide DLC solution. That means those are competitors indeed. They are ready, but they do not have experience yet. Talking about Datacenter Building Blocks Solution, not many providers are able to provide on-site deployment and on-site cabling, on-site servicing. And now with DLC, with 150KW per rack, or even more powerful rack, I believe the on-site premium cabling service becomes a very important value to customers. And we are a company have exactly all our experience, all our successful story.
Ruplu Bhattachary: Okay, for my follow up, if I can ask, as new efficient AI models like Deepsea come about, how are you thinking about the impact on your business? And as you move from training to inference, what is Supermicro doing to further penetrate the enterprise vertical? I know you have enterprise customers, but for those enterprise customers who don't have a large engineering presence, what is your strategy for attacking that customer base as well as for sovereign customers? Thank you for taking my questions.
Charles Liang: OK. So for [deep-seeking] (ph), I mean, for sure, software can always be more efficient quarter out of quarter. So we know that. But industry's expense really depends on financial plan. So I believe the market size won't shrink because of deep seeking. And in terms of enterprise, we have been in the enterprise market for more than 10 years. And our team in enterprise has been much stronger than before ever, especially with our service team, management software and end-to-end data center solution. I believe it's the right time for us to grow quickly in enterprise segment.
Ruplu Bhattachary: Okay, thanks for all the details. Appreciate it.
Charles Liang: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with the company Northland Capital Markets. Nehal, your line is now open.
Nehal Chokshi: All right. Thank you. Quick question here. Can you tell us whether or not Backlog is up Q or Q for the December quarter?
David Weigand: So we don't generally give out backlog figures, Nehal. But what we can say, though, is that backlog tends to follow the chip cycle. And so, when you have new chip solutions coming out, you'll see backlog start to build as solutions become dependable and reliable. And then they'll tail off as the products mature. And so with the expectation of some of the new chips coming out, we believe that you'll see growing backlog industry-wide. Backlog industry-wide.
Nehal Chokshi: Thank you. And then I apologize in advance, this question is going to sound a bit Turkish, but Charles, you characterize a $40 billion target at 60% year-over-year growth. And given that fiscal year 2025 is going to be around 60% year-over-year growth and likely impacted by the 10-K delay, therefore 60% year-over-year growth for fiscal year 2025 is potentially conservative. But I mean, is historical year-over-year growth really a good indicator of future demand? Have you looked at the actual pipeline of demand and said, yep, we believe that this is the, how big is the pipeline and this is a reasonable conversion rate and therefore $40 billion is indeed very reasonable?
Charles Liang: Yeah, very good question. From both, we validate the business from all different dimensions. From our historical growth, last few years we have been growth more than 60% year-over-year, basically, except this year, right, the current year because of 10-K delay, and we have strong cash flow constraint. So we grew, we may grow only about 60% or [60 some chip] (ph) but other than that I believe looking forward next few years our growth should be every year should be more than 60%. And second, from our customer demand, from our customer backlog, from our customer commitment, sales commitment, looks like $40 billion is a relatively very conservative target.
Nehal Chokshi: Great, thank you. And if I might squeeze one more in, I'm sorry, but I'm not quite getting what you mean by Datacenter building block architecture. Can you give me a concrete example as far as what does that mean? Is it like basically the cooling tower design or something else? Can you put a little more concreteness behind that?
Charles Liang: Okay, still a little bit confidential, but I'm happy to share. I mean, it's like ours, right scale building block solution. Customers want to build in their ROIC, we have ambition for them. Same thing, a customer want to build their data center, we will have ambition for them. And today we offer more and more key components. For example, liquid cooling, all kind of liquid cooling pump, and water tower, dry tower, water tower, and then ORA kind of these tables. I'd be too [new to share] (ph).
Charles Liang: I mean, anyway, all the people build a data center need those key components. We try to provide all of them, including software, including management tool and experience. So I hope the customer can one stop shop with Supermicro to build their data center, make their data center time to market much quicker and also cheaper. And the whole cost, right? And quicker to build their data center. And that's power consumption. Better quality. Thank you.
Operator: Thanks. Next question comes from Jon Tanwanteng with the company CJS securities.
Jon Tanwanteng: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Charles, I was wondering if you could break down the factors or maybe David, you know, driving the reduction in the 2025 revenue guidance. How much is maybe pricing related? How much do you think is related to delays or availability of Blackwell? On how and the impact on hopper demand and then maybe how much was related to your 10-K and maybe customers not feeling so great about, you know, doing business with you until that's filed.
David Weigand: Yeah, I would say, Jon, that probably the biggest factor was just the delay in new technology because we were, when you think about it, we were all set to go. We were all set to ship with liquid cooling. We were ready. But the problem was that not everything else was. So that was certainly a huge impact. I think, obviously, 10-K delay was a distraction. But it's more about technology for us, because we count on being early to market. And so that's what creates the big jumps that we have, the kind that took place last year from Q3 to Q4 when we went up $1.5 billion in 1 quarter. But remember, we finished the four quarters that ended June 30th at $15 billion. And now here we are two quarters later, and now we're at a trailing four quarters of over $20 billion. So, we have the dynamic to accelerate really well when the technology is there, the customers want. And I think if you look at all of the spending predictions and intentions that are out there, you can see the money being put in place to spend money on data centers and on data center solutions. And that's why we're here.
Jon Tanwanteng: Got it. Thank you. And then can you talk about your capital needs and cash flow expectations going forward as you start getting the quarter? You're maybe generating $8 billion revenue. $12 billion revenue as implied by that $40 billion target.
David Weigand: Yeah. So we're working on a number of different fronts to raise additional capital, which we just did with some of our actually, the investors that put money into us previously with our bonds. So they came back and provided additional capital for us. So we will, we've always said we want to use our balance sheet as we can to generate additional funding for our growth. But we'll just like we're preparing on the engineering side, we'll also prepare on the capital side.
Charles Liang: Yeah, in terms of the average, our inventory and AR, I guess the long should be available very soon.
David Weigand: Yeah, we have a very unlevered balance sheet, as you know right now, because we paid down a lot some of the bank debt. And so we we've paid down a lot of accounts payable. And so we're -- we have a very, very healthy balance sheet.
David Weigand: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from Aaron Rakers with the company Wells Fargo. Aaron, your line is now open.
Aaron Rakers: Yeah, thanks guys for taking the questions. Most of them have been answered or have been answered, but I've got a couple here real quick. So first of all, Charles, I just want to make sure I'm clear, you know, Blackwell and the product cycle, are you shipping the GB200, the NVL72 today? And or if not, is that a significant factor as far as volume shipments in your current quarter guide? And I've got a few others.
Charles Liang: You know, GB, NVL72, our position is similar to other competitors, right? So we have a solution for you, ready. Now once we have support from Nvidia, we can ship at the time, right? And other than that, our B2-1, indeed, I believe, is some of our advantage because we have all different kind of optimized platform, especially for 4U DLC. We have lots of demand there and we are ready to ship in volume about now.
Aaron Rakers: And DLC as you know, last year alone.
Aaron Rakers: Yeah. Sorry, go ahead.
Charles Liang: Yeah, I said DLC, as you know, last year, Supermarket alone, we shipped more than 3,000 rack to the market. I believe that's about 70% of the whole market, whole DLC market last year. So we have a much better experience, much better solution. So when customer looking for GB200, for B200, I believe we are in much better position than the industry's average, for sure.
Aaron Rakers: That's perfect. And then my second question is really on gross margin. You know, I apologize to ask to get on this topic, but can you walk us through the variables that drove the sequential change in gross margin this last quarter? And I guess the other thing is that, you know, Charles, you mentioned some of the utilization rates in US and Taiwan. You know, hypothetically, let's say that you're at, I don't know, pick a number, 70% or 75% utilization rate. How much of an impact would utilization rates have on gross margin? How do we isolate that impact?
Charles Liang: We did not provide that, but basically for sure, it's impact may be 20, 30 points.
David Weigand: Yeah. In the past, we've said if we can manufacture in Asia, we predicted that we would be able to save 1 to 2 points on the margin, Aaron. But we, back to, let's see, and then you had another question on gross margins to walk you from Q, back through Q2. Because again, we forecast back in November that we would be down 100 basis points. And that was because of the customer mix and products that we saw shipping out. Remember, we're working on more end of life products, which have become more competitive as customers waiting for the new platforms by all the different technology companies to come out from Intel, AMD and Nvidia. So there is of course more people that have, that are offering solutions. But as Charles mentioned, going into the B200s and the GB series, you know, it's, -- it's going to be perhaps a different game. And so that's my commentary on, you know, how we got to the change in margin. And we had a little, we had some extra expenses as well, because we're spending more on R&D right now, and specifically in buying some of the advanced chips as we refine our engineering and production to get ready for what we consider will be very large shipments coming up.
Aaron Rakers: Thank you, guys.
Charles Liang: On-site deployment, cabling, and service, That will be another differentiation with other competitors.
Operator: Our next question comes from Quinn Bolton with the company Needham & Company. Quinn, your line is not open.
Quinn Bolton: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to follow up on the GB200 NVL72 question. Just sounds like you guys are ready to go but the biggest gating factor is just support from NVIDIA. Do you guys have a forecast from NVIDIA? You know when you think you're going to start to see you know supply the GPU, so that you can ship the NVL72 where visibility is still pretty low on availability of the GPUs?
Charles Liang: We already proved pretty much everything. And now, just waiting for – and we are in some allocation, some volume, but the volume demand is way much bigger. So we are waiting for more allocation. So hopefully very soon we can ship in much higher volume.
Quinn Bolton: Got it. So it's just waiting for the allocation, sounds like is the gating factor. Got it. Thanks. And then maybe just to follow up longer term question Charles, on this DeepSeek impact on the industry certainly sounds like we'll get more deployment of AI models, which probably says we get more inferencing. To the extent that you see more inferencing infrastructure put in place, it is probably more fragmented. I assume that -- that's good for Supermicro because it's less concentrated, probably more variability of systems. But can you spend a second on whether you think a shift towards inferencing is positive for the business? Is it neutral? Is it negative? Thanks.
Charles Liang: Yeah, it's very positive. When invention becomes more popular, becomes a worldwide trend. Before, they may have a 300 buyer basically, but with invention getting popular, AI getting popular, I believe very soon there will be thousands of companies need to buy AI equipment or service. So we are very happy to see the market size is growing and many more customers are asking for a product, asking for total solution. And with our application optimized, natural, building blocks solution, We are able to service a variety of customers in different vertical. So that's another advantage we will have.
Quinn Bolton: Thank you, Charles.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Wang with the company Barclays. George, your line is now open.
George Wang: Oh, hey, guys. And thanks for taking my question. Hey, Charles, can you talk about your current pipeline just in terms of the mix of sovereign AI, just especially versus 3 months ago, can you kind of talk about whether you are seeing an incremental kind of pipeline build from the sovereign AI of the world?
Charles Liang: Yes, it's also increasing. I mean, before most of the demand, USA and some other large country only. But now, yes, we see many more countries going to build their own AI infrastructure, especially for solving AI and imaging as well. So the demand is kind of worldwide now, and it's a very exciting moment to see the AI boom continue to be popular worldwide?
George Wang: Just a quick follow-up, if I can. As we potentially heading to the GB300 era, later this year or 2026, the supply chain chatter of most of the open standards as NVIDIA potentially unbundle the supply chain. So that could potentially add more customization. So maybe directionally, can you talk about the implication to Supermicro, especially for the margin? Do you think that you can add a bit of more customization, hence more margin, as we're heading to GB300, or it's non-material?
Charles Liang: Yeah, technology always unlimited. People always come up with some idea and some demand for doing vertical application. So we never feel our engineer has nothing to do. So always do not have enough engineering manpower. So, even today, we still continue to hire engineers very aggressively worldwide. So, there is lots of room to Optimize for different customers, different product lines, different verticals, and especially for invention. So I still have lots of room to differentiate. And especially when we get into a data center building product solution. Now we are growing our [market temp] (ph) to our data center infrastructure. So to provide the whole solution for people who need to build a data center. So I see our market temp also faster growing.
Michael Staiger : Thank you, Jay. We're out of time. Thank you for attending the Supermicro conference call and we'll catch up with you soon. Thank you.
Operator: That will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and enjoy the rest of your day.

===== 2025 Q1  (2024-11-05 17:50:00) =====
Operator: Thank you for standing by. My name is Telia, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Super Micro Computer Inc., SMCI U.S., Q1 FY'25 Business Update Call. With us today, Charles Liang, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; David Weigand, CFO; and Michael Staiger, Senior Vice President of Corporate Development. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you.
Michael Staiger: Good afternoon and thank you for attending Super Micro's first quarter fiscal 2025 business update conference call for the first quarter, which ended September 30, 2024. With me today are Charles Liang, Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and David Weigand, Chief Financial Officer. At the end of today's prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session for sell-side analysts. I will make additional remarks prior to beginning of Q&A, but the company will not address any questions regarding the recent decision of our independent auditor to resign and the delay in the filing of the company’s 10-K. During today's conference call, Super Micro will address business and market trends from the first quarter of fiscal '25, including our financial outlook and operations, our strategy, technology and its advantages, our current and new product offerings, and competitive industry and economic trends. We will discuss estimated financial results, but reference to any financial results are preliminary and subject to change based on finalized results contained in future filings with the SEC. By now, you should have received a copy of today's news release that was issued after the close of market and is posted on our website, where this call is being simultaneously webcast. Any forward-looking statements that we make are based on facts and assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them. Our actual results may differ materially from the results forecasted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. A discussion of some of the risks and uncertainties relating to our business is contained in our filings with the SEC, and we refer you to those public filings, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. During this call, all financial metrics and associated growth rates are non-GAAP measures other than revenue and cash and investments. This call is being broadcast live on the Super Micro Investor Relations website and is being recorded for playback purposes. An archive of the webcast will be available on the IR website and is the property of Super Micro. Our second quarter fiscal 2025 quiet period begins at the close of business, Friday, December 13, 2024. With that, I will turn it over to Charles.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Michael. Before we dive into the first quarter details, I would like to share some thoughts on the recent challenges that the company has experienced. As we have emphasized in our filings since these challenges emerged, we remain confident in our previous financial reports. And as previously announced, we are actively in the process of engaging a new auditor. We are working with urgency to become current again with our financial reporting. I am pleased to report that the Special Committee has today provided the following statement to Super Micro, which is also included in our press release. I quote, "The Special Committee has completed its investigation based on a set of initial concerns raised by Ernst & Young. Following a three-month investigation led by Independent Counsel, the Committee's investigation to date has found that the Audit Committee has acted independently and that there is no evidence of fraud or misconduct on the part of management or the Board of Directors. The Committee is recommending a series of remedial measurement for the company to strengthen its internal governance and oversight functions, and the Committee expects to deliver the full report on the completed work this week or next. The Special Committee has other work that is ongoing but expects it to be completed soon." End of quote. The Special Committee has not otherwise provided any additional details or information. We look forward to receiving the committee's full report in the near future. We do not believe the current challenges affect Super Micro's ability to service our customers and partners as we continue to grow rapidly and strongly with the AI revolution, and my confidence in Super Micro and its staff remains stronger than ever. Here are some key quarterly highlights. The preliminary fiscal Q1 net revenue was in the range of $5.9 billion to $6 billion. At the mid-point, this is up 181% year-on-year, driven by strong AI demand from our old and new customers. It was one of our strongest first quarters in history, despite many customers are waiting for the coming soon new generation GPU chips. The preliminary fiscal Q1 non-GAAP earnings in the range of $0.75 to $0.76 per share versus $0.34 last year, approximately a 122% year-on-year growth rate. The preliminary non-GAAP gross margin is approximately 13.3% and non-GAAP operating margin is approximately 9.9%. Both were higher than the previous quarter as customer mix improved, and supply chain costs and expedited shipment eased for DLC components. We have deployed the world’s largest DLC AI supercluster with 100,000 NVIDIA GPUs in a record time-to-deployment, TTD, as well as time-to-online. This milestone achievement reflects our engineering expertise and complex logistics capabilities for large scale AI infrastructure deployment. Leveraging our Datacenter Building Block Solutions, DCBBS, we are now building full scale liquid cooled datacenters with our Rack Scale Plug And Play solutions featuring our latest DLC liquid cooling technology at a leading pace. DCBBS, Datacenter Building Block Solutions, can reduce the time required for customers to build new datacenters from roughly two years to a few quarters, significantly improving datacenter TTD, time-to-delivery, and TTO, time-to-online and cost for customers' AI IT infrastructure. Datacenter Building Block Solutions is also helping to accelerate the adoption of DLC, direct liquid cooling, driving efficiency and performance while reducing customers' OpEx, achieving greener computing. We expect 15% to 30% of new datacenters will adopt liquid cooled infrastructure in the next 12 months. The DLC volume is at least 10x more than last year -- I mean, this year, DLC market share will be at least 10x more than last year due to the DLC liquid cooling product maturity and the rapid growth of AI. To keep the DLC solutions performing at their best, our new Super Cloud Composer, SCC, is capable of end-to-end management from chip level all the way to rack level and datacenter cooling towers, making it the most powerful DLC datacenter management software on the market today. SCC further simplifies provisioning of a highly automated, software-defined infrastructure, supporting customers with rapidly changing workload requirements. With the addition of SCC, Super Micro is well prepared to service many more customers and grow DLC liquid cooling datacenter market share. On the production front, we are in the process of completing our new Malaysia campus, where we expect to begin manufacturing later this quarter. Additionally, we have been nonstop expanding our facilities in Silicon Valley to increase DLC rack-scale production capacity. Now they are boasting 15 Megawatts of power and able to produce more than 1,500 DLC GPU racks per month, with plans to scale up further. Our Taiwan and Europe production facilities also are growing at a quick pace. Moreover, we are planning to expand to several other global manufacturing locations in the near future. By leveraging our strengths in technology innovation, product design, build quality, supply chain management, deployment and datacenter services, we are pursuing our goal to transform Super Micro into a leading USA, as well as worldwide AI IT infrastructure company. We are off to a strong start in fiscal 2025. Our Total IT solutions deployments are rapidly scaling and our new product developments are progressing smoothly. Our NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 is ready and the 10U air-cooled, and 4U liquid-cooled B200 rack PnP systems are fully production-ready. The brand new 200KW+ SuperRack architecture, co-developed with NVIDIA, which provides near 100% DLC, I mean, the whole rack, almost no cooling fan required, is also on the right track. The new SuperRack architecture will be able to achieve Power Usage Effectiveness, PUE, close to 1.0. To complete our broadest AI portfolio, the AMD MI300 and MI325 platforms and Intel Gaudi 3 solutions are ready to go as well. Our Datacenter Building Block Solutions is attracting more new customers and our long-term investment in DLC is paying off with world-class quality and volume capacity, giving us a sustainable competitive edge and economies of scale. Before passing the call to David Weigand, our CFO, I want to thank our partners, customers, investors and Super Micro employees and express my appreciation for their patience and support until we can provide more information about our 10-K filing status. Our strong foundation, Datacenter Building Block Solutions and DLC green computing leadership, not only reduce energy cost for our customers, but also contribute to a healthier, Mother Earth. I believe we are well positioned for strong future growth.
David Weigand: Thank you, Charles. We remind investors that the unaudited interim financial information in this report is preliminary. We expect unaudited Q1, Fiscal Year '25 revenues in the range of $5.9 billion to $6 billion, up 181% year-over-year and up 12% quarter-over-quarter versus our guidance of $6 billion to $7 billion. Growth was driven by strong demand for Direct Liquid Cooled rack-scale AI GPU platforms. AI contributed over 70% of revenues across enterprise and cloud service provider markets. The expected Q1 non-GAAP gross margin is approximately 13.3% versus 11.3% last quarter due to product and customer mix and lower costs coupled with higher manufacturing efficiencies on DLC AI GPU clusters. The Q1 non-GAAP operating margin is approximately 9.9% excluding $67 million in stock-based compensation expenses versus 7.8% in Q4. The Q1 estimate for other income and expense is expected to be a net expense of approximately $9 million, consisting of $17 million in interest expense offset by $8 million in interest and other income. The Q1 tax rate is approximately 14% for GAAP and 16% for non-GAAP. The Q1 estimate for GAAP net income is $433 million to $443 million and non-GAAP net income is $483 million to $493 million. Non-GAAP net income excludes $50 million in stock-based compensation expenses, net of the related tax effects of $17 million. The split-adjusted Q1 GAAP diluted EPS range is approximately $0.68 to $0.70 versus prior guidance of $0.60 to $0.77. The Q1 non-GAAP diluted EPS range is approximately $0.75 to $0.76 versus guidance of $0.67 to $0.83. We expect a Q1 GAAP diluted share count of 639 million and a non-GAAP diluted share count of 648 million. Operating cash flow is approximately $407 million, an improvement of $1 billion quarter over quarter. Q1 closing inventory was approximately $5 billion. CapEx for Q1 was $42 million. Positive free cash flow was $365 million for the quarter. The Q1 closing balance sheet cash position was $2.1 billion and total debt was $2.3 billion with bank debt of $0.6 billion and convertible bond debt of $1.7 billion, resulting in an improved estimated Q1 net cash position of approximately negative $0.2 billion versus a net cash position of negative $0.5 billion last quarter. Turning to the balance sheet and working capital metrics compared to last quarter, the Q1 cash conversion cycle was 97 days versus 94 days in Q4. Days of Inventory was 85 days compared to the prior quarter of 82 days. Days Sales Outstanding for Q1 was 41 days versus 37 days last quarter, while Days Payables Outstanding was 29 days from 25 days last quarter. For the second quarter of fiscal 2025, we expect net sales in the range of $5.5 billion to $6.1 billion. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin down 100 basis points sequentially due to customer and product mix. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses up approximately $34 million sequentially and GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expense to be a net expense of approximately $7 million. We expect GAAP net income per diluted share of $0.48 to $0.58 and non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $0.56 to $0.65. The company’s projections for GAAP and non-GAAP net income per diluted share, assume a tax rate of 14.0% and 15.0% respectively, a diluted share count of 640 million shares for GAAP, and a diluted share count of 648 million shares for non-GAAP. The outlook for Q2 of fiscal year 2025, GAAP net income per diluted share includes approximately $54 million in expected stock-based compensation expense and other expenses, net of related tax effects of $14 million, which are excluded from non-GAAP net income per diluted share. The final financial results reported for this period may differ from the results reported here based on the review by the new independent registered public accounting firm to be appointed. We are working diligently to select a new independent registered public accounting firm and complete our fiscal year '24 audit. Michael, we're ready.
Michael Staiger: Thank you, David. Before we get into questions, we appreciate you may have further questions about the special committee's findings as well as our audit time line. We're not in a position to address those questions on the call today. So, with that, operator, we'll take a first question.
Operator: We will now begin the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]. The first comes from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.
Michael Ng: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for the question. Just on the business fundamentals, revenue came in at the lower end of the guidance. I was wondering if you could speak to that and whether you're seeing any market share losses as a result of some of the delayed financial filings? And how do you feel about the $26 billion to $30 billion full year revenue guidance that you previously gave out? And are you hearing from any customers that once this resolution occurs, they'll be able to step up some of their orders? Or is it a gating factor? Thank you.
Charles Liang: Okay. Thank you for the question, Michael. Indeed, last quarter, revenue reduced a little bit. I guess the major reason because there are some customers waiting for the new chip, the Blackwell chip, as you know. So people are waiting for the new solution. And the new solution, the Blackwell-based liquid cooling, air cooler, or GP200, our solution is ready. That's waiting for a chip. So, I guess that's the major reason. And our capacity continues to grow, and our liquid cooling solution is fully ready. Again, we can produce 1,500 liquid cooler racks per month now. So, we are fully ready. That's waiting for the new chip to be available. And then I believe we can grow our market share and revenue after that.
Michael Ng: Great. And for David, just on the full year guidance.
David Weigand: Yes, Michael, we're not providing annual guidance on this call.
Michael Ng: Great. Thank you, Charles. Thank you, David.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Michael.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may proceed.
Samik Chatterjee: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess maybe to sort of talk about the gross margins here. You had robust gross margins in the quarter, but you're guiding it down. It seems like maybe it's a bit more choppy in terms of gross margins depending on customer mix. Does the sort of progression before getting back to the 14% to 17% that you talked about earlier still remain sort of the base case? Or are you having to sort of discount more or be more aggressive on pricing on the current generation products? And as separate sort of a side question, just I know you're not commenting on related to the filings, but any management changes or any changes in how you operate that you're planning or thinking about to sort of overall improve things in terms of getting more sort of more disciplined around and more control around the financial reporting? Thank you.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Samik. Yes. I mean, it depends on new product, right, when new GPU chip available. As you know, whenever there are new generation of technology, we have an advantage to grow our market share and profitability. And at the same time, our data centers are building broad solution with SCC, Siebel, Michael, Carl, Composer. They provide a full end-to-end solution. That for sure, we are gradually growing our gross margin and net margin. As to management team, yes, we are always faster growing. You know, 2023, we grew 40% about. And then 2024, we grew more than double. And this year, again, we will have a big growth. So, when company are faster growing, we continue to add more people, including senior management. So we are evaluating the possibility, including the report from special committee. And we, by the nature, we continue to grow senior management team as well.
Samik Chatterjee: Thank you. Thanks for taking my question.
Operator: The next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. You may proceed.
Aaron Rakers: Thanks for taking the question. A couple if I can as well. Charles, I want to go back. I think when you guys had originally guided this quarter, I think the guidance range is like $6 billion to $7 billion. You came in at about $500 million at the midpoint short of that. I guess, given the comments to the prior question, are you assigning that to just the timing of Blackwell? Or was there something that changed in the demand or the timing of deployments this last quarter? I'd also add in there. I think last quarter when you had set that guide. I think there was like $800 million of sales that you had alluded to as being pushed out of last quarter into the fiscal first quarter. Did that all close? I'm just trying to bridge that gap for me between the delta and the guide relative to the business update today.
Charles Liang: Okay. Good. I mean this is a complicated question. So I believe the major impact is new chip availability. Because Blackwell chip for sure is much higher performance, much better performance per dollars, right? And the good thing is that it will be available gradually. And Q1 hopefully, Q1 2025 volume become much better. And so that's the major factor, I believe. As to our 10-K delay may impact a little bit, how much I don't know yet, but a certain impact for sure, but hopefully not too big. As to the whole year, yes, today, we do not provide annual guidance basically with our detailed edge, right. In last few months, we deliver more than 2,000 rack DLC. That, I believe, is a very high percentage for the whole deep cooling market. So, for the future growth, is still very optimistic.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. And then two other quick questions, if I can. So, first of all, I mean, you mentioned $5 billion of inventory coming out of this quarter. Any thoughts of where that might trend coming out of this next quarter embedded in your outlook that you provided today? And then I apologize for asking, I know that you're not going to address the special committee dynamic. But any thoughts on the timing of getting an auditor to sign. Anything you can share on that front? I appreciate that you ask, we're not talking much about that, but I'm curious, any comments on that front.
Charles Liang: Okay. For inventory, maybe I can answer a little bit. I mean the company will continue to grow; I believe. So, $5 billion level of inventory, I believe will continue. And as to the special committee investigation results today, I'm very happy to share some very positive innovation as for detail once it's available from them, we will share with the market.
David Weigand: And Aaron, we have no update with respect to the time line that we talked about, as we mentioned earlier. We're working diligently to get that done, as I mentioned, as quickly as possible.
Aaron Rakers: Thanks, guys.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. The following comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. You may proceed.
Ananda Baruah: Yes, guys. Good afternoon, good evening. Thanks for taking the questions. Two if I could. I guess the first is on gross margin. Dave, should we still expect it to improve as we go through the fiscal year as you were previously anticipating?
David Weigand: Yes. So, by the way, we guided cautiously in this first quarter on our margin. So, we were glad to be able to exceed it. And so in like fashion, we're guiding conservatively into the second quarter. And so, we still have our target margin that we're shooting for. And so we're doing everything that we can to improve that.
Charles Liang: Yes. The competition is still putting some pressure. As you know, but Blackwell, I mean a new technology push and feel very optimistic with a chance to grow. And as I mentioned, the Datacenter Building Block Solutions including SCC, Super Cloud Composer that provide end-to-end management from chip level to rack scale to the whole data center. So, I believe all of those will help our growth. And then we are also able to provide the customer on-site deployment, on-site cable and service. So all of those are very positive to our business. I feel very positive to continue to grow business.
Ananda Baruah: Yes. Thanks for the margin context. I appreciate that. And the follow-up is just a general working capital financing question. This question has come up with a lot with investors. And really, the question is can you explain sort of the access to capital situation as we go forward? And I guess, really, how would you like the investment community to think about the access to capital situation as we go forward? And I guess, really, how would you like the investment community to think about the access to capital situation? Thanks.
David Weigand: Sure. So Ananda, we put in the last eight, nine months, $4 billion into working capital from two equity raises and one convert. And so that's really -- it really left us with a good working capital situation exiting Q4 at a run rate of around $1 billion -- of $6 billion. So again, we're forecasting a little down in Q2. So that takes care of our working capital needs for a while. So access, we have a very strong, growing and profitable company. And so we don't believe that we'll have any impediments to raising working capital.
Charles Liang: Yes, quarterly -- every quarter, we are making a reasonable good net profit, though. So basically, we should be in a good shape.
Ananda Baruah: Okay, guys. Thanks, so much. That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from George Wang with Barclays. You may proceed.
George Wang: Okay, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I have two quick ones. Firstly, can you kind of double-click on which quarter do you think that you will start booking the Blackwell revenue revenue? Last time you guys alluded to sometime in the June quarter. Just curious whether that is still on track. Just any kind of high level in terms of when do you think the Blackwell is going to show up in the P&L?
Charles Liang: Yes, very big question. Indeed, we're asking NVIDIA every day. So I hope their production can go smooth and go for high-volume very soon. And once they have chip available, our solutions are full ready. So, we continue to work with them very closely to develop a current product, GB200, NVL72 and B200 nuclear-cooled and air-cooled. And we also designed some really enhanced rack scale solutions. So, in terms of total solutions, we have a very strong offering waiting for the chip. So, we need immediate and quicker support. Thank you.
George Wang: Well, that's helpful. Just a quick one, if I can. Just how to think about gross margin in the area of Blackwell versus Hopper. Just curious if you can talk about puts and takes on the gross margin for the GB 200, especially in light of reference design from NVIDIA, any kind of incremental value add from Super Micro just as we kind of hand to the Blackwell just in relation to the profitability and the kind of margin profile? Thank you.
Charles Liang: Yes, thank you. By the way, for sure, we estimate more competitive, right, because people know AI market is so big now. So, with Blackwell, we expect more competition. But at the same time, we also were prepared by our Datacenter Building Block Solutions with our end-to-end Super Cloud Composer and with our on-site deployment, cabling service business. So those are new. And I believe we are able to provide a very unique, very efficient time-to-delivery, time-to-online advantage to customers. So yes, competition is strong, but I believe we are in a good position.
George Wang: Okay. Thanks a lot, Charles. I’ll go back to the queue.
Charles Liang: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The following comes from Nehal Chokshi with Northland. You may proceed.
Nehal Chokshi: Yes. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple of questions, please. First, Dave, any 10% customer exposures in the quarter and the upcoming quarter?
David Weigand: Indeed, we will have 10% customers, Nehal.
Nehal Chokshi: Could you give us some detail as far as what percent of overall revenue due to 10% customers represent in the September quarter?
David Weigand: Yes. So we're not going to release that data today.
Charles Liang: Yes. But at the same time, we continue to gain more new customers, especially in Europe and Asia. So I believe we will be able to keep a healthy ratio.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. Great. And then Charles, I think there's a strong feeling in the investment community that the Chairman and CEO roles, if separated, could be quite beneficial to Super Micro. From your perspective, what is the benefit of Super Micro separating these roles?
Charles Liang: Okay. Why would I base it on a company? That's my consideration. So, every day -- if not every day, then every week, I have been thinking about that question since many years ago. And so, again, why would I base it on a business? So, I personally have a very open mind and technology guy and technology in my best interest. But still, overall consideration is the best benefit for shareholders and the company.
Nehal Chokshi: And just to be clear, do you see it potentially being in the best interest of the shareholder of that separating these roles there?
Charles Liang: No comment at this moment, but I'm considering about that. And someday, I will retire it. Hopefully, not in one year or two years. But sooner or later, I will retire. So I mean those changes for sure is a natural base of shareholders and for our company. And for my family too.
Nehal Chokshi: Thank you for taking my question.
Charles Liang: Yes, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. You may proceed.
Vijay Rakesh: Hi, Charles. On the September quarter in December, I’m just wondering how many liquid cool racks we are shipping in September and if you have some idea in December?
Charles Liang: David, maybe do you have some number this year?
David Weigand: It was just a little below last quarter but I don't have the exact...
Charles Liang: I would have to say, we had a company ship most of liquid cooling racks to the market recently. For example, in the September quarter. And our liquid cooling because ahead of the market. So -- and customers like our liquid cooling because save their energy power and safe water requirements and kind of the trend. So I believe we will continue to grow liquid cooling percentage.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. And when you say down sequentially into December quarter on the H200 liquid cooling. Any idea on how much that is sequentially?
Charles Liang: We did not share that number, but I believe this cooling will continue to grow very quickly. And we are very happy to promote that.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. And just last question on…
Charles Liang: Go ahead, Vijay.
Vijay Rakesh: Sorry. I think, David, on the November 16 deadline, are you guys comfortable that you will have an auditor and file a plan to the NASDAQ?
David Weigand: So we're not answering those questions today. So we -- we're -- like I said, we're diligently looking to replace the auditor as quickly as possible. And we will be filing a plan with NASDAQ and indeed regarding an extension. And so -- but that's all we have to say about that.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. Yes.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Jon Tanwanteng with CJS Securities. You may proceed.
Jon Tanwanteng: Hi, Good afternoon, and thank you for taking my question. I was wondering, Charles or David, could you break out what your expected revenue in in Blackwell was supposed to be in the Q1 guidance and what you have implied in the Q2 guidance finance, first of all? And then second, do you see a risk of supply or allocations due to this auditor and filing issue, especially from NVIDIA, just would they possibly maybe hold back some just until you figure it out? Or are they supporting you through this and just meeting your orders and especially with the new technology?
Charles Liang: Yes, our relationship with NVIDIA has been multiple decades. And our growth kind of cooperation between two companies continue to enhance. So we have many important projects co-developed and I don't expect and then negative allocation from them. So at this moment, according to our relationship according to our communication, things very positive.
Jon Tanwanteng: Great. And then I guess, the Blackwell numbers that were implied in the last quarters and this quarter guidance?
Charles Liang: That's hard to answer because we don't know how -- what's the volume NVIDIA, we have rate available every month. So we work with them very closely and co-develop solutions, validate a solution and service the common customer. So once they have no volume available, I believe we will have a good percentage in our product mix.
Jon Tanwanteng: Got it. And then if I could sneak one more in there, if I could. Is there more efficiency to be unlocked in your liquid cooling supply chain? Or have you mostly resolved the issues in ramping your production capacity and supply chain there?
Charles Liang: We focused on liquid cooling much earlier than the industry, right? So in the last few months, we already shipped more than 2,000 racks, right? And so far, the feedback from customers are very happy. Indeed, that quality, the customer satisfaction even better than our air cooler solution. So we are very excited. Our hard work in the last 3 years that is paying off and we believe liquid cooling will continue to be our major advantage, including the whole data center end-to-end total solutions. Again, not just the liquid cooling racks but kind of deployment, cablings, service management so aware. So we are very excited for our DLC liquid cooling solution and customer like today.
Jon Tanwanteng: Great. Thank you and good luck for finding new auditor.
Charles Liang: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The following comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. You may proceed.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes, sir. Thanks for taking my question. David, from what I understand regarding cash flow, it seems like there was a onetime positive impact your days of inventory went up, but you were able to significantly increase your operating cash flow. Can you -- did I hear you correct? And if so, what is the item that helped you with positive operating cash flow?
David Weigand: Sure. I think the answer is, Mehdi, that we've been growing at such a high rate over the past quarters that that's really what's been impacting our operating cash flow is that we've had to pour 100s of million dollars into inventory as well as into accounts receivable. So kind of coming off of a quarter where we didn't have such a dramatic increase in revenue, we were able to generate a lot of cash, basically $1 billion worth of improved cash flows. So it was really -- yes, so it was really just the fact that for the reasons Charles mentioned, the growth wasn't as high.
Mehdi Hosseini: I understand, but your DSO went up -- I'm sorry, your days of inventory went up. And I think from what I heard from you, your DSO didn't change. So was that improvement in operating cash flow all driven by working capital reduction or was there something outside of working capital to help you?
David Weigand: No, it was really for those reasons. It was really just for inventory equation.
Charles Liang: Mehdi, maybe I can have it. I mean, when we grow about 200% more year-over-year. So for sure -- and we see continue to grow. So for sure, we need much higher inventory to support our customer demand. And then when our growth become more normal, not 200% year-over-year. For example, 100% or 80%, then we don't have to grow that much of inventory, and that will help our cash flow. So it's a good challenge I would like to say.
Mehdi Hosseini: Got it. And then, Charles, maybe you can help us give us an update on your total capacity, especially with the Malaysia expansion? And how should -- how is the utilization of the global installed capacity tracking?
Charles Liang: Very good question. We expect we will continue to grow very fast. That's why we have been preparing a huge capacity in Silicon Valley, in Taiwan and now especially in Malaysia. So long term we needed those capacity. But in terms of utilization rate at this moment, I would like to stay a little bit low because capacity is ready, but no such - no enough new chip. As you say that, no in our new chip. That's why variation rate now is relatively low, maybe only 50%.
David Weigand: This is Dave. Yes, I was going to give you a couple of other tips on cash flow. You'll probably notice that because of an improved gross margin, we had almost $80 million on a non-GAAP basis, more profit this quarter. In addition to that, again, going back to working capital metrics, we increased our accounts payable by several hundred million dollars. So that -- those are other factors that go into improved operating cash flow.
Michael Staiger: Before we go to the next question. Thank you Mehdi. Before going to the next question I just want to clarify one of the comments from earlier with respect to NVIDIA and clarify we have the deepest of relationships with NVIDIA at the technology level. It goes back decades and now we have multiple state-of-the-art projects in progress. And we've spoken to NVIDIA, and they've confirmed there have been no changes to allocations and we maintain a strong relationship and don't expect that to change. So I just wanted to make sure that was clarified. Next question -- actually our last question, Telia.
Operator: Absolutely. Our final question comes from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. You may proceed.
Quinn Bolton: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on the kind of the slightly weaker than expected first half really sounds like, it's just customers waiting for new Blackwell chips. Are you guys seeing that starting to show up in the order books, meaning you're building backlog for either the NVL rack or the Blackwell B200 systems? So you see a nice building backlog for those systems. Obviously, you don't know when you'll get the chips, but that gives you confidence for a much stronger second half once Blackwell starts to ship? Or is it too early for you guys to be actually getting those orders or POs at this point?
Charles Liang: Yes. Our solution is very strong. And I believe NVIDIA will continue allocate their solution to the company, the customer who have faced the total solution because at all, common end user satisfaction is mostly important to every company, right? So I would have to say our solution is very strong, and we continue to work with NVIDIA very closely aim to provide the best total solution end-to-end solution to customers. And that's why we started to provide on-site deployment on site cabling -- on-site service. And overall, those new hopefully, very attractive to a lot of new customers and old customers. So we feel very comfortable for the coming to a new chip solution.
Quinn Bolton: So the backlog for Blackwell, you're seeing that building on your order books?
Charles Liang: We provided kind of remote POC now. And so things are happening.
Quinn Bolton: Okay. And second, a follow-up question for David. You've recently sort of filed new credit agreements with both of your banks just setting a date when you would after provide the audited financials. To the extent that you don't hit that date, what happens? Do you just have to go renegotiate new credit agreements? Do the banks at that point, have the right to effectively call those term loans? Just Wondering if you might be able to address what happens with both the bank debt and if there's any risk to the convertible debt, if you don't provide audited financials within the prescribed time.
David Weigand: Yes. So I think we'll just refer you to our 8-K filings. We have long-term and good relationships with the banks. And so as necessary, we will file extensions, yes, or get waivers. And like as I mentioned earlier, we're not concerned about the company's ability to access the capital markets.
Quinn Bolton: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. There are currently no other questions in queue, so I will now turn it back over to the management team for closing remarks.
Michael Staiger: Thank you for joining our conference call today, and we look forward to talking to you soon.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2024 Q4  (2024-08-06 17:00:00) =====

Our first quarter fiscal 2025 quiet period begins at the close of business, Friday, September 13th, 2024. And with that, I will turn it over to Charles.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Michael. Today, I am pleased to announce another record quarterly result of $5.31 billion, a 143% year-over-year growth. For fiscal 2024, we have achieved $14.94 billion in revenue, a 110% year-over-year growth rate. To put this in perspective, our Q4 revenue has exceeded the full year revenue of fiscal 2022. Our robust growth is driven by our technology and product leadership in the AI infrastructure market, especially with Generative AI training and inferencing. We have been scaling quickly to secure a large share of AI CSP opportunities, deploying some of the largest AI SuperClusters in the world. Leveraging our system building blocks, we build and optimize rack-scale plug and play solutions with the latest DLC liquid cooling technology, helping our customers achieve the best TTD time-to-deployment and TTO time-to-online and lowest TCO with their AI solutions. Here are some key quarterly highlights. First, Supermicro is pleased to be included in the NASDAQ 100 Index last quarter. Fiscal Q4 net revenue totaled $5.31 billion, up 143% year-on-year with a strong record high backlog. We could ship more if not for DLC liquid cooling component shortage. Fiscal Q4 non-GAAP earnings of $6.25 per share were well above $3.51 last year, which was 78% year-on-year growth. Our Q4 operating margin is 7.8%, which is lower than what we expected due to the higher mix of hyperscale datacenter business and expedited costs of our DLC liquid cooling components in June and September quarters. Some key new components shortage delayed about $800 million of revenue shipments to July, which lowered our EPS for June and will be recognized in our September quarter. The availability of our Malaysia facility later this calendar year and our dominating position in DLC liquid cooling total solutions will be instrumental in increasing our profitability. Supermicro is powering the largest AI factories around the world today. We believe more and more datacenters will be opting for our latest DLC liquid cooling solutions, which dramatically improves TCO relative to traditional air-cooled datacenters and is less environmentally taxing. We have proved that DLC solutions also offer higher performance and better uptime, with advantage to support the upcoming new AI chips. At Computex Taipei, I shared that Green Computing can be free with a big bonus. This means the cost of deploying liquid cooling DLC is on par with traditional air-cooled datacenter and significantly lowers the operational power cost. Since then, we have been delivering over 1,000 highly reliable DLC racks to multiple customers. Our goal is to quickly make DLC liquid cooling to be a mainstream solution for most datacenters and AI factories that focus on increasing efficiency and performance while reducing OpEx. We are targeting 25% to 30% of the new global datacenter deployments to use DLC solutions in the next 12 months, with most deployments coming from Supermicro we believe. We are happy to help any customers transform and adapt their existing air-cooled datacenters to DLC liquid cooling in the coming years for four major reasons. First, it helps customers save energy costs up to 40%. Second, it boosts datacenter computing performance and third, it helps pull in customers' datacenter lead times or to be more precisely reduces their time to on-line because of less electrical power required and fourth, it reduces carbon footprint for our one-and-only mother earth. As an end-to-end IT infrastructure solutions company, our customers' experience is our number one priority. By leveraging our system building block and rack scale plug and play solutions, we help our customers achieve the best time-to-market advantage with new and performance optimized technologies. Now, we are further expanding this solution to the entire datacenter. With rapid deployment of large-scale AI infrastructure, datacenters worldwide are facing power shortages and cooling inefficiency challenges. Building these new AI-ready datacenters traditionally takes a long time, averaging three years for example. Our upcoming Supermicro 4.0 DCBBS, Datacenter Building Block Solutions will reduce customers' new datacenter build time from about three years to two years. For smaller facilities or old datacenter transformation, Datacenter BBS can enable an optimized, cost-effective datacenter in less than one year or even in just six months. This new offering will significantly improve datacenters' TTO time-to-online and cost, with full integration of AI compute, server, storage, networking, rack, cabling, DLC liquid cooling facility water tower, end-to-end management software, onsite deployment services and maintenance. We will start offering it later this calendar year. Playing a significant role in realizing our Datacenter BBS and providing additional economies of scale, our new Malaysia campus will start production this November. With its geographic advantages, we expect it to quickly ramp up shipping volume and improve our cost structure. In the US, we are adding new buildings and production POC provisioning capacity near our Silicon Valley headquarters as well, which will further boost our monthly DLC liquid cooling rack capacity and value this fiscal year. Moreover, we are on track to expand to a few other global manufacturing locations, leveraging our strength in product design, build quality, supply chain and deployment, positioning Supermicro as one of the largest IT infrastructure company. In summary, we are entering fiscal 2025 with record-high backorders, winning products, large volume DLC liquid cooling capacity, Datacenter BBS and more new customers. While our long-term investments impact short-term profitability, they position us well for future success by providing a sustainable competitive advantage and necessary economies of scale. This gives me confidence to forecast the September quarter revenue between $6 billion to $7 billion, and fiscal 2025 revenue between $26 billion to $30 billion. Again, we anticipate that the short-term margin pressure will ease and return to normal ranges before the end of fiscal 2025, especially when our DLC liquid cooling and Datacenter Building Block Solutions start to ship in high volume later this year. Lastly, I would like to announce a 10-for-1 forward stock split of Supermicro's common stock to make ownership of Supermicro stock more accessible. We are targeting trading on a split adjusted basis commencing at market open on October 1st, 2024. Before passing the call to David Weigand, our Chief Financial Officer, I want to say thank you to our partners, customers, Supermicro employees on an incredible year where we were able to bring AI at scale to the world and to our shareholders for your continued support. David?
David Weigand: Thank you, Charles. We had robust growth in the fiscal year, and I am pleased with the progress we made on our strategic initiatives. For fiscal year '24, we reported revenues of $14.9 billion, representing 110% growth over fiscal year '23 revenues of $7.1 billion. Fiscal year '24 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $22.09 grew 87% over fiscal year '23 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $11.81. Between fiscal year '21 and fiscal year '24, we achieved significant operating leverage with revenues growing at a compound annual growth rate of 61% per year while non-GAAP operating expenses only grew at 19% per year. Between fiscal year '21 and fiscal year '24, gross margins have met or exceeded the target range of 14% to 17%. Non-GAAP operating margins were above the target range of 5% to 8% between fiscal year '21 and fiscal year '24 and more than doubled from 4.4% in fiscal year '21 to 10% in fiscal year '24 due to strong revenue growth and operating leverage. Q4 revenues were $5.31 billion, up 143% year-over-year and up 38% quarter-over-quarter, and above the midpoint of guidance of $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion. Growth was driven by strong demand for next generation air-cooled and direct liquid-cooled rack-scale AI GPU platforms, representing over 70% of revenues across enterprise and cloud service provider markets where demand remains strong. We exited the year with an acceleration in innovative DLC products, a large design win pipeline and a strong backlog, positioning us for continued growth in fiscal year 2025. We expect gross and operating margins to gradually increase in the year driven by product and customer mix, manufacturing efficiencies for new DLC AI GPU clusters and new platform introductions. As Charles discussed, shipments may continue to be constrained in the short-term by supply chain bottlenecks for key new components for our advanced platforms. However, long-term gross margins will benefit from lower manufacturing costs as we scale up production in Malaysia and Taiwan, in addition to expansion in the Americas and Europe. During Q4, we recorded $1.83 billion in the enterprise-channel vertical, representing 34% of revenues versus 49% in the last quarter, up 87% year-over-year and down 3% quarter-over-quarter. The OEM appliance and large datacenter segment revenues were $3.41 billion, representing 64% of Q4 revenues versus 50% in the last quarter, up 192% year-over-year and up 76% quarter-over-quarter. Emerging 5G, Telco, Edge/IoT revenues were $75 million or 2% of Q4 revenues. For fiscal year '24, enterprise-channel revenues grew 79% to represent 41% of total revenues. The OEM appliance and large datacenter segment grew 149% and represented 58% of total revenues. The emerging 5G, Telco, Edge/IOT segment represented 1% of total revenues. One CSP/large datacenter customer represented approximately 20% of revenues for fiscal year '24. Server and Storage Systems comprised 95% of Q4 revenue and Subsystems and Accessories represented 5%. ASPs increased on a year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter basis driven by the value and complexity of rack-scale Total IT Solutions. By geography, US represented 61% of Q4 revenues, Asia 24%, Europe 10%, and Rest of World 5%. On a year-over-year basis, US revenues increased 94%. Asia increased 437%, Europe increased 128%, and Rest of World increased 386%. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, US revenues increased 20%, Asia increased 66%, Europe increased 74% and Rest of World increased 187%. The Q4 non-GAAP gross margin was 11.3% versus 15.6% in Q3 due to product and customer mix, focus on winning strategic new designs with competitive pricing and higher initial costs in ramping production of new DLC AI GPU clusters. For fiscal year '24, the non-GAAP gross margin was 14.2% versus 18.1% for fiscal year '23. We have a path to improve gross margins to the target range of 14% to 17% as we introduce innovative platforms based on multiple new technologies from our strategic partners and improved manufacturing efficiencies on our DLC solutions. Q4 operating expenses on a GAAP basis increased by 15% quarter-over-quarter and 75% year-over-year to $253 million driven by higher compensation expenses and headcount. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses increased 11% quarter-over-quarter and 39% year-over-year to $185 million. Q4 non-GAAP operating margin was 7.1% versus 11.3% in Q3, due to the lower gross margins. Other income and expense for Q4 was $11 million, consisting of $3 million in interest expense and $14 million from interest income on higher cash balances offset by a loss from foreign exchange and other investments. Interest expenses decreased sequentially as we paid down short-term bank credit facilities. The tax provision for Q4 was $1 million on a GAAP basis and $21 million on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP tax rate for Q4 was 0.3% and the non-GAAP tax rate was 5%. The GAAP tax rate was 4.9% for fiscal year '24 versus 14.7% in fiscal year '23 and the non-GAAP tax rate was 10.4% in fiscal year '24 versus 15.9% in fiscal year '23. Q4 GAAP diluted earnings per share of $5.51 was below the guidance of $7.20 to $8.05 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $6.25 was below the guidance of $7.62 to $8.42 due to lower gross margins and higher operating expenses in the quarter. The GAAP fully diluted share count increased quarter-over-quarter from 61.4 million to 64.2 million and the non-GAAP share count increased sequentially from 62 million to 64.8 million shares reflecting the effects of the two recent stock offerings and the convertible bond offering. Q4 cash flow used in operations was $635 million compared to $1.52 billion in the previous quarter, as inventory and accounts receivable grew due to higher levels of business and the timing of shipments. For fiscal year '24, cash used in operations was $2.5 billion due to strong revenue growth of 110% and working capital needs to support large customer design wins. Q4 closing inventory was $4.4 billion in anticipation of future growth. CapEx for Q4 was $27 million resulting in negative free cash flow of $662 million for the quarter. CapEx for fiscal year '24 was $137 million up from $37 million in fiscal year '23 as we invested in new property, plant, and equipment globally, including our greenfield Malaysia plant. The Q4 closing balance sheet position was $1.7 billion, while bank and convertible note debt was $2.2 billion resulting in a net cash position of negative $504 million versus a net cash position of $252 million last quarter. Turning to the balance sheet and working capital metrics compared to last quarter, the Q4 cash conversion cycle was 94 days versus 96 days in Q3. Days of inventory decreased by 10 days to 82 days compared to the prior quarter of 92 days. Days sales outstanding was unchanged at 37 days while days payables outstanding decreased by 8 days to 25 days. Now turning to the outlook for Q1 fiscal year '25, we expect strong growth as we ramp new air-cooled and DLC AI GPU design wins with new and existing customers. For the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we expect net sales in the range of $6 billion to $7 billion. GAAP diluted net income per share of $5.97 to $7.66 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $6.69 to $8.27. We expect gross margins to improve sequentially due to product and customer mix and improving manufacturing efficiency. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $282 million and include $84 million in stock-based compensation expenses that are not included in non-GAAP operating expenses. The outlook for Q1 of fiscal year 2025 fully diluted GAAP EPS includes approximately $48 million in expected stock-based compensation expenses, net of tax effects of $35 million, which are excluded from non-GAAP diluted net income per common share. We expect other income and expenses, including interest expense to be a net expense of approximately $20 million. The company's projections for Q1 fiscal year '25 GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per common share assume a GAAP tax rate of 9.9% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 14.6%, and a fully diluted share count of 65 million for GAAP and 66 million shares for non-GAAP. We expect CapEx for Q1 to be in the range of $45 million to $55 million. For fiscal year 2025, we are introducing guidance for revenues from $26 billion to $30 billion. Michael, we're now ready for Q&A.
Michael Staiger: Harry?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from the line of Michael Ng of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Michael Ng: Hey, good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. I guess, I have, two. Encouraged to see the revenue guidance for $26 billion to $30 billion for fiscal '25. I was wondering if you could just provide a little bit of color around the assumptions underpinning that revenue guidance and any visibility that you have in terms of backlog and some of the contingencies you might be assuming in terms of supply availability? And then secondly, I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color around the growth in operating margin, improvement throughout the year. Should we think about the, the long-term gross margin targets as applicable for the full year as well or exiting the year? Thank you.
Charles Liang: Okay. Thank you. I mean as to what we share, I mean, we continue to gain design wins and we see lots of new product available, including DLC liquid cooling and Datacenter Building Block Solutions, we see a lot of customer engagement and also more new customer like to engage with us. So with our capacity continue to grow $26 billion to $30 billion. That's our target for the next 12 months. And as to gross margin, as what we just mentioned, our DLC liquid cooling now have been very mature. So we are able to take advantage from that and also Datacenter Building Block Solutions that provides a much better value, improve customers' Datacenter time to online and also EG customers job to build their data center. So all of those will increase our profitability gradually.
Michael Ng: Thank you, Charles.
Charles Liang: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question today is from the line of Samik Chatterjee of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Samik Chatterjee: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I have a couple as well. Maybe if I can start with the gross margin performance in the quarter. I know you mentioned you had a hyperscale customer, which impacted product customer mix and margin impact there. How should we think about sustainability or sort of repeat orders from that customer? It sounds like you're saying that's part of the improvement and you probably don't see as much repeat, but just wanted to confirm if that's how we should be thinking about the hyperscale customer you had, which is that it doesn't really repeat through fiscal '25. And I have a follow-up.
Charles Liang: Yes. We have been very consistent. I mean before we are Silicon Valley based, operations was in Silicon Valley. So we focus on enterprise, high-quality, higher performance customer only, that's before. But when we start to take production operation advantage from Taiwan, we start to grow large-scale datacenter customer. And now we have a huge capacity in Malaysia, it will be ready by later this year. So with the economic large-scale advantage, we are waiting for a large customer. So we will continue to grow with large customers. At the same time, we also continue to enhance our enterprise customer base. So recently, we also see the growth in some demand from our enterprise with our software total solution, I mean Datacenter Building Block Solutions. We start to gain more attraction for the datacenter, I mean, enterprise customers as well. So we believe long-term economic scale, the enterprise customer base and overall Taiwan and Malaysia advantage cost advantage that we have a way to grow gross margin and net profit.
Samik Chatterjee: Got it. And for my follow-up, Charles, there have been reports more recently about the delay of the GB200 from NVIDIA. Just wondering if you can share your thoughts of how that would impact the conversion of the robust backlog or pipeline that you're looking at to revenue through the year? And is that accounted for when you talk about liquid cooling now being a materially higher portion than what you talked about at COMPUTEX. Are you taking some of those delays into account? Thank you.
Charles Liang: Yes. I mean, yes, we heard NVIDIA may have some delay, right? And we treat that as a normal possibility. When they introduced new technology, new product, they are always have a chance to -- there will be a push out a little bit. In this case, it pushed out a little bit. But to us, I believe we have no problem to provide the customer with a new solution like H200 liquid cooling. We have a lot of customers like that. So although we hope better deploy in the schedule, that's good for a technology company, but this push out overall impact to us. It should be not too much.
Samik Chatterjee: Okay. Thank you. Thanks for taking my question.
Operator: Our next question today is from the line of Ruplu Bhattacharya of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Ruplu Bhattacharya: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two of them. The first one relates to the gross margin performance in the quarter. David, can you specify of the 430 bps sequential decline, how much was the result of the customer mix, which is the higher hyperscale customer mix versus the impact of ramping liquid cooling solutions? And how much was that impact to gross margins? And in terms of, I think, Charles, you said you lost about $800 million of revenue in the quarter because of nonavailability of components. Is that all liquid cooling related or was that related to other things like GPUs as well? Thank you.
Charles Liang: Pretty much liquid cooling key components related. But now it's much ready now. I mean when we move to July, August, we have a much liquid cooling key components are available now.
David Weigand: Ruplu, it wasn't a loss. It was pushed out into the next quarter. Yes. So there was -- we really -- we were surprised by the amount of demand that we had in this market. And so we -- our manufacturing efficiency improves -- has been improving every day. And so we expect that to continue and that's going to help our gross margins going forward as we deploy liquid cooled racks at scale.
Ruplu Bhattacharya: And is that deployment expected to be linear for these liquid cool racks throughout the year or is it more back-end loaded? Thanks. Thanks for taking my questions.
Charles Liang: Basically, we support a handful customer for liquid cooling. And most of them, once they try our liquid cooling, they will continue to deploy higher percentage with liquid cooling because the cost -- the hardware acquisition cost is about the same, but they will save a lot of energy costs. So I believe this growth will be consistently growing.
Ruplu Bhattacharya: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question today is from the line of Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Ananda Baruah: Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Charles, you said a lot of good stuff on this call. So I'll try to just ask about one or two things here. I guess to start, could you frame for us how the company is thinking about its liquid cooling capability relative to others who are providing liquid cooling service as well. That's been a big top of the conversation. It sounds like you guys are really high on your capability and it seems to be showing up at least in the guidance. But I think additional context around how you guys are competitively positioned and maybe some of the technical reasons why would be super useful for those. And then I just have a quick follow-up.
Charles Liang: Yes. Thank you. I mean as you know liquid cooling have been in the market for 30 years and market share compared with overall datacenter size always small, less than 1% or close to 1%, I would have to say. But just June and July two months alone, we shipped more than 1,000 racks to the market. And if you calculate 1,000 racks, AI rack is about more than 15% on a global datacenter new deployment. So we are very happy. We are happy that the industry pushed from air cooled to liquid cooling and to help customer save energy costs and reduce carbon footprint. At the same time, because of the liquid cooling, DLC liquid cooling datacenters require 30% to 40% less power, that's why it's met customers' datacenter availability quicker because the customers don't have to wait for higher power budget from a powering company. So overall we see more customers like our liquid cooling solution.
Ananda Baruah: And Charles did I hear you accurately that you guys think you did 50% liquid cooling share in the June quarter?
Charles Liang: I believe for June and July in last next two months we may ship at least 70% to 80% or liquid cooling compared with all the liquid cooling in the world. So for liquid cooling, we have at least 70% to 80% market share.
Ananda Baruah: That's useful. Thank you. And then just real quick, my follow-up is you've made remarks earlier this year in the recent past about how you envision expanding your rack capacity sort of over the sort of into the future. I was just wondering if you could give us an update on how to think about, how you're thinking about rack capacity expansion for both liquid cooled and air cooled and that's it for me. Thanks.
Charles Liang: It's a very good question. I mean, last month, we have about 1,000 racks per month liquid cooling capacity. And today, we already grow another 50%. So now we have a 1,500 rack per month capacity. By this year-end, we will grow that to 3,000 rack per month. That's with liquid cooling alone. So we really believe liquid cooling is a much better choice for the market and we provide kind of consultation to customers. And most of the customer when discuss with our engineering team, they love liquid cooling. And again, we are growing customer base for liquid cooling very strongly. And we're really happy for that because minimized power consumption have been common value to the world and especially save operation costs.
Ananda Baruah: And that's fiscal year fiscal year you say end of the year and the fiscal year?
Charles Liang: For the next 12 months, I believe, liquid coding will be a big portion of our business.
Ananda Baruah: Thank you.
Charles Liang: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question today is from the line of Aaron C. Rakers of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I've got two as well. I guess I want to go back to the earlier question on Blackwell just because I think it's going to be a key focal point for a lot of investors here especially as we kind of shape the full year guidance. So Charles I want to be clear. So has your guidance contemplated as we think about the December quarter, do you believe that you'll be shipping the Blackwell platform solutions for revenue in the December quarter or should we think about the full year guide is a bit more weighted to the back half of the fiscal year given some of these concerns around the timing of Blackwell availability and NVL36 and NVL72 platforms, et cetera. I'm just curious of how you want us to say for the street to think about the cadence of that full year guidance shaping up on a quarterly basis. Appreciate you're not going to give quarter-by-quarter guidance.
Charles Liang: Yes. Thank you. I mean, indeed, we are relatively very conservative. I understand Blackwell may postpone how much we don't exactly know because the new technology always what can be pushed out, right? So for Q3, for sure, we do not expect any Blackwell volume. For Q4, I mean December quarter, I guess, it will be very small. Engineering sample small volume. So the real volume, I believe, had to be March quarter next year. And that's why we foresee only $26 billion to $30 billion.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. That's very helpful. And then as a quick follow-up, I want to go back to kind of the gross margin discussion too. We talked about the impact of the DLC platforms. You talked about product mix. One of the other comments, David, you had made was that winning strategic new customers was a factor in that 430 basis point gross margin degradation. Can you help us appreciate what exactly the impact of that has been? How that might have changed this last quarter? And then I'll flip my final one in. Any disclosure on purchase obligations coming out of this last quarter? Thank you.
David Weigand: Yes. Thanks. I'll answer those in reverse order. We don't have any announcements in terms of purchase obligations and so we'll point you to the 10-K for that. But with respect to your first question, I would say, we prepared the market for a downturn in margins or a softening of margins in our guidance last quarter. But even we were surprised by the acceleration that we saw in the liquid cooled rack market. And so we had to ramp up our supply chain. We paid a lot of expedite costs and higher supply chain costs. So I think as the supply chain improves, we expect those efficiencies to now come back out, but that impacted us more than we had expected.
Charles Liang: Especially for June quarter.
David Weigand: Yes, for the June quarter.
Aaron Rakers: Is that the majority of the -- was that the majority for the 430 basis point decline?
David Weigand: Well, no, I think. No, so half was targeting specific accounts like we announced last quarter. And the other half was really the higher supply costs that we encountered.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. Very helpful. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Our next question today is from the line of George Wang of Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
George Wang: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I have two parts. Firstly, can you give more color just in terms of share gains, especially within the hyperscale arena? Traditionally, Supermicro has been more Tier 2, Tier 3 enterprise. And you guys talked about higher mix on hyperscale. Just curious does that mean you guys are winning new penetration to the hyperscale space?
Charles Liang: Yes. Again like what I just mentioned with our Taiwan capacity is getting bigger and Malaysia capacity will be ready. So we're fully ready for large scale datacenter customer, but we will be selective. So that's why we foresee only $26 billion to $30 billion. If we try to be more aggressive in a large scale, our growth can be even faster than that. But we try to grow in both ways enterprise and large scale datacenter kind of try to balance so to maintain our healthy profitability.
George Wang: Okay. Great. Just a second question, if I can squeeze in. Just as we enter the Blackwell era with liquid cooling kind of larger deployments, higher ASP, but also comes with some potential working capital need. Just in terms of the capital raise, is that fair to say you guys are sufficient or there could be some potential to come to the market? Just maybe you can talk about the puts and takes for the next 12 months.
Charles Liang: Liquid cooling, I mean, for sure, is necessary and it's very helpful for Blackwell solution. Although Blackwell solution pushed out a little bit. But indeed we enable liquid cooling for H100 and H200 as well and a lot of customers are interested in our H100 and H200 liquid cooling now indeed. So liquid cooling to from our position we'd like to support the whole datacenter not just Backwell.
George Wang: Okay. Can you address on the working capital if you can give any color on that?
David Weigand: Yes. So we announced a $500 million credit line with a group led by the Bank of America. And so we expect we are really working on our balance sheet and leveraging our balance sheet. And we expect to some announcements to be coming in terms of additional loan possibilities in the future.
George Wang: Okay. Great. I will go back to the queue. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question today is from the line of Jon Tanwanteng of CJS Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Jonathan Tanwanteng: Hey, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I was wondering if you could just talk, given your time to market and volume capabilities and liquid cooling, the energy and compute advantages, can you walk through what your pricing strategy is and why not pass those costs on especially relative to the value that you're providing? Is it a stronger competitive environment close to behind you or are you effectively trying to get ahead of them and get that share first?
Charles Liang: Yes, I mean, indeed, the liquid cooling from our point of view it is really a good value to the whole market and our whole planet because of less energy consumption, right? So we enable liquid cooling primarily for Blackwell, right, because Blackwell higher power that's for sure. Lots of cases need liquid cooling. But we enable that for H100, H200 and regular CPU as well. Because overall liquid cooling once mature, once economical scale is good enough, it's good for all different kind of computing. And not exactly now, we are deploying, we are promoting. Lot of our customer continue to interest in our liquid cooling even enough for Blackwell.
Jonathan Tanwanteng: Got it. Thank you. And then you mentioned getting back to the gross margin target range by the fiscal year-end. Can you help us narrow down a little bit more where in that target range you expect to be at the low end? Is it more towards the middle kind of help us understand how you're getting there?
Charles Liang: Okay. For June, it's really a unique quarter because we deploy lots of liquid cooling and we pay lots of exploration cost. So that makes our June gross margin much worse. But now, indeed, our liquid cooling technology have been getting very mature, and we have a high volume now. So that though our liquid cooling cost are now. And however we try to promote liquid cooling as a mainstream product solution. So we try not to add the value too much to customers. But, instead, we try to gain market share and make liquid cooling everywhere.
Jonathan Tanwanteng: Okay. Thank you. And any color just on where in the margin range you expect to end up?
David Weigand: Well, so we, I think if you look at the guidance that we gave for Q1, we expect to be above 12% in the first quarter. And we're doing -- we'll be working very hard to move back into the range as we mentioned as soon as quickly as we can.
Charles Liang: Especially with our commissioned Datacenter Building Block Solutions with more software, on-site deployment, maintenance and kind of end-to-end management service. So our profit margin should grow from a Building Block Solution for Datacenter very soon.
Jonathan Tanwanteng: Great. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Mehdi Hosseini of SIG. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I just have two housekeeping item. David, what kind of other income did you have in the June quarter. You did say that you had interest income of $12 million that you realized in the June quarter?
David Weigand: That was a net figure, Mehdi. So we actually had $20 million of interest income, but that was offset by some adjustments too, some investment adjustments which brought down lower.
Mehdi Hosseini: But the $20 million is that interest income. The $20 million is that interest income?
David Weigand: $20 million was interest income, yes, from higher cash balances. That was offset by some investments.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay. All right. And then a question I have for Charles. Obviously, you've done a good job of doubling revenue in fiscal year '24. But you also had a negative free cash flow of $2.6 billion. And if I were to look at the high end of your revenue guide for fiscal year '25, you're on track to double revenues again. Does that mean that you're going to need to burn another $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion of free cash flow to hit those revenue targets?
Charles Liang: Not necessarily. I mean if we try to be very aggressively growing market share maybe if example we forecast on $30-something billion, right, so in that case, we may need more. But if we try to focus on below $30 billion then not necessary.
David Weigand: And Mehdi, one thing I would add to that is we believe that we have an IG profile. And as such, like I mentioned earlier, we're starting to leverage our balance sheet more with targeting toward unsecured debt. And so that will help us on an inter-quarter basis.
Mehdi Hosseini: Got you. Thank you. What should I assume for fiscal year '25 CapEx?
David Weigand: No. We don't have -- we're not giving a guide at this time.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay. But would it be down on a year-over-year basis since most of the expansion in Malaysia and US are behind us?
David Weigand: Well we have other projects going on expansion here in the US, but we'll -- nothing to announce today.
Mehdi Hosseini: Got you. All right. Thank you, Dave.
Operator: Our next question today is from the line of Nehal Chokshi of Northland Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Nehal Chokshi: Yes. Thank you. I want to talk about DLC and some of the chatter that's been out there from some competitors and that, it sounds like failure rates for DLC, broadly speaking, not necessarily for Super Micro is high relative to air-cooled. Can you comment on what is Super Micro's DLC failure rates relative to air-cooled and then also relative to other DLC solutions. And I guess maybe we can do it on a per-node basis annualized failure rates or whatever basis you want to utilize?
Charles Liang: Yes. We spent a lot of effort in last, I would like to say, two years to prepare our optimized DLC solution, including lots of new design, redesign, refining the components of the system. So finally, I mean, about May this year, right, we have our DLC solution for you ready. And we have more than a handful, high-profile customers who really like our DLC solution. That's why we're deploying the solution to them and that's why we paid lot of exploration charge, right? But now the good thing is our whole DLC solution has been very mature and ready for really high-volume production. So now for any customer want DLC, we are able to support them quickly and with a much reasonable cost now. So looking forward, I mean, DLC, I believe, will be a really popular solution for the world because it's more efficient, especially energy saving. So we are very happy that we establish DLC solution much ahead of anyone else. Again like June and July, I believe, we have at least 70% or 80% maybe even higher market share in the world for DLC. And air-cooled, again, we have been -- have a very optimized air-cooled solution. So we continue to promote air-cooled solution for sure.
Nehal Chokshi: And do you have any thoughts on the actual like failure rates relative to air-cooled and then relative to other suppliers DLC solutions?
Charles Liang: Yes, liquid cooling, as you know, because a very high efficient in cooling, right? So they allow CPU, GPU other components running at a lower temperature. And then in lot of case, indeed, are able to optimize customers' datacenter performance by percentage, right, a couple of percentage to even high single-digit percentage. So a lot of customers really like DLC at this moment.
Nehal Chokshi: So are you saying that you actually can achieve lower failure rates with DLC because you can run the GPUs at lower temperatures.
Charles Liang: CPU, GPU and other components at a lower temperature that which you have the kind of the whole datacenter quality, uptime, availability time.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. And then my follow-up question is that, I think, June 21st, you did an 8-K after market close, leasing significant datacenter space from prime datacenter and then you're leasing it back to Lambda Labs. It seems like a rather odd arrangement. Can you guys talk about the purpose of doing this?
David Weigand: So we consider ourselves experts in datacenter solutions. And so this is really just one more facet of being a total provider.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Thomas Blakey of Key Corp. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Thomas Blakey: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I have a few here. David, could you comment on the mix shift -- mix rather of AI rack scale revenue here in the quarter? Was it -- did it increase quarter-on-quarter in the June quarter?
David Weigand: Absolutely. I mean our revenues went up -- over a $1.5 billion and that was primarily driven by liquid cooled racks.
Thomas Blakey: Okay. Excellent. And an update maybe on the capacity utilization did that increase as well or decrease? And relatedly to that, you commented last quarter that there would be a number, I think of about 1,000 rack per month going out at a 64 GPU configuration? Could you give an update in terms of did you shipped those to the three customers? One was new in the June quarter? And again an update on the capacity utilization related to that question.
Charles Liang: Yes. Customers like our high density computing solution especially per rack. That's why you say 64 GPU or more GPU, right? So we are very efficiently provide the customer for whatever configuration they like. And very soon we will allow something even better for sure.
Thomas Blakey: So that -- so to be clear is that a yes that you shipped 3,000 racks during the quarter at that configuration to those three customers?
Charles Liang: We are building that capacity for that because how many customers will move to DLC, especially when Blackwell ready. So we are very optimistic for that, especially after Blackwell in high volume production. And we have many Blackwell ready optimized system and rack scale design.
David Weigand: Yes. But Thomas the 1,000 per month was the capacity. We're not saying that we shipped 1,000 per month. But one thing I can tell you is that the efficiency, yes.
Thomas Blakey: That's clear. Okay.
Operator: Thank you. And we have run out of time for any further questions. So this will conclude the Super Micro Computer Incorporated Q4 2024 Earnings Call. Thank you to everyone who is able to join us today. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-04-30 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Thank you for standing by. My name is Joel, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Super Micro Computer Fiscal Q3 2024 Results on April 30, 2024. With us today are Charles Liang, Founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer; David Weigand, CFO; and Michael Staiger, Vice President of Corporate Development. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
Michael Staiger: Good afternoon, and thank you for attending Supermicro's call to discuss financial results for the third quarter, which ended March 31, 2024. With me today are Charles Liang, Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and David Weigand, Chief Financial Officer. By now, you should have received a copy of the news release from the company that was distributed at the close of regular trading and is available on the company's website. As a reminder, during today's call, the company will refer to a presentation that is available to participants in the Investor Relations section of the company's website under the Investor -- excuse me, under the Events & Presentations tab. We have published management's scripted commentary on our website. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, and other income and expenses, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook, including guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 and the full fiscal year 2024. There are a number of risk factors that could cause Supermicro's future results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our most recent 10-K filing for fiscal '23, and our other SEC filings. All of these documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Supermicro's website. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Most of today's presentation will refer to non-GAAP financial results and business outlook. For an explanation of our non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to the accompanying presentation or to our press release published earlier today. In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today's press release and in the supplemental information attached to today's presentation. At the end of today's prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session for sell-side analysts to ask questions. I'll now turn the call over to Charles.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. We achieved another record-breaking quarter, with revenue of $3.85 billion, a 200% increase from same time last year, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $6.65, up more than 308% year-on-year. Supermicro is at the forefront of the current AI revolution. These strong results reflect the continued demand for our rack-scale plug-and-play total AI solutions. We continue to face some supply chain challenges due to new products that require new key components, especially, DLC-related components, and believe this situation will gradually improve in the coming quarters. To sustain this rapid growth, we are making significant investments in production, operation, management software, cloud features and customer service to further increase our customer base and bring more value to them. To support this scale-up, we raised an additional $3.28 billion through a convertible note and secondary equity offering in the quarter. We like to support strong short- and long-term growth with minimal equity dilution. Overall, I remain optimistic that AI growth will continue for many quarters, if not many years to come. We have long recognized that AI is accelerating the need for liquid cooling, and we have invested heavily into high quality, optimized direct liquid cooling, DLC, solutions for high-end CSPs and NCPs. With GPUs reaching 700 watts and soon more than 1,000 watts, efficiently managing the heat from these AI systems has become critical for many customers, especially at the new data centers. I am pleased to announce that our new DLC liquid cooling building blocks and rack scale total solution technology are finally ready for high volume production. With our DLC liquid cooling technology, customers can reduce their expense on cooling [expense] (ph), saving data center space, and allocate a greater portion of their finite power resources to computing instead of cooling, which aligns with our green computing DNA. Now, let's go over some key financial highlights. Supermicro is pleased to be included in the prestigious S&P 500 Index last quarter. Fiscal Q3 net revenue totaled $3.85 billion, up 200% year-on-year, within our aggressive original guidance of March quarter. If not limited by some key component shortages, we could have delivered more. Fiscal Q3 non-GAAP earnings of $6.65 per share were well above $1.63 last year, which was above 308% year-on-year growth. Our increasing economies of scale contributed to better net profit. Our year-over-year operating margin and net income both continue to improve, and we continue to expect further benefits as we bring our Malaysia facility online later in this calendar year. This fast-growing quarter was driven by end users wanting to accelerate their deployment of the latest generation AI platforms. Through our Building Block Solutions, we provide optimized AI solutions at scale, offering a time-to-market advantage and shorter lead time over our competition. Additionally, our rack-scale plug-and-play total solutions, especially with liquid cooling DLC, ensure optimal system performance while saving energy cost up to 40% at data center scale, delivering much more value to customers. We are leading the AI revolution by deploying NVIDIA HGX H100 SuperCluster solutions to our customers, housed in our new 100 kilowatt racks, with 2 times to 3 times higher power density than traditional racks from others. At NVIDIA GTC last month, we unveiled our next-generation Blackwell products, including the GB200 NVL72 solution. To further grow our AI portfolio, we are now strongly focused on developing new generative AI and inference-optimized systems based on the upcoming next-generation NVIDIA H200, B100, B200, GH200 and GB200 GPUs as well as Intel Gaudi2, Gaudi3 and AMD MI300X and MI300A GPUs. Most of them support both air cooling and DLC cooling. As Supermicro is transitioning to our next generation of X14 and H14 product lines featuring the industry's broadest SKUs of Intel XEON 6 processor-based and AMD Turin-based platforms, we are fully ready for high volume production and offer early online access for testing and validation through our JumpStart cloud service. Meanwhile, our X14 and H14 storage solutions are addressing the specific requirements of accelerated AI data pipelines with partners like Weka, VAST Data, and many others. The rapid growth of our business is raising the complexity to scale our capacity. Our production team are making aggressive progress on retrofitting the new Silicon Valley facilities and scaling up our Taiwan and Malaysia factories. We have secured the parts and acquired additional warehouses for our next phase of enterprise and data center businesses. We are currently on track to produce over 2,000 liquid cooling DLC racks per month of AI servers with volumes steadily increasing. Each DLC rack supports up to 100 kilowatt or even 120 kilowatt. At this moment, we are focusing on delivering more than 1,000 racks of NVIDIA HGX AI supercomputers, each rack supports 64 piece H100, H200 or B200 GPUs, with the latest DLC liquid cooling technology to three industry-leading customers, from April to June of this quarter. These three deployments will be among the world's largest DLC liquid-cooled AI clouds, potentially saving our customers up to 40% of energy costs compared to standard air-cooled deployments by our competition. Special thank you to NVIDIA and our close technology partners for this fantastic collaboration. I believe this is just the beginning of our long-term high volume DLC liquid cooling mission. Green Computing can be free with a big bonus. Let's go for Green! In summary, we had a strong quarter with more to come. Supermicro is uniquely capable of delivering new technologies to market faster with our integrated rack-scale plug-and-play solutions, in-house engineering, building block architecture, and green computing DNA. With a robust pipeline of new products in calendar year 2024, we're confident fiscal Q4 revenue will be in the range of $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion. This will raise our fiscal revenue guidance to $14.7 billion to $15.1 billion, an increase to our recent fiscal 2024 guide. We continue to win market share and remain committed to executing our growth plans across all verticals. This remains truly the most exciting time yet for Supermicro, and I believe this strong year-over-year growth will continue in our fiscal 2025, especially with our new, leading and ready-to-ship DLC liquid cooling rack-scale plug-and-play solutions and technologies. Before passing the call to David Weigand, our Chief Financial Officer, I want to thank you again to our partners, our customers, our employees, and our shareholders for your strong support. David?
David Weigand: Thank you, Charles. Fiscal Q3 2024 revenues were $3.85 billion, up 200% year-over-year and 5% quarter-over-quarter. Q3 growth was again led by AI GPU platforms which represented more than 50% of revenues with AI GPU customers in both the enterprise and cloud service provider markets. We expect strong growth in Q4 as the supply chain continues to improve with new air-cooled and liquid-cooled customer design wins. During Q3, we recorded $1.88 billion in the enterprise/channel vertical, representing 49% of revenues versus 40% last quarter, up 190% year-over-year and 26% quarter-over-quarter, driven by industry recognition of our solution price-performance metrics and reliability. The OEM appliance and large data center vertical revenues were $1.94 billion, representing 50% of Q3 revenues versus 59% in the last quarter, up 222% year-over-year and down 10% quarter-over-quarter. One existing CSP/large data center customer represented 21% of Q3 revenues and one existing enterprise/channel customer represented 17% of revenues. Emerging 5G/Telco/Edge/IoT revenues were $37 million or 1% of Q3 revenues. Server and Storage Systems comprised 96% of Q3 revenue and Subsystems and Accessories represented 4%. ASPs increased on a year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter basis. By geography, U.S. represented 70% of Q3 revenues, Asia 20%, Europe 7%, and Rest of World 3%. On a year-over-year basis, U.S. revenues increased 242%, Asia increased 257%, Europe increased 30%, and Rest of World increased 87%. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, U.S. revenues increased 3%, Asia increased 17%, Europe increased 3%, and Rest of World decreased 11%. The Q3 non-GAAP gross margin was 15.6%, up slightly quarter-over-quarter from 15.5% as we continued to focus on winning strategic new designs, gaining market share and improving manufacturing efficiencies. Q3 operating expenses on a GAAP basis increased by 14% quarter-over-quarter and 72% year-over-year to $219 million driven by higher compensation expenses and headcount. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses increased 8% quarter-over-quarter and 43% year-over-year to $166 million. Q3 non-GAAP operating margin was 11.3%, which was in-line with Q2 levels. Other income and expense for Q3 was $3.8 million, consisting of $6 million in interest expense and a gain of $10 million principally from foreign exchange. Interest expenses decreased sequentially as we paid down short-term bank credit facilities. The GAAP tax rate was negative 5.2% resulting in a tax benefit of $20 million for Q3. The non-GAAP tax rate for Q3 was 6% resulting in Q3 tax expense of $27 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were lower due to the impact of higher R&D tax credits and tax benefits from employee stock grants exercised. Q3 GAAP diluted EPS of $6.56 and Q3 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $6.65 exceeded the high end of guidance through record revenues, stable gross margins and operating margins and lower tax rates. The GAAP share count increased from 58.1 million to 61.4 million and the non-GAAP share count increased sequentially from 59 million to 62 million shares as a result of the two stock offerings and, to a lesser extent, the convertible bond offering. Cash flow used in operations for Q3 was $1.5 billion compared to cash flow usage of $595 million during the previous quarter as we grew inventory and accounts receivable for higher levels of business. Cash flows from strong profitability was offset by higher inventory, a large portion of which was received late in Q3, and higher accounts receivable from increasing revenues. Our Q3 closing inventory was $4.1 billion, which increased by 67% quarter-over-quarter from $2.5 billion in Q2 due to the purchase of key components. Capex was $93 million for Q3 resulting in negative free cash flow of $1.6 billion for the quarter. During the quarter, we raised $1.55 billion from a 0% coupon five-year convertible bond offering due in 2029, net of underwriting discounts and offering expenses. We also raised approximately $1.73 billion in net proceeds from the sale of 2 million shares at a price of $875 per share. The proceeds from these transactions will be used to strengthen our working capital, enable continued investments in R&D and expand global capacity to fulfill strong demand for our leading platforms. The closing balance sheet cash position was $2.1 billion, while bank and convertible note debt was $1.9 billion resulting in a net cash position of $252 million versus a net cash position of $350 million last quarter. Turning to the balance sheet and working capital metrics compared to last quarter, the Q3 cash conversion cycle was 96 days versus 61 days in Q2. Days of inventory increased by 25 days to 92 days compared to the prior quarter of 67 days due to key component purchases for higher expected Q4 revenues. Days sales outstanding increased by 8 days quarter-over-quarter to 37 days while Days Payables Outstanding decreased by two days to 33 days. Now turning to the outlook for Q4, we expect strong growth as the supply chain continues to improve with new air-cooled and liquid-cooled customer design wins. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 ending June 30, 2024, we expect net sales in the range of $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion, GAAP diluted net income per share of $7.20 to $8.05 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $7.62 to $8.42. We expect gross margins to be down sequentially as we focus on driving strategic market share gains. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $226 million and include $55 million in stock-based compensation expenses that are not included in non-GAAP operating expenses. The outlook for Q4 of fiscal year 2024 fully diluted GAAP EPS includes approximately $30 million in expected stock-based compensation expenses, net of tax effects of $28 million, which are excluded from non-GAAP diluted net income per common share. We expect other income and expenses, including interest expense, to be a net expense of approximately $8 million. The company's projections for Q4 GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per common share assume a GAAP tax rate of minus 2.9%, a non-GAAP tax rate of 2.6%, and a fully diluted share count of 64.8 million for GAAP and 65.3 million shares for non-GAAP. We expect CapEx for Q4 to be in the range of $55 million to $65 million. For fiscal year 2024 ending June 30, 2024, we are raising our guidance for revenues from a range of $14.3 billion to $14.7 billion to a range of $14.7 billion to $15.1 billion, and establishing guidance for GAAP net income per diluted share of $21.61 to $22.46, and non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $23.29 to $24.09. Our projections for GAAP and non-GAAP net income per diluted share assume a tax rate of approximately 3.6% and 9.2%, respectively, and a fully diluted share count of 61.2 million shares for GAAP and fully diluted share count of 61.8 million shares for non-GAAP. The outlook for fiscal year 2024 GAAP net income per diluted share includes approximately $116 million in expected stock-based compensation, net of related tax effects of $98 million that are excluded from non-GAAP net income per diluted share. We're now ready for Q&A.
Operator: Absolutely. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Ruplu Bhattacharya with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Ruplu Bhattacharya: Hi, thank you for taking my questions, and congrats on the strong guidance. I have two questions. First, I wanted to ask a question on liquid cooling. Do you design most of the components for liquid cooling racks in-house? And as such, do you think you would be able to charge more for liquid-cooled racks? And can this be accretive to gross margins?
Charles Liang: Yes, very good question. Yes, we design lots of key components for, DLC, liquid cooling system, because we care quality, maintenance, and also time to market. So, we design lots of key components while we leverage third-party components as well. So, it's a combination. And, yes, I mean, liquid cooling, we try to charge customer with a minimum premium, and customer can save kind of air-conditioned equipment cost because cool down my liquid, right? So, at the same time, customer will safe lots of TCO, up to 40% of energy cost. That's why we try to promote a slogan, "green computing can be free with big bonus." Customer pay a very minimal premium, but they save up to 40% of energy cost. So, I believe a lot of customer will go for that direction. And, indeed, we already have a handful of customer have big order. That's why this quarter alone -- I mean, June quarter, we are preparing more than 1,000 liquid cooling rack for those early bird. And I believe the demand will continue to grow very strong.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Samik Chatterjee: Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess in the press release, Charles, you mentioned the visibility into share gains as the new solutions ramp. And I was curious if you can sort of give us a bit more color there in terms of when you're thinking about share gains, are these relative to the next-generation GB200 product with NVIDIA? And is this more in relation with sort of hyperscalers? Are you expanding the number of hyperscalers that you are engaged with as you move to these new solutions? Just any more color in terms of the visibility around these share gains? Where is that coming from? And is that more in relation to the next product generation from NVIDIA? Thank you.
Charles Liang: Okay. Thank you. I mean, yes, we continue to gain market share, especially our rack-scale plug-and-play solution that reduce customers' lead time and also reduce customers' time to online. With our rack-scale plug-and-play, customer able to put the system -- deploy the system online in next day or next few days instead of the next few weeks. So, time to online saving is a big advantage to customer. At the same time, the liquid cooling, they help customer save energy power. So, customer can allocate, relocate the energy power to power more computing equipment instead of waste of power for air cool. So, same money, that benefit lots of leading customer, and also rack-scale plug-and-play that make customer time to online. So, we continue to gain more new customer. While our old customer continue to grow, started to grow faster with our beta offering. So, GB200 [indiscernible] right? GB200, each rack will be around 100 kilowatt. So, lots of customer like that. And we help them build their liquid cooling system and optimize their data center for liquid cooling. So, we are growing customer base strongly now.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Michael Ng: Hey, good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. I wanted to ask about gross margins. Strong gross margins for the quarter. I know you're guiding to a sequential decline in gross margins. If our math is right, I think that implies 13.5% to 14% gross margins for the June quarter -- sorry, for the June quarter. Is that the right way to think about gross margins on a go-forward basis? Do you still feel comfortable with the prior 14% to 17% long-term gross margins? And any comments just around AI server gross margins in general? And if there are any ancillary services and support that can help improve the margins on just the product sales? Thank you very much.
David Weigand: Yeah. So, our target is still 14% to 17%. If you look at our guide for Q2 -- I'm sorry, for Q3, we actually guided slightly down and we ended up slightly up. And so, it's very hard to guide exactly on the margins. There is a range, and in fact, I think the guide inside of -- inside the models last time was even more conservative. So, I would say, we build conservative -- we build conservatively and then seek to overachieve. So, I think, if you look at our guide for revenue and for OpEx, you'll be able to determine our guide there. But our target is definitely to stay in the 14% to 17% range.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Aaron Rakers: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I'll try and slip in two here, if I can. So, I guess, one of the just kind of housekeeping questions is a very significant increase in inventory this quarter. I know you said it came in towards the end of the quarter. How do we think about the trajectory of inventory as the supply comes on? Do you expect inventory to stay at this level? Do you expect it to start to come down? I'm just kind of curious to how we think that flow through kind of looks as you take on more supply? And then just a quick housekeeping thing too is that, the 21% customer you referenced in the prepared remarks, is that the same customer, large customer you had last quarter, or how has that evolved? Thank you.
Charles Liang: Two reasons we had to increase inventory. One is because Q4, I mean, June quarter, we will have a strong revenue growth. Second reason, because we're preparing for high volume liquid cooling. Again, we have more than 1,000 of 100 kilowatt liquid cooling rack we had to ship to customer in Q4. And liquid cooling, as you know, is pretty new. So, we had to prepare enough inventory, so that we can deliver liquid cooling rack-scale product to customer on time or with minimum lead time. So, both factor, indeed, is a positive factor though. With our economic of scale continue to grow, indeed, our inventory average day, indeed, will slightly improve.
David Weigand: Yeah. So, Aaron, my take on that is I hope that our inventory continues to grow because that means there's a reason behind it. So, it's -- and it's tied to sales. So, to your second question, the 21% customer was, the same as last quarter. And I want you to -- I wanted to let you know that, in the Q, we're going to be moving to customer A, customer B, customer C, because as we add more customers, we'll try to make it easier to make those distinguishments.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of George Wang with Barclays. Your line is now open.
George Wang: Hey, guys. Congrats on the strong June guide. I'd like to put in two parts. Quickly, just not asking for specific guidance for FY '25 or the September, December quarter, but any sort of high-level kind of color you can provide just to think about how to model the September, December and also the FY '25? And also kind of related, kind of can you parse out kind of utilization in the March quarter? And also kind of what's the expected utilization kind of cadence for the next few quarters?
Charles Liang: Yeah. As you know, we have a lot of new product coming soon, right, to support NVIDIA, H200, B100, B200, GB200, and AMD MI300 and Intel Gaudi2, Gaudi3. So, we have a lot of new product already, and plus, liquid cooling, DLC, we are ready to ship high volume product. So for sure, I mean, calendar -- I mean, fiscal year '25, I mean, for September, December quarter, we will be -- we will have a strong growth. And I believe this strong growth will continue for many quarter to come if not many years. I believe it will be many years.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is now open.
Ananda Baruah: Yeah. Thanks guys for taking the question. Really appreciate it. And Charles, let me maybe, the remarks you made a moment ago about the strong ongoing growth, does that -- could that mean that you could also grow sequentially from this point forward for a little bit, just given the market share gain opportunities, the components coming online that you talked about in the new products? Any context on the way to think about sequential growth sort of in the coming quarters would be helpful as well. Thanks.
Charles Liang: Yeah. As you know, traditionally, in last 10 years, right, I mean, September quarter and March quarter always our soft quarter. But now with AI demand growing so strong, so we basically are able to grow sequentially. So, although, March and September still a little bit weak, but, basically, because of strong AI growth and our market share growing, so the sequential growth will become normal. And, basically, I mean, we have even better technologies than before ever, and now economies of scale become much bigger. Malaysia campus, production will be ready by end of this calendar year. So, we see lots of positive factor to grow our business.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Jon Tanwanteng with CJS Securities. Your line is now open.
Jon Tanwanteng: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more to the gross margin and if you expect them to go structurally higher at some point in the near future, in the coming quarters. Especially if Malaysia ramps, you get economies of scale there as you transition to GPU products and you add more liquid cooling. Is there a point where that starts to revert higher? Or do you expect it to remain at a relatively constant level for the foreseeable future?
Charles Liang: Again, the AI platform is getting popular, right? So, there are more and more competitor as well. So, we will try to keep a balance. To grow market share, we may, sometimes, some deal, we may have to be a little bit more aggressive in pricing. But, overall, we try to keep a balance. David, you may add something.
David Weigand: Yeah. And also, I agree with your point that Malaysia will also offer some opportunity to us. And we're also at a transition time when there's a lot of new -- we have a lot of new platforms that are coming out and the customers are highly anticipating. And those platforms are built on some emerging technologies that from many different areas. And we -- Supermicro's strength again is its fast time to market, and we expect with these -- with the emerging technologies and our new platforms and our liquid cooling to be first out there with very compelling solutions. So, we think those things are all going to be helping our margins.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is now open.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes, thanks for taking the question. A couple for me. Regarding the channel customer, the 17% of the customer, have you ever had the channel customer that big? I believe in the past you've talked about the 21 -- 20%-plus customer, but I think this is new. Can you clarify this?
David Weigand: So, this is an existing customer and we actually had a higher customer back in 2022, Mehdi, but I think they were around [22%] (ph). But this is still a really good customer, really good opportunity.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay. Great. And then, one question for you David on the cash flow. Actually, there was a -- I believe there are two items. There is a $110 million of cash burn in operation and then there was also a non-current asset. Am I missing something here? These two items were big items that had an impact to overall cash flow. Is that correct?
David Weigand: Sure. We had a number of things that impacted us. I think in non-current assets, we had deferred taxes grew by quite a bit this year -- or this quarter, and so that was something unusual. And then, let's see, I think those are -- I think that's the only unusual item, was a deferred tax grew a lot and that's what lowered our tax rate -- our quarterly tax rate as well.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital. Your line is now open.
Nehal Chokshi: Thank you, and congrats on a strong guide here. Talk about the guide here, inventory increased $1.5 billion Q-over-Q, and David, as you mentioned, you like to see inventory increase. I do too, because it's a strong indicator of things to come. And you've guided June quarter to increase by $1.6 billion Q-over-Q. If I do this math where I'm looking at the inventory at the quarter-end and then the four-quarter revenue, typically, it's around 60% to 70% of revenue. But with your March Q ending inventory and your current June Q guidance, that equates to about 85% of projected revenue. So, can you just explain what seems to be a little bit more usual inventory buildup given the revenue guidance range?
David Weigand: Sure, absolutely. That's a fair question. So, we actually got a substantial amount of inventory in the last week of the quarter, okay, which obviously we're not going to be able to ship. But we took in $700 million in the last week of the quarter. So that's not something that -- that's something that has to do with when inventory arrives. And so, we -- it hurts our cash flow. But you know what? It doesn't matter, because we need that inventory for Q4 shipments.
Charles Liang: Yeah. Again, two reasons, right? Q4, we will have a strong revenue. So, we had to prepare with Q4. And, also, I mean, liquid cooling, I mean, it's new. So, we had to prepare enough safety inventory for liquid cooling demand for June quarter and September quarter as well. So that's another reason why we have a slightly higher inventory now.
David Weigand: Yeah. And I want to add, Nehal, that that's exactly why we did capital raises, too, is to prepare for these Q4 shipments, and so that we could make those large purchases and we hope to continue that.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Matt Bryson with Wedbush. Your line is now open.
Matt Bryson: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I would be thinking with liquid cooling ramping in fiscal Q4, and not to harp on the gross margin issue, but that you would be seeing a benefit to gross margins. And I guess my question is, is there any chance that either with the liquid cooling solutions or with your other solutions, that you're again seeing some penetration at those larger customers and specifically hyperscalers, and that's why we're seeing gross margins come down? And I guess just one clarification for Dave. If you can provide the magnitude that revenues were affected by your inability to procure components in fiscal Q3? Thanks.
Charles Liang: Let me add a little bit. Because liquid cooling is new to us, so to speed up quick support for some of our very important customer on June quarter, indeed, we had to pay some premium to speed up the supply. So, we spend a bunch of [indiscernible].
David Weigand: Yeah. So, the two questions, Matt, I would say, first of all, to the gross margin question, again, I try to give a -- my philosophy is, give a conservative [indiscernible] to beat that. And we were able to do that in Q3 and we'll do everything we can do it -- can do to beat it in Q4. But it'll depend also on what we ship. As to the magnitude of revenue, I'll go back to the fact that our backlog is at a record high. And so what that means is that every quarter we could have shipped more if we had more parts. And so therefore, it's an ongoing problem and we don't rely on that as an excuse. The fact of the matter is, we're glad to be able to produce the products that we're producing for some of the best companies in the world. And so, we continue -- we will continue to do that and we're very upbeat by the fact that the supply chain continues to improve each quarter.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is a follow-up from Jon Tanwanteng with CJS Securities. Your line is now open.
Jon Tanwanteng: Hi, thanks for the follow-up. I was wondering if you could speak to your cash usage expectations over the next quarter or two. Are the proceeds from your recent capital raises all spoken for, as you look to the growth in the pipeline and record backlog you spoke to, or do you think that's more in reserve for growth further down the line?
David Weigand: Yeah. So, the way I would answer that is that, I hope that I have -- that I need more capital, Jon, because that means that we're booking -- that we're growing revenues even faster. So, we've got capital adequate to get us through the current market, which means today. But in a week, that -- we hope that that changes, and we hope that we've got orders that require even more capital. So, all I can say is I hope that -- I'm hoping for the needs for more capital.
Charles Liang: Yeah. We believe our revenue will continue to grow strong, and that's why we need more capital to grow faster. If we grow 20%, 30%, we may have enough capital now. But if we grow much faster, then for sure, we need more capital to grow stronger.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question today is a follow-up from the line of Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital. Your line is now open.
Nehal Chokshi: Hey, thanks. Thanks for the follow-up question. This is for Charles. Charles, with the capital base that you have now -- and I hear you, Dave, that you hope that you will need more capital. But with the capital base that you have now, technology advantage that you've always had that you've added to, is there anything else that you need in order to become the number one server vendor?
Charles Liang: Yes. Indeed, our plan is very ambitious. Let me use that word. We have a very ambitious brand, so we try to continue grow very strong, kind of 3 times to 5 times faster than our industry's average. So, when that case happen, and we believe so, we hope so, then for sure we need more capital.
Operator: Thank you.
Charles Liang: Thank you. I'll see you in next quarter.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. Have an excellent rest of your day.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-01-29 17:00:00) =====

Charles Liang: Thank you, Michael and good afternoon everyone. I'm delighted to share our second quarter results, which show a record-breaking performance for Super Micro. We achieved revenue of $3.66 billion, a 133% increase from last year, and earnings per share of $5.59. This is our first quarter ever with over $3 billion revenue. More importantly, this single quarter's revenue surpassed our annual revenue for 2021. This fantastic quarterly result was driven by strong demand and improving supply conditions for GPU and related key system components. Our rack-scale plug-and-play IT and AI Total Solution continues to gain more new customers, along with their confidence in Super Micro as their go-to infrastructure partner. Our AI rack-scale solutions, especially the Deep-Learning and LLM-optimized based on NVIDIA HGX-H100, continue gaining high popularity. The demand for AI inferencing systems and mainstream compute solutions has also started to grow. The exciting news is that, finally, we are entering an accelerating demand phase now from many more customer wins. To support faster growth, we have increased our working capital recently by raising about $600 million with an equity offering. Moreover, we have other programs to increase our cashflow without additional equity dilution to support short and long-term sustainable growth. Overall, I feel very confident that this AI boom will continue for another many quarters, if not many years. And together with the related inferencing and other computing eco system requirements, demand can last for even many decades to come, we may call this an AI revolution. Let’s go over some key financial highlights. First, fiscal Q2 net revenue totaled $3.66 billion, up 103% year-on-year and up 73% quarter-on-quarter, exceeding the top end of our original guidance of $2.9 billion for December quarter. Second. Fiscal Q2 non-GAAP earnings of $5.59 per share were well above $3.26 a year ago and exceeded the guidance range of $4.40 to $4.88, further demonstrating continued strong operating leverage. Economy of scale is important to us for continue strong growth. Supermicro is at the forefront of the AI revolution, where the pace of innovation is accelerating. We are leading the race by developing the most innovative AI infrastructure on many platforms at rack scale, for almost any industry, and for any market vertical. As the market leader, we have been preparing to more than double the size of our current AI portfolio with the coming soon NVIDIA CG1, CG2 Grace Hopper Superchip, H200 and B100 CPUs -- GPUs, L40S Inferencing-optimized GPUs, AMD MI300X/MI300A, and Intel’s Gaudi 2 and Gaudi 3. All these new platforms will be ready for high volume production in the coming month and quarters. Moreover, we are adding further optimized new architectures for the upcoming NVIDIA GPU product lines. Our AMD MI300X systems are sampling now, and our Intel Gaudi 3 system is coming soon. More importantly, we are continuing to invest and innovate in datacenter and enterprise liquid-cooling technology to make sure these high-power AI platforms are in line with our green computing methodology, while improving the performance, efficiency, and reliability of systems in a datacenter. As a Total IT Solutions innovator, manufacturer and provider, more and more of the major deployments is being delivered as an integrated rack solution, particularly for the AI cluster deployments. Servers, networking, storage, security features, and software are optimized, validated, delivered, and serviced as an integrated rack cluster from Supermicro’s manufacturing facilities worldwide. Leveraging our building block architecture and operation/production automation systems, we can deliver optimized rack solutions with time-to-market and quality advantages for our customers more efficiently than competition. Our TTD, Time-to-Delivery factor has been in a continuous improvement. By this June quarter, we will have high volume, dedicated capacity for manufacturing 100 kilowatt to 120 kilowatt racks with liquid-cooling capabilities, providing DLC, direct liquid cooling racks capacity up to 1,500 racks per month and our total rack production capacity will be up to 5,000 racks per month by then. At the same time, our volume -- high volume clean room rack-scale production facility will be ready to service critical customers very soon. The rapid growth of our business is driving the need for additional R&D, solution optimization, manufacturing and service capacity. Today, our production utilization rate is about 65% across our USA, Netherlands and Taiwan facilities, and they are quickly filling. To address this immediate capacity challenge, we are adding two new production facilities and warehouses near our Silicon Valley headquarter, which will be operating in a few months. The new Malaysia facility will focus on expanding our building blocks with lower costs and increased volume, while other new facility will support our annual revenue capacity above $25 billion. To summarize, our record quarterly performance demonstrates our Building Block rack scale plug-and-play IT and AI industry leadership, which continues to accelerate and shows signs of strong market share gains. The continued strength of existing customer builds and ramp of newly acquired customers, and the robust pipeline of new products coming in 2024 gives me confidence that fiscal Q3 revenue will be in the range of $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion. Additionally, we are expecting continued strength for the second half of fiscal 2024, and now forecast revenue for the full fiscal year ending in June to be in the range of $14.3 billion to $14.7 billion. We are in overdrive to accelerate Supermicro 3.0 business model with this AI boom. At the meantime, we are preparing ourselves for the next phase of Supermicro business growth with Supermicro 4.0 and its expanding TAM. Now is certainly the most exciting time yet for Supermicro. Before passing the call to David Weigand, our Chief Financial Officer, I want to thank again to our partners, our customers, our Supermicro employees and our shareholders for your strong support. Now, let me pass to our CFO David, for more financial details.
David Weigand: Thank you, Charles. Fiscal Q2 2024 revenues were $3.66 billion, up 103% year-over-year and up 73% quarter-over-quarter. Revenues were higher than our initial guidance of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion and slightly above our recently updated guidance of $3.6 billion to $3.65 billion. Our growth was driven by demand from new and existing customers for our leading AI and rack-scale Total IT solutions and an improving supply chain. Next generation AI and CPU platforms continue to drive strong levels of design wins, orders and backlog from top-tier data centers, emerging cloud service providers, enterprise/channel, and edge/IoT/telco customers. During Q2, we recorded $1.48 billion in the enterprise/channel vertical, representing 40% of revenues versus 43% last quarter, up -- this was up 55% year-over-year and up 62% quarter-over-quarter, driven by enterprise AI and CPU upgrade programs. The OEM appliance and large data center vertical revenues were $2.15 billion, representing 59% of Q1 revenues versus 55% last quarter, up 175% year-over-year and up 83% quarter-over-quarter. Two existing CSP/large data center customers represented 26% and 11% of total revenues for Q2. Emerging 5G, Telco, Edge, IoT revenues were $35 million or 1% of Q2 revenues. Growth was driven by AI/GPU and rack-scale total IT solutions, which again represented over 50% of total revenues this quarter with AI/GPU revenues in both the enterprise/channel and the OEM appliance/large data center verticals. Server and Storage Systems comprised 94% of Q2 revenue and Subsystems and Accessories represented 6%. ASPs increased on a year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter basis, driven by product and customer mix. By geography, the US represented 71% of Q2 revenues, Asia 18%, Europe 8%, and rest of the world 3%. On a year-over-year basis, US revenues increased 139%, Asia increased 98%, Europe decreased 8%, and rest of the world increased 67%. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, US revenues increased 61%, Asia increased 191%, Europe increased 51%, and rest of the world increased 37%. The Q2 non-GAAP gross margin was 15.5%, which was down quarter-over-quarter from 17% as we continued to focus on winning strategic new designs and gaining market share. Turning to operating expenses, Q2 OpEx on a GAAP basis increased by 6% quarter-over-quarter and 58% year-over-year to $193 million, driven by higher compensation expenses and headcount. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses increased 18% quarter-over-quarter and 41% year-over-year to $153 million. Q2 non-GAAP operating margin was 11.3% versus 10.8% last quarter as we benefited from operating leverage driven by higher revenues. Other Income and Expense for Q2 was a net expense of approximately $16 million, consisting of $8 million in interest expense and a loss of $8 million principally from foreign exchange. Interest expense increased sequentially as we drew down on short-term bank credit facilities for working capital during the quarter. The tax provision for Q2 was $61.5 million on a GAAP basis and $71.1 million on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP tax rate for Q2 was 17.3% and the non-GAAP tax rate was 17.8%. Q2 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $5.59 exceeded the high end of our initial guidance of $4.40 to $4.88 and slightly above our recently updated guidance of $5.40 to $5.55 due to operating leverage. Cash flow used in operations for Q2 was $595 million compared to cash flow generated by operations of $271 million during the previous quarter. Strong profitability and higher level of accounts payable was offset by higher inventory and accounts receivable due to build plans for Q3 and the timing of shipments during Q2. CapEx was $15 million for Q2 resulting in negative free cash flow of $610 million versus positive free cash flow of $268 million last Quarter. During the quarter, we executed an equity offering and raised approximately $583 million in net proceeds after underwriting discounts and other issuance costs from the sale of 2.3 million shares at a price of $262 per share. The proceeds will be used to strengthen our working capital, enable continued investments in R&D and expand global capacity to fulfill strong demand for our leading platforms. The closing balance sheet cash position was $726 million, while bank debt was $376 million resulting in a net cash position of $350 million versus a net cash position of $397 million last quarter. Turning to the balance sheet and working capital metrics compared to last quarter, the Q2 cash conversion cycle was 61 days versus 86 days in Q1. Days of Inventory decreased by 24 days to 67 days versus the prior quarter of 91 days due to the timing of shipments during the quarter. Days sales outstanding was down by 14 days quarter-over-quarter to 29 days while days payables outstanding decreased by 13 days to 35 days. Now, turning to the outlook, we expect a strong March quarter as we continue to gain momentum with new and existing customers for our AI and rack-scale total IT solutions. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024 ending March 31, 2024, we expect net sales in the range of $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion, GAAP diluted net income per share of $4.79 to $5.64 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $5.20 to $6.01. We expect gross margins to be slightly lower than Q2 levels. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $201 million and include $39 million in stock-based compensation expenses that are not included in non-GAAP operating expenses. The outlook for Q3 of fiscal year 2024 diluted GAAP EPS includes approximately $28 million in expected stock-based compensation expenses, net of tax effects of $14 million, which are excluded from non-GAAP diluted net income per common share. We expect other income and expenses, including interest expense, to be a net expense of approximately $9 million. The company's projections for Q3 GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per common share assume a GAAP tax rate of 13.8%, a non-GAAP tax rate of 15.8%, and a fully diluted share count of 60.1 million for GAAP and 61.0 million for non-GAAP. We expect CapEx for Q3 to be in the range of $18 million to $21 million and a range of $105 million to $115 million for the fiscal year 2024. For the fiscal year 2024 ending June 30, 2024, we are raising our guidance for revenues from a range of $10 billion to $11 billion to a range of $14.3 billion to $14.7 billion. Michael, we're now ready for Q&A
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. It's also been asked to keep yourself to one question with one follow-up question. We'll pause here briefly as questions are registered. Our first question is from George Wang with Barclays. Your line is now open.
George Wang: Hey guys, congrats on the quarter on a strong guide. I have two questions. Firstly, can you kind of supply versus demand, obviously for the December quarter probably driven by both including supply and also strong demand. So, if you can maybe you can talk about backlog level and also on the supply side, are they still ongoing constraints right now?
Charles Liang: Yeah, thank you for the question. Indeed, the demand is still stronger than supply. So, we have a more supply, we would be able to ship more and we are very happy to continue and grow our capacity, work out betas, even higher support so to grow business even quicker.
George Wang: Okay, thank you. And quickly a follow-up just on the liquid cooling. You talked about kind of expanding to 1,500 racks per month after June this year, and maybe you can talk about your expectation for the total production mix from liquid-cooled racks by year-end, and also maybe you can parse out kind of difference, the configure within the liquid cooling. I know you guys have some immersion cooling and air to liquid cooling. So maybe you can double-click on this thematic topic going forward.
Charles Liang: Yeah. Thank you George for the question. In the liquid cooling, we are beating the industry. So, we have a huge capacity ready and have very mature total solution ready, but lots of customer, already rack liquid cooling by their data center, needed some more time to be to ready. I mean their infrastructure needed some more time. So, we believe -- I think liquid cooling will be the trend and we continue to make ourselves ready and try our best to support the customer, including providing some help to their data center infrastructure. So, I believe liquid cooling percentage will continue to grow, but at this moment most of the shipping is still air cooled.
George Wang: Okay great, thank you. I'll go back to the queue.
Charles Liang: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.
Samik Chatterjee: Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the strong results here. Maybe, if I can just start with the gross margin. You did have a step-down here in 2Q, you're guiding to a slight moderation in 3Q. Maybe just help me understand, as a management team, how do you think about balancing the opportunities that you've going forward in terms of market-share wins and design-wins relative to sort of big growing profitably over the long-run, how you sort of evaluating those opportunities side-by-side and then I have a follow-up. Thank you.
David Weigand: Sure, thanks, Samik. So, when we win a new customer, we always try to go in and out. And so we go into the organization and try to spread out into the different divisions. And so, in order to do that as we take on new customers, we do evaluate and try to win the business, which requires us to be competitive. And so, we always are balancing in the interest of shareholder value, how to maximize that. And so, at this time we are we are growing really quickly. And in order to do that and in order to take market share, we will take opportunities by being more competitive on pricing.
Charles Liang: The good thing is that when we continue to grow our economies of scale, our operation margin indeed will be still able to keep in healthy position.
Samik Chatterjee: Got it. And then just this more near-term question when I look at the revenue guide for 3Q and 4Q. Is a step-up here in revenue of about sort of call it $0.5 billion a bit less going from 2Q to 3Q. And then a bigger step-up to get to the mid-point to be annual guide into 4Q, how much of that is driven by just being a bit more cautious about when supply comes in and pushing that the revenue guide a bit more to the 4Q or is that really what the visibility currently of supply of just trying to get sort of what's driving the cadence from 2Q to 3Q to 4Q. And the guide that you provided. Thank you.
David Weigand: Yeah, so Samik, we have a very large and growing backlog, which grew again this quarter. And so really as Charles mentioned earlier, our only constraint is supply. However, the good news is, supply is improving. And so to your point, we have to be somewhat conservative, because we are constrained still by supply.
Samik Chatterjee: Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: Our next question is from Nehal Chokshi with Northland. Your line is now open.
Nehal Chokshi: Yeah, thanks. Great impressive guidance and thanks for explanation regarding the dynamic on the forward guidance for both March quarter, plus the June Q guide. Looking at the incremental revenue for the December quarter. Dave, you already alluded to this, you're making shareholder accretive decision. So, that's what's driving the tick down in the gross margin, yet, your operating margin has improved, Q-over-Q. So just to be clear, when you're talking about making shareholder accretive decision, it's still with respect to current revenue not just simply looking at future free cash flows associated with future revenue follow-on from these lower-margin opportunities, is that correct?
David Weigand: It's really about trying to return the most shareholder value. So back to your point, we know that with -- because of our tight control over operating expenses, if we get more volume from a large customer, we're going to be able to bring more EPS to our shareholders. So that's really the -- it's really the decision to partner with a really good customer.
Nehal Chokshi: Got it. Okay. And then did you review the 10% revenue customers for the quarter?
David Weigand: We did, where we said we had two, one 25 and one 11, both in the CSP large data center vertical.
Nehal Chokshi: Great, thank you for taking my question. I'll get back in the queue.
Operator: Our next question is from Jon Tanwanteng with CJS Securities. Your line is now open.
Jon Tanwanteng: Hey, good afternoon, and thank you for taking my questions. And really, congratulations on the fantastic growth. Charles, my first question is for you. I was wondering what gives you the confidence in the growth beyond this year. You mentioned -- inferenced the ecosystem potentially years and decades of demand. Where is the visibility to coming from, what are you seeing in your backlog and your order books and in conversations with customers that gives you that confidence?
Charles Liang: Yeah, thank you for the question. Yes, I mean, other than generative deep learning segment continue to grow very strong. Our inferencing opportunity in general CPU customer base also growing. So with AI continuing to be more popular, indeed, so many vertical around the world need more inferencing solutions as well, including private cloud, private kind of data center and [indiscernible]. So, we are approaching continue to grow in [indiscernible] of direction and we see positive feedback, a convincing feedback.
Jon Tanwanteng: Got it, and to ask one of the questions that's been mentioned in a different way, is there a gross margin floor as you pursue this share gain. And when do you see a possible inflection? I'm just wondering what is the limit. When you go in terms of gaining share versus the margin that you generate?
David Weigand: Sure, so we set out a target back in March of 2021 of 14% to 17%. But that's and we've actually done pretty well against that target. But one thing I'll say is that we have a lot of -- there's a lot of initiatives that play into our favor. Number one, we're doing a lot in terms of expansion to lower our cost envelope. Number two, we are -- our advantage is our building block solutions and what that means is, we're the fastest to market because of the way that we have architected our products. So what that means is there's a lot of new technologies that are coming out from many different technology providers. And we expect to again, as we work with AI, be first-to-market with those. And that first-to-market advantage helps us -- helps to differentiate ourselves as we come out with a complete set of solutions. So, we think that's another thing that will that is always going to play to Super Micro's advantage.
Charles Liang: Yeah, especially we have so broad building block proud solution. So, economical scale will help our building block solution to be more efficient because there's lot of product in our volume were still in the middle size to small size volume and we [indiscernible] and will continue to be aggressive to grow to see every segment, every vertical, we have ALC, economies of scale.
Jon Tanwanteng: Okay great, thank you. I will turn back in the queue.
Operator: Our next question is from Quinn Bolton with Needham. Your line is now open.
Quinn Bolton: Thanks for taking my question. I mean congratulations on the very strong results. I guess I wanted to ask a gross margin question too, obviously it's moderated here in the current quarter and the forward quarter. As you guys position yourself to further market-share gains. I guess my question is, what sort of the midpoint of that 14% to 17% level that you set back in 2021, is that sort of the right level to be thinking about as you guys stay aggressive and try to drive market-share gains? And maybe -- sorry about the twist in the question, to the extent that. Supply catches up to demand and growth rates slow, would you then start to focus more perhaps on higher-margin business, just any sort of thoughts, wherein that 14% to 17% range margin may trend over the next year or two would be helpful?
David Weigand: Yeah, for sure I'll -- most important principle is why would a base go for shareholder for our company. So, although we said of 14% to 17% as in that range in 2021, but if any change, any further adjustments would be the pace of a shareholder. We went to that change. And we are carefully evaluating that range kind of monthly.
Quinn Bolton: Okay, got it and then as Charles said, question on liquid cooling. Just as you look forward, you guys are ready, it sounds like the infrastructure may still need some improvements, but I guess as you look at data center customers CSPs that are looking to deploy liquid cooling. Is that sort of does that include current-generation sort of 700-watt, GPUs are, is it really the next generation, the B100s and sort of the 1,000 watt GPU class that really drives the adoption at your CSP customers, drives that need for liquid cooling.
Charles Liang: You are right. In these current 600 watt, 700, watt module, people can still take care very well, we say air conditioning. And that's why people still are comfortable with our traditional air cooler. But when that system grows to 1,000 or even 1,000 watt per module, yes. I mean -- I think cooling becomes even much more critical. So, by that time, I believe. Most of the data center will have facility ready for that. So we are very optimistic and very patient to continue to improve our quality, especially that reliability and easy for maintenance. So when customers are ready, we can dwell quickly to support them.
Quinn Bolton: Excellent. Thank you.
David Weigand: Thank you for the question.
Operator: Our next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Aaron Rakers: Yeah, thanks for taking the questions and also great results. Just curious, when you talk about your customer concentration and the diversity of the business, when you talk about 26% and 11% of your revenue coming from two customers, are those the same customers, like last quarter I think you had a customer that was 25%, or are you seeing these customers kind of bounce around. I guess the simple question is just, is that the same customer 26% and 25%?
David Weigand: So, Aaron. The 26% customer is the same customer. But the 11% customer is not a new customer, and it's a longer-term customer. But first time in 11% and to your point, yes, we do see a bouncing in and out, and we're very happy. Anytime they do bounce about by the way.
Charles Liang: Yeah, and that's why the economies of scale is very important to us when we further grow our total revenue, we will have a more large scale customer and more middle-sized and small-sized customers as well.
Aaron Rakers: Yeah, and then as a quick follow-up, I'm just curious as we look at the AI kind of evolution from here. There's a lot more kind of product diversity itself coming out, B100s, GH-200s. AMD's product lineup. As you think about the growth going forward, would you say that the growth is more ASP expansion driven, as we think about these next-generation platforms for this diversity driving more of the growth being driven by unit volume growth? I'm just curious on how you would kind of characterize the growth driver from here going forward on those two Inputs.
David Weigand: I guess in the next few years, our growth will be quicker in terms of unit number. So that volume growth will be quicker than ASP, because last two years, our ASP have been growing a lot, right. So, in next day, but I guess unit number, volume will grow faster.
Aaron Rakers: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is now open.
Ananda Baruah: Yeah, good afternoon guys. And thanks for taking the question. Appreciate it. Congrats on the really solid execution. Yeah, congrats on that. I guess, two if I could, Charles. And maybe a clarification, I did some math on the 15,000 racks per month. And they came up with -- I guess $5.6 billion a quarter, let's call it 5.5%. I guess, plus or minus but that came to $5.6 billion, is that kind of accurate and I guess the question is -- if it stood at midyear, you're talking about getting to that point. Is that the kind of run-rate opportunity that we can be thinking about quarterly and not like a guidance, but like an opportunity when you get into sort of the back half of the calendar year. Just wanted to make sure that we're interpreting that kind of accurately and then I have a quick follow-up. Thanks.
Charles Liang: Yeah, again, we see, we recommend green computing everywhere. That's why wherever, whenever we can help a customer at base, we will. That's why we have been building really large-scale capacity for liquid cooling and other green computing solutions. So yes, that capacity will be huge, but its capacity there, when customer need, we are ready. And indeed our facility also very flexible. Lots of facility can support liquid cooling and air cooler, or combination cooling. So yes, we have a huge capacity ready for growth, but not necessarily all for liquid cooling, they support air cooler or combination hybrid cooling as well.
Ananda Baruah: Awesome. Thanks for that. And then could you just, I guess the follow-up is, you guys have mentioned a couple of times on the call today, sort new customers as part of -- and I think Charles, your words were accelerated growth. And so any complexion, I guess any -- sort of any context on the new customers that you guys are wrapping into run-rate kind of would be useful. Anything about them, like what kind of industries, I guess like sort of industries, projects, anything like that would be helpful. Thanks.
Charles Liang: Yeah, thank you, I mean, we spend a lot of effort to make our sales and operational process, service process be automatic. So, those automation systems for sales, for production, for support, really enlarge our capacity. And that's why we have capacity to approach to support a more customer now. So -- and we need economies of scale, because economies of scale is very important to our operation margin and overall EPS. So, yes, we are ready to grow much quicker EBIT.
Ananda Baruah: Yeah, that's super helpful. Okay guys, thanks a lot. Congratulations.
Charles Liang: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Jon Tanwanteng with CJS Securities. Your line is now open.
Jon Tanwanteng: Hi, thank you for the follow-up. I was just wondering if there is any change to your OpEx growth formula. It's been on a trailing basis, less than half of our revenue growth is as you grow bigger and do you expect to run against any limit in supporting such a large customer base and potential customer base or are you getting more economies of scale as you grow larger with that?
Charles Liang: Yeah, indeed we had been some low-volume company for too long, a 30 years old company. So our volumes just started to grow in kind of good economical scale just recently. And we like to take this chance to continue and grow our economies of scale. So when our economies of scale grow, we leverage automation system again for sales, for operation, and for service. And that's why, I mean, we are in good position to continue growing quickly.
Jon Tanwanteng: Okay, great. And then I was just wondering at the rate of growth that you're seeing, do you expect to need more external financing? I know you talked about other sources of cash, I was wondering, if you are going into the debt markets, what the plans are to finance this growth.
Charles Liang: Yeah, our financial team have been very diligently working now more source, especially try to minimize dilute the stock equity. So we have a [indiscernible] program kind of we're steady and ready there. So when we need more capital, we are ready. David, you may add something.
David Weigand: Yeah, so I'll just echo what Charles said, we're looking at a number of different things, Jon, and we -- but we are mindful of not having further dilution, as Charles said. So, we're -- but we're looking at a number of different opportunities. And the reason we have to is because we need more working capital for growth. And the reason that our cash flows were not -- did not -- were not as strong as last quarter was simply because we grew by so much. So if you -- when you grow by over $1 billion dollars in quarter, you've got to have additional working capital. So that's the plain and simple fact.
Charles Liang: Our inventory had been growing more than $1 billion.
David Weigand: Yes.
Charles Liang: And we are continuing to grow.
Jon Tanwanteng: Got it, thank you very much.
Operator: Our last question will be from Nehal Chokshi with Northland. Your line is now open.
Nehal Chokshi: Yeah, great, thanks for the follow-up question. And I actually have two follow-up questions. First, at the September quarter earnings call I think you guys said the capacity was around $18 billion, that's up from $15 billion to June 2023 quarter. What's the driver of that actually increased capacity or increased ASPs. And then, in relation to that, your full-year guidance that implies a June Q guidance of around $4.7 billion, that implies that your annualized capacity is reaching $19 billion. And so as your capacity is increasing. Is this largely a mix-driven like-for-like ASP driven or how has your capacity actually gone up prior to Malaysia coming online?
Charles Liang: Yeah. I mean our ASP gradually continued to grow while that unit number will grow much faster from now on now I guess. So that's why we need more capacity.
David Weigand: And one thing I'll add Nehal is that in December, we shipped over $1.7 billion -- $1.8 billion. And so that alone establishes a $19 billion capability.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. And then my other question is that typically going into the March quarter revenue is seasonally down Q-o-Q, guiding to be up Q-o-Q. Usually when the revenue is down seasonally quarter-on-quarter, your cash conversion cycle goes on a Q-o-Q basis, this March quarter because you're projecting a Q-o-Q revenue increase, does that change your expectations on cash conversion cycle seasonality dynamics?
Charles Liang: Well. Yeah, because of the demand, it is very strong. So we believe this March quarter will be a strong quarter as well. David, is there anything to add to that?
David Weigand: Yeah, so it really comes down, Nehal to timing. When we receive inventory and when we ship out, so as I mentioned in the December quarter, you can have big activity even within a month, within the quarter, and so that will affect your metrics.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay, I'm talking about the December quarter, your cash conversion cycle was actually a lot better than what we had expected. And yes, I recognize there consumption of cash, but it was at least a lot better than what we had expected. Was that actually better than what you had expected given the significant revenue upside that you had delivered here.
David Weigand: It absolutely was, yeah. Yeah, we had some that some customer prepayments and things which helped us out.
Charles Liang: Yeah, also when economies of scale [Multiple Speakers] grow, we can more efficiently leverage our inventory as well.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay, great. Congrats guys. Thank you.
Operator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation, you may now disconnect your line.

At the end of today’s prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session for sell-side analysts to ask questions. I will now turn the call over to Charles.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I am pleased to announce that we are off to a good start for fiscal 2024, with first quarter revenues of $2.12 billion. We navigated tight AI GPU and key components supply conditions to deliver total solutions and large compute clusters, especially for generative AI workloads where our backorders continue to expand faster than our forecast. During the first quarter, demand for our leading AI platforms in plug-and-play rack-scale, especially for the LLM-optimized NVIDIA HGX-H100 solutions, was the primary growth driver. Many customers have started to request direct-attached cold-plate liquid-cooling solutions to address the energy costs, power grid constraints and thermal challenges of these new GPU infrastructures. In some cases, customers are able to double their datacenter AI computing capacity using our DLC solution due to lower system power requirements, lower PUE and higher computing density per cluster. To meet this strong demand, we have been continuously expanding our validation and production facilities. By the coming March quarter, we expect to complete a dedicated capacity for manufacturing 100 kilowatt racks with liquid-cooling capabilities, that will further expand our total rack production capacity to 5,000 racks per month in full-speed mass production. The increased AI business also includes our new inferencing platforms and telco-optimized edge products based on the L40S, L40 and L4 and for sure H100 as well, AI product lines. Furthermore, the upcoming Grace Hopper Superchip-based MGX products for both generative AI and inferencing AI are just ready for volume production. Our broadest AI solution portfolio also includes Intel Gaudi 2, PCIe Flex, PVC a codename from the backyard [ph], as well as AMD MI250 and MI300X and MI300A based platforms. We fully expect many of these products to gain broad adoption and expand our share in the accelerated compute market. Let’s go over some key financial highlights. Fiscal Q1 net revenue totaled $2.12 billion, up 14% year-on-year and down 3% quarter-on-quarter, towards the high end of our guidance range of $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion despite the GPU and key component shortages during our traditionally soft September quarter. Fiscal Q1 non-GAAP earnings of $3.43 per share were in line with $3.42 a year ago and towards the high end of our guidance range of $2.75 to $3.50, demonstrating continued strong operating leverage during a traditional soft quarter. We launched and are delivering end-to-end Liquid-Cooled Data Center Solutions. We foresee up to 20% of our data center deployments will move to liquid-cooling and for the first time, customers can get a complete rack scale liquid-cooling solution from a single source with a maximum lead time of -- with minimum lead time of about two weeks. Super Micro is working hard to fully take the current AI growth opportunity by speeding up the development of more new AI optimized platforms. Super Micro is utilizing its Building Block Architecture to continue our first to market DNA with the launch of NVIDIA CG1, CG2 Grace Hopper Superchip and NVIDIA Grace CPU Superchip as we speak. Super Micro’s latest MGX systems provide groundbreaking computing densities, energy efficiency and ease of datacenter deployment and serviceability, ideal for hyperscale and edge data centers. I believe this ongoing AI revolution will impact all industries and the world, possibly much more impactful than the Industrial revolution over 200 years ago. As most people know, the power consumption and thermal challenges of these new AI technologies have risen dramatically. We are now shipping up to 80 kilowatt rack solutions, with 100 kilowatt rack just around the corner, for compute-intensive datacenter, CSP and other industries. Our high power efficiency systems, free-air and liquid-cooling expertise has become one of our key differentiators of success. I anticipate that up to 20% or more of global datacenters will transition to liquid-cooled solutions in just a few years. In addition, the combination of increasing computing density, reducing TCO and liquid-cooling reduces the environmental impact of datacenters significantly. This is well-aligned with Super Micro’s green computing mission as we improve datacenter performance-per-watt, per square foot and per dollar. To better support traditional datacenter, enterprise and IoT, telco industry, we have begun the seeding and early ship of the upcoming fifth generation Intel Xeon processor, codenamed Emerald Rapids and shipping fourth generation AMD EPYC processor, codenamed Genoa and Bergamo SP5 and SP6 with more computing cores, PCIe Gen 5, CXL and many other workload-optimized features. For customers that want to test drive these latest systems, we offer our JumpStart program with remote access to our high-end X13, H13 and GPU systems for qualified customer’s workload validation, testing and benchmarking before volume deployments. As the performance of CPU, GPU and memory technologies increase, enhancing storage performance is also necessary to feed massive datasets to the applications without becoming a bottleneck that slows the entire system or cluster down. Super Micro’s new PCIe Gen 5 based E1.S and E3.S Petascale All-Flash storage servers offer industry-leading storage performance and capacity. Together, with our U.2 NVMe, top-loaded system and traditional storage platforms, we are fulfilling customer’s AI, compute and storage needs with one-stop total solution shopping experience. Super Micro’s Total IT Solutions is being recognized as saving customers from the complications of design, validation, sourcing, integration and onsite deployment. We are also streamlining their network switching, firmware and software management challenges, topping it off with our 24x7 Global deployment and service tiers. Essentially, our customers are now incorporating our capabilities into their long-term infrastructure plans, entrusting Super Micro provides them with fully optimized solutions and with scale capacity to fit their long-term needs. Given our current customers infrastructure demands, we have continued to evaluate our footprint beyond our ongoing expansion in Malaysia. We are adding several new buildings close to our Silicon Valley HQ campus and on track to surpass our current capacity of 4000 racks per month. Today, with utilization rate at about 60%, our U.S. headquarter and Taiwan facility can easily support at least $18 billion in revenue. The new Malaysia facility will serve building blocks with high volume scale and improved cost structure, while pushing our total revenue capacity to a much higher scale than $20 billion. We are also continuing to work with some of our key partners and are deep in the planning process of adding a new manufacturing campus in North America, outside of California focused. We have just celebrated our 30th anniversary in September. For the past 30 years, we have been working tirelessly towards gaining industry leadership position with a best-in-class product portfolio, global scale capability and capacity, and the best time to market, distinguishing ourselves from the competition. Our IT industry leadership position will be even stronger in the near future. The pipeline of new products in the coming quarters has never been stronger. We are gaining market momentum that I expect to build deep into 2024, giving me confidence that fiscal Q2 revenue will be in the range of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion. Additionally, we are expecting continued strength for the second half of fiscal year 2024 and now forecast revenue in the range of $10 billion to $11 billion. Our position as a leading supplier of rack-scale plug-and-play Total AI and IT Solutions has just begun. Our growth will accelerate as we deliver more optimized AI infrastructure to existing and emerging markets, along with our growing software and services value. I also look forward to providing more updates on our product lines in the coming quarters that will continue to extend our datacenter technology leadership for years to come. With that in mind, I expect our $20 billion annual revenue target to be just a couple of years away. Before passing the call to David Weigand, our CFO, I want to take this chance to thank to our partners, our customers, our Super Micro employees and our shareholders for your continued support. Thank you. David?
David Weigand: Thank you, Charles. Fiscal Q1 2024 revenues were $2.12 billion, up 14% year-over-year and down 3% quarter-over-quarter. Revenues were towards the end of our guidance range -- the upper end of our guidance range of $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion, driven by AI-related platforms despite supply-chain challenges and summer seasonality. Next generation AI and CPU platforms continue to drive strong levels of design wins, orders and backlog. We expect diversified growth in fiscal 2024, driven by top-tier datacenters, emerging CSPs, enterprise investments in new AI, CPU servers and edge, IOT, telco markets. We are also enhancing our offerings in Storage, Switches, Software and Services to strengthen our Total Solutions offerings. During Q1, we recorded $917 million in the Enterprise and Channel vertical, representing 43% of revenues versus 45% last quarter. This was up 10% year-over-year and down 6% quarter-over-quarter due to seasonally lower enterprise spending as customers focus on AI investments. The OEM appliance and large datacenter vertical revenues were $1.17 billion, representing 55% of Q1 revenues versus 53% last quarter. This was up 26% year-over-year and flat quarter-over-quarter. One existing CSP large datacenter customer represented 25% of total revenues for Q1. Our emerging 5G, telco, edge, IoT segment revenues were $31 million, which represented 2% of Q1 revenues. AI, GPU and rack-scale solutions again represented over 50% of our total revenues this quarter with AI, GPU revenues in both the enterprise channel and the OEM appliance and large data center verticals. The mix of complete systems, storage and rack-scale Total IT Solutions has increased over the last two years. Server and Storage Systems comprised 93% of Q1 revenue and Subsystems and Accessories represented 7%. ASPs increased significantly on a year-over-year basis and decreased slightly quarter-over-quarter driven by product and customer mix. By geography, U.S. represented 76% of Q1 revenues, Asia 11%, Europe 9% and Rest of World 4%. On a year-over-year basis, U.S. revenues increased 25%, Asia decreased 17%, Europe decreased 19% and Rest of World increased 63%. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, U.S. revenues decreased 3%, Asia decreased 4%, Europe decreased 16% and Rest of World increased 38%. The Q1 non-GAAP gross margin was 17%, down slightly quarter-over-quarter from 17.1%. We continue to focus on winning strategic new designs and gaining market share. Turning to operating expenses, Q1 OpEx on a GAAP basis increased by 25% quarter-over-quarter and 42% year-over-year to $181 million driven by higher stock-based compensation expenses and headcount. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses decreased 3% quarter-over-quarter and increased 11% year-over-year to $130 million. Our Q1 non-GAAP operating margin was 10.8% versus 11% last quarter and 12.5% a year ago due to changes in revenues, gross margins and operating expenses. Other income and expense for Q1 was approximately $4.7 million, consisting of $1.9 million in interest expense offset by a net gain of $6.6 million principally from foreign exchange. Our interest expense decreased sequentially as we paid down our debt during the quarter. The income -- the tax provision for Q1 was $20.2 million on a GAAP basis and $36.2 million on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP tax rate for Q1 was 11.4% and the non-GAAP tax rate was 15.5%. We delivered strong Q1 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $3.43, which was at the high end of the guidance range of $2.75 to $3.50 due to revenues towards the higher end of guidance, stable gross margins, lower non-GAAP OpEx and foreign exchange gains. Cash flow generated from operations for Q1 was $271 million, compared to cash flow used in operations of $9 million during the previous quarter due to continued strong profitability offset by higher inventory requirements based on build plans for Q2. CapEx was $3 million for Q1 resulting in positive free cash flow of $268 million versus negative free cash flow of $17 million last quarter. We have $50 million remaining under the authorized buyback program which expires on January 31, 2024. The closing balance sheet cash position was $543 million, while bank debt was $146 million resulting in a net cash position of $397 million, up from a net cash position of $150 million last quarter. We generated $271 million in operating cash flow and paid down debt by $144 million in Q1. Turning to the balance sheet and working capital metrics compared to last quarter, the Q1 cash conversion cycle was 86 days versus 77 days in Q4. Days of inventory increased by 16 days to 91 days versus the prior quarter of 75 days as we built inventory for a seasonally strong Q2. Days sales outstanding was up by five days quarter-over-quarter to 43 days, while days payables outstanding increased by 12 days to 48 days. Now turning to the outlook, we remain enthusiastic about our diversified business model covering a wide range of GPU, AI, core computing, storage, 5G telco, edge and IOT solutions. We expect a seasonally strong Q2 and are carefully observing the global macro-economic situation and continuing supply-chain constraints especially for leading AI platforms. For the second quarter of fiscal 2024 ending December 31, 2023, we expect net sales in the range of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion, GAAP diluted net income per share of $3.75 to $4.24 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $4.40 to $4.88. We expect gross margins to be similar to Q1 levels. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $191 million and include $49 million in stock-based compensation expenses that are not included in non-GAAP operating expenses. The outlook for Q2 of fiscal year 2024 fully diluted GAAP EPS includes approximately $40 million in expected stock-based compensation expenses, net of tax effects of $13 million, which are excluded from non-GAAP diluted net income per common share. We expect other income and expenses, including interest expense to be a net expense of approximately $8 million. The company’s projections for Q2 GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per common share assume a GAAP tax rate of 15.7%, a non-GAAP tax rate of 17.1% and a fully diluted share count of 57.6 million for GAAP and 58.3 million shares for non-GAAP. We expect CapEx for the fiscal second quarter of 2024 to be in the range of $21 million to $23 million and a range of $105 million to $115 million for the fiscal year 2024. For the fiscal year 2024 ending June 30, 2024, we are raising our guidance for revenues from a range of $9.5 billion to $10.5 billion to $10 billion to $11 billion. Michael, we are now ready for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is open.
Ananda Baruah: Hey. Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the strong and ongoing execution. I guess, yeah, just so a couple of the starts. Charles, can you talk about the degree to which you guys either are benefiting or anticipate the benefit from the increased NVIDIA supply that was pointed to China but now needs to find other places to go? And to the degree you think you might benefit, if you could give us some sense of at what rate that benefit makes its way out of China and into other countries. And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.
Charles Liang: Thank you for the question. Again, it’s a complicated situation. But at this moment, we believe December quarter, our supply from NVIDIA will be much better than last quarter. And that’s one of the reasons why we are able to fulfill more percentage of customer demand and that’s why we say, $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion should be our target. So basically, a price condition that we need to meet.
Ananda Baruah: That’s actually really helpful context. I appreciate it. And then, I guess, sort of dovetailing from that, Charles. So the midpoint of the implied guide for the fiscal year, the raised guide, $10.5 billion, implies that the March quarter and June quarter would also be about $2.8 billion, which is the midpoint of your December quarter guide. And then you also, though, made mention of growth accelerating. And so -- and that -- and it seems like supply is getting better. You also have co-op capacity coming on, going into the year. So I guess the question is, is there conservatism built in into even the implied fiscal year guide that’s been raised or is there some pull-forward in December quarter that you think might be challenging to duplicate in the March and June quarter? It seems like conservatism, but just wanted to check that? Thanks.
Charles Liang: Yeah. Thank you. Again, we continue to gain lots of design win. So our back order has been growing faster than what we forecast in reality. So at this moment, $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion for December should be a very conservative number. And for our whole fiscal year, $10 billion to $11 billion, again, should be a conservative number. So I feel very optimistic to continue to grow quickly and that’s why we continue to grow our rack-scale, including a difficulty rack-scale rather than production capacity. Likewise, just, before we have 4,000 rack per month capacity and now pretty much we will grow to 5,000 rack per month capacity very soon. So we are very optimistic for the future growth.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Wang with Barclays. Your line is open.
George Wang: Oh! Hey, guys. Hey, Charles. Thanks for taking my question. Just maybe you could give some color in terms of the allocation from other suppliers and partners, kind of maybe in the near-term, kind of for the future, like the AMD MI300, which is expected to launch in the first quarter 2024. And also aside from H100 from NVIDIA, any other upside when the L40S from NVIDIA is ramping? Just curious and also including Gaudi from Intel. Maybe you can give some color on allocation from additional suppliers?
Charles Liang: Yeah. Thank you for the question. Yes. I mean, as you know, we have a very strong NVIDIA product line, including the L40S, right, and including the CG1, CG2 on the way. And AMD MI300X also getting ready. And Intel Gaudi 2 is ready to volume production. So although we have a very good demand and very strong supply capacity. So, again, I feel very optimistic for a quicker growth.
George Wang: Okay. Thanks. I have a quick follow up if I can. Just in terms of when Malaysia coming out and also in the future, kind of Taiwan facility, any thoughts on the kind of impact to the profit margin and kind of obviously with the much lower labor costs, can you kind of quantify, maybe give some color just on expected operating margin accretion going forward?
Charles Liang: Yes. I mean, as of what I just shared, our utilization rate for U.S. and Taiwan capacity today only about 60%. So when we have a higher utilization rate, our overall cost will be lower, right? So that’s why when we grow revenue, our profitability will increase. And Malaysia, as you know, is a lower cost campus. So once we start production in Malaysia, our cost will be better and profit margin will be slightly improved.
Operator: Our next question comes from Janik Wing with Susquehanna Financial Group. Your line is open.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. It’s actually Mehdi Hosseini. Thanks for taking my question. David, your midpoint of the December quarter guide implies 57% year-over-year growth, but operating margin declining by about 100-basis-point. I understand utilization rate is in the 60% range, but as you bring up utilization rate, how should I think about the OpEx and the leverage from here on?
David Weigand: Yeah. So we expect that we will continue to get operating leverage, Mehdi. We were, I think, a little conservative in our guide for OpEx in Q2. So we -- and as we were in Q1, and so we came in a little bit lower. We are doing everything we can to do that in Q2 as well. So back to your operating guide question. We came down a little bit on gross margin year-over-year, as you know, but we expect -- as Charles mentioned, we expect some gross margin leverage, as well as operating margin leverage as we -- as our operating expenses never increase at the rate that our revenues are.
Mehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thank you. And Charles, a big part of your cause is memory and other components. And everything we have heard from memory manufacturers that they are not going to sell at prices that were prevalent just a couple of months ago. So memory prices are going up. And how do you alleviate that inflationary trend to be able to expand margins?
Charles Liang: Thank you. I mean, basically we are able to pass-through our cost to customers. So for that portion, basically we are kind of okay. We won’t be impacted by that. At least it won’t be impacted too much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jon Tanwanteng with CJS Securities. Your line is open.
Jon Tanwanteng: Hi. Thanks for taking the question, guys, and great quarter and a nice outlook. Just wanted a little more color on the gross margin guidance and outlook. I mean, I assume you are getting better margins and utilization and on your new facilities on the ramp. Are you simply planning to give all that back with the share gain initiatives and the hyperscale mix or is there some input cost component and kind of when should we expect the timeframe for gross margin leverage to really become apparent? Is it only with the new facilities or can that happen a little sooner than that?
David Weigand: Well, it’s a combination, Jon, of -- as we ramp revenues up, we are going to get leverage on the gross margin because, as Charles mentioned earlier, we are going to get higher efficiency and factory throughput as we -- which will lower costs as we put more through the factories. So we will get some benefit there. We will also get benefit as we transition more manufacturing over to Malaysia and Taiwan. And I think that -- so that’s why right now we are, although, very competitive situation, we are maintaining our margin guidance for Q2.
Charles Liang: Yeah. I can add a little bit of some color. I mean, kind of our software business is growing. Our service, including on-site deployment, all those will help our gross margin, our value bridge. So at this moment, we should be on the right track, healthy direction.
Jon Tanwanteng: Got it. Okay. And then just a question on the, I think you said, you are building seven new buildings here in the U.S. I know you are expanding and looking for places to put facilities in North America. Would those all be margin accretive or neutral or negative, just given the higher costs here? How do we think about those facilities and their impact?
Charles Liang: Oh! Very good question. Indeed, we are adding some more buildings in the Bay Area and most of those will be rental buildings, because our growth is faster than what we can build in a building. So it will be a rental facility. And then I did mention about we are looking for another location, hopefully in a little bit of a lower cost state in North America. So we are planning for building a new campus in -- we will decide in the next few months, I believe. But short-term, new buildings in Silicon Valley will be rental property.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nehal Choski, Northland Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Nehal Choski: Yeah. Thank you. You may have already addressed this, but what are your expectations for AI revenue contribution with respect to the midpoint of December quarter guide being up 32% quarter-over-quarter?
David Weigand: Yeah. So I think we are expecting really the same performance, Nehal. We will expect it to be in a range of over 50%.
Nehal Choski: Okay. And can you give a little bit more precise number as far as what the exposure was in the September quarter other than greater than 50%?
David Weigand: That’s -- we are giving that approximate figure and that’s our guide.
Charles Liang: Yeah. Basically AI revenue percentage continues to grow, but hopefully in ALCN [ph] consistently with…
Operator: Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Aaron Rakers: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question and also congrats on the quarter. I am just curious, going back to the supply side of the discussion, how would you, as you are engaging with customers and thinking about their build-out plans in their datacenter footprints for AI, how would you characterize the evolution of lead times on these higher end GPUs? I mean, relative to what it was maybe 90 days ago, how has that evolved and how are you seeing that evolve into the current quarter?
Charles Liang: Yes. It’s a complicated job. However, because our building-box solution and our global footprint together, we have a huge lead time. We support hundreds of customers. So [Technical Difficulty] indeed, relatively, we are able to take care of the allocation, the lead time, the inventory control, product flow-in, more efficient than our competitors. And we are continually improving in that area.
Aaron Rakers: So, you would say that lead times have improved throughout this course this last quarter and you would expect that, it sounds like to continue improving in the December quarter. It’s kind of a fair characterization.
Charles Liang: Yes. And that’s why our inventory utilization rate will be improving. So, before, I guess, we have about 90 days turnaround time.
Aaron Rakers: Yes.
Charles Liang: And I guess that will be improved when the scale continues to grow and when we continue to…
Aaron Rakers: Yeah.
Charles Liang: … leverage our building-box solution, situation will continue to improve.
Aaron Rakers: Yeah. And then the follow-up question would be, as the market evolves more competitively and you see, I know a prior question on the MI300, you have got the Gaudi Silicon. I guess the way I think about it is these customer deployments are longer cycle. It’s not like these decisions are made in a given quarter. So, as we look to these products, particularly the MI300X ramping, really starting early part of next year and through the course of next year. Are those projects that you are already seeing visibility into and that actually adds another layer of growth to the pipeline? Are those projects that you have already been designed in and you are just waiting for those products to kind of launch to really start to see that incremental revenue for those competitive offerings?
Charles Liang: Yeah. You are right. Because our building-box solution, so we are able to design all that and make a new technology available earlier than the market, basically. So, usually we send our solution to customer for evaluation so our customer can make a decision earlier and that allows Super Micro, there will be an earlier time to prepare the product, prepare inventory. So, it doesn’t matter if we have a solution, AMD solution or Intel solution, we provide a same building-box solution and we gain time to market advantage. We provide a customer earlier seeding, earlier system so that they can validate in advance.
Operator: This will conclude our question-and-answer session and our conference call today. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q4  (2023-08-08 17:00:00) =====

At the end of today's prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session for sell-side analysts to ask questions. I'll now turn the call over to Charles.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I am pleased to announce a new record fiscal result of $7.12 billion annual revenue, a 37% year-over-year growth rate. We have also achieved our first landmark $2.18 billion quarter, which is 34% growth year-over-year and 70% quarter-on-quarter. We are continuing to exceed both top and bottom-line results and performing well beyond our previously guided ranges. It’s no secret that our strong growth has been driven by the demand for our leading AI platforms in plug-and-play rack-scale, especially for the large language model-optimized NVIDIA HGX-based Delta Next solution. Our engineering capability enabled us to deliver optimized, first-to-market AI products and solutions to our customers, distinguishing us from the competition and empowering us to take market share.  I am also proud of our logistics and production teams’ execution to maintain our time to market advantage and deliver our total solution to our key partners much sooner than competition. Our investment of 4,000 racks-per-month state-of-the-art validation and production facility in Silicon Valley is one of the major factors in delivering high-performance AI racks quickly with both air-cooled and liquid-cooled options. Let’s go over some key financial highlights: We enter FY24 with record-high backorders, many more new design wins and new customers. Again, our fiscal year 2023 net revenue totaled $7.12 billion, up 37% year-on-year, above our mid-point guidance range of $6.7 billion. Fiscal year 2023 non-GAAP earnings per share grew 109% year-over-year to $11.81, compared to $5.65 a year ago, exceeding the higher end of our revised guidance range of $10.50 to $11.00. Fiscal Q4 net revenue totaled $2.18 billion, up 34% year-on-year and up 70% quarter-on-quarter, above our guidance range of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. Fiscal Q4 non-GAAP earnings of $3.51 per share grew 34% year-over-year compared to $2.62 a year ago, and it was well above the high end of our guidance range of $2.21 to $2.71, demonstrating strong operating leverage and continued customer preference towards our rackscale Total IT Solutions.  For 30 years, we have been diligently building our company strength and foundation. As the only U.S. -based scale AI platform designer and manufacturer, we have been shipping our winning products in volume to our partners for more than a quarter.  Couple of months ago, I was honored to have my close friend, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang, join me on stage at Computex to highlight our optimized new generation GPU solutions for this AI era. We are deploying not just systems, but complete rack-scale total solutions to large generative AI innovators. Supporting HGX H100 Delta-Next, H100 PCIe GPUs, and the just-announced L40SGPUs; our Delta-Next, Redstone-Next, and 8-GPU OVX systems have become the benchmarks of excellence for the industry. We are also getting good traction on Intel’s Gaudi 2 and PVC, as well as AMD’s MI-250 accelerator solutions. The demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure is perfectly addressed by our building block server architecture, and due to our building block solutions, we have the best and broadest application-optimized GPU solutions on the market. We plan to extend this leadership with the upcoming MGX platforms that we announced at Computex, bringing modular flexibility on acceleration with X86, Grace, C2 and Grace-Hopper CG1 Superchip.  The MGX platform is a shared vision of AI computing between NVIDIA and Supermicro, designed to be open, flexible and future proof for multiple generations of GPUs, CPUs, and DPUs. We already have many customers engaged with these new MGX platforms as we speak, and soon they will be in volume production.  With nearly half of our revenues this quarter based on AI-related designs, I expect this AI growth momentum to continue expanding our TAM across all customer types from major AI innovators, super large CSPs, Tier 1 DCs, Tier 2 cloud, and to the general enterprise market. As the performance of GPU, CPU, DPU and memory technologies increase, enhanced storage performance is also necessary to feed massive data sets to the applications without becoming a bottleneck that slows the entire system down.  Supermicro's new PCIe Gen 5 based E1.S and E3.S Petascale All-Flash storage servers offer industry-leading storage performance and capacity. Together, with our U.2 NVMe, top-loaded scale-out and traditional storage platforms. We are fulfilling customers’ AI, compute, and storage needs with a one-stop total solution shopping experience, with the best optimization in performance, time-to-online, and cost. With accelerated computing and storage, the power consumption and thermal challenges of these new technologies have risen dramatically. 40KW or even 100KW rack solution demand is rapidly expanding and required for compute-intensive DC, CSP, and other verticals. Having high power efficiency, free-air and liquid cooling expertise has become one of our key differentiators of success. We have made major investments across a variety of technologies to drive adoption of direct liquid cooling in datacenters to address the thermal challenges.  In addition to increasing computing density and reducing TCO, liquid cooling reduces the environmental impact of datacenters dramatically, aligning with our green computing mission. Similarly, our liquid immersion solution is making good progress, and we will be happy to provide that option to interested partners soon. The reality is that datacenter infrastructure is getting more complex, especially with the unprecedented demand for AI. The design complexity and integration skills, along with the requirement to deploy in a timely fashion are heavy burdens to many end customers. Supermicro Total IT Solutions approach saves them from the complications of design, validation, sourcing, and integration. It also streamlines network switching, firmware and software management in datacenter scale. Customers’ peace of mind is topped off by the value of our 24/7 Global Service tiers.  Given the current infrastructure demand, we have been continuing to evaluate our footprint beyond our recently announced Malaysia expansion. We have recently added another new building close to our Silicon Valley HQ and are aiming to further increase our current 4,000 rackper-month capacity in this fiscal year. To further support demand from key domestic partners. We are also planning to build another manufacturing campus in North America. At this moment, our U.S. headquarter and Taiwan facility can support at least $15 billion in revenue while the new Malaysia facility will further increase our total revenue potential by serving scale builds on a reduced cost structure in the coming CY'24. In closing, Supermicro is in a great position to continue our growth momentum with our leading AI portfolio, our infrastructure readiness, and our ability to deliver products in a timely manner. Due to the current key components supply shortages, we forecast revenue in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion for the September quarter. However, given the record high backlog, we see fiscal year 2024 revenue between $9.5 billion to $10.5 billion with room to deliver more depending on availability of supply.  Our role as the leader of rack-scale Total AI and IT Solutions has only just begun. We are ready to deliver optimized AI infrastructures to existing and emerging markets, along with our value-added software and services. To say it plainly, our foundation and capacity are fully ready, and our demand is growing strongly. With LLM large language model and other AI applications booming, I now expect the $20 billion annual revenue target to be just a couple of years away.  Before passing the call to David Weigand, our Chief Financial Officer, I want to say thank you to our partners, customers, Supermicro employees and to our shareholders for your continued support.  Thank you, David.
David Weigand: Thank you, Charles. Fiscal fourth quarter revenues were $2.18 billion, up 34% year-over-year and up 70% quarter-over-quarter. Q4 revenues exceeded initial guidance range of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion and were at the high end of the recently updated range of $2.15 to $2.18 billion.  For Fiscal 2023, we reported revenues of $7.12 billion, representing 37% growth over FY'22 revenues of $5.20 billion. Next generation CPU and AI platforms continue to drive record levels of design wins and orders. Exiting fiscal year 2023 with a record backlog, we are well positioned for fiscal year '24 with an outlook for continued revenue growth and profitability. We expect diversified growth driven by top-tier datacenters, emerging CSPs, enterprise AI build-outs, CPU upgrades, and edge IOT and telco markets.  We are also targeting new opportunities in adjacent markets such as Storage, Switches, Software & Services. We note that our shipments against a record backlog may continue to be constrained by supply chain bottlenecks for key new components for our advanced AI server platforms. Q4 results were driven by our high-growth AI/GPU and rack-scale solutions which represented 52% of our total revenues. We had two 10% customers for Q4 and did not have any 10% customers for fiscal year '23. During Q4, we recorded $976 million in the Enterprise and Channel vertical, representing 45% of revenues versus 50% last quarter. This was up 19% year-over-year and up 51% quarter-over-quarter as we ramped several key enterprise programs. The OEM appliance and large datacenter vertical achieved $1.17 billion in revenues, representing 53% of Q4 revenues versus 47% last quarter, up 59% year-over-year and up 94% quarter-over-quarter as we gained momentum from existing and new datacenter, CSP, and OEM cloud appliance customers. Our emerging 5G, Telco, Edge, IoT segment achieved $43 million in revenues, representing 2% of Q4 revenues versus 3% last quarter. For the fiscal year 2023, Organic Enterprise and Channel and AI/ML revenues grew 10% to represent 48% of total revenues. The OEM appliance and large datacenter segment grew 102% and represented 49% of total revenues. The emerging 5G Telco Edge IOT segment decreased 36% and represented 3% of total revenues. The mix of complete systems and rack-scale Total IT Solutions has increased over the last two years.  Server and Storage Systems comprised 93% of Q4 revenue and Subsystems and Accessories represented 7%. ASPs continued to increase on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis driven by the value and complexity of our rack-scale Total IT Solutions. By geography, U.S. represented 76% of Q4 revenues, Asia 11%, Europe 10%, and Rest of World 3%. On a year-over-year basis, U.S. revenues increased 55%. Asia decreased 17%, and Europe increased 1%, and Rest of World increased 12%. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, U.S. revenues increased 112%, Asia increased 10%, Europe decreased 1%, and Rest of World increased 11%. The Q4 non-GAAP gross margin was 17.1%, down quarter-over-quarter from 17.7% in Q3 as we focused on winning strategic new designs and market share. For fiscal year '23, the non-GAAP gross margin of 18.1% versus 15.4% for fiscal year '22 was driven by an increased rack-scale product/customer mix and higher manufacturing efficiencies. Turning to operating expenses, Q4 Opex on a GAAP basis increased by 14% quarter-over-quarter and 19% year-over-year to $145 million driven by headcount and related expenses. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses increased 14% quarter-over-quarter and 17% year-over-year to $133 million. Our non-GAAP operating margin increased significantly to 11% for Q4 versus 8.7% last quarter due to operating leverage driven by higher revenues that outpaced increases in operating expenses. For fiscal year '23, we achieved a non-GAAP operating margin of 11.4% versus 7.2% in fiscal year '23 due to higher gross margins and operating leverage from higher revenues and expense controls. Other Income & Expense for Q4 was an expense of approximately $1.5 million consisting of $3.5 million in interest expense offset primarily by a net foreign-exchange gain of $2.0 million. Our interest expense increased sequentially as we utilized our short-term credit lines for working capital requirements along with higher short-term interest rates on our borrowings.  The tax provision for Q4 was $31.3 million on a GAAP basis and $36.6 million on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP tax rate for Q4 was 13.9% and the non-GAAP tax rate was 15.4%. The GAAP tax rate was 14.7% for fiscal year '23 versus 15.7% in fiscal year '22 and the non-GAAP tax rate was 15.9% versus 17.7% in fiscal year '22. We delivered strong Q4 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $3.51 which exceeded the high end of the original guidance range of $2.21 to $2.71 and the recently updated range of $3.35 to $3.45. The increase in Q4 EPS was due to a combination of higher revenues and operating leverage. For the full fiscal 2023, we reported non-GAAP diluted EPS of $11.81, up 109% year-over-year versus fiscal 2022 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $5.65 and higher than the FY'23 guidance of $10.50 to $11.00. Cash flow used in operations for Q4 was $9 million compared to cash flow generated by operations of $198 million in Q3 due to higher accounts receivable, offset by lower inventory and higher accounts payable from backend loaded shipments in the quarter due to supply constraints.  CapEx was $8 million for Q4 resulting in negative free cash flow of $17 million versus positive free cash flow of $190 million last quarter. For fiscal year '23, we had free cash flow from operations of $664 million, CapEx of $37 million resulting in free cash flow of $627 million. We have $50 million remaining under the authorized buyback program which expires on January 31, 2024. The closing balance sheet cash position was $440 million, while bank debt was $290 million resulting in a net cash position of $150 million down from net cash position of $176 million last quarter as we utilized our bank lines of credit to support higher revenues and accounts receivable as we ramped up production of new AI/GPU design wins. Turning to the balance sheet and working capital metrics compared to last quarter, the Q4 cash conversion cycle improved to 77 days versus 126 days in Q3. Days of Inventory was 75, representing a decrease of 51 days versus the prior quarter of 126 days. Days Sales Outstanding was down 13 days quarter-over-quarter to 38 days while Days Payables Outstanding came down by 15 days to 36 days. Faster inventory turns contributed to the improvement in our cash conversion cycle. Now turning to the outlook, we remain enthusiastic about our diversified business model, covering a wide range of AI, core computing, storage, 5G telco edge and IOT applications. Design wins span across enterprise/channel, large datacenter/emerging AI CSP, and Telco and OEM customers.  We are carefully observing the global macro-economic situation and continuing supply-chain constraints especially for leading AI platforms. For the first quarter of fiscal 2024 ending September 30, 2023, we expect net sales in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion, GAAP diluted net income per share of $2.02 to $2.80 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $2.75 to $3.50. We expect gross margins to be similar to Q4 levels.  GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $185 million and include $48 million in stock-based compensation and other expenses that are not included in non-GAAP operating expenses. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to increase due to continued investments in R&D and higher personnel costs adding to our great engineering and sales teams. The outlook for Q1 of fiscal year 2024 fully diluted GAAP EPS includes approximately $44 million in expected stock-based compensation and other expenses, net of tax effects of $9 million, which are excluded from non-GAAP diluted net income per common share. We expect other income and expense, including interest expense, to be a net expense of approximately $1.5 million. The company’s projections for GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per common share assume a GAAP tax rate of 14.7%, a non-GAAP tax rate of 15.4%, and a fully diluted share count of 56 million for GAAP and 57 million shares for non-GAAP. We expect CapEx for the fiscal first quarter of 2024 to be in the range of $10 million to $12 million. For the fiscal year 2024 ending June 30, 2024, we are giving guidance -- I'm sorry, the first fiscal year 2024. Which ends June 30, 2024. We are giving guidance for revenues in the range $9.5 billion to $10.5 billion. Okay, Michael, we’re now ready for Q&A.
Charles Liang: Operator? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Now we have the first question, comes from the line of Nehal Choski from Northland Capital Markets. Sir, Your line is open. 
Nehal Choski: Thank you. And congratulations on an amazing quarter and amazing fiscal year '24 revenue guidance of $9.5 billion. Definitely want to dig into. First off, Charlie, I think he said you have 50% in revenue exposure AI for the June quarter. That's incredible makes a very strong statement that Super Micro, indeed the leader in AI systems. What do you think is a sustainable differentiation that you guys are wielding with rack-scale AI systems that's driving that incredibly fast increase in revenue exposure AI systems?
Charles Liang: Yeah, thank you for your question. Yes, as AI has been our major focus is since a few years ago, and we work with AI chip company kind of very closely. And we could develop lots of our platform, including our MTX [ph]. Now coming MTX, as you know, to support a C2and CG1. So our AI solution with rack scale scale, or cloud scale, customer scale solutions that make our customers deploy even much easier. And full rehab, they also solution for energy cost as they've been for time to online. So I believe our AI product line will continuing to grow in the near future maybe continue to be more than 50% of our revenue.
Operator: Next question comes from line of Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna International Group. Your line is open.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes, thanks for taking my question. And Charles, I think it would be very helpful if you could [technical difficulty] $10 billion of revenue. And perhaps any kind of color on ASP increased that would capture your increased content would give us an insight unless you have other ways of explaining to get to $10 billion net.
Charles Liang: We continue to get lots of new customer or partner continue to like our solution. And we continue to gain new customer with our rack scale, cloud scale, total solution, including [Indiscernible]. So we see a very strong demand and growing very fast order. So $10 billion should be kind of a short term target this year. 
Mehdi Hosseini: Last question, your competitors also argue for innovative cooling? And they also argue for shagging? Is there something with your cooling technology that is better offers better cost performance, compared to some of the emerging cooling that your competitors are for marketing, are talking about?
Charles Liang: Yeah, indeed, our engineering team is strong and dedicated. Everyone can design systems, our system simply better than others, not just better in quality, performance, but also earlier time to market. And together with service, software, system management. So it's a total solution and service. So we feel pretty confident that we will continue to gain market share.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay, maybe move on, because they are becoming more than 50% of your revenue. How is your pipeline as you look into the second half of calendar year? Do you already have a pipeline that gives you confidence, you're going to hit that 50% plus AI as the mix of revenue or you still have to go and qualify and win the business to hit that target.
Charles Liang: Indeed, our pipeline I believe is very strong. And that is momentum, its ability is very clear. So we are very confident especially with another chemical customer too.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jon from Tanwanteng. Your line is open.
Jon Tanwanteng: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions and congrats on a really strong quarter outlook again. My first one, is I just wanted to dig into your confidence for the outlook. Can you just in various parts, maybe talk about your confidence in supply chain, being able to supply that maybe 40% growth guidance at the midpoint? Maybe talk about your ability to get allocations from key suppliers.  And then within your order book and backlog? What is your assurance? Or how can you identify if there's double or triple ordering? And how do you protect yourself against that if they do exist?
Charles Liang: Yeah, it's a complicated question. We have a very good product many product line for delta max for redstone max for grace for [indiscernible] and other solutions including error 40s. So the solution is really strong and supply chain we work with our vendor very closely every day. And so hopefully that situation will be consistently improve, but it's not 100% control of our sale. So although we have a good partnership but it's 100% controlled by our sales. So all though we have a good partnership, which vendor, which customer. So we work together very closely, And the situation will be continue to improve I believe
Jon Tanwanteng: On the order side
Operator: Your next question, I will ready for the next question. 
David Weigand: John, did you ever follow up question?
Jon Tanwanteng: In order site, double protection against double and triple? 
Charles Liang: Yeah, and see the other side? I mean, the tech order had been continued growing strongly. Every month I see older growth.
David Weigand: Also, John, we have a lot of NCNR orders as well. That protects against double and triple booking.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ananda Baruah from Loop Capital, your line is open.
Ananda Baruah: Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. And thanks for taking the questions. Yeah, congrats on the strong results and the ongoing momentum. I have a couple if I could. Charles, you've talked in the prepared remarks about the unprecedented demand you're seeing and you guys have talked about actually adding new customers, including top tier data center customers, I think you mentioned and some of these gen AI server forecasts, for 2024 calendar are really, really strong. And you're also talking about gaining share, et cetera.  And so I guess the first question is, is what's the opportunity do you see to maybe even do teach stronger than the fiscal '24 guidance. I guess, what would be the puts and takes there? And, if you were to be able to exceed the 2024 guidance, what would be some of the things you think would need to occur? And then I have a quick follow up. Thanks.
Charles Liang: Yeah, thank you. Very good question. Again, we continue to gain generative AI innovator, and we have a very good partnership. We partnership with some small OEM. And for sure, they need 10 times 20 time more system. And we just cannot ship at this moment, because of supply chain.  And at the same time, we also continue to engage with large CSP, in large data centers. So we continue to gain more customer from I read who say, all given political. So yes, hard to work out which supply chain, three party regime, our supplier, our customer in our sales. And that's have been our major focus now. Although we continue to improve our total datacenter solution included in DRC, direct liquid cooling and liquid immersive solution. So I mean, we are on the right track, yes expecting supply chain can improve so that we can grow our revenue.
Ananda Baruah: That's really helpful. And so, Charles, just to make sure that I understood that accurately, is that to say, if the supply chain -- so if you can, if you can get more from the supply chain, actually use it to say this way you have order visibility, such that if you can procure more, you would have the ability to share gains, exceed the fiscal '24 range that you provide is a really supply chain issue, I guess, is what I'm asking. Did I hear that accurately?
Charles Liang: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, we continue to prove to our customer and our vendor, say, hey, we have a business solution. So okay with us, that's where we went wherever you went.
Ananda Baruah: I got it. And then let me just ask a quick follow up to that one. Is there any way you guys could provide in context for us around I guess how constrained you are, like, what might the demand outlook sort of look like if you were not constrained? So not like a guidance, obviously, you gave your guidance to just content context for us and really getting a sense of what the structural positioning of the company is, if there were not constraints?
Charles Liang: Yeah, I can. We have a very good product. And we have a very good partner customer. And we, we pushed our vendor. And we know our vendor doing their best to support us at the same time as well. So we just have to continue to work together.
Ananda Baruah: Charles, I have one more quick one, I appreciate it. Sounds like the gross margin guidance for the September quarter is a pretty solid most attractive guide. For fiscal '24, should we assume that same 17% kind of gross margin range or what's the right way to think about that? And that's it for me. Thanks.
David Weigand: Sure, Ananda, this is David. So we're targeting to hold our margins. And that's all the guidance that will give right now. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam [Indiscernible] from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Yeah, thanks for taking the questions. And also congrats on the results tonight. So I first of all, I just want to clarify, I want to make sure I heard the number. Yeah, the 50% or 52% of the revenue that was from your AI and rack scale solutions as last quarter?
David Weigand: Yeah, Adam. Charles, in his script said approximately 50% and I clarified 52%. 
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, so I guess the question isn't either that is that, one of the questions I get asked a lot about, is the spend around AI being so strong. And it sounds like obviously, you're carrying a pretty good backlog looking out over the next several quarters, given the supply dynamics. But if I take that number and I say the non-AI business, how has that trended or basically, are you reallocating capacity away from more of the non or traditional compute side to satisfy demand on the AI side? Or have you seen spending slowdown outside of these AI investments that you're clearly benefiting from?
Charles Liang: Yeah, now AI server storage, IoT telco, we keep involve and a bit blend. Understand that industry has been declining, we are not declining, above Fed. And we try to grow as well. And that's why we are growing in many directions kind of manufacturing, kind of like Taiwan and Malaysia. And we may have another North America campus. So that's all to increase our capacity, so that we can grow traditional data center business as well, instead of omni focus on that, growing AI. 
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. So just to be clear, I mean, so you're limiting -- you're limited on your supply, on the traditional compute side, because of the AI demand that you're seeing. Is that fair?
Charles Liang: Not exactly impacted, but not exactly. Indeed, as traditional server, traditional datacenter business, and a bit bland from the demand side. So we face into similar experience as well, but not declining to ---
Unidentified Analyst: Yep. Okay. And then the final question for me is just thinking about the AI opportunity. And I think you alluded to this a little bit your prepared comments you mentioned positioning around I think it was the Intel, Ivy chip and then also I think another vendor coming to market the MI300 from AMD. How do you see that playing out for your opportunity?  Does it help satisfy the man are you seeing indicators that, this AI opportunity is going to be much more diversified here as we move into '24 versus what you've seen on the NVIDIA side at this point? Just curious how you're seeing kind of the competitive landscape or maybe opportunities that expand for you guys with those newer other solutions coming to market?
Charles Liang: Yeah, in retail solutions, [Indiscernible] and people are really waiting for NVIDIA more supply. And other solution from Intel, from AMD, because our box [ph] solution we have a solution ready for show up again. So that's the advantage we have. So we just waiting for their solution to be available in production.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you very much.
Charles Liang: Thanks. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jon from Tanwanteng. Your line is open.
Jon Tanwanteng: Hi, thanks for the follow up. Dave, I was wondering if you could talk about your working capital needs in the sort of environment. Can you generate positive cash flow going forward? Are you going to be using cash as you as you try to fulfill this OpEx demand?
David Weigand: Yeah, John. We see the business generating good cash flows, as it has historically. And we think that the --- especially in this constrained supply market, where we could deliver more if we had more supply. But we're so really, the constrained supply ends up moderating the working capital. And so we grew our business last quarter quite a bit and grew our ARR. So that utilized a lot of working capital, but we have no concerns about working capital.
Jon Tanwanteng: Okay, great. And then could you guys give a little bit more detail on the capacity expansion, and then when those various facilities come online, and what exactly they add?
David Weigand: Sure, we have Malaysia, which is expected to come online in around 12 to 15 months. And that's going to --- that will eventually double our capacity. And we also have additional capacity coming online in our building 23, here in our Social Valley campus. And we've also added, as Charles mentioned, another site in in San Jose, with intentions to add another site in the Americas.
Jon Tanwanteng: Got it? And then last one, for me. Maybe a more detailed question, what percentage of your AI sales right now are liquid cooling basin? Do you expect that percentage to increase as you go forward?
Charles Liang: This is very new questions. So we have a very good DLC, direct liquid cooling solution ready to go now. And it's all depends on customer demand. And at the same time, the big emotions solution also getting ready. So we have all three solution and depends on customer's demand. At this moment, for sure [indiscernible] still a majority, as you know.
Jon Tanwanteng: Okay, great. Thanks. Charles.
Charles Liang: Thanks. 
Operator: Your next question from the line of Nehal Choski from Northland Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Nehal Choski: Yeah, thank you for the follow up question. So NVIDIA was guided their July quarter data center revenue up 2x QonQ. What does that mean for Super Micro in terms of GPU systems? Especially what I'm trying to drive is that is there a lag between when a video that's recognized revenue and when to rest from server OEMs gets revenue recognized revenue?
Charles Liang: We believe their capacity are growing. And that's why we talk to them every day asking for more. So hopefully we can gather more support from them. And hopefully their capacity that grows mostly quickly. So that's all I can say now. Okay.
Nehal Choski: Okay. You have a -- I guess on, what is your AI-related market share during the June quarter and what they're not that was up QonQ?
David Weigand: We don't have --- we're not going to go into offer a market share for the June quarter. You can make some assumptions by looking at the results of others. But, we have we sell different GPUs as Charles mentioned. So, there is a direct correlation. 
Charles Liang: Yeah, basically we have a strong order backorder. And we still have not full capacity. We are waiting for more AI chip. That's our situation. 
Nehal Choski: Yep, understood. And how should we think about distributing the remaining 8 million across the final three quarters here?
David Weigand: We're not going to announce quarter-by-quarter our guidance. But we're expecting this to be a robust year and has tempered by the natural supply constraints because of the popularity of these new platforms,
Charles Liang: Yeah, basically in NVIDIA we have a more capacity for sure. And we're really happy to wait over there. And besides other than the alternates our residental mix next is a company that is already in our CG-1 solution is pretty much ready as well. So we believe we can ship much more and not less situation. So in next four quarter I believe will continue to grow quarter after quarter.
Nehal Choski: Thank you very much, 
Charles Liang: And even a supply condition, I believe we can surpass $10.5 million for sure easily.
Operator: Thank you, everyone for joining time for question at this time. And this will conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Thank you, everyone.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-05-02 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. My name is Abby, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Super Micro Computer Incorporated Fiscal Third Quarter 2023 Results Conference Call. Today’s conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And I will now turn the conference over to Michael Staiger, Vice President of Corporate Development. You may begin.
Michael Staiger: Good afternoon. And thank you for attending Supermicro’s call to discuss financial results for the third quarter, which ended March 31, 2023. With me today are Charles Liang, Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and David Weigand, Chief Financial Officer. By now, you should have received a copy of the news release from the company that was distributed at the close of regular trading and is available on the company’s website. As a reminder, during today’s call, the company will refer to a presentation that is available to participants in the Investor Relations section of the company’s website under the Events & Presentations tab. We have also published management’s scripted commentary on our website. Please note that some of the information you’ll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expenses, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook, including guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 and the full fiscal year 2023. There are a number of risk factors that could cause Supermicro’s future results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our most recent 10-K filing for fiscal 2022 and our other SEC filings. All of these documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Supermicro’s website. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Most of today’s presentation will refer to non-GAAP financial results and business outlook. For an explanation of our non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to the accompanying presentation or to our press release published earlier today. In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today’s press release and in the supplemental information attached to today’s presentation. At the end of today’s prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session for sell-side analysts to ask questions. I’ll now turn the call over to Charles.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Our revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 totaled $1.28 billion, down 5% year-on-year and below our initial guidance range as we previously announced, but our non-GAAP earnings per share grew over 5% year-on-year to $1.63, compared to $1.55 a year ago. While the quarter did not unfold as we expected, I am strongly encouraged by our current business momentum as we navigate market uncertainties with our new generation X13, H13 and H100 leading-edge products, especially in artificial intelligence. These new AI product demands from top-tier companies have led us to challenges in terms of new key components availability. Compounded with the economic headwind, our Q3 results were reflective of these difficult yet opportune conditions. The good news is that we have already started to address these component shortage pressures over the past few months and we are in a much-improved situation going forward. We have started to produce and ship some back orders since April. Here are a few highlights for the quarter. First, record pace of GPU leading-edge design wins and growing back order, including winning at least two new global top 20 customers. Second, we refreshed our entire product portfolio based on new CPU, GPU, Storage and Fabric technologies from key partners including NVIDIA, Intel, AMD and others. And third, increased customer demands of our rack scale PnP solutions and continued expansion and transition from a server/storage hardware manufacturer to a Total IT Solutions provider. With applications like ChatGPT that heavily count on large language models or LLM and generative AI, the state of AI infrastructure business has grown rapidly. This AI momentum has benefited Supermicro greatly as we are deploying many of the world’s leading and large-scale GPU clusters. In addition, we have built a close and collaborative relationship with NVIDIA over the years by co-developing and offering the most optimized and the fastest time-to-market GPU platform on the market. Aligning new generation product designs with partner ecosystems is highly complex. As I mentioned earlier, multiple key component shortages delayed our ability to manufacture and deliver the new systems like the Delta Next GPU system last quarter. With the improving components availability this quarter, the new GPU system shipments will ramp significantly. Indeed, we continue to scale up our manufacturing campus in U.S., Taiwan, Netherland and Malaysia, so that we can support our revenue growth in a much larger scale in the coming quarters and years. By leveraging our in-house Building Block design and manufacturing, we are well equipped to navigate through the current economic headwinds. With our building block solutions architecture, we always deliver workload optimized new products to market faster than competitors, like with the recent NVIDIA H100, Intel Sapphire Rapids and AMD Genoa releases. The power consumption and thermal challenges of these new technologies have risen dramatically and 40KW or even 80KW rack solution demands are getting stronger and popular for computing hungry DC and industries. Having high power efficiency and air/liquid thermal expertise has become one of our key differentiators of success. Combined with our proven green computing pedigree that saves customers much TCO costs, our time-to-market advantage and solution optimization via building block solutions, we anticipate to continue to gain many more new design wins with these new generation products in the quarters ahead. We have made solid progress in our Total IT Solutions initiative by advancing our rack-scale solutions capability. Provided there are no supply constraints, we can design, build, validate full systems and deliver turn-key rack level solutions to customers within a few weeks of placing an order instead of months from competitors. Supermicro’s one-stop shop Total IT Solutions strategy includes AI, servers, storage, networking, software, racking, cabling, power, cooling, integration, validation and management features plus services. The idea is to let our customers focus more on their applications and new software functions, leaving the IT hardware solutions to Supermicro from cloud to edge. Currently, we are on track to support up to 4,000 racks per month of global manufacturing capacity by the calendar year end. Our business is maintaining a growth rate that is multiples of the overall IT growth rate worldwide in the same period. We are doing so by efficiently taking market share in the new and fastest growing markets. AI, Storage, on-prem Cloud, Embedded and 5G Edge are all verticals we see potential to greatly increase our TAM. We are well positioned to support these highly specialized markets by optimizing our technology, design and business automation at our U.S., Asia and EMEA campuses. The recently added liquid-cooled rack-scale solutions and production lines, product auto configurator and online business automation will bring more value to customers quicker with better quality. We are also improving our cost structure by scaling our Taiwan and upcoming Malaysia campuses, which will be online soon with some of our key partners. While our March quarter results had some challenges, our new generation of products are in high demand, especially for AI and we anticipate more customers deploying our products in rack-scale PnP. We continue to emerge as one of the largest global suppliers of Total IT Solutions and continue to gain market share. The strength of our products and technology keeps us confident of delivering Q4 revenues in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. If supply conditions improve sooner, we expect to be above that range, despite some economic headwinds ahead. In other words, I continue to expect our fiscal year 2024 revenue to be at least 20% year-over-year growth and we are accelerating to reach our mid- to-long-term growth objectives of $20 billion per year. Now I will pass the call to David Weigand, our Chief Financial Officer, to provide additional details on the quarter. Thank you.
David Weigand: Thank you, Charles. Fiscal Q3, 2023 revenues were $1.28 billion, down 5% year-over-year and down 29% quarter-over-quarter, which was below our initial guidance range of $1.42 billion to $1.52 billion. The shortfall was primarily due to key new component shortages for Supermicro’s new generation server platforms which have been mostly resolved to-date. Our next generation AI platforms are driving record levels of design wins along with strong orders from top-tier customers and a record backlog. We are well positioned for a strong finish to our fiscal year 2023 as we rank up -- wrap up -- ramp up deliveries of our new platforms to key customers. We note that our shipments against a record backlog may be constrained by supply chain bottlenecks due to high demand for our advanced AI server platforms. Q3 results were driven by our high growth AI/GPU and rack-scale solutions which represented approximately 29% of our total revenues and we expect significant future growth. An existing Cloud Service Provider customer represented more than 10% of revenues for the first time. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, key new platform component shortages and seasonality impacted our three end market verticals. On a year-over-year basis, we had growth in our OEM appliance and large datacenter vertical reflecting momentum with new datacenter and CSP customers. We recorded $646 million in the Enterprise and Channel vertical, representing 50% of Q3 revenues versus 53% last quarter. This was down 22% year-over-year and down 32% quarter-over-quarter due to new platform component shortages. The OEM appliance and large datacenter vertical achieved $601 million in revenues, representing 47% of Q3 revenues versus 43% last quarter. This was up 30% -- 37% year-over-year as we gained momentum with existing and new datacenter, CSP, and OEM cloud appliance customers and down 23% quarter-over-quarter due to new platform component shortages. Our emerging 5G/Telco/Edge/IoT segment achieved $36 million in revenues, which represented 3% of Q3 revenues versus 4% last quarter. Systems comprised 91% of total revenue and was up 2% year-over-year and down 30% quarter-over-quarter. Subsystems/accessories represented 9% of Q3 revenues and were down 43% year-over-year and down 16% quarter-over-quarter. On a year-over-year basis, the volume of systems and nodes shipped decreased while System node ASPs increased due to higher product ASPs, especially for AI product offerings. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, the volume of systems and nodes shipped decreased due to lower shipments from component shortages while system node ASPs increased.  Geographically, during Q3 the U.S. market represented 61% of revenues, Asia 17%, Europe 18% and Rest of World 4%. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, U.S. revenues increased 3%, Asia decreased 31%, Europe increased 11% and Rest of World decreased 29%. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, U.S. revenues decreased 28%, Asia decreased 35%, Europe decreased 27% and Rest of World decreased 20%. The Q3 non-GAAP gross margin was 17.7%, down 110 basis points quarter-over-quarter and up 210 basis points year-over-year. The decline in the non-GAAP gross margin was due to, one, our efforts to gain market share in the rapidly growing AI server platform market with aggressive pricing targeting strategic large enterprises, data center and CSP customers; secondly, lower factory efficiency from smaller sales volume and a learning curve in the production ramp of new platforms. The company’s mainstream server business margin profiles were generally on par with last quarter. As we focus on gaining market share with our new AI platforms, we will target the optimal mix of revenue growth, gross margin and operating profit growth to create long-term value for our shareholders. Turning to operating expenses, Q3 OpEx on a GAAP basis increased by 4% quarter-over-quarter and increased 5% year-over-year to $127 million. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses increased 7% quarter-over-quarter and increased 6% year-over-year to $116 million. OpEx increased sequentially due to lower NRE and marketing credits for new platform launches and higher headcount. The non-GAAP operating margin was 8.7% for the quarter versus 12.8% last quarter and 7.5% a year ago due to lower revenues and lower gross margins. Other income and expense was approximately $1.4 million in expense primarily consisting of interest expense of $1.3 million and a small FX loss, as compared to $1.8 million in interest expense and $6.3 million FX losses last quarter. Interest expense decreased sequentially as we paid down some of -- some working capital loans last quarter. The tax provision for Q3 was $11 million on a GAAP basis and $15 million on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP tax rate for Q3 was 11% and non-GAAP tax rate was 14%. Our tax rates were lower sequentially due to higher discrete tax benefits realized in Q3. Lastly, our share of income from our joint venture was a loss of $1 million this quarter, as compared to a loss of $1.4 million last quarter. We delivered Q3 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.63, which was up 5% year-over-year and down 50% quarter-over-quarter due to the lower revenues, lower gross margins and higher operating expenses quarter-over-quarter. Turning to the balance sheet and working capital metrics compared to last quarter, our Q3 cash conversion cycle was 126 days versus 95 days in Q2. Days of inventory was 126, which was up by 27 as we built inventory to fulfill large new customer orders. Days sales outstanding rose 13 days quarter-over-quarter to 51 days, while days payables outstanding increased by nine days to 51 days. Working capital metrics were impacted by the -- again by the new platform component shortages, which increased inventory and lengthened the cash conversion cycle as we could not fulfill all our sales demand. In fiscal Q3, we generated positive cash flow from operations of $198 million versus $161 million in Q2. Despite our Q -- quarter-over-quarter revenue decline, our operating cash flow benefited from continued profitability and the conversion of accounts receivables to cash. CapEx was $8 million for Q3 resulting in positive free cash flow of $190 million versus positive free cash flow of $151 million last quarter. The closing balance sheet cash position was $363 million. Total bank debt increased to $187 million as we increased our debt by $17 million during the quarter, while net cash increased to $176 million in Q3 from $135 million in Q2 due to strong operating cash flow. During Q3 we repurchased 1.55 million shares of our common stock for approximately $150 million leaving $50 million remaining under our current $200 million share repurchase authorization which goes until January 31, 2024. Our Board will determine the timing and amount of any future share repurchases. Now turning to the outlook for our business, we have a strong backlog of orders for new platforms entering the seasonally strong June quarter. We are working diligently with our strategic partners and customers to fulfill their requirements and are making steady progress in easing key supply constraints. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 which ended --ending June 30, 2023, we expect net sales in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion, GAAP diluted net income per share of $2.13 to $2.65 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $2.21 to $2.71. We expect gross margins to be approximately 17% as we focus on gaining market share with our strategic new customers and platforms. As we improve our production efficiencies on the new platforms and gain scale with our customers, we expect our gross margins to improve. However, in the current AI growth, AI market environment, we will continue to balance market share gains with gross margins. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $145 million, which includes approximately $10 million in expected stock-based compensation and other expenses that are excluded from non-GAAP diluted net income per common share. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to increase in Q4 due to lower R&D NRE credits and higher personnel and marketing costs. We expect other income and expenses, including interest expense, to be a net expense of approximately $4 million and expect a nominal loss from our joint venture. The company’s projections for GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per common share assume a GAAP tax rate of 14.7%, a non-GAAP tax rate of 15.7% and a fully diluted share count of 56 million for GAAP and 57 million shares for non-GAAP. The outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 fully diluted GAAP EPS includes approximately $7 million in expected stock-based compensation and other expenses, net of tax effects that are excluded from non-GAAP diluted net income per common share. We expect CapEx for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 to be in the range of $11 million to $14 million. For the fiscal year 2023 ending June 30, 2023, we are tightening our guidance for revenues for a range -- from a range of $6.5 billion to $7.5 billion to a range of $6.6 billion to $6.8 billion, which would represent year-over-year growth of 27% to 31%. GAAP diluted net income per share from a range of $8.50 to $11 to a range of $10.14 to $10.66 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share from a range of $9 to $11.30 to a range of $10.50 to $11. The GAAP -- the company’s projections for GAAP annual net income assume a tax rate of 14.9% and a rate of 16% for non-GAAP net income. For fiscal year 2023, we are assuming a fully diluted share count of 56 million shares for GAAP and 57 million shares for non-GAAP. The outlook for fiscal year 2023 fully diluted GAAP earnings per share includes approximately $33 million in expected stock-based compensation and other expenses, net of tax effects that are excluded from non-GAAP diluted net income per common share. For fiscal year 2024 we are expecting revenue growth of at least 20% based on strong customer demand for our best-in-class new AI platforms and Total IT solutions. We remain confident in our long-term outlook for robust revenue growth and profitability driven by our leading-edge new platforms, design wins with significant new customers, our efficient global manufacturing capacity and continued market share gains. And Michael, we are now ready for Q&A.
Michael Staiger: Operator?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Nehal Chokshi: Yeah. Thank you. Very impressive buyback rate of $150 million in the quarter to $100 a share. So a very strong statement that the shares are attractive prices and nice to see that backed up with the $1.5 to $11 share fiscal year 2023 guidance. So, with that in mind, on the at least 20% year-over-year revenue growth for fiscal year 2024, what’s your level of confidence that Supermicro can operate at the high end of the target model that you guys communicated two years ago, that being the 14% to 17% gross margin range?
David Weigand: So…
Charles Liang: Yeah. Indeed our confidence is very good. So, again, because of the economic headwinds, so we try to be more conservative here. But at least 20% year-over-year growth and we expect -- we hope more than that for sure.
Nehal Chokshi: And what about with respect to gross margin?
David Weigand: Yeah. So, Nehal, we -- yeah. Back two years ago, we gave a 17% to 21% -- 23% topline growth. Obviously, we’re in there at a minimum of 20%. And for the gross margins, we continue to, like I said, to wrestle with taking market share and also balancing that against gross margins. But we’re confident with our new manufacturing facilities coming online that we will be able to improve our gross margins. And we also, as we come out of this quarter and we begin to ramp our new product offerings that we will be able to improve margins as well.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. Great. And are you guys seeing any signs of general corporate IT demand weakening -- weakness as the CDW preannounced has indicated?
Charles Liang: Yeah. The general IT market has slowed down a little bit, but this year we have a lot of high-end high computing, especially GPU product line that we saw a very strong demand. So, overall, our growth will be strong.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. And then do you guys have any 10%-plus customers in the quarter and any expectations that, that would contribute within the June quarter as well?
David Weigand: So we did have a new 10% customer this quarter. They’re not a new customer, but they’re a new 10% customer. And we expect from time -- from quarter-to-quarter, Nehal, depending on the delivery of these -- of our design wins, we will see other customers over -- achieve over 10% of our revenue. So that will continue to happen.
Nehal Chokshi: And is that the expectation that there will likely be a new 10% customer pop up within the June quarter?
David Weigand: It’s very possible.
Charles Liang: Yeah. But at the same time, we are also greatly growing our operating NIM through our channel, through retail and also through online business. So we try to balance the growth between the large accounts and a lot of small account. And so we are…
Nehal Chokshi: Thank you, guys. Best of luck. Yeah. Great. Best of luck, guys. Thank you very much.
Charles Liang: Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is open.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. A couple of follow-ups for me. I want to better understand. I remember last earnings conference call, you discussed your confidence in the backlog, and back then, there was a little bit of a pushout of revenue opportunities from perhaps March into June, but you were very confident that as we approach June and September, it should materialize and now that the magnitude of the revenue push was more than expected. So what happened if you if you were confident with the backlog in January, what prevented you to procure the key components? And I have a follow-up.
David Weigand: Sure. There was a shift -- there was a dramatic shift toward new AI solutions, Mehdi. And so therefore, it was larger than anyone expected and so the parts availability constrained the amount of shipments that we could do. Obviously, we anticipated a slower quarter, because the third quarter is seasonally slower and we also mentioned -- you’re correct, we also mentioned some customers that tapped the brakes and moved out to Q2. But it was really the component shortages that hit us this quarter.
Charles Liang: Yeah. I’m going to Q1, we have some customer postponed shipping right? But at the same time, some other customers growing and they want a high-end, especially GPU product line. And for those high-end GP product line and new design, yes, we have some key component shortage, including GPU/CPU combination and kind of high power thermal solution. So we did a very big effort to prove in those components and now situation have been dramatically improved. That’s why we are pleased for June quarter.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay. Thank you for details. And David, one that cash flow items. In the December quarter, you were able to work down inventory, but then there was one non-working capital item, which caused the decline in cash from operation, and this quarter, March, it was actually the other way. You had to purchase inventory, but there was a non -- there was positive non-working capital item that came in. Can you help us understand how I should think about these dynamics in working capital and how is it going to change looking forward?
David Weigand: Yeah. I think, as we go out, Mehdi, I think, that’s a good question, because we will -- working capital wise is this fourth quarter is going to be challenging for me, because we are going to be moving -- acquiring a lot of inventory. And so it will -- that will challenge our cash flows during this quarter. So that’s something -- the timing of inventory and shipments is critical. And as going into this Q4 or ending Q3, we were building inventory, and yet at the same time, as Charles mentioned, we couldn’t ship things, because we didn’t have every -- all the parts that we needed. So we’re growing inventory at the same time that we’re constrained on shipping. So what that does is it caused our working capital metrics to go down a little bit and that’s evident in our cash conversion cycle. But I would say that in spite of that, we generated some of our best cash flow. We generated $200 -- almost $200 million in cash flow and we returned $150 million of that to the shareholders. So, what I would say is that, yeah, going into Q4, we -- cash flow is very important. But, I think, ultimately, the business has shown that it generates very good cash flows.
Charles Liang: Yeah. Although, like David said, recently cash flow a little bit high, but will be very safe. I would have to say, we will be super safe and a little bit tight, because we would pay -- purchase a lot of components for growing June quarter and following the September quarter. I believe June and September quarter will be very strong, especially September quarter, we would say. So we had to prepare components and that’s why cash flow will be a little bit high, but will be super safe.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay. Thank you. I will go back in the queue.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take our next question from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is open.
Ananda Baruah: Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I really appreciate it. Two, if I could. At the risk of asking maybe the, obvious, I think, 90 days ago, you guys had, Charles said on your earnings call that, you had expected in the second half of this calendar year. So September, December quarter to be in a position to start -- this is the way that I interpreted Charles, making a regular part of your book of business, the layering in of larger projects from the cloud cadre from the AI cadre, like that. And I guess my question is, are you seeing -- is what we’re seeing in the June quarter that you’re talking about, is that a pull forward of what 90 days ago we anticipating later this year? So is that dynamic happening sooner kind of as you would describe it holistically or is this something different than that? And then I have a follow-up. I appreciate it. Thanks.
Charles Liang: Very good question. Indeed, the June quarter, our demand is very strong, because of the component shortage. So, at this moment, we try to be conservative. So that’s why we share with you $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. That’s based on some shortage. If we can find those parts quicker than indeed the June quarter will be much stronger than that. And September quarter, likewise you say, what -- likewise your question is September quarter, we will continue to be very strong, and as well as the December quarter, I believe. So now that really problem is a shortage. So we had to build other components for inventory. At the same time, we are not quite sure how much we can grow in this quarter. But for sure, $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion should be a very safe number.
Ananda Baruah: Really appreciate that. That’s helpful context. And then I guess the follow-up is for Dave -- Dave, for you. Just with regard to your gross margin comments. Any greater context you can share that’s responsible. I realize that this is sort of at the front end of beginning to mix in some of this larger footprint business. But I would love to get a better understanding of how you guys are thinking about sort of the gross margin manifestation if we think about the continued layering in of larger footprint, which may come at a slightly lower margin. Is it really that over time, we just expect a greater presence of that lower margin business with some efficiency gains or is it just in the beginning here, the margin will be lower for the new business, but then collectively, the P&L gross margin expands over time?
David Weigand: Yeah. So we’re looking at it and on -- in the -- your latter alternative, Ananda, and here’s why. So right now, there’s three things that we’ve been facing. We’re having to face more air transportation costs in order to make our deliveries. So that impacts our margin. And also, we’re having to pay other expedite fees. That impacts our margin. Number two, we ran a lot less through our factories than in Q3 than we did in Q2. So your margin efficiency, your ability to spread your fixed costs, it’s tremendously impacted on a smaller scale. So as we scale up, we improve our margins. Thirdly, the -- as we ramped our new product offerings, there is an efficiency on these new -- on the production of these new products. So we are going to improve the efficiency of these products, which will improve the margin. And so those three things alone speak to margin improvements. But again, we are -- we have -- we believe we have best-of-breed AI products. And those are in high demand and people are coming to us and so we’re going to -- we’re very strategic about taking the market.
Charles Liang: Yeah.
Ananda Baruah: Great. Thank you.
Charles Liang: I can add some color. I mean, as I shared, I mean, we are building a $20 billion of revenue, hopefully in midterm and that’s why a grow our capacity and support a large customer is very important to us. Once our volume becomes higher, our costs will be improved and then business operation efficiency will be higher. So we are doing better great way to grow our revenue. And so, I mean, once we start to reach that number under $10 billion to $20 billion, I guess, our gross margin will start to grow, because we won’t always invest for big growth after that.
Ananda Baruah: I appreciate that context guys. Thanks a lot.
Operator: And we will take follow-up questions from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is open.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. A couple of follow-ups. David, did you say that the OpEx for the June quarter will be around $145 million?
David Weigand: Let’s see. That sounds about -- on a non-- we have -- we gave both GAAP and non-GAAP guidance, Mehdi.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay.
David Weigand: So our...
Mehdi Hosseini: Let’s see, the non-GAAP was $145 million.
David Weigand: Yeah. Let’s see. Just a second. Yeah. Yeah. $145 million for GAAP.
Mehdi Hosseini: Thank you.
David Weigand: Sure.
Mehdi Hosseini: I’m sorry, GAAP or non-GAAP.
David Weigand: It was -- GAAP is going to be $145 million.
Charles Liang: Yeah.
David Weigand: And that includes $10 million in expected stock-based comp. So that would -- that means $135 million for non-GAAP.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay. That’s what I was looking for. Okay. And then CapEx for the June quarter?
David Weigand: Yeah. We said $11 million to $14 million.
Mehdi Hosseini: $11 million to $14 million. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session and today’s conference call. We thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-01-31 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is Devin and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Super Micro Computer, Inc. Fiscal Q2 2023 Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you for your patience. Mr. Michael Staiger, you may begin your conference.
Michael Staiger: Good afternoon and thank you for attending Supermicro’s call to discuss financial results for the second quarter, which ended December 31, 2022. With me today are Charles Liang, Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and David Weigand, Chief Financial Officer. By now, you should have received a copy of the news release from the Company that was distributed at the close of regular trading and is available on the Company’s website. As a reminder, during today’s call, the Company will refer to a presentation that is available to participants in the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website under the Events & Presentations tab. We’ve also published management’s scripted commentary on our website. Please note that some of the information you’ll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expenses, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook, including guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and the full fiscal year 2023. There are a number of risk factors that could cause Supermicro’s future results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our most recent 10-K filing for fiscal 2022, and other SEC filings. All of these documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Supermicro’s website. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Most of today’s presentation will refer to non-GAAP financial results and business outlook. For an explanation of our non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to the accompanying presentation or to our press release published earlier today. In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today’s press release and in the supplemental information attached to today’s presentation. At the end of today’s prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session for sell-side analysts to ask questions. And I’ll now turn the call over to Charles.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I am pleased to announce another outstanding quarterly result for Supermicro, driven by contributions across our diversified customers, end markets and strong products. No single customer contributed more than 10% of our revenue. This is the eighth consecutive quarter of outstanding growth that effectively doubled our annual revenue. Let me share some key highlights for the quarter. First, revenue for the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 totaled $1.803 billion, up 54% year-on-year, above our guidance range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. Our fiscal second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share grew over 271% year-on-year at $3.26 compared to $0.88 a year ago, far exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $2.64 to $2.90. This great achievement is made possible by our much-improved operational and financial discipline, including our Taiwan campus that contributed lower operation and production cost. With the increase of AI applications, our Plug-n-Play Rack-Scale Total IT solutions and GPU based systems continue to be strong contributors with more than 100% year-on year growth. Storage products are also gaining significant traction with 41% year-over-year growth as we continued to grow market share. We are mindful that many of our partners and customers have become increasingly more cautious with respect to macroeconomic headwind, and we are prepared to deal with these uncertainties as we always have in the past. The strength of our products and business fundamentals keeps us confident in our ability to continue gaining market share from competition given in the traditionally soft Q3 quarter. We expect the headwind may persist in the first half of calendar 2023, but we believe our business will recover quickly in the second half of the year as our new Sapphire Rapids, Genoa product and H100 product lines start to ramp in high volume. Having said that, our fiscal year 2023 revenue year-over-year growth should be in the middle 30% compared with last year without changing our business plan for strong growth in the coming years. For fiscal year 2024, we are targeting year-over-year revenue growth of at least 20%. We continue to see new customers, increase demands for energy efficient rack-scale plug-n-play solutions across the tier-1, tier-2 datacenter ecosystems as well as other enterprise customers. Some of them are highly interested in our liquid cooling at the rack and system level for their green computing HPC, datacenter and cloud installations. In addition, our continuous investment in software, switch and service are paying dividends to our Total IT strategy as they grow. Our Silicon Valley and Taiwan campuses continue to optimize their rack-scale production processes, ready to deliver L10, L11 and L12 systems in volume with software, networking and services. Our U.S. facility still has 40% capacity while Taiwan still has 50% capacity headroom to grow for the next one to two years. To accommodate stronger growth in the near and midterm future, our recently broken-ground Malaysia new campus will start to contribute even better profit margin through economy of scale with our more and more new high-volume customers. I am very glad that the lower operation and production cost from our new Malaysia campus will be ready in just 4 to 5 quarters away. When the time gets tough, customers are looking for tangible value from their IT investment. With the power requirements rising with each new generation of technology, now up to 400 watts on the CPUs and 700 watts on the GPUs, we are seeing the true value of our Green Computing effort. We have added both high ambient temperature operation and liquid cooling support for the new portfolio to reduce environmental impact, cooling-related infrastructure costs and OpEx. We are happy to see many more cloud total solutions customers speeding up their deployments with our Green Computing methodology. Many of them have already saved tens of millions of dollars in electricity cost as a direct result. We expect them to grow even faster by the coming quarters and years as we deliver superior performance, performance per watt and per dollar through new generations of products. As I have shared in the past, when the IT industry adopts our Green Computing solutions or develop green solutions like ours, it’s possible to save close up to $10 billion in electricity costs per year, which is equivalent of eliminating about 30 fossil fueled power plants and equating to the preservation of up to 8 billion trees for our planet. As we approach the second half of our fiscal 2023, we see opportunities for diversified growth across more Large Datacenters, Enterprise, AI, Machine Learning, Storage, Cloud, 5G/Telco and IOT markets. Our online B2C and B2B programs have finally started to ramp up and offers the convenience and quicker service of direct support from Supermicro to many customers around the world. With all the online automation and intelligent database-driven tools, we see many new customers that are really happy to order from our new platform. 24-hour around-the-clock services, real time responses, precise communication, cost efficiencies are just some of the advantages this program offers. With our industry’s most extensive product portfolio supporting the recently launched Intel 4th Gen Scalable Xeon processors, Sapphire Rapids; 4th Gen AMD EPYC, Genoa processors; and NVIDIA H100, Hopper, GPUs, we are confident to maintain and enhance our market-leading growth momentum in the coming quarters and years. Unlike last few generation’s steady product ramp up, we currently see many more customers taking samples and seeding units of these new solutions. This demonstrates our customer base is strongly expanding now. We expect them to become a significant revenue stream by the June quarter and more so in the September quarter and beyond. With market excited for the latest innovations from Intel, AMD, NVIDIA and Supermicro, we remain optimistic that the demand will expand as new architectures developed for AI, Metaverse, Omniverse and IoT/Edge applications will be strong in the foreseeable future. We had a better than expected December quarter. With new generation of products in a strong position now, it will generate more demand, especially with our rack-scale solutions. Along with our getting stronger software, switch and service offerings, our potential to gain market share has never been stronger than today despite the macroeconomic headwind. With our strong cash position today, and especially total PE, [ph] we have allocated $200 million for stock buyback program. We continue to emerge as one of the largest global suppliers of Total IT Solutions with market share gains. We are a Silicon Valley company focusing on green innovation and system technology. Our efforts have saved our customers’ OpEx tremendously. With our 50% still available capacity in Taiwan and the soon coming more cost-efficient campuses in Malaysia, we continue to expect a 20% to more than 50% year-over-year growth for the coming years, and we remain on track to reach our long-term growth objectives of $20 billion annual revenues in the long run. Now, I will pass the call to David Weigand, our Chief Financial Officer, to provide additional details on the quarter. David?
David Weigand: Thank you, Charles. I am pleased to report Q2 fiscal 2023 revenues of $1.8 billion, up 54% year-on-year and down 3% sequentially. Revenues were at the high end of our initial guidance range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion and our recently updated range of $1.77 billion to $1.8 billion. Our year-over-year revenue growth continued to be driven by new and existing customers widely adopting our GPU/AI systems and rack-scale Total IT Solutions which contributed to solid gross margins and record operating margins. In fiscal Q2, we had good growth in our two largest verticals: enterprise/channel and OEM vertical -- I’m sorry, the enterprise/channel vertical and the OEM appliance/large datacenter vertical, which demonstrated the resilience of our business model. AI/GPU accelerated computing solutions represented more than 20% of our revenues over the past four quarters and is a significant growth opportunity based on our wide range of AI/GPU platforms. We achieved Q2 revenues of $1.8 billion with no customer representing more than 10% of revenues. We recorded $970 million in our Enterprise and Channel vertical, representing 54% of Q2 revenues versus 45% last quarter, up 29% year-over-year and up 15% quarter-over-quarter. The OEM appliance and large datacenter vertical achieved $766 million in revenues, representing 42% of Q2 revenues versus 50% last quarter, this was up 172% year-over-year and down 17% quarter-over-quarter. Our emerging 5G/Telco/Edge/IoT segment achieved $67 million in revenues, representing 4% of Q2 revenues versus 5% last quarter. Systems comprised 92% of total revenue and was up 68% year-over-year and down 3% quarter-over-quarter. Subsystems/accessories represented 8% of Q2 revenues and were down 24% year-over-year and up 2% quarter-over-quarter. On a year-over-year basis, the volume of systems and nodes shipped as well as System node ASPs increased due to product and customer mix, while on a quarter-over-quarter basis, the volume of systems shipped increased while nodes shipped and System node ASPs decreased, again, due to product and customer mix. Taking a look geographically in fiscal Q2 the U.S. market represented 61% of revenues, Asia 18%, Europe 17% and Rest of World 4%. On a year-on-year basis, U.S. revenues increased 71%, Asia increased 16%, Europe increased 45% and Rest of World increased 98%. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, U.S. revenues decreased 15%, Asia increased 23%, Europe increased 33% and Rest of World increased 33%. The Q2 non-GAAP gross margin was 18.8%, that was unchanged quarter-over-quarter and was up 480 basis points year-over-year due to price discipline, lower freight costs and leverage from higher factory utilization. Taking a look at operating expenses, Q2 OpEx on a GAAP basis decreased by 4% quarter-over-quarter and increased 8% year-over-year to $122 million. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses decreased 7% quarter-over-quarter and increased 5% year-on-year to $109 million. OpEx decreased sequentially due to higher NRE and marketing credits that we received from the new platform launches. The non-GAAP operating margin was 12.8% for the quarter versus 12.5% last quarter and 5.2% a year ago as we benefited from lower operating expenses. Other income & expense was approximately $8 million in expense primarily consisting of $6 million in foreign-exchange losses as the dollar weakened during Q2 and interest expense of $2 million as compared to an $8 million in FX gain and $4 million of interest expense last quarter. Interest expense decreased sequentially as we reduced short-term credit lines, this was partially offset by increased interest rates. The tax provision for Q2 was $30 million on a GAAP basis and $34 million on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP tax rate for Q2 was 14.3% and non-GAAP tax rate was 15.3%. Our tax rates were lower sequentially as we benefited from favorable discrete tax benefits. Lastly, our share of income from our joint venture was a loss of $1.4 million this quarter as compared to a loss of $0.9 million last quarter. We delivered strong Q2 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $3.26 which was up 271% year-over-year and down 5% quarter-over-quarter and exceeded the high end of the original guidance range of $2.64 to $2.90 and our recently updated guidance of $3.07 to $3.22. Our EPS outperformance was attributed to our ability to maintain gross margins, manufacturing efficiencies and higher NRE and marketing credits. Turning to the balance sheet and working capital metrics compared to last quarter, our Q2 cash conversion cycle was unchanged at 95 days versus Q1. Days of Inventory was 99, which is down by one day sequentially due to a more stable supply-chain. Accounts receivable increased sequentially by $32 million while accounts payable decreased sequentially by $225 million. Days sales outstanding was down by 1 day quarter-over-quarter to 38 days while days payables outstanding came down by 2 days to 42 days. In fiscal Q2, we generated positive cash flow from operations of $161 million versus $314 million in Q1. Our operating cash flow continued to benefit from strong revenues and margins and an improved supply chain. We note that Q1 operating cash flow benefited from $70 million in customer pre-payments recorded as deferred revenues. CapEx was $10 million for Q2 resulting in positive free cash flow of $151 million versus positive free cash flow of $303 million last quarter. The closing balance sheet cash position was $305 million, while bank debt was reduced to $170 million as we paid down $80 million in short-term debt during the quarter. We did not buy back any shares during the quarter and have $200 million in share repurchase authorization until January 31, 2024. Our Board will determine the timing and amount of share repurchases. Now turning to the outlook for our business, we continue to watch the global macroeconomic situation. Additionally, as the supply chain disruptions have eased and the industry transitions to new platforms from Intel, AMD, NVIDIA during 2023, we anticipate normal -- return to normal seasonal patterns. For the third quarter of fiscal 2023 ending March 2023, we expect net sales in the range of $1.42 billion to $1.52 billion, GAAP diluted net income per share of $1.75 to $2.02 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $1.88 to $2.14. We expect gross margins to be down 30 to 40 basis points due to macroeconomic conditions. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $139 million, which includes approximately $12 million in expected stock-based compensation and other expenses that are excluded from non-GAAP diluted net income per common share. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to increase in Q3 due to lower R&D NRE credits and higher personnel costs. We expect other income and expenses, including interest expense, to be a net expense of approximately $3 million and expect a nominal loss from our joint venture. The Company’s projections for GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per common share assume a GAAP tax rate of 15.9%, a non-GAAP tax rate of 16.9%, and a fully diluted share count of 57 million for GAAP and 58 million shares for non-GAAP. We expect CapEx for the fiscal third quarter of 2023 to be in the range of $11 million to $14 million. For the fiscal year 2023 ending June 30, 2023, we’re maintaining our guidance for revenues from a range of $6.5 billion to $7.5 billion, GAAP diluted net income per share from a range of $8.50 to $11.00 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share from a range of $9 to $11.30. The Company’s projections for GAAP annual net income assume a tax rate of 19.2% and a rate of 19.8% for non-GAAP net income. For fiscal year ‘23, we are assuming a fully diluted share count of 57 million shares for GAAP and 58 million shares for non-GAAP. The outlook for fiscal year 2023 fully diluted GAAP EPS excludes (sic) [includes] approximately $33 million in expected stock-based compensation and other expenses, net of tax effects that are excluded from non-GAAP diluted net income per common share. We remain confident in our long-term outlook for robust revenue growth and profitability driven by our leading-edge new platforms, design wins, market share gains, and engagement with significant new global customers. Michael, we’re now ready for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Markets.
Nehal Chokshi: Yes. Thank you. And congratulations on the strong results, especially gross margin, and the guidance that implies very resilient gross margin. Dave, you did mention that you’re expecting 30 basis points of the Q-over-Q downtick due to macro pressures. I mean, that’s a de minimis amount. Can you discuss why only that amount?
David Weigand: Well, Nehal, our margins are holding up. We expected a downtick last -- in this Q2, but it didn’t happen. We’re still allowing for a downtick just in case we have to sharpen our pencil on some particular deals. But otherwise our prices and margins are holding up.
Nehal Chokshi: So then, can you talk about why you think your margins are indeed holding up in what appears to be pretty quickly deteriorating macro environment?
David Weigand: Well, we have customers that are -- that have pushed out orders, certainly Nehal, but that we still bring value to our customers. And that value is -- has not diminished. And, in fact, with all of the new designs that are coming out, we believe it’s increased.
Nehal Chokshi: Got it. That’s great. And then, you’re maintaining your fiscal year ‘23 guidance despite outperformance in the December quarter and you’re providing at least March guidance that’s above my expectations. So, how should we be reading that implied June Q guidance, basically? Should we be -- if we take at the low end of the fiscal year ‘23 guidance, you could be looking at a pretty dire gross margin situation within June Q, is that the correct interpretation?
David Weigand: No, I would say Nehal that really we are -- we don’t want to update our guidance. We’re confident in our guidance and in the ranges that we’ve given. And so really we’re just -- we’re watching the macroeconomic situation. But we remain confident in our basic business fundamentals and in our values -- the values that our products bring.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. So just to be clear, there is no reasonable basis for believing that gross margin would drop to the low-end of your what’s arguably a sale target model of 14% to 17% in the June quarter, or lower, is that correct?
David Weigand: So we -- right now, we don’t see any degradation of our gross margins, as I mentioned. And so -- but we feel like -- we remain confident in our in our ranges. And we don’t believe this is a time to update them.
Nehal Chokshi: And then, Charles made a comment that he expects fiscal year ‘23 revenue be taking at least 30% year-over-year growth or mid-30%. But your overall fiscal year ‘23 guidance range is still a pretty large bracket. So, how should we be reconciling these two things here?
David Weigand: Well, I think that number of mid-30s, that still falls within the range. Right, Nehal?
Nehal Chokshi: Absolutely.
David Weigand: Yes. So I think that’s an indication.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital.
Ananda Baruah: Yes, just a few if I could. So, maintaining -- actually, I think, slightly raising the midpoint of the fiscal year guide, March is below where Street is, the implication is June is above where Street is. And so, is it really just a matter of, kind of Street, like we are -- and I think I’m part of this, sort of had miss-modeled March to the low side? And subsequently, we’re also miss-modeling June? Well, we miss-modeled March to the high side, and we’re miss-modeling June to the low side? Just a clarification. Just your thoughts on that and I have a couple of follow-ups. Thanks.
David Weigand: Sure. So again, I’ll kind of go back and we’re -- because things have been changing economically and we had some -- we’ve seen some push-outs, not cancellations, again, push-outs, we feel like, we shouldn’t be adding more details on Q4 or annual guidance. And so, really, we feel like the guidance ranges that we gave allow for where we think performance will land. And so, to give more specificity to that, at a time when details are not easy to -- are not as clear to see, we think is the wrong way to go. And so instead, we’re giving good guidance on what we see in the quarter ahead. But again, we’re still comfortable with our annual guidance.
Ananda Baruah: And it sounded -- I think, I believe Charles mentioned, and actually just please clarify this for me if this is inaccurate, something about kind of macro software, but recovery in the second half of calendar year ‘23. And if I heard that accurately, is that to say, you guys envision the first half of the calendar year being sort of the softest part of macro for you? And you also made comments Dave about returning calendar ‘23 to seasonality. And so first half is the soft spot, second half, you guys think sort of normal seasonality plus quote unquote, recovery begins and that dovetails into your fiscal year ‘24 outlook? And so contextually, I just want to ask you, is that how you guys are thinking about it?
Charles Liang: Yes. Macroeconomic headwind issue is some concern to everyone now. So other than that, indeed, our demand is still pretty strong, especially as you know, Intel just announced Sapphire Rapids; AMD, Genoa; and NVIDIA, Hopper, H100. So we have very strong products available. And this time, we saw a customer very aggressively asking was simple for early seeding. So, we believe these were put in big growth. And -- however the very big growth in model should be in about summer or even after summer timeframe. So long-term, we have a very strong confidence, especially after summer. Before summer, depends on macroeconomic headwinds. We try to be more cautious.
Ananda Baruah: Very helpful, Charles. And, Charles, last for me, I believe you mentioned potential for more large data centers in the second half of calendar ‘23. Did I hear that accurately? And are those incremental data centers, if I heard it accurately? And any more context you could provide around that? Thanks.
Charles Liang: Yes. I mean, as you know, we start to approach large accounts since maybe one year ago. So, we continue to gain interest from those CSP and larger accounts. And that’s why we increased having capacity for lower production cost to support those larger accounts. And we even started a big campus in Malaysia. So, the goal is to increase our production capacity and lower our operation and production costs, so that we are able to support those larger accounts with reasonable profitability. So, we continue to gain some engagement and interest from larger accounts around the world. And also at the same time, we also started to engage with lots of mini size accounts, especially those through B2B and B2C. So, we are engaging with much broader customer base now.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.
Mehdi Hosseini: Couple of follow-ups. It seems like the price decline in the December quarter has more to do with the mix. And I am assuming that the OEM and large data center mix went down from 15, September to 42% in December. And in that context, my question to you is how should I think of the mix in the March quarter, and how will that impact unit and ASP trends?
Charles Liang: In March quarter, because of the market headwind, so we still tried to be cautious. But after summer, our feeling become much stronger, because a lot of good products, lots of engagement from larger accounts, middle sized account and even small -- a lot of small accounts.
Mehdi Hosseini: So, Charles, I just want to understand, would the mix of revenue from OEM and large data center decline again in the March quarter?
Charles Liang: Yes. I would say. Yes.
Mehdi Hosseini: And then, I also want to understand how you see the ramp of these three different CPUs. You have always -- you’ve historically been a close partner of Intel, AMD and NVIDIA. How long in advance do you actually procure those components in advance of building the boxes? How much of the inventory commitment or working capital commitment do you have to make before the actual high volume manufacturing takes place?
Charles Liang: Indeed we have a very close partnership with all of our vendors. So, in this area, I believe we are similar to the industry standard or slightly better. David, you may…
David Weigand: Yes. Many things have improved recently, as you know, on the supply chain side. So, we used to procure further in advance. And so one of the reasons our inventories have come down, one of the reasons our cash flows have been -- have increased. And by the way, we had net income the last two quarters of $360 million, we had free cash flow of $454 million. And so, again, the reason for that is we had to invest less money in inventory. So, our ability to produce products is faster now, because we can buy later in the cycle. But to your point on the timing, some of it’s going to be dependent on when in the quarter our customers are taking the bulk of their products. So, if we have early quarter shipments versus late quarter shipments, that can affect the timing of our inventory and accounts payable.
Mehdi Hosseini: And then one last question for me on the balance sheet, especially with the Malaysia facility coming on line, are you still targeting, like a $45 million of CapEx for fiscal year ‘23, or more or less?
David Weigand: Yes, so, fair question. So, we’re going to add in -- for Q3, we’re adding a $4 million of CapEx for Malaysia, and we’ll add $9 million in our Q4, for Malaysia. So that’ll be $13 million for our fiscal second half. And then, this is going to be an investment over a couple -- over several years. And so, we’ll make another $13 million in the first half of fiscal ‘24. So, that’s not -- that’s given you a little more insight on that investment.
Mehdi Hosseini: Should I assume that just the maintenance CapEx out to the Malaysia is what, $8 million to $10 million a quarter?
David Weigand: Yes, that’s correct. So, your question, yes, you can maintain the 45 and just add in the figures that I just gave you.
Operator: Our final question comes from the Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Markets.
Nehal Chokshi: Great, thanks. I get to leadoff and cleanup, awesome. So, relative to seasonal patterns, and excluding the 21.9% customer from the September quarter, how did the business actually perform in the December quarter then?
David Weigand: So, the December quarter was an outstanding quarter on in every respect. And so from free cash flow, inventory, all the metrics were strong, cash position. So, as you mentioned, customer -- no customer concentration. And so, we feel we had a really good -- a really great quarter.
Nehal Chokshi: I mean, my interpretation here is that the core business excluding that 120%-plus customer from the September quarter was up more than seasonal. Is that a correct interpretation?
David Weigand: Well, we always have customers that will take -- when we have design wins, Nehal, we’ll always -- from quarter-to-quarter, we’ll always have shipments -- large shipments to customers. Sometimes it’s according -- sometimes they change their forecast, and we ship a little bit more in one quarter than another. So, we can’t control that always. But as we said, as the supply chain has improved, that was -- that dynamic was felt a lot harder during the supply chain crunch. Now that we’ve returned to a better supply chain, therefore, that’s why we feel we’ll return to more normal seasonality. But that can always be altered by a new design win that we get in one quarter or over two quarters.
Charles Liang: Yes. Basically, in ‘22, we had some larger accounts, but in fiscal year ‘23, now we are adding more larger accounts. So we are growing in more largely accounts and more midsize accounts, and also B2B, B2C. So, indeed, our customer mix is becoming much more diversified, much more healthier, and for sure the volume will be bigger. That’s why we extend to Malaysia for really lower cost operation and campus.
Nehal Chokshi: Presumably, just diversification with the larger customers is coming on the higher margin plug and play rack-scale products. Is that correct?
Charles Liang: We hope so. So anyway, that’s -- we feel we still have a lot of room to add more customers. And once we have a higher capacity in USA, Taiwan, Malaysia, our plan is to add a lot of more customers.
Nehal Chokshi: And then, is there a particular vertical that you guys are seeing the pushups from that -- that you were talking about for the quarter? [Ph]
Charles Liang: Data center. Right.
Nehal Chokshi: The Push-outs were not in data -- large data center?
David Weigand: Well, he was saying that they were in large data center, but so…
Charles Liang: In the large data centers?
David Weigand: Yes.
Charles Liang: Okay. All right. Very good. And then for the March quarter, you’re guiding to an 18% Q-over-Q decline in revenue. There’s clearly obviously some seasonality with March quarter. Then there might be, I guess, ongoing push outs from the large data center customers and then there’s also a macro element. Are these the three major elements that are driving the 18% Q-over-Q decline? And then could you potentially help parse out what are rank order of these three drivers here?
David Weigand: So Nehal, if you look back pre-COVID, our typical Q3 decline was 12%. Okay. So, that was during the time of normal seasonal patterns. During COVID, there was a different dynamic of course, because our supply was scarce. But we think as we return to normalized supply that we will have this kind of seasonality. 
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. And then, as far as the potential runoff of the large customer versus macro, any input as far as what’s the driver there, as far as the above the 12% typical Q-over-Q decline?
David Weigand: Well, we’re engaging with new customers all the time. And so, we’re not looking to be declining, and in fact, just the opposite. So, while we will have some seasonality as in a stable supply chain, we still have our growth plans that are intact and that we remain confident in.
Nehal Chokshi: And then my last question here is, did I hear correctly that there’s a new buyback that was implemented, something about $200 million buyback? Can you just clarify that?
David Weigand: No, that’s the existing, already approved buyback.
Nehal Chokshi: So, now that you guys have worked yourself back to a net cash position with the strong free cash flow that you’ve highlighted over past two quarters, is it reasonable to expect that you guys are going to put that back to work now?
David Weigand: Yes, it’s completely up to the Board, completely up to the Board. But, I think it’s certainly unreasonable.
Nehal Chokshi: We got one Board member here. Charles, your thoughts? Your thoughts on utilizing the buyback?
Charles Liang: You know, as why I say, the PE is still low and cash flow is strong, why not?
Operator: We have a question from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. So, just a quick follow-up, just a clarification. David, did you employ or did you say that the 10% plus customers that you had in September quarter of last year is going to come back or you’re going to have another 10% plus customer in the coming quarters? It was very confusing.
David Weigand: Yes. So Mehdi, the 10% customer we had a year ago September is a different customer. Okay? The 22% customer that we had in the recent September quarter, again a different customer, was below was did not constitute 10% of our revenues in Q2. Okay, did I clarify that?
Mehdi Hosseini: Sure. Just as a follow-up, do you expect that particular customer to come back, is that what the confidence behind the June quarter is?
David Weigand: Well, we have -- so…
Charles Liang: Indeed with our new product, indeed very strong offering. So we expect any time we will have a more new larger customer or old customer coming back is always very high possibility. And we are working with them very closely there, the partnership would come stronger ever.
Mehdi Hosseini: This is dynamic.
Charles Liang: Yes.
David Weigand: We thrive on repeat business.
Mehdi Hosseini: Thank you for clarification.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. With that said, concludes today’s conference. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q1  (2022-11-01 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Abbey and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Super Micro Computer Incorporated Fiscal Quarter One 2023 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.  Mr. Michael Staiger, you may begin your conference.
Michael Staiger: Good afternoon and thank you for attending Supermicro's call to discuss financial results for the first quarter, which ended September 30, 2022. With me today are Charles Liang, Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and  David Weigand, Chief Financial Officer. By now, you should have received a copy of the news release from the Company that was distributed at the close of regular trading and is available on the Company's website. As a reminder, during today's call, the Company will refer to a presentation that is available to participants in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website under the Events & Presentations tab. We have also published management's scripted commentary on our website. Please note that some of the information you’ll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expenses, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook, including guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 and the full fiscal year. There are a number of risk factors that could cause Supermicro's future results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our most recent 10-K filing for fiscal 2022, and our SEC filings. All these documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Supermicro's website. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Most of today's presentation will refer to non-GAAP financial results and business outlook. For an explanation of our non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to the accompanying presentation or to our press release published earlier today. In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today's press release and in the supplemental information attached to today's presentation. At the end of today's prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session for sell-side analysts to ask questions.  I'll now turn the call over to Charles.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I am very pleased to announce another fast growing quarter and a great start to our fiscal 2023. Supermicro is finally ready to do a big jump, for Green Computing and for being the best IT Total Solution company. Here are some key highlights for the quarter. First, revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 totaled $1.85 billion, up 79% year-on-year; above our guidance range of $1.52 billion to $1.62 billion, with growth rate at about 10 times greater than the overall IT industry. Our fiscal first quarter non-GAAP earnings per share grew over 490% year-over-year at $3.42 compared to $0.58 a year ago. It was well above the high end of our guidance range of $2.07 to $2.32. It was achieved by our leading designs, innovative products, our IT Total Solution, and our strong global operations. Especially, the growing utilization of our Taiwan facility is improving our ability to meet demand and making higher operating margin. Our plug-and-play Rack-Scale Total IT solutions and GPU-based systems have resulted in triple-digit percentage growth year-over-year. Along with excellent results from storage and 5G verticals, we are making solid market share gains. Growth in our major geographies skewed to the U.S. at 70% of total sales this quarter, driven by ongoing design wins from some of the top tier technology leaders. They recognize and accept the strong value proposition of our Green Computing technology and Total IT Solutions. We are off to a great start for fiscal 2023, and we expect our unprecedented growth momentum to continue. We are comfortably delivering quarterly revenue in the multibillion-dollar range, supporting our ambition of reaching $20 billion in the near distant future with a focus on increasing our profitability. Based on our current demand and capacity, we are forecasting $1.75 billion revenue for this December quarter, supporting our $7 billion annual revenue target for fiscal year 2023. We continue see opportunities for share gains across our TAM, especially with strong demands for our rack-scale Total IT Solutions and accelerated compute platforms. Despite already having the broadest server and storage portfolio in the industry, we are expanding our product lines by 25% in supporting our future growth. These additional new products will specifically be optimized for: number one, high-end AI workloads; second, 5G telco applications; third, accelerated storage systems; and number four, specific technology partner and top tier customer engagements. For the first time, we are offering standard OCP-optimized platforms and rack products. We are able to leverage our unique Building Block Solution designs instead of spending huge additional engineering, production resources and hardware/software investment. Combining our hardware Building Block Solution, advancing software, security and service features, our Total IT Solutions are getting ever stronger. To address the growing demand of Total IT Solutions, our manufacturing capacity in both Silicon Valley and Taiwan campuses continues to gear toward delivering more L10, L11 and L12 rack scale systems, including our new liquid cooled solutions. We are on target to scale our rack scale production capacity to 3000 racks per month in U.S. in the near future. We are also preparing to expand our rack scale Plug-and-Play solution in Europe and in Asia soon. Furthermore, as the component shortages start to ease, our ability to deliver our best-in-class solutions will begin to accelerate, giving our customers even greater confidence in our ability to service their IT needs. From a systems level perspective, we are ready to launch a full line of next generation products with technologies across our key partner ecosystem. For Intel, we are engaged with many large opportunities with Intel’s upcoming Gen 4 scalable Xeon CPU codenamed Sapphire Rapids. We now have hundreds of early seeding engagements including several dozen early shipments. Similar programs have been executing with AMD, and we have seen very strong demand for our upcoming Genoa CPU based platforms. With respect to NVIDIA, not only do we have the most complete portfolio of systems supporting H100 GPUs, but we have also developed many brand new architectures for the leading Metaverse and Omniverse partners. At the upcoming Super Computing event, we will be showcasing many new systems supporting these latest CPUs and GPUs, including our next generation water-cooled rack scale plug and play solutions. We work closely with our customers, designing solutions that are both optimized for performance and efficiency, putting them on the path of Green Computing. From a financial perspective, Supermicro’s Green Computing solution lowers customer datacenter TCO while maximize performance per kilowatt, increase compute capacity per rack, lower facilities costs while add location flexibility, in particular to power constrained regions with higher power cost. We expect to see elevated demand for energy efficient rack scale solutions across the tier-1 and tier-2 datacenter ecosystems. Thus, we now have enabled our popular SuperBlades, Twin product lines and some of GPU product lines to be fully optimized for liquid-cooling solutions and free-air cooling datacenter environment. Soon, we will start to offer fully redundant liquid cooling on the system level similar to its air-cooled counterparts for even more peace of mind. If half of the IT industry adapts Supermicro’s Green Computing solutions or develops solutions as green as ours, together we can potentially save the industry up to $10 billion in electricity costs per year, which is equivalent of eliminating about 30 fossil fueled power plants. That is also equivalent to preserving eight billion trees for our planet. With planning in advance for green computing, indeed Green Computing can be free, with bonus! To summarize, we are emerging as one of the largest global suppliers of global IT solutions. There are some key factors that enable Supermicro to continue with its ability to make strong market share gains. First, our unique building block solution design methodology enables us to create optimized products from system level to rack-scale. Second, our IT Products Solutions strategy, including data center management software, security features, cloud stack and service, offers customers a peace of mind and quicker time to market while expanding our TAM. Our unique operation model, with business headquarters and campuses in U.S., Asia and Europe is pivotal in supporting these key growth drivers. Third, our Green Computing DNA helps our customers achieve much lower TCO while saving the Mother Earth. As I have mentioned earlier, Green Computing can be free with proper advanced planning, with a bonus that keeps paying back. With that, I expect our fiscal Q2 revenue will be in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion, and our fiscal 2023 should reach $6.5 billion to $7.5 billion. Looking ahead, I anticipate fiscal year 2024 revenue may reach the range of $8 billion to $10 billion considering the current economic headwind may last for many quarters. As we continue to gain IT market share with the best rack-scale Plug-and-Play IT Total Solutions, I believe we will soon become a $20 billion revenue company. Our business model has been optimized, our engineering teams are fully ready, and our worldwide campus production capacity and efficiency are now second to none. Let me not forget, I want to take a moment to thank our Super Micro employee teams, our suppliers, and our partners for their continued dedication to making Super Micro a market leader. Now I will pass the call to David Weigand, our Chief Financial Officer to provide additional details on the quarter.
David Weigand: Thank you, Charles. I'm pleased to report Q1 fiscal 2023 revenues of $1.85 billion, a 79% year-on-year and 13% quarter-on-quarter increase. Revenues exceeded our initial guidance range of $1.52 billion to $1.62 billion and our recently updated range of $1.78 billion to $1.82 billion. Our growth momentum continued with our rack-scale Total IT Solutions targeting growing markets and customers with accelerated GPU/AI workloads, software-defined storage and networking, public and hybrid cloud, and 5G/Edge/IoT Platforms. Our Green Computing Solutions helped us gain market share as customers valued both generating less carbon in our environment and reducing their operating costs. These growth drivers have resulted in accelerated revenues with expanding margins and operating leverage. In fiscal Q1, Super Micro again recorded strong revenues across all three of our market verticals demonstrating the value we bring to our end markets and customers. We achieved $840 million in our Enterprise and Channel vertical, representing 45% of Q1 revenues versus 51% last quarter, that vertical was up 16% year-over-year and 1% quarter-over-quarter. The year-over-year growth in this segment was driven by our new product offerings. Our OEM appliance and large datacenter segment achieved $921 million in revenues, representing 50% of Q1 revenues versus 44% last quarter. This vertical was up 268% year-over-year and up 28% quarter-over-quarter with strong growth coming from design wins from datacenter and OEM appliance customers. Our 5G/Telco/Edge/IoT Segment achieved $90 million in revenues representing 5% of Q1 revenues, which was the same as last quarter. This was also – this vertical was also up 58% year-over-year and 9% quarter-over-quarter. Our mix of complete systems and rack-scale Total IT Solutions has been increasing steadily. Systems comprised 92% of total revenues and was up 102% year-over-year and 16% quarter-over-quarter as we saw growing success with our high-value rack-scale Total IT Solutions for emerging applications. Subsystems/accessories represented 8% of Q1 revenues and was down 24% year-over-year and down 9% quarter-over-quarter as we prioritized our key customers with high-growth rack-scale applications. On a year-over-year basis, the volume of systems and nodes shipped as well as system node ASPs increased due to product and customer mix. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, the volume of systems shipped decreased while nodes shipped and system node ASPs increased again due to product and customer mix. During fiscal Q1, we observed strength in the U.S. market with U.S. representing 70% of revenues; Asia represented 14%, Europe 13%, and Rest of World 3%. On a year-on-year basis, U.S. revenues increased 131% as we gained market share with our advanced rack-scale Total IT Solutions for high-growth server workloads. Asia increased 3%, Europe increased 31% and Rest of World increased 78%. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, U.S. revenues increased 21%, Asia decreased 4%, Europe increased 5%, and Rest of World decreased 5%. The Q1 non-GAAP gross margin was 18.8%, up 120 basis points quarter-over-quarter from Q4 and up 540 basis points year-on-year due to price discipline, lower freight costs and leverage from higher factory utilization. Our Q1 gross margin demonstrates the success of our high-value rack-scale Total IT Solutions. Turning to operating expenses, Q1 OpEx on a GAAP basis increased by 4% quarter-on-quarter and 17% year-on-year to $127.4 million. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses increased 3% quarter-on-quarter and increased 16% year-on-year to $117.3 million. Our non-GAAP operating margin increased significantly to 12.5% for the quarter versus 10.7% last quarter and 3.7% a year ago, demonstrating both improvements in gross margins and operating leverage. Other Income & Expense was approximately $4.1 million in income primarily consisting of $7.8 million in foreign-exchange gains offset by interest expense of $3.9 million as compared to $4 million in FX gain and $2.9 million in interest expense last quarter. Interest expense increased sequentially as we reduced short-term credit lines while interest rates increased. The tax provision for Q1 was $38.9 million on a GAAP basis and $42.1 million on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP tax rate for Q1 was 17.4% and non-GAAP tax rate was 17.9%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax expenses increased due to the higher level of pre-tax profits. Lastly, our share of income from our JV was a loss of $0.9 million this quarter as compared to a gain of $0.3 million last quarter. We delivered strong Q1 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $3.42 which was up 490% year-over-year and up 31% quarter-over-quarter and exceeded the high end of the original guidance range of $2.07 to $2.32 and the recently updated range of $3.05 to $3.20. The increases to earnings per share were due to a combination of higher revenues, higher gross margins from manufacturing efficiency, price discipline and operating leverage. Turning to the balance sheet and working capital metrics compared to last quarter, our Q1 cash conversion cycle improved to 95 days versus 100 days in Q4, still above our target range of 85 days to 90 days. Days of inventory was 100, representing a decrease of seven days versus the prior quarter of 106 days as we managed our inventory more efficiently. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially by $98 million from strong collections, while accounts payable increased sequentially by $130 million due to the timing of payments to our vendors. Days sales outstanding was down by three days quarter-on-quarter to 39 days while days payables outstanding came down by four days to 44 days. For fiscal Q1, we generated positive cash flow from operations of $314 million versus cash used in operations of $25 million last quarter. The positive operating cash flow was due to higher profitability along with better management of inventory and working capital. Revenue growth was 79% year-over-year and 13% quarter-over-quarter, while inventory grew 47% year-over-year and 12% quarter-over-quarter. CapEx was $10.8 million for Q1 resulting in positive free cash flow of $303 million versus negative free cash flow of $36 million last quarter. The closing balance sheet cash position was $238 million, while bank debt was reduced to $250 million as we paid down $347 million in short-term debt during the quarter. We did not buy back any shares during the quarter and have $200 million in share repurchase authorization until January 31, 2024. Now turning to the outlook for our business, we are carefully watching the global macro-economic situation and supply-chain dynamics. For the second quarter of fiscal 2023 ending December 31, 2022 we expect net sales in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion, GAAP diluted net income per share of $2.54 to $2.81 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $2.64 to $2.90. We expect gross margins to be down 75 basis points to 100 basis points due to competition from a strong U.S. dollar and macro-economic conditions. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $133 million and include $11.8 million in stock-based compensation that is not included in non-GAAP operating expenses. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to increase in Q2 due to continued investments in R&D and higher personnel costs. We expect other income and expense, including interest expense to be a net gain of approximately $1.6 million and expect a nominal contribution from our joint venture. The company's projections for GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per common share assume a GAAP tax rate of 17.4%, a non-GAAP tax rate of 17.9%, and a fully diluted share count of 55.7 million for GAAP and 57.0 million shares for non-GAAP. We expect CapEx for the fiscal second quarter of 2023 to be in the range of $7 million to $10 million. For the fiscal year 2023 ending June 30, 2023 we are raising our guidance for revenues from a range of $6.2 billion to $7 billion to a range of $6.5 billion to $7.5 billion. GAAP diluted net income per share from at least $7.27 to a range of $8.50 to $11, and non-GAAP diluted net income per share from at least $7.50 to a range of $9 to $11.30. The company's projections for GAAP annual net income assumes a tax rate of 19.2% and a rate of 19.8% for non-GAAP net income. For fiscal year 2023, we are assuming a fully diluted share count of 57 million shares for GAAP and 58.4 million shares for non-GAAP. The outlook for fiscal year 2023 fully diluted GAAP EPS includes approximately $32.7 million in expected stock-based compensation and other expenses, net of tax effects that are excluded from non-GAAP diluted net income per common share. As we look ahead to the rest of fiscal 2023, we expect that our improved profitability together with good working capital management will lead to operating cash flow in line with net income. We remain confident in our long-term outlook for robust revenue growth and profitability driven by our leading-edge new platforms, design wins, market share gains and engagement with significant new global customers. Michael, we're now ready for Q&A.
Michael Staiger: Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jon Tanwanteng from CJS Securities. Your line is open.
Jon Tanwanteng: Hi, good afternoon everyone. Thank you for taking my questions and congratulations on a really, really impressive quarter. My first question is just looking at the guidance and I know you raised this, but the midpoint still suggests you're anticipating declining quarters on average for the rest of the year. Is that express function of – an expectation of perhaps with a recession or macroeconomic pressure on your clients? Or are you thinking of specific customer programs there at the midpoint or is something else? I know in the past, you've put in a cushion there for what has been supply chain constraint. Just help us understand what you're thinking within the brackets of this year going forward.
Charles Liang: Yes, very good question as the macroeconomic condition is how to predict at this moment look like there will be some headwind for sure. But with the coming soon several rapid new technology from Intel, AMD, Genoa and NVIDIA H100, so there are lots of new opportunity for us whenever the market have a new technology, Supermicro [indiscernible] chance to gain mark share. So with that, indeed, I believe our business in next 12 months should be not too – not too much impact. And also our business automation like in the last few quarters I mentioned about our auto configurator, our online automation that will help ourselves to service customer better. And with those offset the new product, the better tool, I believe our next 12 months business won't be too bad.
Jon Tanwanteng: Great, thank you for that. And then the second question just with the really strong cash flow you have in the quarter and an expectation for future cash generation, what are your priorities there for cash usage? I know you mentioned you still have that share repurchase program, which you didn't use. Are there any CapEx plans or should we be thinking of any other things you may want to use the cash to invest in?
David Weigand: So we haven't changed our CapEx allocation strategy. We still have a repurchase plan in place as market – and the board review that policy. And otherwise our CapEx for next quarter was listed as $7 million to $10 million and so we don't anticipate large increases in inventory.
Charles Liang: And this year is, again, that's why I just mentioned so many new technologies coming. So we'd like to take this chance to continue to gain market share. So hopefully Supermicro [indiscernible] a $10 billion company and then $20 billion company. So we'll continue to focus on quickly growing the company market share and our position.
Jon Tanwanteng: Got it. One more if I could. Did you see any weakness in the quarter from any end markets or customers or geographies?
Charles Liang: Yes. Generally a little bit kind of signal we need to observe that, but again new product, new technology that will offset this macro economy weakness.
Jon Tanwanteng: Okay, great. Thank you very much guys.
Charles Liang: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nehal Choski from Northland Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Nehal Choski: Yes, thank you, amazing quarter, really impressive guidance shows strong visibility here. And I'm sorry I missed quite a bit of a conference call, so you probably already hit upon this, but what are you seeing on the supply chain side at this point?
Charles Liang: Supply chain has been dramatically improved, as you may know, right. Three months ago, they have seen a shortage everywhere, but as of today, the shortage problem has been dramatically improved, so not much shortage at this moment. And we believe looking for growth in the coming quarters we won't have a shortage problem. After this, that won't be too bad and that's why we prepared to grow market share.
Nehal Choski: Okay, great. At what point in time does you actually see the supply chain shortage more or less evaporate?
Charles Liang: Indeed since quickly improved in about last two months.
Nehal Choski: Okay, great. And then really incredible free cash flow generation, I haven't run through numbers yet to figure out how that was done given the strong growth. Can you just walk me through what was the driver of the strong free cash flow generation?
David Weigand: Sure, absolutely. You can see our cash conversion cycle came down and that was a result of, we were able to speed collections and also we did receive some advance customer payments and we'll have a little bit more color on that in our 10-Q, which should be filed in the next few days. But we received about $70 million in advance payments from customers, so that helped us out. But still our cash flow from operations greatly exceeded our net income.
Charles Liang: Yes. In that one month or three months, I mean we have some cash pressure, major because global shortage, so we had to keep large amount of inventory, now inventory program have been improved because no more big supply chain challenge now.
Nehal Choski: Got it. Understood. Okay. And then Dave, did I hear you correctly that you expect free cash generation to be close to that non-GAAP net income for fiscal 2023?
David Weigand: Yes. Nehal, that's correct, because we have our – inventories are a little more reasonable now. And then what I mean by that is the supply – some of the supply chain issues we have our cash flows are a little more imbalanced and so we expect cash flows to be a little more in line with income.
Nehal Choski: Great. And then finally your updated low end of guidance implies and I think if we look at your prior low end of guidance implied that maybe you'd have a slightly negative year-over-year growth in the back half fiscal year 2023. Now this new updated guidance implies 10% to 15% revenue growth. So again, I'm sure you would stress this during the script, but what is driver of this improving growth outlook despite worsening macro that you're providing here at the low end of guidance by the way?
Charles Liang: Again, the major reason is a macroeconomic condition. Because no one really know how long the economic headwind will last. So we try to be more conscious.
Nehal Choski: Yes, understood. I guess my point is that the updated low end actually implies an improved year-over-year growth outlook on the back half of the year. This is despite a worsening macro. So what are you guys seeing that's effectively driving a raise in your back half revenue growth expectations?
David Weigand: Yes, we really have – we have growth in all of our verticals, Nehal, and not only that but geographically as well. So as Charles mentioned, there's new CPUs coming out from AMD, from NVIDIA, from Intel, as well as relative new product launches. So we think that all of those, the momentum that we have in our verticals as well as the new product introductions is what gives us guidance to the numbers that we put up.
Nehal Choski: Excellent. Fantastic job. Thank you for taking my questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Jon Tanwanteng from CJS Securities. Your line is open.
Jon Tanwanteng: Hi, thanks for taking my follow up. I was wondering if you were seeing any kind of impacts on the sanctions on China by the U.S. if there are any. I know earlier in the quarter, there's NVIDIA news; I know a lot of companies got added to the entry list where any of those are customers. How should we think about the consequences of those actions?
Charles Liang: Yes, we see some impact for sure and exactly how long that impact we are lasting, we still keeping watch.
David Weigand: Yes. So by the way, we didn’t have any customers that were added, however, as everyone knows the GPU sales became limited. China sales last quarter were less than 3%. So we don’t consider this to be a significant issue for us going forward.
Jon Tanwanteng: Understood. Thank you. And then in your guidance, do you have any impact from foreign exchange built in there or possibly price declines as maybe you’ve passed through declines in component costs as they occur.
David Weigand: Most of our contracts are invoices are U.S. dollar denominated. We – our FX really comes from the fact that we have some Taiwan dollar denominated loans, and that’s what causes the quarterly fluctuation in our FX is just marking the dollar to – the U.S. dollar to the Taiwan dollar. So therefore, the only impacts on FX come from really a price setting issues as opposed to balance sheet issues.
Jon Tanwanteng: Got it. Okay. And then lastly the strength in the quarter, did you observe any pulling or was it just more of the supply chain loosening up and being able to get more components and were there any push outs that you observed?
David Weigand: So we didn’t have any push outs. We had some customers, this will be in the 10-Q we had a couple customers who prepaid and whose shipments somewhat, which were made but were not – did not qualify for revenue recognition, others that would ship later. So that we didn’t have any push out, so.
Jon Tanwanteng: Okay. Great. Thanks, again.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from SIGS. Your line is open.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. A couple of follow-ups. Thanks for the update on the fiscal year and I just want to better understand how your system ASP would trend given the updated fiscal year 2023 revenue guides. I’m asking because you have done a really good job in increasing content, it’s captured in your system ASP, and I want to see if you would still be able to increase to see a system ASP increasing in double-digit figure. And I have a follow-up.
David Weigand: So Mehdi, probably may have heard that a lot of GPU prices and CPU prices are going up, especially with the new the new refreshes that are coming out. So we anticipate that ASPs will continue to go up.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay. Would – for your fiscal 2022, it was more than 30%, should we assume the acceleration or would you be able to keep up the pace?
Charles Liang: It’s a big question. I mean again, they are lots of new technology, new CPU, new GPU, so that will be a positive side, but at the same time, the macro economy can be – can put in some negative impact. So at this moment, we try to play safe, so that’s why the number I will share is relatively conservative.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay. So that’s good. A balance sheet question. And David, there was a line item. I think accounts payable also helped combine the $75 million of the prepayment. It helped with a positive cash flow operation. And in that context, how should I think about cash from operation in Q2 fiscal year 2023?
David Weigand: Yes. So I think that I think my general comments apply that our – we see our cash flows as now more balanced with income – with net income. And so we’ll get a – we’ll have a few puts and takes where customers prepay more or less from quarter-to-quarter. But we went – we underwent a lot of heavy lifting Mehdi to get our revenue levels up and our AR levels up as we were growing. And so to the extent that we have more growth, we will face those challenges, but based on our current forecasts, we expect cash flows to be close to net income.
Mehdi Hosseini: And then updated guide for CapEx in FY2023.
David Weigand: So we haven’t given a guide for FY2023 just for the next quarter.
Mehdi Hosseini: Should I assume similar capital intensity as last year, just for modeling cash flows?
David Weigand: I think we’ll come out with a little – with more of a guide later on.
Mehdi Hosseini: Got you. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah from Loop Capital. Your line is open.
Ananda Baruah: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Congrats on the ongoing momentum and thanks for taking the question. I have a few falls tonight, so I may ask something that’s already been addressed. If it is, we can just chat on it offline. But I would love just context on customer penetration, any new customer acquisition that was contributed to the quarter. And then any context you can give on what continues to be really, really good ongoing strength of those key application types that have been driving the business for the last number of quarters. Anything that you haven’t given yet, I can take it offline with you or get out the transcript. Anything that I missed if you’ve already talked about it, but there’s any additional context, we love to get it. Thanks.
Charles Liang: Yes, very good question. As I earlier just mentioned, we just introduced a couple of business automation tool, including auto configurator, including auto online, online service. So all of those were ahead of our sales, make our sales and customer relationship become more efficient, more accurate and we expect we are able to gain more customer, hopefully many more customer because of the improvement of our automation tool.
Ananda Baruah: And Charles…
Charles Liang: Again, with our much stronger storage product now, right, including all kind of data center management tool, our security tool and other service and applications. So yes, so we are in much stronger position from this point of view with our kind of large-scale total solution.
Ananda Baruah: And let me ask a follow-up too. And this may – this is something that could have come up earlier as well on the call in your pay remarks or in the Q&A. Sort of upcoming Intel AMD and Nvidia cycles, should we think of those as being potentially meaningfully incremental to your business run rate or those sort of blended in? But they sort of just like blend into the run rate? Thanks.
Charles Liang: For sure, customer will buy new product to replace that old product, right? But because we always have a stronger new product line, a new technology, that’s how we expect we will continue to gain customer base and also improve customer relationship because of a stronger product. And not just the hardware product like before, but now our total solution have customer a lot. And GreenComputing as you know, our GreenComputing is a total solution. And we make for example, water cooling much easier and much quicker delivery time. So all of those we believe will be a positive drive for our business growth.
Ananda Baruah: That’s super helpful. Thanks a lot guys. Thanks, Charles.
Charles Liang: Thank you.
David Weigand: Thanks.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Charles Liang, I turn the call back over to you.
Charles Liang: Thank you. Thank you for joining us today and expect to meet you next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2022-08-09 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to Super Micro Computer, Inc’s Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2022 Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Nicole Noutsios, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.
Nicole Noutsios: Good afternoon. And thank you for attending Super Micro's call to discuss financial results for the fourth quarter, which ended June 30, 2022. With me today are Charles Liang, Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Dave Weigand, Chief Financial Officer. By now, you should have received a copy of the news release from the company that was distributed at the close of regular trading and is available on the company's website. As a reminder, during today's call, the company will refer to a presentation that is available to participants on the Investor Relations section of the company's website under Events & Presentations tab. We have also published management's scripted commentary on our website. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expenses, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook, including guidance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 and the full year of 2023 and the potential impact of COVID-19 on the company’s business and results of operations.

In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today's press release and the supplemental information attached to today's presentation. At the end of today's prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session for sell-side analysts to ask questions. I will now turn the call over to Charles.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Nicole, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'm pleased to announce record year ended out with annual revenue surpassing milestone of 5.2 billion growing 46% year-over-year. We ended the year with another great quarter with fiscal Q4 2022 revenues of 1.64 billion growing 53% year-over-year, and 21% quarter-on-quarter, surpassing both top and bottom-line estimates. Our quarterly and year end results are above our guidance given three months ago and exceed our recently obtained range given several weeks ago. Our strong growth is fueled by recent run in design wins based on our rack scale total IT solutions, especially on GPU solutions and AI platforms. And I believe our solutions will continue to drive plenty of new design wins and accelerate our strong growth in the coming quarters and years. More customers are also recognizing and adopting the value of our green computing solutions, due to the rising environmental challenge and energy cost. The total solution strategy and green computing solution has resulted in our four consecutive quarters of growth at a minimum three times faster than competitors' growth story. Now, let's look at some of the key highlights from the year and quarter. First, our quarter 2022, revenue totaled 5.2 billion up 46% year-on-year above our guidance range of prior year. Our fiscal year non-GAAP earnings per share of $5.65 grew 128% year-over-year compared $2.48 a year ago which exceeded the higher end of our guidance range of $4.53 to $4.71. Our fiscal fourth quarter net revenue totaled $1.6 4 billion up 53% year-on-year and up 21% quarter-on-quarter above our guidance range of $1.4 billion to $1.48 billion. Our fiscal fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share tripled year-over-year and was $2.62 compared to $0.81 a year ago and was way above the high-end of our guidance range of $1.51 to $1.59 and pretty much now strong operating leverage and has more preference to our rack scale total IT solutions. With our total IT solutions experienced robust growth in USA this year. We will continue to gain even greater domestic attraction going forward. We will also expand our total IT solution to both Europe and Asia markets in the coming quarters and years. We are excited as of this generation opportunity to become a global leader of rack scale plug and play IT solutions. Our robust fiscal year results reinforced our competence in achieving the $10 billion in annual revenue target much sooner than we guide last year. And we are now preparing for our $20 billion mid-term mission that we discussed last quarter. Based on our current supply and capacity, at least at a midpoint of our guidance range. We are forecasting 1.57 billion in revenue for the upcoming September quarter. I'm also confident that our full fiscal 2023 revenue will be above the prior guidance range of 6 billion to 7 billion. We now expect revenue to be in the range of 6.2 billion to 7 billion with EPS at least at $7.50, following the macroeconomic conditions uncertainty, we are optimistic that some order supply chain and logistics issue will begin to subside. From a market perspective, we continue to see increasing demand for accelerating compute and AI platforms. We are meeting this demand at a both system and rack-scale level with our total IT solutions which are supported by our over 20 years of seasonal billing growth development. This billing growth products allow us to create highly optimized rack-scale plug and play direct single solutions for our customers with lower infrastructure cost and increase in significant TCO savings. Our total IT solution approach streamline design, dedication, solution and integration, resulting in a much shorter lead times for our customers which optimized quality and performance. Moreover, our total IT solution simplified integrated [indiscernible] control. In addition, our super cloud composer, orchestrator, security and other products can help only manage compute, acceleration, storage and network building products at cloud-enabled including rich analytics. Data center operator can easily leverage these information to [indiscernible] grow workload efficiency. So, we are expanding our investment in our data center management software stack that will enable to draw infrastructure as a service and secure monitoring as a service functionality for enhancing our total IT solution capability and value. This one stop shop approach we are aligned with emerging growth market across AI, machine learning, software defined storage, networking, public and hybrid cloud, and 5G, IoT and telco. We previously shared that we were certain that people in our community interface intelligent business automation, with new B2B B2C automation platform is being used and validated by more and more of our customer as we speak. These intelligent auto configurator will leverage our system building product methodology to carry out application optimized solutions to a much broader customer base. We expect that this tool will help tremendously grew our go-to-market initiatives, product design, operations, and service effectively. Most importantly, the automation process will considerably grow our customer base and improve customer satisfaction starting from pretty much this fiscal year. Our current manufacturing scale and capacity is a build to support between 10 billion to 12 billion in annual revenue as we continue to ramp up our next scale capabilities in our global facilities. During the June quarter, we shipped over 1000 plug and play rack, today -- in the September quarter, we have double our rack-scale capacity with enhanced features at our new building [indiscernible]. Our rack-scale capacity can be up to 6000 direct for quarter now. Our total development activities continue to grow strongly with close partnership with NVIDIA extending our GPU system product line including H100 very strong mix and very top product lines. Our early deployment programs with our upcoming Intel and AMD product lines are mostly ready just waiting for the new Intel and AMD processor to be available. Switching gear, we stay committed to lead the market in green computing solutions with our resource saving designs both to reduce environmental impact and of course our customers' operation. As we apply our green computing solutions at a rack-scale level, we can put in even better quality and time to market value to our customers. Higher energy costs and limitation on electricity usage will continue to strain many companies in the near future. We saw this dynamic and challenge since a decade ago, and we have been at the forefront with technology and solution that help customers go for higher temperature operation terra center, fully air cooling or liquid cooling. DNA of our customers achieved to getting TCO employee reduction in their data centers turn to 1.05 from the achieved evidence of 1.57 or even higher. By our calculations [indiscernible] adoption of our green computing solutions or other suppliers’ solution with similar energy visions will potentially save the IT industry more than $10 billion in electricity costs here or eliminating equivalent of more than 30 fossil fuel power plants equal to saving 8 billion trees of our planet. Personally, I’m very glad to see increased demand for energy efficient solutions for cost savings but more importantly, we must do this for our Mother Earth. Encouraging, we are focused on building and delivering much more greener rack-scale total IT solutions. From an industry perspective this is that greatest opportunity Super Micro has ever seen since our founding 29 years ago. Our year-over-year top and bottom-line performance is evidence that our total IT solution strategy is accelerating. I see our room to grow is at least another 4x in the coming years why we believe that our time will continue to expand with continued applications. We will continue to address these technology intersection by enhancing our total IT solutions, capability and capacity with the most software and we will continue to gain market share and extend it to new verticals, which increase our business scale and operating [Technical Difficulty]. My team and I will continue to escalate our growth strategies and accelerating the timeline to our 10 billion revenue target is short-term and $20 billion revenue in the future. I will now pass the call to Dave Weigand, our Chief Financial Officer to provide additional details of the quarter. Thanks.
David Weigand: Thank you, Charles. I'm pleased to report fiscal fourth quarter revenues of 1.64 billion or 53% year-on-year and 21% quarter-on-quarter increase. Our revenues exceeded our initial guidance range of 1.4 billion to 1.48 billion and our recently updated range of 1.58 billion to 1.63 billion. For fiscal year 22, we reported revenues of 5.2 billion representing 46% growth over fiscal year 21 revenues of 3.56 billion. Our growth initiatives are gaining momentum with our total IT solutions targeting fast growing markets and customers with accelerated GPU and AI workloads, software defined storage and networking, public and hybrid cloud and 5G Edge IoT platform. These new growth drivers complement our traditional strength, with enterprise channel and OEM customers, leading to accelerated revenue growth, expanding margins and operating leverage. In the fourth fiscal quarter Super Micro recorded balanced revenues across all three of our market verticals, demonstrating the resilient nature of our diversified end markets. We achieved 835 million in organic enterprise and channel and AI and revenues representing 51% of Q4 revenues versus 62% last quarter, up 24% year-over-year and flat quarter-over-quarter. The year-over-year growth in this segment was driven by our growing list of large enterprise customers and new product offerings. Our OEM appliance and large data center segments achieved 717 million in revenues representing 44% of Q4 revenues versus 32% last year, up 95% year-over-year and up 67% quarter-over-quarter with strong growth driven by large new and existing data center customers and OEM appliance customers. Our 5G telco edge IoT segment achieved 83 million in revenues representing 5% of Q4 revenue versus 6% last quarter and was up 172% year-over-year and down slightly by 4% quarter-over-quarter. For the full fiscal year 2022, our organic enterprising channel and AI and our revenues grew 40% to represent 61% of fiscal year 22 revenues. Our OEM appliance and large data center segment grew 44% and represent 32% of revenues. Our emerging 5G, telco edge and IoT segment grew 163% and represented 7% of total revenues. Our mix of complete systems and rack-scale total IT Solutions has been increasing steadily. Systems comprise 91% of total revenue and subsystem accessories represented 9% Q4 revenue. On a year-over-year basis and also on a quarter-over-quarter basis, the volume of systems and nodes shipped as well as system node ASP increased due to product and customer mix. We had a balanced distribution of Q4 revenues across geographies, with U.S. representing 66% of revenues, Asia 17%, Europe 14% and rest of the world 20%. On a year-on-year basis, U.S. revenues increased 65% as the gained market share with our advanced Rack-scale total IT solutions for emerging high growth server workloads. Asia increased 38%, Europe increased 21% and the rest of the world increased 8%. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, U.S. in revenues increased 41%, Asia decreased 9%, Europe increased 9% and the rest of the world 30%. In Q4 non-GAAP gross margin was 17.6% up 200 basis points quarter-over-quarter from Q3 and up 390 basis points year-on-year due to price discipline, lower freight costs, leverage from higher factor utilization, operating efficiencies and our continually improving product customer mix. While the supply chain disruptions achieved some success in controlling freight and other logistics costs through disciplined execution. Our Q4 gross margin was above the high-end of our long-term target model range of 14% to 17% and demonstrates the success of our new high value total IT solutions. Turning to operating expenses. Q4 OpEx on a GAAP basis increased slightly by 1% quarter-on-quarter and 15% year-on-year to 122 million. On a non-GAAP basis operating expenses increased 4% quarter-on-quarter and increased 15% year-on-year from 113.5 million. Our non-GAAP operating margin increased significantly to 10.7% for the quarter versus 7.5% last quarter and 4.4% a year ago, demonstrating both improvements in gross margin driven by new product and customer mix and operating leverage driven by higher revenue along with disciplined expense control. Our non-GAAP operating margin of 10.7% for Q4 was also above our target model range of 5% to 8%. Other income and expenses approximately $1 billion in income consisting of 4 million in foreign exchange gain offset by interest expense of 2.9 million as compared to 4.7 million in FX gain and 1.5 million in interest expense last quarter. Our interest expense increased sequentially as we utilize our short-term credit line before financing inventory and accounts receivable. We also experienced higher short-term interest rates on borrowings driven by recent fed-ex. This quarter the tax provision was 25.8 million on a GAAP basis 29.9 million on a non-GAAP basis. Our GAAP tax rate for Q4 was 15.5% and our non-GAAP tax rate was 17.1. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax expenses increased higher levels of pre tax profit, but though the rates were lower sequentially. Lastly, our share of income from our JV was $0.3 million this quarter as compared to [Technical Difficulty] last quarter. We delivered strong Q4 non-GAAP diluted EPS of 262, which exceeded the high end of the original guidance range of 151 to 169 and our recently updated range of 230 to 240. The increases to EPS were due to a combination of higher revenues, higher gross margins from manufacturing efficiency, price discipline, product and customer mix and operating leverage. For the full fiscal year 2022, we reported non GAAP diluted EPS of $5.65 which was up 128% year-over-year versus fiscal 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS of 248 and higher than our initial guidance of 471. Cash flow used in operations for Q4 was 25 million compared to cash flow used in operations of 228 million for Q3 due to our improved profitability, along with better management of our inventory and working capital. Despite the 21% quarter-over-quarter increase in revenues, trimmed our inventory by 3% quarter-over-quarter. Accounts receivable increased sequentially due to higher revenues, while accounts payable decreased sequentially due to the timing of payments to our vendors. Our CapEx was $11 million for Q4 bookings and negative free cash flow of 36 million versus negative free cash flow of 239 million last quarter. Our closing balance sheet cash position was 267 million while bank debt was 597 million, as we utilized our bank lines of credit for those higher revenues [Technical Difficulty] and accounts receivable as we ramped production of new design wins globally. As we look ahead to fiscal 2023, we expect that our continued growth in revenue and profitability together with improved working capital management leads to better operating and free cash flow. We're optimistic that some of the supply chain and logistic costs begin to stabilize. We remain confident in our long-term outlook for robust revenue growth and profitability driven by our leading-edge new platforms design win, market share gain and engagement with significant new global customers. We are announcing -- also attribute $200 million stock buyback program today [Technical Difficulty] through January 31, 1.4. Turning to the balance sheet and working capital metrics compared to last quarter, our Q4 cash conversion cycle was 100 days, versus 98 days in Q3 and above our target range of 85 to 90 Days. Days of inventory was 106 representing a decrease of 11 days versus the prior quarter of 117 that managed our inventory more efficiently. Day sales outstanding is up by three days quarter-on-quarter with 42 days, while days payable outstanding came down to [Technical Difficulty] by 10 days to 48 days. Now turning to the outlook for our business, we remain enthusiastic about design wins and plug and play flag sale total IT solutions ramping in multiple in markets. We're carefully watching the global macroeconomic situation, continuing supply chain disruptions for the first fiscal quarter 2023 ending September 30, 2022, we expect net sales in the range of 1.52 billion to 1.62 billion. GAAP diluted net income per share of $2.01 to $2.27 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share up to $2.07 to $2.32. We expect gross margins to be similar to Q4 levels. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately 126 million and they include 8.6 million in stock-based compensation 1.5 million in other expenses that are not included in non-GAAP operating expenses. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to increase due to continued investment in R&D and higher personnel costs. We expect other income and expense, including interest expense to be a net expense of approximately 3.6 million and expect a nominal contribution from our joint venture. The company's projections for GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per share, assume a GAAP tax rate of 19.4%. Our non-GAAP tax rate of 20.3% and a fully diluted share count of 54.8 million for GAAP and 56.2 million shares for non-GAAP. We expect CapEx for the fiscal first quarter of 2023 be in the range of $6 billion to $8 billion. For the fiscal year 2023, ending June 30, 2023, we are giving guidance for revenues in a range of 6.2 billion to 7 billion. GAAP diluted net income per share of at least $7.27 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $7.50. The company's projections for GAAP annual net income procurement tax rate of 20.3 and a rate of 21.1 for non-GAAP net income. For fiscal year 23, we are assuming a fully diluted share count of 55.6 million shares for GAAP and 57 million shares for non-GAAP. The outlook for fiscal 2023 fully diluted, GAAP earnings per share includes approximately 35.4 million and expected stock-based compensation and other expenses net of tax effects that are excluded from non-GAAP net income per share. Now, Nicole, will turn it back to you..
Nicole Noutsios: Operator you can open the line up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Nehal Chokshi: Congratulations on amazing results. Amazing guidance clearly showing sustainable share gains story here. Let's talk about the gross margin, I think this is the first time I've heard Super Micro talk about better prices as a driver of gross margin expansion, which is great, but can you delve into why do you believe your existing prices for now versus in the past?
David Weigand: Okay. So I missed just a little bit of what you said Nehal. You said what was the question?
Nehal Chokshi: I believe, this is the first time I've heard you guys talk about price discipline being a driver of gross margin expansion. And so I'd like to understand why is that happening now?
David Weigand: Okay. Got you. So, we have -- it took us some time to adjust to the rising freight costs and another component costs and so we managed to adjust those properly. And then, we also got some tailwind from finally from freight costs coming down 20% in q4. So those two things combined allowed us to have a higher gross margin.
Charles Liang: Essentially our scale -- building scale continue to grow and we maintain a very good product line and also when building scale growth, yes, we will have a higher gross margin and net margin.
Nehal Chokshi: Got it. Great. And then, can you give a little bit more detail on the driver of the -- strength in the quarter which was leading edge vertical solutions and OEM appliance in large data center segments?
Charles Liang: Yes. Recently we have indeed handled four of really a good product win including most of them indeed high-end AI platform. So our AI platform continue to gain market share and especially rack-scale plug and play. We have a complete rack install customer so it's makes customers job much easier. And most of it and see what rack just starting to power cable then there are cable and then ready to run. So that really attract some customers.
Nehal Chokshi: What about within the OEM side? Was the driver there on OEM side?
Charles Liang: [indiscernible] indeed it's pretty much our standard product. Our standard product for customer, we want some really top 10 highest value company around the world.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay, great. And then finally, what are your expectations for cash conversion cycle is the semi cycle appears to be entering a down cycle now?
David Weigand: Well, we expect our cash conversion cycle to come down Nehal, for a couple of reasons. Number one, our profitability has been increasing. And secondly, we've been able to manage our inventories better. So and the reason for that is in Q3, we were building inventory as we were getting ready to start the launch of some design wins. And those design wins really, really got traction and that allowed us to kind of even out our inventory. So we expect our cash flow and cash conversion cycle to improve.
Nehal Chokshi: Great, congratulations.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is open.
Ananda Baruah: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Yes, thanks for taking the question. And congrats on strong results and very solid execution. Thanks. Congrats on that. So I guess a few if I could. Kind of piggybacking of Nehal's question, like in a bigger picture context, are there any other kinds of key aspects of what you guys seeing going on this leading to the ongoing acceleration in revenue generation? And I guess, Charles, is it all share gain? Are there other things that you guys are seeing that's been leaving the last couple quarters to the accelerated revenue generation run rate?
Charles Liang: Thank you. Indeed, we start to our folks on rack-scale total solution, rack-scale plug and play since the last three years ago, so it gets to the point where [indiscernible] to make an order, how do we and sort of where, from where people were chained. So now we start again started remodeling more deal, especially top 10 or top 30 highest [indiscernible] country around the world. So if we are very comfortable, we were convenient again, to win more in AI high-end platform and total solution, including storage, including switch, the kind of complete [indiscernible] or using rack-scale plug and play solution?
Ananda Baruah: Hey, got it, I got it. So it sounds like it sounds like a big component in this share, and it is really continuing to resonate in the marketplace. Both of the total solutions and what you're able to actually provide to the customer with that total solution. So it sounds like it's just easier to use, and it's stronger product, those two things combined. And yes, I would just say, are you seeing parts of the marquee aspects of your end markets actually accelerate? Well, I guess I'd love to know, like, what's your opinion on kind of the tenor of demand in your key areas kind of the last 90 days versus the prior 90 days? It seems like you've actually seen some acceleration as the state from just shared gain. But how would you guys characterize that particularly in the macro backdrop?
Charles Liang: Yes, actually you may know, I mean, AI, deep learning, being compared to grow, including metaverse, lots of customer, lots of company continuing to invest heavily in those areas. And it's for now we have -- I would like to say exactly that pace for AI platform around the world, doesn't matter, really high end, or all kinds of high volume platform enabled or rack-scale enabled or cloud enabled. So our investment in that three start to gain customers attention as we save their big time especially, most of the time in the industry, people take them maybe two miles to three miles to finish shipping, a rack scale, cluster, and it takes us much shorter, because we optimize the inventory and total solution and ship it to customer with a much shorter lead times and customer really appreciate that as well.
Ananda Baruah: Sorry, no, I don't want to cut you off. That's great content Charles. I'll see [indiscernible] for now. Thanks. Appreciate it.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jon Tanwanteng with CJS Securities. Your line is open.
Jon Tanwanteng: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Can you hear me?
Charles Liang: Yes, Jon.
Jon Tanwanteng: Okay, great. The gross margins about 17%, the high-end of your range, is that sustainable over this year? And do you think that you should be changing your long-term target range a bit?
David Weigand: The answer is, yes, it is sustainable. And we will be reviewing our new target levels. But it's really, as Charles mentioned, we've had a lot of customers come to us, and we've design very special solutions for them. And these solutions have a value. And they're high value to the industry and to our customers. And so we are -- when I say price discipline, and we've realized, higher value for some of our solutions. And we've had the good fortune of being able to secure enough supply to start to ramp up of those solutions.
Jon Tanwanteng: That's great news. Thanks. And then, do you see any indications of your customers being impacted by recessionary pressures at all? And maybe go along with that what assumptions, if any, are in your guidance regarding macroeconomic or geopolitical risk?
Charles Liang: It depends. Some customers, we saw them slow down, but not for other customer, indeed, continue to increase their demand, especially for high-end AI platform for those future products. And, by the way, I mean, there a lot of new technology, coming out quarter-out-quarter or month-after-month. So at this moment, we believe our macro economy may slow down at ADP, but our demand should continue growing.
Jon Tanwanteng: Okay, great. And the guidance that you gave for the next quarter that sequential decline at the midpoint? Is that more indication of just seasonality or supply? Or is it maybe more of this macro slowdown that maybe some of your customers are seeing?
Charles Liang: Two reasons, one is supply chain. We still facing some supply chain constraints. Some parts have been more available than before last year, lots of past year in shortage that's one thing. Second thing, in our September quarter used to be our slow season. So both reason, and that's why we tried to be more conservative.
Jon Tanwanteng: Okay, understood. And last one if I may, just when do you need to think about investing in new capacity. I know you guys have up to 10 billion to 12 billion in your current facilities, but at your current growth rate, you probably have to start thinking about it pretty soon. So I was just wondering what your plans are, if you need to get there. And where you might start investing if you need to do so?
Charles Liang: In addition to that, because we [indiscernible] really global market yet, we are very strong in some countries, some territory, but in other countries, we are still pretty mean. So our solution is able to grow with much higher scale. We just need more warehouse, more production, making power and then we can achieve a more productive customer as far as how we, are far away from where product assumption has been ready. And we haven't replicated the end market to more countries and we already are a premium product.
Jon Tanwanteng: Okay, great. Thanks, guys. And again, congrats on a fantastic quarter.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is open.
Ananda Baruah: Oh, God. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it. I just love to get a little more context on the mix dynamic. Charles that you guys you talked about in his remarks, it sounds like meaningful aspects of the mix is a total solution. Are there any other components of mix that we should be aware of and contributing to that dynamic? Or is it primarily the total solutions that are resonating increasingly?
Charles Liang: Very good question. Indeed, that's why we start to prepare, rack-scale plug and play about three years ago. So it took us -- acquired a lot of April to train our people to make it or facility or components ready, especially a street communication networking device. And finally every single ad we start to gain more customer, gain more design win. I believe those design wins will continue and at this moment, I feel pretty positive in the continued growth in those areas.
Ananda Baruah: That's really awesome. And are there any particular verticals that those rack scales tend to go into or targeted at more, or that they'll resonate with more or just sort of across all your verticals? Do you think the rack scale has a real place?
Charles Liang: AI, people learning, metaverse, omniverse and at the beginning, high end gaming, automation, scientific application. So it is a local area, even kind of lack of forecasting company, also having some strong demand.
Ananda Baruah: That's super helpful context as always. Just, I guess, just let me up to two last quick ones here. Sounds like the backlog probably grew again, over the last 90 days, given your comment around constraints. Is that accurate?
Charles Liang: Yes, because, they are not [indiscernible]. And that's why we keep in our inventory, so that we can support a continual growth demand. Basically, our image here is pretty healthy. We have some high volume inventory, but they are under strong demand. So like, at this moment, I don't worry about inventory level.
Ananda Baruah: Great. And then last one for me, guys. Is Charles, just an update on Taiwan? How would you characterize the utilization level there now?
Charles Liang: It’s growing faster. But we always suffering supply chain shortage in that nine months, already. So I hope the supply chain will continue to get better. And once that happen, I reckon Taiwan can be much improved. At the moment, I believe our evaluation rate in Taiwan, only about 45% or so.
Ananda Baruah: And so Dave? Dave, sort of 40 -- let's say 45% utilization. Does that mean when you guys get to sort of normalized utilization, which is still expected, Dave, what was it like 150 to a [indiscernible] before it's a gross margin contribution on top of where you guys are right now?
David Weigand: From their shipments. Yes, that's right. We said 100 to 200 from Taiwan.
Ananda Baruah: So 100 to 200 from Taiwan not 100 to 200. So it's not 100 to 200 to the overall P&L, it's 100 to 200...
David Weigand: That's correct. Yes.
Ananda Baruah: Got you. Now Taiwan is going to be approaching half year volume at some point. So would that sort of be long-term 50 to 100 basis points to the overall P&L.
David Weigand: That's a fair way of looking at it.
Ananda Baruah: Okay, awesome. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.

Charles Liang: Thank you, Nicole, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I am pleased to announce our quarterly revenue of $1 billion – $1.36 billion for fiscal year Q3 2022, which was 51% year-over-year growth and 16% quarter-on-quarter growth sequentially. These results are well above our guidance given three months ago and above our recently updated range given two weeks ago. The continued five quarters of strong earnings indicate our total IT solution growth strategy is working well, and we are only at the very beginning of the breakout. Now let's look at some of the key highlights from the quarter. First, again, our fiscal third quarter net revenue totaled $1.36 billion, up 51% year-on-year and up 16% quarter-on-quarter. We are above our guidance range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. It's Super Micro’s fifth and 60th quarter of faster revenue progression, and we continue to execute our strong growth trajectory at three times to four times higher than the overall industry's growth rate. Our fiscal third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share was more than tripled year-over-year and was $1.55 compared to $0.50 years ago. This 210% growth was well above with the higher end of our guidance range of $0.17 to $0.19, demonstrating strong operating leverages and the customers accepting the value of our total IT solutions. Growth in our major geographies was well balanced, and our recent the Taiwan expansion has contributed to our better operation margin and meeting our growth customer demand. Our results in the past five quarters are showing that we are ahead of our $10 billion annual revenue target that was shared last year March. And our profitability has been improving greatly as well since then. Based on our current demand and capacity, we are forecasting at least $1.45 billion revenue for the coming June quarter to end the fiscal 2022 on a strong note at above $5 billion yearly revenue. Looking further ahead, I believe we will continue to have a strong fiscal year 2023 in the range of $6 billion to $7 billion annually and expect to reach our $10 billion yearly revenue at least one year than the original plan we shared back in 2021 March. The fuel that accelerates our revenue came from our success with our total IT solution in AI, enterprise, Cloud, Edge telco and customers from many other verticals. Riding on the strength and the foundation of Super Micro’s optimal building broad architecture, our total IT solutions allow customers to quickly deploy without going through the complications of design, meditation, solution and integration. This strategy also positions Super Micro very profitably changed the ongoing supply chain challenge compared to our competition. With our building growth and faster growing economy of scale, we can create and deliver workload optimized solutions to customers with time-to-market advantage, quality, performance, cost and TCO advantages. To grow our solutions and customer base faster and more efficiently, we are on track with our command-center based Auto-configurator and B2B, B2C automation platforms. Many customers have tried and like this intelligent database and wafer-based service for many quarters. This represents our next opportunity to scale up and scale out our application optimal solution to many more customers, 24/7 with no downtime and no manpower bandwidth limitation. The B2B and B2C automation program will be greatly launched nationwide in this month, indeed next week, I believe. It will dramatically improve our engineering, operations, sales and service effectiveness and customer satisfaction while accelerating our market share gains to enrich our total IT solution product portfolio, we have doubled our software engineering resource in the past few years to build new features to power our enterprise datacenter and OEM customers. Our Super cloud composer and other software products manage GPU, compute, storage and networking building broker at cloud scale, including rich analytics. So data center operators can make clinical data-driven decisions to improve workflow efficiently. In middle and long term, we see our investment in throughout datacenter management software stack will enable future infrastructure as a service and monitor as a service functionality and that will further enhance our total IT solution capability and value.  Our recent Taiwan and US expansion are focusing on delivering [indiscernible] [9.53] total IT solutions in volume, capable of shipping thousands of racks per month directly from SuperMicro campuses, designed with green computing in mind. This energy saving rack-scale solutions, leveraging our latest real air cooling and liquid technologies.  More and more of our customers are able to run their datacenter with PoE close to 1.06 or even better. Customers can expect lower TCO by saving energy costs, while increased performance per megawatt in their facility substantially. In some other cases, our customer increased computing capacity up to 15% with the same energy budget. Manufacturing these customers are quite happy to receive higher-quality, higher credit rating products. They are fully optimized, integrate and validate by SuperMicro. Our R&D organizations are happy and hard at work to expand our new technology product lines with the upcoming new Intel, better graphics and AMD in all our processes. We again are ready to bring time-to-market advantages to our customers. We are pleased to see a strong trend in terms of customer seeding and early deployment requests.  We are especially partnered closely with NVIDIA and other leading technologies partners in the emerging Metaverse and Omniverse ecosystems and double our GPU product line to support this opportunity and immersive workloads. With all of the new technologies, including PCI-E Gen 5, CXL, CDR5 [ph], the new 350 watt CPU and 700 watt GPU, our portfolio of new platform for rack-scale total IT solution will continue to develop and become a key growth driver for our coming quarters and years. In closing, our 51% year-over-year revenue growth and $1.55 quarterly EPS proved that our total IT solution strategy has been gaining customers' preference and trust in this growing pen. We will continue to enhance our total IT solutions capability and value while continue to lower our operation costs by leveraging our Taiwan production capacity. With our strong technical foundation, dedicated employees, server building bill solutions and application optimized green computing products, we are quickly and consistently winning new customers and their satisfaction now. More importantly, we invest in command center-based B2B and B2C platforms will help us to much efficiently increase our customer base and market share. I and my team will continue to execute our growth strategies and accelerating the time line to reach $10 billion revenue target in short term and start to plan and execute our new $20 billion midterm goal as well. I will now pass the call to David Weigand, our CFO, to provide additional detail on the quarter. David?
David Weigand: Thank you, Charles. I'm pleased to report solid fiscal third quarter revenue of $1.36 billion, 51% year-on-year increase and 16% quarter-on-quarter increase. Our revenue exceeded our initial guidance range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion and our recently updated range of $1.3 billion to $1.35 billion. This was our fourth consecutive quarter of revenues exceeding $1 billion. Year-to-date revenue through our fiscal third quarter, increased 43% year-over-year. Our growth initiatives with the total IT solutions targeting fast-growing markets and customers with accelerated GPU and AI workloads, software-defined storage and networking, public and hybrid cloud and edge IoT platforms are gaining momentum. These new growth drivers complement our traditional strength with enterprise, channel and OEM customers, leading to accelerating revenue growth, expanding margins and operating leverage. Revenues for the trailing four quarters of Q4 '21 through Q3 of fiscal year '22, totaled $4.63 billion. In the third fiscal -- Super Micro recorded balanced revenues across all three of our market verticals, demonstrating the resilient nature of our diversified end markets. We achieved $846 million in organic enterprise channel and AI and revenues, representing 62% of Q3 revenues versus 64% last quarter. It was up 44% year-over-year and 12% quarter-over-quarter, with growth driven both by our growing list of large enterprise customers and new product offerings. Our OEM clients and large data center segment achieved $423 million in revenues, representing 31% of Q3 revenues, versus 23% last quarter, which was up 54% year-over-year and up 54% quarter-over-quarter, with strong growth driven by our large, new and existing data center customers and OEM appliance customers. Our 5G/telco, Edge and IoT segment achieved $86 million in revenues, representing 7% of Q3 revenues versus 12% last quarter. This was up 159% year-over-year and down 39% quarter-over-quarter. This emerging segment represents a vast long-term opportunity for us and our design win momentum and backlog continues to grow, but short-term quarter-to-quarter result can fluctuate, depending on the timing of new customer adoption and qualification cycles. Systems comprised 85% of total revenue and subsystems and accessories represented 15% of Q3 revenues. On a year-over-year basis, the volume of systems and nodes shipped as well as system node ASPs increase. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, the volume of systems shipped and system node ASPs increased, while nodes shipped were lower due to product mix. We had a balanced distribution of revenues across geographies, with the US representing 56% of revenue; Asia, including Japan, 23% and Europe 15%, while rest of the world was 6%. On a year-on-year basis, US revenues increased 53%; Asia, including Japan increased 50%, Europe increased 27%, and the rest of the world increased 184%. On a sequential basis, gross revenues increased 19%. Asia, including Japan, increased 9%. Europe increased 5% and the rest of the world increased 124%. The Q3 gross margin was 15.6%, which was up 160 basis points quarter-over-quarter from Q2 and up 180 basis points year-on-year due to price discipline, leverage from higher factory utilization and operating efficiencies, and a continually improving product/customer mix. The quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year increase in gross margins was achieved despite continued elevated freight and supply chain costs. Turning to operating expenses. Q3 OpEx on a GAAP basis increased 7% quarter-on-quarter and 14% year-on-year to $121 million. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses increased 6% quarter-on-quarter and increased 15% year-on-year to $110 million. Our non-GAAP operating margin increased significantly to 7.5% for the quarter versus 5.2% last quarter and 3.2% a year ago, demonstrating both improvements in gross margins and operating leverage. The year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter increases on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis were driven by higher headcount and personnel costs and lower research and development NRE credits. Other income and expense was $3.1 million, in income, consisting of $4.6 million in foreign exchange gains, offset by interest expense of $1.5 million, as compared to a $1.8 million expense last quarter. This quarter, the tax provision was $16.2 million on a GAAP basis and $19.6 million on a non-GAAP basis. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 18.7% for the quarter. Our tax rate for GAAP and non-GAAP purposes increased again this quarter, primarily due to a significant increase in pre-tax income in fiscal 2022. Lastly, our share of income from our JV was $0.39 million this quarter as compared to $0.29 million last quarter. The Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share totaled $1.55, which exceeded the high-end of the original guidance range of $0.70 to $0.90, our recently updated Q3 range of $1.40 to $1.50. The increases to EPS were due to a combination of higher revenues, manufacturing efficiency, price discipline, product and customer mix and operating leverage. Cash flow used in operations for Q3 was $228 million compared to cash flow used in operations of $53 in Q2, as accounts receivable and inventories grew due to increasing demand from our customers and to mitigate the continued impact of supply chain disruptions, including CapEx of $11 million, Q3 negative free cash flow totaled $239 million. Key uses of cash during the quarter included increases to inventory and accounts receivable and/or reductions in customer prepayments. This was offset by cash provided from increased accounts payable and short-term debt. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter. Our closing balance sheet cash position was $247 million, while bank debt was $547 million as we drew down on our bank lines of credit to increase inventory levels as we ramp production of new platforms globally. Turning to the balance sheet and working capital metrics compared to last quarter, our Q3 cash conversion cycle was unchanged at 98 days relative to Q2 and above our target range of 85 to 90 days due to higher inventory. Days of inventory was $117, representing a slight decrease of one day versus the prior quarter. Days sales outstanding was up by two days quarter-on-quarter compared to 9 days, while days payable outstanding was up by 1 day to 58 days. Now turning to the outlook for our business. We note that our Q4 June quarter is typically seasonally strong, and we are enthusiastic about several new customers and innovative new leading-edge total IT solutions ramping in multiple end markets. We are carefully watching the global macro and economic situation and impacts to the supply chain from continuing COVID-19-related disruptions. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, ending June 30, 2022, we expect net sales in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.48 billion, GAAP diluted net income per share of $1.45 to $1.64 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $1.51 to $1.69. We expect gross margins to be similar or slightly up from Q3 levels. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $121 million and include $8 million in stock-based compensation and $1 million in other expenses not included in non-GAAP operating expenses. We expect other income and expense, including interest expense, to be a net expense of approximately $2 million and expect a nominal contribution from our JV. Non-GAAP operating expenses are forecast to be up quarter-on-quarter from continued investment in R&D and higher personnel costs. The company's projections for GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per common share assume a GAAP tax rate of 17.4%, a non-GAAP tax rate of 19.4%, and a fully diluted share count of $54.3 million for GAAP and 55.79% shares for non-GAAP. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022, we are raising our revenue guidance range from $4.2 billion, $4.6 billion to a new range of $4.96 billion to $5.04 billion and raising our GAAP diluted net income per share outlook from at least $2.77 to a range of $4.16 to $4.35, and our non-GAAP diluted net income per share from lease 320 to a range of $4.53 to $4.71. The company's projections for GAAP annual net income assumes a tax rate of 16.5% and a rate of 18.7% for non-GAAP net income. For fiscal year 2022, we are assuming a fully diluted share count of 53.6 million shares for GAAP and 55.1 million shares for non-GAAP. The outlook for fiscal year 2022 fully-diluted GAAP earnings per share includes approximately $39 million in expected stock-based compensation and other expenses. Net of tax effects, that are excluded from non-GAAP diluted net income per common share. Finally, we expect CapEx for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022 to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million. Nicole, we’re ready for Q&A.
Nicole Noutsios: Operator, we can now open the line up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah wit Loop Capital. Your line is open.
Ananda Baruah: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Yeah, congrats on the great execution first half of this calendar year, it sounds like it's a good following through here. Two, if I could, Charles and David, what would you guys – first time we've got the chance to talk to you guys since you pre-announced. What would you guys say, you would consider to have been incremental versus 90 days ago that's leading to such strong revenue execution for both the March quarter and now the June quarter? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks a lot.
Charles Liang: Yeah. That's been utilize because of the supply chain, because there are always some invisible factor. And that's why I mean earlier I mean in March quarter, we try to be conservative. But it's turn out, we have many customers really like our IP total solution, and we ship a lot of completed rig. Indeed, our direct scale PnP, plug and play rack solution, grew a lot year-over-year. Roughly, this year compared with last year, our rack product grew about 5 to 6 – 5 times to 6 times growth. And this momentum, I believe, will continue to be very strong in the next 12 months. So we expect another 3x to 5x direct scale PnP product line growth. So that's why, I mean, the growth has been a little bit surprised us.
Ananda Baruah: That's great context, Charles. And then, Charles, I'm just going to ask you sort of what is the next probably more natural follow-ups since you just remarked that you expect another 3x to 5x. Is the 17% to 23% long-term growth rate? Is that still the appropriate growth rate -- or should it really be something stronger than that as you look out the next couple of years? Thanks.
Charles Liang: Next couple of years can be very strong. But again, it depends on our global supply chain situation. As David has mentioned, COV19 still challenging us and also macroeconomic condition. So if in is not much worse, I believe our growth rate year-over-year virtually will continue to grow.
Ananda Baruah: Okay. Thanks. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it. Thanks so much.
Charles Liang: Thank you.
Patrick Wang : Hey, Ananda, this is Patrick. I'm just going to jump in here. You also note that Charles also talked about is expectations on fiscal 2023 and the implied growth rate there. So that's another data point.
Charles Liang: Yes. Next year, I mean, fiscal 2023 at this moment, I believe $6 billion to $7 billion will be relatively a very conservative estimation.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is open.
Mehdi Hosseini : Yes. And thanks for taking my question and actually, I have a couple of follow-ups. Charles, as you look into next fiscal year, how do you see seasonal trend impacting your September quarter? And I asked that because you're doing really well, especially with diversification of revenue. And I think it would really help us how we should think about seasonal factor and how you would set up the company for $6 billion to $7 billion of revenue run rate in the fiscal year 2023? And I have a follow-up.
Charles Liang: Thank you. Very good question. Indeed, traditionally, September will be our slow season. But this time can be quite different, because we have a very strong back order now. And again, lots of customer, high-profile customers really like our rack-scale plug and play solution. So we are preparing the big growth in that segment. So I believe this year, September, we will have a great quarter. It can be even more than June quarter.
Mehdi Hosseini : Okay. Thanks for that color. And then a question for David. You've had three consecutive quarter of cash burn. And given the strength and your backlog, should assume that you're going to burn cash again in the June quarter?
David Weigand: Yes, Mehdi, I think that as our expand increases, as we have to add accounts receivable and inventory, we will continue to use cash. But we're using it for customers and for inventory. So we would consider that to be really strong uses.
Mehdi Hosseini : Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Markets. Your line is open,
Nehal Chokshi : Yes, thank you and congrats on the awesome results and amazing guidance. Would you say that the component availability situation has improved at all quarter-to-date or during the March quarter relative to the December quarter?
Charles Liang: A few months ago, we suppose that situation will gradually improve and unfortunately, there are some parts -- I believe it continues to be very tight. That's why we still suffering supply chain ability program. Some components, yes, have been dramatically improved, but there are some other components still in a serious shortage. So, we try to improve that situation for sure.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. And so clearly, guidance is indicating that there was no pull-in of demand, especially in the context of how Intel guide. And thus the share gains that you guys are putting up appear to be very sustainable. Still I'd like to hear your pushback that Super Micro's lower lead-time and better management of these constrained components are not leading to these massive share gains that you're seeing at this point in time?
Charles Liang: Indeed, because right scale, I mean, present solution, we plan in advance both with customer understand their future demand and we plan in advance flowing all the different components in the events. And then we are able to ship the complete drag to customer kind of relatively efficient, more timing efficient than others. So, at least, I believe, is one of the reasons why we are able to grow. And we will continue to extend the customer base to offer them reg scale solution. Indeed, we have prepared to double our reg scale capacity in the coming quarter -- indeed in June quarter. So, we feel pretty strong that we will be able to continue to help customers to have their supply chain challenge.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay, great. And then cash consumption was actually in line with what I had expected. And I presume that was also in line with what you guys had expected given the revenue outperformance, given the cash conversion cycle was flattish Q-to-Q. A, is that correct? Was it in line with what you had expected given the revenue outperformance?
David Weigand: No, it was, Nehal and also, we also have to look out to Q4 and beyond in planning our inventory levels. So, it is going in line. I mean the fact that we have the high growth rate, 51% year-over-year is definitely going to continue to challenge working capital.
Nehal Chokshi: Yes, yes. And as such, there's been no share buybacks, right, because all the cash is needed to finance the growth at this point in time, the massive growth that you're seeing?
David Weigand: Yes, exactly right.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. And given that the cash consumption is tracking what you would expect given the revenue growth that you're putting up, does this give you incremental confidence to utilize debt to make capitalist turn track your non-GAAP earnings as opposed to waiting for a slowdown in the business before you can really start a share repurchase program in earnest?
David Weigand: Well, we also have to watch the overall environment. And so we're trying to strike the balance.
Charles Liang: Yes, we are talking about a possibility. But given the macroeconomic still have lots of unknown factors. That's why we try to be very careful.
Nehal Chokshi: All right, fair guys. Congratulations.
Charles Liang: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jon Tanwanteng with CJS Securities. Your line is open.
Jon Tanwanteng: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Thank you for taking my question. And congrats on -- again, on a really great quarter and the outlook. First question is, well, it's great to hear your component supply is getting better. I was wondering how much of a corresponding drop you're seeing in component price? Is it that's the case? And should we think of improvement in the gross margins going forward as well, maybe towards the high end of the charge range?
Charles Liang: Indeed, it's hard to say because of the core situation in Asia, as basically Taiwan and Mainland China is kind of very serious. So, I believe it's hard to say. So, although we are doing our bit and believe situation will be getting improved, but exactly how fast at this moment, not much idea. David Weigand?
David Weigand: Yeah. So the second part of your question, Jon, we did experience some gross margin expansion from higher efficiency, which means that we actually -- we had higher throughput our factories at a lower per unit cost. And so, we do expect that to continue, especially as we ramp up production in Taiwan. And so, we do look forward to further margin expansion.
Charles Liang: Indeed, the one factor we did not share before, but I'd like to take a little chance to share with everyone. With our continuing growing in rec scale, product play rec scale product. Indeed, with our current facility in USA campus and Taiwan campus. When business continued to grow mostly the current capacity, we can support our revenue up to $12 billion. So our capacity is pretty up. So looking forward in the next many quarters, when our volume continues to grow, our gross margin and net profit will continue to gain advantage from the economical side, economical scale, I mean.
Jon Tanwanteng: Got it. That's great color. Thank you. And it's really great to see that capacity. My second question is regarding cash flow and some people have touched on this a little bit. Is it in your interest to raise permanent financing to support the growth? Or you just continue to use the revolver? How should we think about your ability to just fund the growth that you've seen?
Charles Liang: We are starting the possibility, kind of, depends on the macroeconomic conditions. If macroeconomic conditions continue to be healthy, then we may try to be more aggressively leveraging the money from the bank. Otherwise, we may continue to be conservative.
Jon Tanwanteng: Okay, understood. Congrats again.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is open.
Ananda Baruah: Hey, thanks guys for taking the follow-up. I guess, sort of, piggybacking Charles off of one of the last questions. I guess, how much of the revenue upside for the March and June quarter is from new demand that you may have been conservative about relative to how much do you think was demand that you have been getting indications about, but that supply chain became available for. And really, I guess what I'm trying to get a sense of is how much how much of this is supply chain related? And is the follow-through dependent to an extent on new supply chain continuing to get released? I appreciate that both.
Charles Liang: Yeah, very good question. Indeed, our demand continue growing, have become stronger and stronger. So the really big limitation now indeed is supply chain to us. So that's why everyday, we are spending time to figure out how to improve the supply chain. So that's the situation. The demand is strong and keeping growing, because of our better technology, total solution and getting very strong support, I suppose.
Ananda Baruah: That's really helpful. And just a quick follow-up there. I've been jumping between calls a little bit to see, so I apologize if it has already been answered or spoken to. But you -- in the prepared remarks, you mentioned the total IT solutions being a catalyst for demand in general. And I think actually, you completed racks, maybe even specifically in the prepared remarks. And so any context you can give us about what you're seeing, I guess, like engagement context. I suppose, with your customers that having the sort of IT Solutions can be a real catalyst to revenue right now? Okay, it looks like it may be -- and I guess is the implication if it's showing up in an increasingly bigger way, first half of this calendar year. Thanks a lot.
Charles Liang: Yeah. Indeed, in our supply chain. David, do you want to add something or Patrick. The supply chain has been puzzling us for many, many quarters, as you know, right? So at this moment, our current customers, existing customers and some new customers indeed all have a strong demand. And with that had to work out, David, maybe you can add something to or Patrick.
David Weigand: Yeah. So we're seeing Ananda, we're seeing really a lot of high demand in the AI and ML area. And so those -- the workloads that are being addressed there and the solutions that we're providing are being well received by our customers. And so the engagements that we're in, that's the driver that we're seeing that AI has led our growth over the last three to four quarters.
Patrick Wang: Yeah. This is Patrick I'll talk to that. I'll jump in here. So the supply chain topic, we've talked about quite a bit. It's not unique to us. But I think we do have to be able to kudos and sets the operations team here at Super Micro. Because without their hard work, we're not able to get the supplies we need. But on the other side, the customers just really like our product. We've got trade products. And we talked about a strong backlog, talked about targeting of top customers. And we're seeing all that stuff play out. And so the good news is that, we've got great solutions, the customers really enjoy the benefits of our product on workloads. And it just turned out to be a very good result. So we're all pretty happy here.
Charles Liang: So I agree supply chain and cash flow. In other areas, we will continue to bigot to start how can we that space utilize or how can we further grow the supply chain and more efficiently utilize our cash flow.
Ananda Baruah: Excellent. Thanks so much for the context, you guys.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's conference call. You my now disconnect.

Charles Liang: Thank you, Nicole, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I am pleased to announce our quarterly revenue of $1.17 billion for fiscal Q2 2022, which was 41% year-over-year growth, and our sequential growth was 14%. We have seen strong growth in all our key verticals and geographies despite challenges from global component shortage and COVID impact. More importantly, our Total IT Solutions strategy has been empowering us to continuously gain market share, all thanks to our dedicated employees, powerful server building block solutions, and finally, our fast growing software products. With the bigger TAM and potential from Total IT Solutions, I believe our growth trend will continue for many years to come and getting stronger quarter-after-quarter. Now, let’s look at some key highlights from the quarter. First, again, our fiscal second quarter net revenue totaled $1.17 billion, up 41% year-on-year and up 14% quarter-on-quarter, at the higher end of our guidance range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. It’s Super Micro’s fourth consecutive quarter of fast revenue progression as we continue our growth trajectory at multiple times the industry’s growth rate. Our fiscal second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.88, compared to $0.63 in the same quarter last year, which was 40% growth and at the higher end of our guidance range of $0.70 to $0.90.  All our major geographies contributed significantly to our year-over-year growth, especially in the APAC region which grew 76% year-over-year. The Taiwan expansion boosts our APAC and EMEA growth momentum by providing additional capacity and lowering operational cost. We continued to expand the B2B Auto-configurator program to service significantly more customers during the quarter. Our innovative center -- command-center based on-line business system has been improving our sales, FAE, PM team’s efficiency, as well as our key customer’s satisfaction.  Recent market conditions have presented us with better opportunities to accelerate our business transition from a hardware company to a Total IT Solutions company. The transition has enabled Super Micro to offer customers higher value and product availability with optimal hardware, software, services, switches and more. Our results have shown that our outperform -- we outperform our previous $10 billion annual revenue target timeline we shared in the few quarter ago. More encouragingly, we are observing a diversified growth across our target verticals, which are large enterprise, AI, machine learning, Cloud, 5G/telco and IoT. Our design wins and engagements with Fortune-listed customers continue to grow quickly with our Total IT Solutions. Our push towards Total IT Solutions is benefiting Super Micro and our customers in multiple ways. Most notably, our customers will receive higher-quality, plug-and-play ready products that are fully optimized, integrated and validated in-house. This effort is also helping Super Micro and our customers mitigate the impact of the global supply chain disruptions by accurately forecasting, building inventories in scale and prioritizing with our strategic partners. As a result, our Total IT Solutions dramatically improve our customer’s time-to-market and increase Super Micro’s value. Our Total IT Solutions are built upon a robust knowledge of system architecture and building blocks that can be optimized for most market verticals. With the rise of Omniverse and Metaverse, we have recently introduced several new architectures to enhance our GPU product offerings. Our new Universal GPU architecture allows customers to choose the best CPUs, GPUs, switches and I/O configurations to truly optimize their applications and workloads, leveraging either Intel Xeon Scalable processors or AMD EPYC processors. The Universal GPU system enables customer to standardize configurations in their clusters for the desired workloads on a single platform. This unique versatile system supports various GPUs, including NVIDIA A100 GPUs, the newly announced AMD MI200 series accelerators, many FPGA products from different companies and others. I am glad to announce that we already have many major customers and industry leaders committing to this new platform, and the only limitation is the supply chain challenge.  Partnering closely with leading technology providers in the emerging Metaverse and Omniverse ecosystems, Super Micro has doubled our GPU product lines to support these 3D and immersive workloads. Our 2U 2-node GPU system provides an optimal mix of CPU-to-GPU ratio with resource-saving features. Our high performance and highly configurable Hyper and Hyper-E servers support multiple GPUs in a single system and are ideal for use cases such as distributed AI inferencing applications, content delivery, telco micro datacenters, 5G core and many other mission critical enterprise workloads. Along with our NVIDIA A100 Delta and Redstone platforms, Super Micro’s comprehensive AI system building blocks support everything from inference at the edge to high-performance computing data center for the Metaverse or Omniverse kind of application and everything in between.  Last quarter we have redefined our growth drivers to speed up our growth strategies, which include; Subsystem and Components, Complete Systems, Total IT Solutions and 5S’s. Our building blocks and complete systems business have been steadily growing over the decades with the help of our partners, and they still serve as the backbone of our revenue growth. With other large enterprise customers, top technology-leading companies and appliance partners engagements, I would like to emphasize again that Total IT Solutions business is our new major growth driver now. Going forward, our investments in software products, service and networking will be the keys to improve our margins and profitability in the coming quarters and years. In summary, Super Micro is rapidly growing and transforming into a Total IT Solutions company from a server hardware company. We are accelerating our design wins and market share gains at key large global customers including enterprise, AI, machine learning, 5G/telco and Edge and IoT. We are improving our profitability and replicating our market share success in the U.S. to APAC and EMEA with the completion of our APAC expansions and rapid production ramp in Taiwan. Our new Command Center Based Auto-configurator and B2B Automation platforms are improving our operations effectiveness and customer satisfaction while accelerating our market-share gains. In closing, our 41% year-over-year revenue growth is a solid proof that Super Micro’s business is taking off quickly now. I am confident that our market presence, TAM and profitability will continue to increase strongly and we invest more -- as we invest more resources instead we are -- as a Total IT Solutions company. My team and I have been diligently executing our growth strategies and accelerating the timeline to pull in our $10 billion revenue goal. I will now pass the call to David Weigand, our Financial -- Chief Financial Officer, to provide additional details on the quarter. Thank you.
David Weigand: Thank you, Charles. I am pleased to report our third consecutive quarter of revenues exceeding $1 billion. We are seeing continued strength across all geographies and strong demand for our products and services, resulting in fiscal second quarter revenue of $1.17 billion, a 41% year-on-year increase and up 14% quarter-on-quarter. Our Q2 revenues were at the higher end of our guidance range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. Revenues for the trailing four quarters in Q3 of fiscal year 2021 through Q of fiscal year 2022 totaled $4.17 billion. Super Micro’s Q2 FY 2022 recorded revenue growth across all three of our market verticals, achieving $756 million in the Organic Enterprise and Channel and AI/ML vertical, $274 million in OEM appliance and large data center vertical and $142 million in the 5G/telco and Edge/IoT vertical. The 5G/telco and Edge/IOT vertical more than doubled sequentially as new designs went into production. Systems comprised 84% of total revenue and subsystems and accessories represented 16% of Q2 revenues. The volume of systems and nodes shipped, as well as System node ASPs increased both year-over-year and quarter-on-quarter. On a year-on-year basis, Asia, including Japan, increased 76% as we saw continued growth with both new and existing and customers, Europe increased 39%, U.S. increased 38% and Rest of World decreased 32%. On a sequential basis, Asia including Japan increased 8%, U.S. sales increased 14%, Europe increased 20%, and Rest of World increased 19%. The Q2 gross margin was 14%, which was up 60 basis points quarter-over-quarter from Q1 due to price discipline and a better product/customer mix. This increase was achieved in spite of our increased use of air freight and higher supply chain costs. On a year-over-year basis gross margins were down 240 basis points due to a discrete cost recovery event in Q2 of last year and higher freight and supply chain costs in the current year. Turning to operating expenses, Q2 OpEx on a GAAP basis increased 3% quarter-on-quarter and 14% year-on-year to $113 million. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses increased 2% quarter-on-quarter and increased 15% year-on-year to $103 million. The year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter increases on a GAAP basis were driven by higher personnel costs and increased headcount; higher stock compensation expense and lower research and development NRE credits. The year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter increases on a non-GAAP basis were driven primarily by higher personnel costs and the increased headcount and lower research and development NRE credits. Other Income & Expense included interest -- including interest expense was a $1.8 million expense, as compared to a $0.8 million expense last quarter. The sequential change is mostly related to loss from remeasurement of our Taiwan Dollar loans to a weaker U.S. Dollar, so FX. This quarter the tax provision was $7.6 million on a GAAP basis and $10.9 million on a non-GAAP basis. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 18.5% for the quarter. Our tax rate for GAAP and non-GAAP purposes increased this quarter primarily due to a change in U.S. tax regulations. Lastly, our share of income from our JV was $0.2 million this quarter, as compared to $0.4 million last quarter. Q1 non-GAAP diluted EPS totaled $0.88, which was near the high end of the guidance range due to higher revenues and higher gross margins, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Cash flow used in operations was $53 million, compared to cash flow used in operations of $135 million in Q1, as we continued to build inventory to be in a position to meet the increasing levels of large orders from our customers and to mitigate the impact of supply chain disruptions. CapEx totaled $12 million for Q2 resulting in negative free cash flow of $65 million. Key uses of cash during the quarter included increases to inventory and accounts receivable, offset by cash provided from increased accounts payable, customer prepayments and deferred revenue. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter. Our closing balance sheet cash position was $247 million, while bank debt was $100 -- was $316 million as we drew down on our bank lines of credit to increase inventory levels as we ramped production of new platforms globally. Turning to the balance sheet and working capital metrics compared to last quarter, our Q2 cash conversion cycle was 98 days, up from 94 days in Q1, which is above our target range of 85 days to 90 days due to higher inventories. Days of inventory was 118 days, representing an increase of four days versus the prior quarter. Days sales outstanding was down by four days to 37 days, while days payables outstanding was down by four days to 57 days. Now turning to the outlook for our business, we note that our Q3 March quarter typically has some seasonal impact from the Lunar New Year holiday and we are also carefully watching impacts to the supply chain from Covid-19 related disruptions. We expect net sales in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, GAAP diluted net income per share of $0.58 to $0.81 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $0.70 to $0.90 for the third quarter of fiscal year 2022 ending March 31, 2022. We expect gross margins to be up slightly from Q2 levels. Our GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $118 million and include $8.5 million in stock-based compensation and $1.7 million in other expenses not included in non-GAAP operating expenses. We expect other income and expense, including interest expense, to be a net expense of roughly $2 million and expect a nominal contribution from our joint venture. Non-GAAP operating expenses are forecasted to be up quarter-on-quarter from continued investment in R&D and higher personnel costs. The company’s projections for GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per common share assume a GAAP tax rate of 15%, a non-GAAP tax rate of 16.5% and a fully diluted share count of 54.5 million for GAAP and 56 million shares for non-GAAP. The outlook for Q3 of fiscal year 2022 GAAP diluted net income per common share includes approximately $8.5 million in expected stock-based compensation and $1.7 million in other expenses, net of tax effects, that are excluded from our non-GAAP diluted net income per common share. We are maintaining our revenue guidance range of $4.2 billion to $4.6 billion for the fiscal year 2022 ending June 30, 2022, and our GAAP diluted net income per share outlook of at least $2.77 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of at least $3.20. The company’s projections for GAAP net income assumes a tax rate of 15% and a rate of 17% for non-GAAP net income. For fiscal year 2022, we are assuming a fully diluted share count of 54.1 million shares for GAAP and 55.6 million shares for non-GAAP. The outlook for fiscal year 2022 fully diluted GAAP earnings per share includes approximately $37 million in expected stock-based compensation and other expenses, net of tax effects that are excluded from non-GAAP diluted net income per common share. We expect CapEx for the fiscal third quarter of ‘22 -- 2022 to be in the range of $5 million to $8 million. Nicole, I will turn it back to you.
Nicole Noutsios: Operator, we can now open the line up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is open.
Ananda Baruah: Yeah. Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the ongoing momentum and the nice results. Congratulations on the good execution. A couple if I could. It -- so -- how is linearity through the quarter, revenue linearity and any context around new kinds of, like, new customer, like, customer expansion, workload expansion, things of that nature, would be really helpful? And then I have a quick follow up. Thanks.
Charles Liang: Yeah. Thank you for the question. As you know, we just migrating from a Hardware Solution company to a Total IT Solution company. So lots of customer like our complete solution for the auto-ID need. So we continue to gain some really large customer and some really technology leader. So we are very happy, very excited to service more partner in the industry. And that’s really help… D And then…
Charles Liang: Yeah. Go for it.
David Weigand: Okay. I was just going to add that, customer wise we had really good growth in the telco and the 5G/telco vertical.
Ananda Baruah: Okay.
Charles Liang: Essentially, like, as opposed to like an Omniverse, and Metaverse, lots of very exciting opportunity there.
Ananda Baruah: Charles, do you think it sounds like Meta, correct me if it’s not an accurate interpretation. But does that to say that telco picked up incrementally in December quarter and that new energy, you think is going to continue at least kind of March quarter first half of the -- first half of the calendar year here?
Charles Liang: I mean, March quarter, traditionally, is our kind of soft season, but this year is different, because we have very strong demand, especially likewise, say GPU, Metaverse, Omniverse, lots of opportunity there and we already have some large engagement just try to fulfill them.
Ananda Baruah: Okay. Great. That’s helpful. A quick follow up Charles. Any comments…
Charles Liang: Thank you.
Ananda Baruah: … on demand after the June quarter? I just asked that since we’re coming up on the second half of the year, any context you can provide, second half of the calendar year on sales demand? Thanks.
Charles Liang: Yeah. There is woman looks pretty commendable [ph], because of our strong product and Total IT Solution, lots of customer now have a bigger back order with us. So we are increasing our back order kind of in a very commendable way.
Ananda Baruah: Excellent. Okay. Thanks a lot. I’ll get back in the queue.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is open.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Just want to get a further understanding how you’re managing the inflationary trend in component prices, your inventory has gone up for two consecutive year and by about $350 million over the past six months. But then I look at your revenue guide for March and implied guide for June taking the midpoint of the fiscal year guide, it does suggest a sequential decline. And is that because you’re not able to pass on extra cost or you just been conservative, despite the fact that you have built inventory or is there something else that I’m missing here? And I have a follow up.
Charles Liang: Yeah. Indeed, I’m very happy with a big inventory now, with global supply chain difficulty. We build the inventory based on our back order. And at this moment, indeed, our back order have been very strong. And the reason why we did not update the whole year revenue and earnings, just because there are still certain uncertainty -- there’s still some uncertainty in terms of supply chain. Other than that, we feel very optimistic.
Mehdi Hosseini: Just on the supply …
Charles Liang: And…
Mehdi Hosseini: Go ahead, sorry, go ahead.
Charles Liang: Yeah. Our inventory indeed happened to have in a very healthy, very conservative way.
David Weigand: Yeah. And Mehdi, this is David. Just to answer your question, another question that you had. Our ability to pass on costs is really reflected in our increased gross margin. So those increase component costs are being passed on.
Mehdi Hosseini: Got you. Okay. And then, excuse me, if I were to go back to the three buckets that you highlighted, organic OEM and 5G/telco. Thanks for providing the dollar revenue contribution. Can you also give us sequential and year-over-year changes for each bucket?
David Weigand: So, Mehdi, we didn’t go back to the Q2 of last year, I don’t believe, although, in our -- we have guidance in our slides that we have by quarter. Yeah, that’s available on our website.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay. But can you -- maybe you can provide some qualitative comments as to which bucket was the strongest?
David Weigand: Absolutely. So our organic enterprise and channel and AI/ML constitutes approximately 65% of our revenues. The OEM appliance bucket comprises about 25%. And then the, look the data center, I’m sorry, the 5G/telco and Edge is about 10%. And that’s up from 5% in the prior quarters, the 5G/telco and Edge bucket. So that’s the way -- that’s kind of been the trend over the past quarters.
Mehdi Hosseini: So the 5G…
David Weigand: The big change though…
Mehdi Hosseini: Oh! Go ahead.
David Weigand: The big change was in 5G. Yeah, was from really some from big growth and traction with telco customers.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay. Thank you.
Patrick Wang: Hey, Mehdi. This is Patrick. I want to just come back to one thing that you mentioned earlier in your question, which is the implied guide for June. I wouldn’t read what we’ve done here as implied guidance for June. What we said was, we’ve given guidance for what we expect in March, given -- just given our situation today, we’re not -- we’re actually just maintaining that the full year guidance there. We feel very comfortable with it, of course, right? But we’re not actually guiding another quarter out, which is why we just -- we kept it where it was.
Mehdi Hosseini: Got it.
David Weigand: Yeah. And the thing…
Mehdi Hosseini: Go ahead.
David Weigand: Yeah. I am sorry. This is David. So I will add to that, that we have -- we have a range, we put out a range of 4.2 to 4.6. So we’re very comfortable there, sure.
Mehdi Hosseini: If I may just quickly, there’s also continued mismatch for components with supply and demand. There’s still some mismatches. So would it be fair to say that you’re also conservative, given the mismatches of availability of components?
Charles Liang: You can say that…
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay.
Charles Liang: … kind of, the back order is stronger by now. We tried to be fully conservative, in case…
Mehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nehal Choski with Northland Capital Markets. Your line is open. Nehal Choski with Northland Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Nehal Choski: Yeah. Sorry. Thank you. I was on mute here. Congrats on the solid results and well above difference March Q guidance. This question has already been partially answered by Patrick. But let me put a little bit finer point on this here. Why not at least narrow to fiscal year 2022 revenue guidance range given that the unchanged midpoint guidance does apply effectively about flat year-over-year for the June quarter?
Charles Liang: So, our -- Nehal, our demand has never been stronger. And so we have obtained some new logos, new customers, which have designed in our products and so we feel very strong about our back order and our demand, but this is a market where supply also dictates your forecasts. And so we have to be careful about forecasting two quarters out on supply. So that’s really the reason for our range.
Nehal Choski: Understood. Okay. And then, yeah, slide nine is great. I love the fact that we’re getting five quarter back visibility into these three vertical markets and it certainly does imply that 5G/telco and Edge has very significant year-over-year growth. And Charles, you’ve mentioned that, part of this demand is Metaverse/Omniverse, not sure what Omniverse means, but I do know what Metaverse means. And I guess…
Charles Liang: Yeah.
Nehal Choski: …I was in impression that Metaverse at least would go under the rep category, i.e., large data center, not 5G/telco. Can you just give me a little bit more understanding as to why Metaverse potentially falling into the telecom here?
Charles Liang: Today there are some really four class company, big company coming to Omniverse or Metaverse, right? So we have a very strong engagement with some of them. So in terms of AI, GPU, Metaverse, we have a very strong back order now indeed and just try to work out components to fulfill over the demand. As to 5G/telco, it’s relatively new territory for us. We start 5G/telco about three years ago and now we have many bigger engagement. So we are very excited for 5G/telco growth as well.
Nehal Choski: Okay. So to be clear then the commentary about the strong demand for Metaverse is not related to 5G/telco, correct?
Charles Liang: Not necessary. It’s kind of not much related.
Nehal Choski: Okay. Got it. Then, so at the Investor Day, about a year ago, you talked about the 5G/telco opportunity. There’s long design cycles, long qualification cycles. And it does look like this quarter the dam broke basically. What percentage of your telecom customers you’re engaged with went from qualifying to production ship?
Charles Liang: A big portion. Indeed, as I just mentioned, we start 5G/telco about three years ago and then we have a very strong engagement so far and some of them start to move certain volume, some modem will move good volume later. So it’s a new territory, but we overall very satisfied with a big engagement from those partner.
Nehal Choski: Okay. Great. And then my last question is that, also on these vertical markets, it does imply that the OEM appliance on large data center was up only 10% year-over-year, why is that?
Charles Liang: Indeed, we have some large engagement and they are kind of high value product now. As we mentioned, for really kind of meta-scale data center we are selective, but when those demand high end, kind of high value products. So we are indeed very excited. We start to gain some of those opportunities.
Nehal Choski: Okay. Thank you.
David Weigand: Also…
Nehal Choski: Yeah.
David Weigand: This is -- yeah. I’ll add that, that -- the large data center vertical, I think, is going to there -- is going to vary a little bit by digestion, too, because we have some regular customers that are purchasing -- they’ll purchase for two quarters or three quarters, and then they’ll take up -- and they’ll take a pause. But the good thing about our business is that, it’s grown to the point where we have enough momentum in all areas that, that one vertical can offset the other.
Nehal Choski: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jon Tanwanteng with CJS. Your line is open.
Jon Tanwanteng: Thank you. Good quarter guys and on the outlook, too, very fast. My question is, are inflation and supply chain headwind still accelerating in Q3 for you and that’s maybe matched by your pricing or was it roughly the same as Q2 and maybe as a subset to that could you tell us what were the friction in this quarter, if it’s any different and if you see any easing or things getting tougher?
Charles Liang: Now question is that, most of our customer already get used to kind of take the responsibility for the extra cost. So that’s why our gross margin or net margin will basically get in a stable right, including a higher transportation charge, basically customer already accepted it.
Jon Tanwanteng: Okay. Great. Any commentary on where the friction is in components and shipping?
Charles Liang: Overall supply chain situation have been, I would have to say, gradually improving, not much improving, but gradually improving. So we get in feel more comfortable then last quarter or before?
Jon Tanwanteng: Okay.
Charles Liang: It was still a big concern, yeah.
Jon Tanwanteng: Got it. Charles, you spent a little time earlier in the call talking about the Total IT Solutions transition, could you just tell us what the margin is like in a typical Total IT Solution sale versus a historically pure hardware sale?
Charles Liang: Okay. I mean, our total hardware, that’s the model we have as -- we had to compete with lots of competition, right, lots of competitor. But Total IT Solution, customer need lots of software, lots of security feature and kind of like a cloud plug and play, cloud composite waiver software and utility there [ph]. So we invest a lot in this territory in last three years and now we start to harvest the results and we continue -- we will continue to invest more in software. So our kind of software value, Total IT Solution value will continue to grow. I would like to say, gradually, we may be able to add 1%, 2% or even 3% actual profit -- net profit to our revenue in next few quarter or few years.
Jon Tanwanteng: Okay. Great. And that’s -- that was part of your Investor Day target within the target model, correct?
Charles Liang: Yes.
Jon Tanwanteng: Okay. Understood. Thank you.
Charles Liang: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is open.
Ananda Baruah: Hey, guys. Thanks. Thanks for the follow up. I have a couple if I could. Charles just going back to your comments just moment ago about imposing constraints that you actually, as you said, they are actually becoming less constrained right now. So just a clarification?
Charles Liang: Data feed -- data under control, but still some concern, especially…
Ananda Baruah: Okay. Got it.
Charles Liang: … for a complete IT solution, right, even sometime, you just have one component in shortage and you cannot ship the whole product line, whole solution. So that’s why it’s improving but still lots of concern.
Ananda Baruah: Understood. Understood. Helpful. And then on the gross margin, you guys talked about reaching 14% in June. So it sounds like you’re tracking ahead of that and then you guided sort of up sequentially, how like -- how should we think about gross margin kind of going forward post the March quarter, I guess, trajectory wise and what are the put and takes. Just -- I think you guys have talked about sequential up December, sequential up March and sequential up June to get to 14%. And so now that you’re already there, can you give us some sense of what the personality of gross margin should look like in the coming quarters, appreciate it?
Charles Liang: Yeah. Basically, when our Total IT Solution become more mature, gross margin and net margin will consistently growing, that’s benefited very slowly the direction. But in some time -- and I hope it happens, sometime when we engage with large scale ASP or OEM in really high revenue deal that may impact our gross margin and net margin. Although, it’s though our overall margin, but when it’s positive to company, overall future, we will still selectively take some deal there.
Ananda Baruah: Okay. Great. Thanks. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.
Charles Liang: Thank you.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is open.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for the follow up. Just a modeling follow up. If I take $3.20, minimum of $3.20 EPS guides for FY 2022 and assume $0.80 for March then my June EPS would be up over $0.90. So you are expecting margin expansion from June -- from March to June, is that the right way of thinking about to get to the $3.20 minimum EPS for FY 2022.
David Weigand: So -- go ahead, Charles. Go ahead.
Charles Liang: Yeah. Basically, June, always our kind of harvest season, right. So this year, I believe, same opportunity. June will be very strong quarter I believe. And so as to gross margin maybe a little bit lower. But if that happen, the net profit should be more than $0.90, maybe more than $1. Maybe you have some come in there.
David Weigand: Yeah. Mehdi, so we -- we’re very comfortable being inside 14% to 17%. That’s our target. We’ve guided up for Q3 at higher margin. We said we should be up slightly in Q3 and for Q4 we -- we’re not giving updates on Q4. But for the full year, as we said before, very comfortable with the guidance that’s out there, because it’s got a -- it has a low range and high range.
Mehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q1  (2021-11-02 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Super Micro First Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Nicole Noutsios, Investor Relations for Super Micro. Please go ahead.
Nicole Noutsios: Good afternoon, and thank you for attending Super Micro’s call to discuss financial results for the first quarter, which ended September 30, 2021.

With that, I’ll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Charles?
Charles Liang: Thank you, Nicole, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to announce that our quarterly revenue exceeded $1 billion even during a traditional weak September quarter. For fiscal Q1 2022, we delivered strong year-over-year revenue growth of 35%. We continued to gain market share and are exciting well against – and executing well against our plan to achieve $10 billion in annual revenue. The revenue growth was driven by strong progress across many key customers with our Total IT Solution strategy. Now, let’s look at some highlights from the quarter. First, our first quarter net revenue totaled $1.03 billion. It’s our second consecutive quarter of $1 billion plus in revenues, up 35% year-on-year and down 3% quarter-on-quarter, exceeding our guidance of $900 million to $980 million. Our efforts continue to enable our growth trajectory at multiple times the average industry growth rate. Our fiscal first quarter non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.58, compared to $0.55 in the same period one year ago and higher than our guidance of $0.28 to $0.48. All our major geographies contributed significant year-over-year growth with the APAC region including Japan doubling Year-over-year. The newly completed Taiwan expansion at Bade is greatly helping our Asia and EMEA growth momentum by providing additional capacity and lowering operational cost. These results show that we remain on track to achieve our $10 billion revenue target as we previously shared. We started our business with the best system building block solutions on the market 28 years ago. After many years of servicing the System Integrators and Value-Added Resellers, we began to offer application-optimized complete systems to direct partners including many appliance partners, OEM and large enterprise accounts. In the past 10 years, we have continued to expand and began our business transition from a hardware solutions company to a Total IT Solutions company that combined hardware, software, service and more features. With application optimized total IT solutions for many vertical markets and a much broader technology footprint today, we are redefining our growth drivers to speed up our growth strategies. First, Sub-system and Components, we will continue to offer server motherboards, enclosures, barebones and accessories to the market to continue help growing our market share. Second, Complete Systems, we will continue to fully focus and expand on growing our complete hardware systems with technologies co-developed with our key partners including Intel, AMD, NVIDIA, Broadcom, and others. And third, Total IT Solutions, we are accelerating our broad development of Appliance and Plug-n-Play Rack-Scale Solutions for AI, Machine Learning, Industry Automation, IoT, 5G/Telco and Cloud products. And number four, 5S. We are finally ready to aggressively promote our Software, Service and Switch Product lines. And I will share more about the other two S when they are ready. Our building blocks and completed systems business have been steadily growing over the decades, and they serve as the backbone of our revenue growth. With more enterprise customers and appliance partners engagements, our Rack Scale, Total IT Solutions business is our new major growth focus now. To make our Total IT Solutions a seamless experience for our customers, we have been increasing our R&D resource to focus on many software products, service, and networking for many years. These products, as higher value parts of our Total IT solutions, will be the key to improve our margins and profitability in the coming quarters and years. Our new online auto-configurator together with new B2B program are now driving our business growth more efficiently than ever before. Our innovative new command-center based customer service system have been greatly helping our sales, FAE, PM as well as our key customers. They are dramatically improving our business interactions with customers much faster, much accurate, more optimized and more customer friendly while reducing manpower, human delay and error. Our new intelligent database driven tools are indeed performing much smarter and faster than human efforts in most areas. This automated-intelligent system is servicing our salesforce and customers to their great satisfaction now, and it will be constantly upgrade and update. Our push toward Total IT Solutions is benefiting Super Micro and our customers in multiple ways. Most importantly, our customers will receive higher-quality products that are fully optimized, integrate and validate in-house. For the PnP, Plug-n-Play Rack-Scale products, our customers just need to connect network and power cables. And then relative to run the application. This shrinks their deployment time from many weeks to just a few hours. The Total IT Solutions is also helping Super Micro and our customers to mitigate the impact of the global shortage supply chain disruptions by accurately forecasting, building inventories in scale and prioritizing with our strategic partners. The system building block solution allows us to utilize sets of common sub-systems and components to create, design and deliver first-to-market products with reduced manufacturing and supply chain complexity and risk. This will dramatically improve our customer’s time-to-market, which is critical to their success. The Total IT Solution is indeed a win-win-win proposition for Super Micro, our customers and our supply chain partners. Customers can get a taste of our Total IT Solutions now by signing up for our new JumpStart Program. They can remotely run their software and applications on our customer, preconfigured, pre-validated racks powered by the latest technology from Intel, AMD processors and NVIDIA. We are also providing hosted instances of plug and play Cloud Infrastructure with operating systems and other tools that can be accessed remotely for development and testing. The program will instill more confidence in Super Micro customers as it delivers the convenience, faster time to market, performance optimization, cost savings and security. In summary, Super Micro is rapidly growing and is transforming into a Total IT solution company from a server hardware company. In addition to providing the greenest hardware total solution, our software, switch and service products are now ready for any large enterprise, cloud, AI and Telco customers. We are building on and expanding our successful product and technology leadership. Our new growth factors, including the Total IT Solutions and the fast-growing 5S product lines, are keys to achieving our $10 billion revenue target with higher profitability. And third, replicating our market share success in the U.S. to APAC and EMEA with the completion of our new APAC campus in Taiwan. And fourth, our new Command Center Based Auto configurator and B2B Automation platforms are getting broadly used by customers around the world now, and they are accelerating our market-share gains and customer satisfaction. In closing, I am getting much happier with the progress of our business transformation, which is resulting in an acceleration of our business in fiscal 2022 and beyond. As a Total IT Solutions company, our TAM continues to increase as we invest our resources for growth, and I am optimistic about achieving our $10 billion annual revenue goal in a much sooner schedule. With that, I will now pass the call to David Weigand, our Chief Financial Officer, to provide additional detail. Thank you.
David Weigand: Thank you, Charles. We continued to experience diversified growth across our key market verticals, exceeding $1 billion in revenue for the quarter, above the high end of our guidance range. This is the second consecutive quarter that revenues have exceeded $1 billion. Revenue growth was driven by sales to large enterprise, cloud, AI, and Telco markets, continued strength across all geographies and strong demand for our products and services. Our fiscal first quarter revenue totaled $1.03 billion, reflecting a 35% year-on-year increase and a 3% decrease on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Looking at Super Micro’s Q1 revenue in our three market verticals, we achieved $725 million in the Organic Enterprise and Channel AI/ML vertical, $250 million in the OEM appliance and large data center vertical, and $58 million in the 5G/Telco and Edge/IoT vertical. Systems comprised 82% of total revenue and the volume of systems and nodes shipped were up year-over-year. System node ASPs increased year-over-year and quarter-on-quarter. On a year-on-year basis, Asia increased 108% as we saw continued growth with both existing and new customers, Europe increased 60%, U.S. increased 13% and Rest of World increased 6%. On a sequential basis, Asia increased 29%, U.S. sales decreased 14%, Europe decreased 3%, and Rest of World decreased 1%. From this point forward, unless otherwise noted, I will be discussing financial metrics on a non-GAAP basis. Working down the P&L, the Q1 gross margin was 13.4%, down 30 basis points quarter-over-quarter from Q4 due to higher freight and supply chain costs as was also reported by many other companies around the world. On a year-over-year basis gross margins were down 370 basis points due to a discrete cost recovery event in Q1 of last year, while also incurring higher freight, supply chain and other costs in Q1 of the fiscal year 2022. Turning to operating expenses, Q1 OpEx on a GAAP basis increased 2% quarter-on-quarter and 10% year-on-year to $109 million. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses increased 2% quarter-on-quarter and increased 7% year-on-year to $101 million. The year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter increases on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis were driven primarily by higher personnel expenses due to increased headcount, especially in Asia. Other Income & Expense including interest expense was a $0.8 million expense as compared to a $2.1 million expense last quarter. The sequential change is mostly related to FX. This quarter the tax provision was $3.3 million on a GAAP basis and $6.2 million on a non-GAAP basis. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 16.6% for the quarter. Lastly, our share of income from our JV was $0.4 million this quarter as compared to $0.6 million last quarter. Q1 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share totaled $0.58, which was higher than our mid-point guidance of $0.38 due to higher revenues, and lower operating expenses, offset by lower gross margins. Cash flow used in operations was $134.6 million compared to cash flow generated from operations of $63.6 million in Q4 as we built inventory ahead of a seasonally strong December quarter and positioned ourselves to mitigate the impact of supply chain disruptions. CapEx totaled $11.9 million resulting in free cash flow consumption of $146.5 million. Key uses of cash during the quarter included increases to inventory, payments made to reduce accounts payable offset by an increase in deferred revenue. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter. Our closing balance sheet cash position was $270 million, while bank debt was $279 million as we drew down on our bank lines of credit to increase inventory as we ramped production of new platforms globally. Turning to the balance sheet and working capital metrics compared to last quarter, our Q1 cash conversion cycle was 94 days, up from 80 days, above our target range of 85 to 90 days due to higher inventories. Days of inventory was 114, representing an increase of 18 days versus the prior quarter. Days Sales Outstanding was up by 4 days to 41 days, while Days Payables Outstanding was up by 8 to 61 days. Now turning to the outlook for our business. We expect net sales in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. GAAP diluted net income per share of $0.60 to $0.80 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $0.70 to $0.90 for the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 ending December 31, 2021. We expect gross margins to improve as we manage supply chain costs and maintain price discipline. Over the upcoming quarters, we continue to expect to achieve margins within our target model as we further scale our Taiwan operations and begin to gain traction from our new product offerings and auto configurator B2B/B2C solutions. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $112 million and include $7 million in stock option compensation expenses and $1 million in other expenses not included in non-GAAP operating expenses. We expect other income and expense, including interest expense, to be a net expense of roughly $1.5 million and expect a nominal contribution from our JV. Our non-GAAP operating expenses are forecasted to be up quarter-on-quarter from continued investment in R&D and higher personnel costs. The company’s projections for GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per common share both assume a tax rate of approximately 16% and a fully diluted share count of 53.5 shares for GAAP and 55 million shares for non-GAAP. The outlook for Q2 of fiscal year 2022, GAAP diluted net income per common share includes approximately $8 million in expected stock-based compensation and other expenses, net of tax effects, that are excluded from non-GAAP diluted net income per common share. We are raising our guidance for the fiscal year 2022 ending June 30, 2022, and now expect net sales in a range of $4.2 billion to $4.6 billion versus our prior forecast of $4.1 billion to $4.5 billion. GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be at least $2.77 versus our prior forecast of $2.60. And non-GAAP diluted net income per share of at least $3.20 versus our prior forecast of $3. The company’s projections for GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per common share both assume a tax rate of approximately 16% and a fully diluted share count of 54.1 million shares for GAAP and 55.6 million shares for non-GAAP. The outlook for fiscal year 2022 GAAP diluted net income per common share includes approximately $33 million in expected stock-based compensation and other expenses, net of tax effects that are excluded from non-GAAP diluted net income per common share. We expect CapEx for the fiscal second quarter of 2022 to be in the range of $3 million to $5 million. I’ll turn it back over to you now, Nicole.
Nicole Noutsios: Operator, now you can open up the line for question.
Operator: The floor is now open for your question. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital.
Ananda Baruah: Hi guys. Yes, listen. Good afternoon. Congrats and thanks for taking the question. I guess, a couple for me, just to start off, could you talk about, it seems like you’re highlighting both in the press release and then in your remarks new design wins and speaking of them, broadly that there across the business. Could you maybe talk to what you saw that was – those exciting for you and most incremental to the business throughout the quarter. And then I have a couple of follow-ups. Thanks.
Charles Liang: Yes. Thank you. A very good question. Yes, I share in last few quarters, we started engage more and more large enterprise account. And we, again, it’s even more than handle for a larger account in last few quarter, including 5G/Telco, including AI machine learning and including HPC as well. So pretty much across broader range. We have a more customer and with our B2B automation, auto congregator to I just mentioned. Now we are able to have sales engineer and PA to communicate with customer much more efficiently. So now we have a more bandwidth to talk to more customer, talk more customer’s application in more detail. So I do – we are contained again, customer and again design win.
Ananda Baruah: That’s helpful context, Charles. Thanks. And how would you characterize, I guess, the – I don’t even know, if I want to call it progress with the new Taiwan facility. Could you just describe for us the appropriate, like, the appropriate context of that we can understand, what the operation feels like right now both from a production perspective, but also from a revenue generating perspective as well.
Charles Liang: Yes. Thank you for the question. Yes. As I share with – we see in last few quarter, Asian campus production capacity is very important to our business. In USA, especially, our operation have been pretty much focused on our pay area and that’s 28 years and it really cost too high. So we are very happy finally, we have a big campus in Taipei, Taiwan, and now we have big capacity ready. Indeed, we – today, we just utilize about less than 30% of our capacity. So we have cheaper capacity available in Asia now. So we are very happy and we are a start to a very aggressively engaged customer in Asia and EMEA or even leverage Taiwan, the capacity to support a customer in USA. So that’s a very positive changing to us.
Ananda Baruah: How long Charles, any estimate on, where you’ll get kind of normalized capacity utilization in the Taiwan facility?
Charles Liang: Okay, good. Because of our global shortage, otherwise our revenue must be much bigger than Taipei. We alarmed at $1.03 billion this quarter, because we’re always shortage otherwise that much should be much bigger. So at this moment, our iteration rate in Taiwan is about 30% or a little bit bad. And we expect once the global shortage program to this, we will use unpaid to 80% to 100% capacity in Taiwan almost in a few quarters. So we have a very strong demand and just need a supply chain to be improved.
Ananda Baruah: That’s really helpful, Charles. I appreciate it. I’ll get back into the queue. Thanks a lot.
Charles Liang: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini of SIG.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for thinking my question. A couple of follow-ups on – regarding the balance sheet and cash flow, can you remind me how much more alone a credit you have that you can utilize?
David Weigand: So we have a $200 million line of credit with the Bank of America, and we also have over $300 million in Credit Lines in Taiwan as well.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay. So after a total of $500 milllion, that’s I know with this being neutralize, right?
David Weigand: Yes. So we’ve – as you see from our balance sheet, we’re sitting at about $279 million.
Mehdi Hosseini: Got you. Okay. And then regarding the growth, can you maybe, Charles or anybody else from the team help me understand? What would the key growth drivers in Asia more than double on a year-over-year basis and the U.S., which is the largest market had a double digit growth, but Asia was up double digit. What were the key drivers behind that growth?
Charles Liang: Yes. Indeed, in Asia, we did not have really strong promotion before, because our capacity before it was limited in Asia. And most of the time, we had to ship the port out from USA to customer in Asia, that was our business before. Now we saw Taiwan capacity much, much bigger maybe. So we are very aggressively approaching customer in Asia and these are not just in Asia, in support European customer from Asia, also very good arrangement. And we start to focus kind of our sales force in Asia. So that’s a major reason, and we will continue to invest more as sales marketing team in Asia and EMEA as well as in East Coast, indeed in USA, East Coast will be a very sweet spot for us as well. And we just have a strong team as not to focus on U.S. is cost now.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes, perhaps maybe if I rephrase the question, you highlight the three buckets of revenue, organic and organic enterprise OEM and the Telco. Was there any particular end market that was particularly strong in Asia?
Charles Liang: AI, for example, and Telco – 5G/Telco, for example, and in either because our Asia market share was a small before, so basically we have a lot of norms to grow in Asia.
Mehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thank you.
Charles Liang: Thank you.
Nicole Noutsios: Next question, please.
Operator: Your next question comes from Nehal Choski of Northland Capital Markets.
Nehal Choski: Yes. Thank you. And fantastic results and very strong guidance, great feedback. A couple of questions for me. Charles, what’s your perspective on whether the worst of global supply chain issues have passed or not. And then related to that, how long do you think it will be prudent to continue carrying more base inventory than typical?
Charles Liang: Very good question and a big question. As you know, we usually keep about $900 million in mentoring and now grow to almost $1.3 billion. So the reason why we grow inventory so quickly, because we want to make sure we are doing our best to support the customers and to support our growth. So we continue to improve our relationship with out supply chain, and it’s really a big shortage, especially in chips like those I/O chip, especially, a small chip like what I mentioned before. In some CPU shortage as well, CPU some slow delivery as well. So we are facing to lots of logistics delay and however because we are providing IP total solution now. So we taking care all our difficulty portion and keep complete pattern play direct solution to our customer. So most our customer now are very appreciate, direct scale total solution. And we just had to continue working with our supply chain to enable those shortage item. And how soon can we fix those problems. It’s really a global problem. So people included myself, I guess maybe at least in three months to four months. And hopefully, of the day, things will be improving.
Nehal Choski: Great. Thank you for that perspective. And then following on Mehdi’s question regarding regional performance, helpful on what’s driving Asia. David, you did say that U.S. was down 14% Q2. Is that seasonal? Or is there something more going on there?
David Weigand: I think it’s simply just a matter of digestion. We had some large, very large purchases, and there was some digestion of those purchases, and we expect those to return.
Nehal Choski: Got it. All right. I’m going to get back in the queue. You addressed some good questions as well. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking my questions and also congrats on the quarter and the guide. Just kind of dovetailing off the component question. Everybody is definitely seeing supply constraint. I guess my question on that is, can you comment on what you’re seeing from a pricing perspective of some of the key components in the supply chain, be it memory or other components? And what you’re doing to maybe pass-through some of that pricing? Or how effective you’ve been there?
Charles Liang: Yes. I mean, as you may know, right, CRM price is dropping now since last month, so maybe two months ago. So CRM supply is getting a much better position than before. So other than CRM and most of the other components, still have a big shortage. And we foresee some IC price will continue going up. As you know, even TSMC November 1, some of their product line cost will increase to their customer. So overall, I feel – seen some improvement, but won’t be right away.
Aaron Rakers: And how are you reacting with your own pricing?
Charles Liang: We basically pass-through to our customer whatever we can, and customer is getting used to this model because we just cannot afford to get so much price rise. This year, the customer pretty much understand that.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. In this environment, a lot of companies have seen – are requested maybe their own customers to provide longer lead times on their own purchase commitments. Have you also asked your customers to lengthen out their lead times and, therefore, given you more visibility in the business beyond maybe just this next quarter?
Charles Liang: Yes. Basically, we hope so. But the problem is we cannot deliver even our back order today. So that’s why we did not push customers to predict order much earlier, but we hope they can more transparent to us about their forecast, about their IPO, yes, for sure. But again, the current back orders indeed have been a big demand, and we had to fulfill there as soon as possible.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. And then the final question, just kind of strategically, I’m curious about is, I think the company is fairly well-positioned given your engineering presence and breadth around the role of AI and the proliferation of AI from a compute layer perspective. Can you help us appreciate how material, AI is? I’m assuming that server platforms that are incorporating a GPU predominantly, how big that business is? How fast it’s growing? And any kind of thoughts at a high-level? How much that changes the weakness of the mix of your business on a AI-optimized server relative to more of a traditional server?
Charles Liang: Yes. AI-optimized server for so is high-value, high performance, high-value, and we are very aggressive to continue to grow our AI machine. Indeed, our AI machine, including complete system and some payable, I believe our market share still pretty much top one or top two. I hope top one, and I believe will be continue to grow very strongly because we have been focused so much on those high-end products, including a Total Solution, right, AI Total solution. We start to ship kind of AI Cloud to some of our partner. Again, that makes our customers’ job much easier. So when we ship that direct to customers, customers are able to get targeting networking cable, power cable and pretty much ready to run their applications. So with Total AI Cloud, Total AI solution, I am very optimistic that our deep learning AI machine, even including a video streaming solution will continue to grow very fast.
Aaron Rakers: Very helpful. Thank you, guys.
Charles Liang: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jon Lopez of Vertical Group.
Jon Lopez: Hi. Thanks very much. Can you hear me all right?
David Weigand: Yes, Jon. We can.
Jon Lopez: Great. Thanks, David. So I had a couple of quick ones. I wanted to start on the inventory side as well. So I apologize for doing that, but if I remember correctly, I think your purchase commitments or inventory purchase commitments as of June, excuse me, were up $550 million, $575 million something in that ballpark and add doubled versus where they were at the end of 2020 – calendar 2020? Can you give us a feel for where that stands now as of the end of September, and just given the size of this increases does that ultimately find its way onto your balance sheet? Or are you now it’s sort of a steady state level where what’s going out is more being matched with what’s coming in?
David Weigand: Yes. So as I think the key is we’re going into a seasonally strong December quarter. And so we – that combined with the fact that we’ve got to make sure we get in ahead of supply chain delays as much as possible has really driven our decision to increase inventory levels up. So therefore in this – in the current market with the delays, both on the delivery side, as well as on the production side and the delays in containers making it to port, you’ve got to order earlier. So therefore we have to – we have to place orders in order to keep up with our customer demand. So that’s really, and that’s why we increased our credit lines and use those to increase inventory.
Jon Lopez: Okay. Got it. And just off the top of your head David, do you know where that number stood as of September?
David Weigand: I went out – we’re don’t, I don’t. I don’t release that number on the quarter.
Jon Lopez: Okay. All right. Great. Thanks for that. Secondly, I’m sorry, go ahead please.
David Weigand: So we’ll have a little more color in the 10-K.
Jon Lopez: Sure. Of course. Your deferred revenue actually jumped up quite nicely. The current deferred was up like double digits, which hasn’t really been the case for the last couple of quarters. Why was that?
David Weigand: So two reasons. Number one, we had some customers who prepaid and number two, we had some additional services that were – an increase in services that we had to defer.
Jon Lopez: Okay. That’s help...
Charles Liang: That expand to, I just mentioned, we start to focus on our 5S business right, the software, breaches and service and those probably have a higher profitability, but they are also generally priority four revenue.
Jon Lopez: Got it. That’s really helpful. Thanks. Sorry, two other quick ones. The first one is, David, I think you made mention to gross margin. I think you said it was going to increase. I wasn’t sure if that meant in the December quarter or that was just sort of an intermediate term comment. But can you remind us a) like what are the targets again; and b) just put some color around that that comment and how we should think about maybe trending and trajectory?
David Weigand: Sure, absolutely. So our target model gross margin is of course 14 to 17. And we’ve mentioned that again, this quarter our transportation costs or freight costs went up by $3 million or 30 basis points. And that was on top of the increase from the prior quarter. Now, I can tell you that in my discussions with our operations people, it looks like that amount is starting to level off of that the rates are leveling off. And so we are – so the guidance that we give is giving or giving is to be up both in Q2, as well as in the second half.
Jon Lopez: Gotcha. Really helpful. Okay. And sort of is that leveling off a relatively recent phenomenon, or is that something maybe you observed through the course of the quarter?
David Weigand: That’s just, I mean, there’s only been one month in this quarter, but so far they don’t seem to be increasing at the same rate that they were in prior quarters.
Jon Lopez: Gotcha. Okay. I’m sorry. I was trying to take the prior quarter. So they kept increasing through your fiscal Q1?
David Weigand: Yes. So in other words, through Q4, they continue to increase. And then in Q1, they also increased another 30 basis points. And another think about it is 30 basis points on lower evidence that the freight costs went up. So, I’m saying in the current Q2, we see that leveling off.
Jon Lopez: Gotcha. Really helpful. And so my very last one. Just as we think about your fiscal 2022 guidance, you mentioned that both units and prices increased in your September quarter. Excuse me, I’m wondering as we think about this sort of, let’s call it 20% odd growth that you’re building in for your fiscal 2022. Can you give us a rough sense for how much of that is going to come from pricing versus what’s going to come from units?
David Weigand: I think that’s too hard to judge. Yes.
Jon Lopez: Okay. Okay. Would your gut be that it’s going to be a combination of the two? Maybe I can leave it there.
David Weigand: Absolutely. Absolutely.
Jon Lopez: Okay. All right. Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Nehal Choski of Northland Capital Market.
Nehal Choski: Yes. Thanks for taking my follow up questions. And great on the breakout relative to the three colors of growth that you’re laid out here and I’ll state really appreciate that. Do you have color on how each of these trended on a year-over-year basis relative to the overall year-over-year growth?
David Weigand: Yes, so we’re actually on verticals. We didn’t – we’re not going back on a year-over-year basis, because we really started tracking this closely beginning with the fiscal year end. And so but as each quarter, now we’ll give a little bit more insight. But I can tell you that, the one vertical that went down, which was in the 5G – I’m sorry, the OEM, and OEM appliance was really, as I mentioned, that was the digestion that I referred to from a couple of customers. And we see that returning that first returning in Q2.
Nehal Choski: Got it. Okay, great. And then what is the risk that the strong demand that you’re seeing is a result of the supply chain disruptions, and that you are having customers come through – new customers come to you in an effort to go or triple source, or of course, triple source and effectively alleviate their own supply chain issues?
Charles Liang: Yes, this is a very important area, we watch very well. So most our orders are pretty evenly come from our customer base. So at this moment, I did not see in the specific this year. So pretty evenly come from many customer and from many different vertical. And by the way, our Building Block Solutions, not advantages we can simply kind of the configurator system. So even in one customer slow down, we won’t have to kind of really have a hard time for over inventory.
Nehal Choski: Right. I think that later part is an excellent point. So maybe frame that up of the incremental demand that you’re seeing. How much of that is coming in the form of a configuration that your competitors typically would not satisfy that they’re much more limited configurations that they could provide.
Charles Liang: Yes. And see I’m very happy to share. Most of our growth from our Building Block Solutions, after we continue to emphasize our Building Block Solutions and see the most of the customer now put it our Building Block Solutions, because it’s easy to support their urgent demand and also this over inventory risk for our sale and volume sale.
Nehal Choski: Okay, great. And then my final follow-up question is for Dave. SG&A, I think, was down $4 million in Q2. Is that correct? And why is that?
David Weigand: So we had a little bit lower. We had – personal, it was – we had increased personnel costs. And then we did have a little bit lower bonuses this in Q2. I’m sorry, in Q1, I said in Q1.
Nehal Choski: Alright, got it. Thank you very much.
David Weigand: Okay.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jon Tanwanteng of CJS Securities.
Jon Tanwanteng: Hi everybody. Thank you for taking my question. Great quarter and outlook. David, I was just wondering if you could clarify the sequential increase in gross margins. What’s getting that – where are you finding that? Is it mostly your selling prices catching up to inflation? Are you expecting to reduce some costs or realize some other efficiencies? Or is there a mix improvement as you go forward? Just help me understand what the sequential increase coming from?
David Weigand: Sure, Jon. There’s a number of factors. Number one, we expect to start gaining traction from our auto-configurator, B2B, B2C solutions. We also have been exercising more price discipline. And also, we’ve learned how to manage, how to better manage the passing on of freight charges and other things and our cost increases to our customers. So that, along with the – some of the margins from our new product offerings give us a good little bit better insight into margin growth.
Jon Tanwanteng: Okay. Perfect. And I just wanted to touch on the auto-configure and B2B. You mentioned actually. What was the sales advantage there? I don’t know if you can quantify it exactly, but just give us a sense of how important that is to your growth and how big you expect it to be going forward in the next couple of quarters?
Charles Liang: It will be very important, especially for our long-term. Before we see many come from manpower sales, FA and PA to work with customer one-by -one. But now we see inhabiting database, not online for CT, are able to help customers figure out what’s the base configuration, what’s the base of the product for them and then embed it through our commence center-based service. So almost all our customer in sales who have able use that system are very happy with the service and shrink the time to communicate and make the communication much more accurate product optimization, much more cost down and data performance. So for midterm, long-term, I’m very optimistic with auto-configurator command center-based B2B system.
Jon Tanwanteng: Great. Maybe just the last one for me. What is the margin of sales through that channel compared to your regular sales maybe versus what it normally has been?
Charles Liang: We did not share with that number yet. But basically, the profitability will be higher because B2B auto-configurator, we are able to work with many more customers and especially a lot of middle-sized enterprise customer now. But before we can take are only large-scale customer because we do not have in our man power to take care of 2 million ton. But now with automation we have, we are able to reach to many more middle-sized enterprise account. And for those accounts, as the pro-margin data.
Jon Tanwanteng: Okay, great. Thank you.
Charles Liang: Thank you.

In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today's press release and in the supplemental information attached to today's presentation. At the end of today's prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session for sell-side analysts to ask questions. I'll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Founder, Chairman and CEO. Charles?
Charles Liang: Thank you, Nicole, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to announce that for the first time our quarterly revenue has exceeded $1 billion. For fiscal Q4 2021, we delivered year-over-year revenue growth of 19.3%. For the whole fiscal year 2021, our revenue grew 6.5%. We have gained market share and finally resumed fast growth starting from March quarter this year, after the impact from the past 10-K delay and COVID19 challenges. The revenue growth was driven by some wins from large enterprise customers and large multi-nation high-tech companies. These customers choose Super Micro because of our green computing technology, faster time-to-market, and plug-and-play total IT solutions, especially in appliance, Cloud, AI and 5G markets. Now, let’s look at some key highlights from the quarter. Our fiscal fourth-quarter net sales totaled $1.07 billion, up 19.3%, both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, at the top end of our guidance range. This growth rate, I believe, is much higher than that of the industry. All our major geographies contributed double-digit year-over-year quarterly growth. Our fiscal fourth-quarter non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.81, up from $0.68 same period last year. We saw a significant increase in sales from new and existing large, high-profile customers. Our strong momentum is mainly driven by our business expansion from hardware solution to total IT solution that consists of hardware, software, and services. We have doubled our software engineering resources in the past 24 months to allow us to swiftly execute this plan. Through engagement and close collaboration with strategic leading hardware and software partners, we have provided our customers fully optimized, tested, certified, and ready-to-deploy reference architectures. As a result, large volume orders are deployed timely without customers’ having to go through complicated processes of hardware validation, software compatibility, and supply chain disruption. It’s a win-win for everyone. Earlier in fiscal Q4, we successfully executed the launch of Intel Ice Lake, AMD Milan and NVIDIA A100 GPU based product lines and began to ship more than 200 application-optimized product solutions. They are all based on the strong foundation of our Server Building Block Solution. These optimized systems are created in-house, leveraging close to three decades of subsystem innovations, including motherboards, enclosures, power supplies, and cooling technologies. What’s more, our security and management software empower customers to deploy, manage and scale in a timely manner from enterprises to hyperscalers. On the product side, our new Ice Lake-based X12 generation multi-node solutions have gained great tractions among customers who are looking to scale out their enterprise and cloud datacenters. From SuperBlade, MicroBlade to BigTwin, FatTwin and the upcoming GrandTwin, all these resource-saving product lines support dense NVMe and Optane persistent memory, flexible GPU and FPGA configurations, providing optimal performance and the best TCO to a variety of customer workloads. Our GPU product lines are continuing their strong growth with the explosion of AI/ML application demands. These new Ice Lake and Milan-based GPU product lines support larger on-GPU memory and accelerate compute intensive applications. Our 2U 2-node GPU system has proven to be a top-seller since its introduction, thanks to its optimal mix of CPU-to-GPU ratio and resource-saving features. Later this year, we’ll be introducing a brand-new Universal GPU product line that will provide even more flexible configurations for many different CPU and GPU modules combination, further push the limit of system density and performance up to 50% when compared to competition. Announced in June during Computex 2021, the Plug & Play Rack product line is an integral part of our complete solution strategy going forward. These turn-key racks have undergone a thorough, solution level design and validation process and built securely for our AI, 5G/Telco, enterprise, cloud, and storage customers. Upon receiving these total IT solutions, customers only need to connect power and networking, then they are immediately ready to run their applications, shortening the time from making decisions to seeing results. To further improve sales and operations efficiency, we will launch our auto-configurator tool to enable B2B/B2C automation, which will be broadly ready to service our customers in the coming few weeks. This tool makes it faster to achieve product optimization and more efficient to leverage configurations among our sales, engineers, and customers. We recently completed our Taiwan campus expansion. Now with the total 3 million square feet campus in Taiwan, we are equipped to deliver not only sufficient capacity, supply chain resilience, but also lower cost structure. Combined with manufacturing facilities in Silicon Valley and the Netherlands, Super Micro is well positioned to grow market share with economy of scale, agility, quality and rapid delivery time. To satisfy our customers' fast-growing demands, we are working aggressively across our global supply chain to mitigate critical parts shortage. In summary, Super Micro has been solidly transforming into a total IT solution company from a server hardware company. In addition to providing the greenest hardware total solution, our software and service products are now ready for large enterprise, cloud, AI and Telco customers. Second, our Taiwan campus expansion doubles our solution capacity and lowers our cost structure. Now if we decide to do so, we can start to reduce our expense in Silicon Valley HQ. Third, our business automation program, including the auto-configurator and B2B/B2C systems, will significantly improve customer experience by streamlining customer configuration and order process, resulting in shortened solution delivery time with better quality and optimization. With that as a summary, I believe our fiscal year 2022 revenue will reach at least $4.3 billion and start to grow much faster than our past four years. In closing, I am pleased with the progress of our business transformation, which has started to speed up our business execution in fiscal '21. As a total IT solution company, we are now able to grow business much more efficiently and achieve our $10 billion of revenue goal quicker, perhaps we are able pull in from 2026 to 2025 or even sooner. With that, I will now pass the call to David Weigand, our Chief Financial Officer, to provide additional details on the quarter.
David Weigand: Thank you, Charles. We continued to accelerate in all major areas of the company and exceeded $1 billion in revenue for the quarter, which was at the high end of our guidance range. Growth was driven by wins from large enterprise customers and key high-tech companies worldwide, continued strength across all major geographies and solid demand for our products and services. Our fiscal fourth quarter revenue totaled $1.07 billion, reflecting a 19% increase both on a year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter basis. Looking at Super Micro's Q4 revenue in our three market verticals, we achieved $672 million in organic enterprise and channel AI and machine learning vertical, $366 million in OEM and large data center vertical, and $31 million in 5G/Telco and Edge/IoT vertical. Systems comprised 78% of total revenue and the volume of systems shipped was up year-over-year, while the nodes shipped were down year-over-year. System ASPs increased year-over-year and quarter-on-quarter. Performance was strong across all major geographies this quarter. On a year-on-year basis, Asia increased 25%, U.S. increased 21%, and Europe increased 13%, while Rest of World decreased 3%. On a sequential basis, U.S. sales increased 30%, Europe increased 14%, Asia decreased 1%, and Rest of World increased 7%. From this point forward, unless otherwise noted, I will be discussing financial metrics on a non-GAAP basis. Working down the P&L, the Q4 gross margin was 13.7%, down 30 basis points year-on-year and 10 basis points quarter-on-quarter. We expected our Q4 gross margin to improve 70 basis points due to discreet costs incurred in Q3. As expected, those costs did not repeat in Q4, however expedite fees and shipping costs increased by 50 basis points quarter-over-quarter. As reported by many other companies around the world, supply chain pressures related to the resurgence of variants of COVID-19 persist. Turning to operating expenses, Q4 OpEx on a GAAP basis was essentially flat quarter-on-quarter and decreased 7% year-on-year to $106 million. The decrease year-on-year was caused by a decrease in incentive bonuses, offset by higher headcount this year, primarily in R&D. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses increased 4% quarter-on-quarter and increased 9% year-on-year to $99 million. The quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year increases were related to headcount and other personnel costs as we continue to invest in human capital to address our growth opportunities. Other income and expense including interest expense which was a $2.1 million loss as compared to a $1.4 million gain last quarter. The sequential change is mostly related to FX. This quarter our tax benefit was $1.6 million on a GAAP basis and an expense of $1.8 million on a non-GAAP basis. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 4% for the quarter. Lastly, our share of income from our JV was $0.6 million this quarter as compared to a loss of $0.3 million last quarter. Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share totaled $0.81 as compared to $0.50 in Q3 of fiscal 2021 and $0.68 in the same quarter of last year. Cash flow from operations totaled $64 million compared to cash flow used in operations of $124 million in Q3. CapEx totaled $13 million resulting in free cash flow of $50 million. Key uses of cash during the quarter included increases to inventory and receivables while key providers of cash included an increase of $144 million in accounts payable and $12 million in deferred revenues. The increase in deferred revenue was due to higher sales of our service contracts. We also used $12 million to repurchase shares in the quarter. Our closing balance sheet cash position was $232 million, while bank debt was $98 million, resulting in a net cash balance of $134 million. Turning to the balance sheet and working capital metrics compared to last quarter, our Q4 cash conversion cycle was 80 days, which from down from 86 day in Q3, beating our target range of 85 to 90 days. While the absolute level of our inventory increased, days of inventory at 96 days decreased. Days Sales Outstanding was 37 days while Days Payables Outstanding totaled 53 days. Now turning to the outlook for our business. We expect net sales in a range of $900 million to $980 million, which resulted in GAAP diluted net income per share of $0.16 to $0.36 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $0.28 to $0.48 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 which ends September 30, 2021. We expect gross margins to remain at similar levels sequentially, with upside potential as we manage supply chain costs and maintain price discipline. Over the upcoming quarters, we expect to achieve margins within our target model as we further scale our Taiwan operations and begin to gain traction from our new product offerings and auto configurator B2B and B2C solutions. GAAP operating expenses are forecasted to be approximately $110 million and include $7 million in stock-based compensation expenses and $1 million in other expenses not included in non-GAAP operating expenses. We expect other income and expense, including interest expense, to total roughly $2 million and expect a nominal contribution from our JV. Non-GAAP operating expenses are forecasted to be up quarter-on-quarter from continued investment in R&D, lower NRE expected and higher personnel costs. The company’s projections for GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per common share both assume a tax rate of approximately 16% and a fully diluted share count of 53.7 million shares for GAAP and 55.0 million shares for non-GAAP. The outlook for Q1 of fiscal year 2022 GAAP diluted net income per common share includes approximately $8 million in expected stock-based compensation and other expenses, net of taxes, that are excluded from non-GAAP diluted net income per common share. We expect net sales in a range of $4.1 billion to $4.5 billion, GAAP diluted net income per share of at least $2.60 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of at least $3 for fiscal year 2022 which ends June 30, 2022. The company’s projections for GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per common share both assume a tax rate of approximately 16% and a fully diluted share count of 55.3 million shares for GAAP and 56.5 million shares for non-GAAP. The outlook for fiscal year 2022 GAAP diluted net income per common share includes approximately $30 million in expected stock-based compensation and other expenses, net of taxes, that are excluded from non-GAAP diluted net income per common share. We expect CapEx for the fiscal first quarter of 2022 of approximately $14 to $16 million. Nicole, I’ll turn it back to you for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is open.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes, thanks for taking the question. I had a couple follow-ups if I was to take the midpoint of guide range for fiscal year 2022. It seems like maybe there is a little bit of a, leverage in operating profit in other words, maybe a 200 basis points of improvement to get $3 of earnings. What I want to understand is, what are the key assumptions for component costs is this a base case or very conservative case? And I have a follow-up to that?
Charles Liang: I would rather say, it’s based on conservative base because supply chain continued to very tight. And although we have a good relationship with all, of our supplier but anyway its global incentive program so it’s a conservative base, but because our operation now is able to genetically expanded to Taiwan so - well though overall cost.
Mehdi Hosseini: Right so where is the most - what segment of the supply chain you're experiencing the most shortage? What are the key components that you're relatively have - the most difficult time procuring?
Charles Liang: IC chip especially IO chip.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay. And question on the cash flow what was the depreciation, amortization for the reported June quarter and what should be assume for fiscal year 2022?
Charles Liang: I’ll get back to Mehdi on this.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay. Given the CapEx growth in fiscal year 2021 on the $60 million and the buildup of the Taiwan facility, should we expect CapEx to moderate from here?
Charles Liang: Absolutely, yes because our Taiwan operation is pretty much ready we add about 200 staff in Taiwan in last year month and all the people have been well trained. And they just moved into the new building last month. Other than that, now free information as we just mentioned for B2B/B2C and order comes later. We hire people and same people and they are about always and start to offer our service to certain customer. And we will over the year apply to all the customer in the next few weeks.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay great. So I’ll get back in queue?
Charles Liang: My investment, have been there…
Mehdi Hosseini: So Charles, are you implying that the CapEx should decline in fiscal 2022?
Charles Liang: Maybe because we are growing I mean, 2022/2023/2024 we expect continue to grow so I guess the operation expense won’t shrink it may grow very kind of consistent - very limited growth because we already invested there.
Operator: Your next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Northland. Your line is open.
Nehal Chokshi: Yes thank you and congratulations on strong results especially the free cash flow we’re expecting a drain based on this commentary for last quarter and enjoy very nice free cash. It’s looks like the big delta relative to our expectation with an increasing base payable and given this environment of trained component environment. I mean, how is it pulled off basically?
David Weigand: So now we did have a lot of inventory that came at the near end of the quarter. And so that's what caused accounts payable to rise and with a result in rise in DTO.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay.
Charles Liang: And now I can see there is a positive so keep kind of high inventory because we strongly believe customer needed those products.
Charles Liang: And so by the yes….
Nehal Chokshi: Go ahead sorry please?
Charles Liang: All right, you can tell from our forecasts from our revenue forecast that our sales are not dipping as they traditionally do in Q1. And so therefore, we needed to have more inventory on hand, which was why, I alluded to the challenges of cash flow for this projecting cash flow for Q4. But we ended up in a good position.
Nehal Chokshi: I see so I guess because we built up the inventory, at the end of the quarter you’re satisfied a strong demand, you're seeing the September quarter and the balance sheet is showing up as increased base payable. But what you're saying is that base payable terms actually didn't increase, this is simply the timing of which you received the inventory.
Charles Liang: That's exactly right.
Nehal Chokshi: Got it okay understood okay. And I don't recall last time you gave full-year guidance. I'm not sure if you have before, but certainly I don't think you did during fiscal year 2021 or fiscal year 2020, or past few years, one year in 10-K filing delay held. So what has changed to give you visibility guide on the full year basis, and importantly, almost 10% of that the consensus estimate?
Charles Liang: Not much reason, but pretty much because we have a successful expansion in Taiwan, and also are build in business automation, including the auto congregator and B2B, B2C tool. And also a company expanding from a hardware solution company to total IT solution company. So we saw it’s a good idea to open the market, kind of more completed picture for a whole year and for the future.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay all right. And this midpoint 20% growth guidance for fiscal year 2022 is this tied to any sort of - and server industry growth expectation?
Charles Liang: I'm sorry, what was the last part of your question is it tied to what?
Nehal Chokshi: Is it tied to server industry growth any sort of server industry growth expectation or is it independent of server industry growth?
Charles Liang: Not quite, not quite. As we mentioned, we had returned to faster growth faster in other model. If you remember, before 2017, we were attending delays our growth always had been two times to four times faster than our industry. And we believe we are returned to the faster growth being this model. So start from March and June last quarter, we start to outperform in our industry. And I believe we will start to outperform in our industry growth rate maybe double or triple or even more, looking forward. So we are very much here in the lower.
Nehal Chokshi: Yes, undoubtedly, clearly but is there a particular industry growth rate that you are expecting an urge I got 20% year-over-year 5%, 10%, 2% share your thoughts on that?
Charles Liang: We believe our industry may grow 5% to 10% and our growth it should be a double to our people over there operate.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay, great. And then my final question, is that the minimum $3 per share? Does that correspond to the low end of the revenue guidance, or to the midpoint of revenue guidance?
Charles Liang: I rather say it’s a conservative number.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is open.
Ananda Baruah: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the strong revenue execution and the visibility to put out a long-term word of fiscal year rough guide here? I guess a couple from me if I could, David, could you just walk back through the components that you spoke to on gross margin? I just want to make sure that I'm straight on those. And then I have a quick follow up as well.
David Weigand: Certainly, so when we finished last quarter at, you know at 13.8, we had some about 70 basis points of discrete costs, and which included some assumption costs as well. But mainly, it was principally streets and discrete costs that we didn't expect to occur. So this quarter, those did not occur. But we did have 50 basis points more of a shipping costs. And it was it was really caused by our directed effort to deliver product to our customers on time. And that’s what our customers expect and demand. So that’s really the reason that we were not able to raise margin occur. Just because these…
Ananda Baruah: That’s cool. And so if you lost the 70 to that 13 to 13.1%, and then I got it and then you - sorry, you lost 70 and you gained 70 so that will take you to 14.5% or so, and then you had 50 more so that took you to - about to take you back down to 14%. And then was there, I think I’m doing that math right. Correct me if I’m wrong. And then was there an incremental 30 basis point headwind that brought it down to the 13.7%?
David Weigand: Well, there was. We had two things. One, we had deferred revenue that we added to our balance sheet of about $12 million. So we had to carve-out some income for our services. And we also had, just the rest was just product mix and…
Ananda Baruah: Got it. Okay. And then, like how should we - what are sort of the pushes and the pulls? You may mentioned it in the prepared remarks that you expect in the coming quarters to move up into the 14% to 17% range. What are the pushes and pulls there? And if there’s any way to give them by order of magnitude, that would be helpful also.
David Weigand: Sure, absolutely. So, we realized that with the Delta variant, it’s hard to say that COVID is over. And so therefore, we expect to continue to have challenges on supply chain shipping costs. However, we do expect our other initiatives such as our transition over to Taiwan and our new product offerings, and especially in those verticals that have attractive - more attractive gross margins, as well as our B2B and B2C configurator. We expected benefit of those things to start to come to the business in the upcoming quarters. So in the short run, we know that Taiwan has gone online. However, it's going to take a couple quarters to start to realize benefits.
Ananda Baruah: Any - can we - I’m sure I’m not the only one intrigued about this. Any chance you get you to give us some sense of - for fiscal 2022 what the gross margin could look like?
Charles Liang: So we’ve given guidance on the top line and the bottom line. But we're not going - other than the fact that we expect gross margins to improve, we're not giving further guidance.
Ananda Baruah: I got it. But it’s not unreasonable to think that you would be in the range by the end of the year – end of fiscal…
Charles Liang: Yes. Our target is to go - and I think this is in the notes. Our target is to be back within our range during the year.
Ananda Baruah: Our range?
Charles Liang: Yes, our range by the way was 14% to 17%. Yes.
Ananda Baruah: Yes. Appreciate it. I'll get back in the queue here. I appreciate it. That's really helpful. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Aaron Rakers: Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the quarter. I’m just curious as the industry and not just you guys, but the industry in whole deals with supply chain shortages, semiconductor, IC shortages, et cetera. I’m curious on your side of the business. Have you been able to invoke your own customers to provide you with extended lead times and has that provided you with better visibility? And then on the heels of that kind of tied to that question is, is the guidance for this current quarter assuming that you would have actually outperformed that number if you were able to get all of that - all of the supply to meet demand? Put it another way, are you able to meet demand as you see it in the current quarter?
Charles Liang: Very good question. Again, although it’s highly whatever possible we could, but still, we cannot get however we want. So we cannot shift all our demand to our customer. But I wanted to say, we can shift most of that, maybe customers still had weighted longer than regular time. And the going we have a loss of repeat customer, older customer. So they understand the global difficulty, so a longer lead times is people don’t like to see that, but basically they are cooperative. So we cannot shift wider customer need, but basically customer happy with our physical service.
Aaron Rakers: And what is your current view of expectations of when that normalizes? Does your fiscal 2022 guidance reflect a view that the tightness in the semiconductor supply chain starts to normalize through this fiscal year or do you think it’s out further than that? Just curious of what your thoughts are?
Charles Liang: Yes. I mean, as I shared before and now, traditionally, our growth story was double to quadruple faster than our industry. And I believe we already get back from that momentum. Double to quadruple faster than our industry. Now because of that the global shortage, that impact our growth a little bit for sure. And that’s why we are humbled to stay maybe $4.3 billion even now because of big shortage equivocally. I believe our growth will be a much better than that.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. And then the final quick question is, there is a lot of architectural things going on in the server and the universe around semiconductors and so on. I’m curious of how - what kind of growth that you’re seeing in GPU accelerated server platforms. Do you think that there is a longer term narrative that we’re at the point where actually the richness of the server configurations can really drive a positive upward trend and blended ASPs for foreseeable future. I’m just curious to how you’re seeing compute architectures evolve that maybe benefits you guys from a growth perspective?
Charles Liang: Yes. As a technology company based on Silicon Valley, we like technical challenge. We like new tech knowledge. That’s why a lots different CPU, a lots of different GPU, a lots of different platform, not to a big trends to us. And that’s why I just mentioned, we will introduce Grand Twin a brand new architecture to the market very soon. And we also examining a universal GPU platform and that will be ready by end of this year. So all of those is to provide the much more flexible kind of support on multiple different CPUs, vendor, multiple different GPU vendor, and different form factor. So all the platform we think will benefit our customers. And thank you to our building for solution, we are able to kind of optimize architecture and especially Grand Twin and kind of universal GPU solution. So we are very happy - really excited to see the opportunity.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jon Tanwanteng with CJS Securities. Your line is open.
Jon Tanwanteng: Good afternoon, guys, and great quarter and also the outlook is pretty impressive. I wanted to drill down on the previous just on how you have confidence in that $4.3 billion in revenue. Is that a bottoms up analysis with like qualified customer leads indication of interest? Contracts that may have already been signed or is there more - or that you actually have to go out and get before you can achieve that? I’m wondering how you build to that?
Charles Liang: It’s both bottoms up and top down from both direction we see the growth where it will be very strong. Again, it’s not because of global shortage. Our growth should be much better than that. And with better product with our current operation, and with also many more new engaged high profile customer we achieved in the last six months and currently. So we feel pretty optimistic of that.
Jon Tanwanteng: And I was going to ask, how do you feel about your ability to pass price through in this environment? You talked about expedited shipping. I know that you were doing airfreight last quarter just to get things to customers on time. I would think that everyone knows at this point that it’s impossible to get things without paying of extra shipping charges. So I’m wondering if you’re running on surcharges or other pricing methods to be able to pass that through the customer. And if so, are they receptive to it?
Charles Liang: Very good question and a complicated question too. So we try whenever possible to communicate with the customers. But overall, we have to absorb I would have to say at least 50% of that well maybe plus-50% percent of customer. So we tried to kind of provide a customer very cooperative way. So that we can grow much there as well.
Jon Tanwanteng: Okay. Great. And maybe just one final one on pricing. When do you think you can catch up on pricing just to higher input costs? Is it a quarter or the two? How should we think of the lag time before you’re able to absorb all of that?
Charles Liang: Again, it’s a complicated question because all the pandemic the airfreight still going on. So - but once the COVID-19 ends I believe will recover to normal. But before that, we are getting able to pass those overhead actual cost to customers. Likewise, they maybe 50-50 in in last quarter, and we will be getting better, but hopefully COVID-19 problem can be end very soon. So we will get back to normal automatically.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line Jon Lopez with Vertical Group. Your line is open.
Jon Lopez: I'm very sorry. That’s great. I had phone trouble. Sorry about that. Thanks, David. So I just have say two, I wanted to come back for a second to the fiscal Q1 guidance and maybe to come out this way. I thought in summer March you made you referenced like not declining in fiscal Q1. But I guess as we calculated actually a bit below your normal seasonal trending pattern and that’s after being pretty comfortably above that pattern in the last two quarter, so both fiscal Q3 and fiscal Q4. So, I guess my question is one are we looking at those numbers differently than you are maybe just set me through what you meant when you said not declining. And then two, is there any constraint on your revenue guidance relative to component or logistical issues perhaps if you can quantify that? Thanks.
David Weigand: Sure. I think that - I think what our range does is a range allow us for the struggles that we faced in the supply chain. So therefore, we feel like we provided a broad enough range that we can overachieve And we can also, but we feel comfortable with that range.
Charles Liang: I guess one, the other factor is that because last year COVID-19 reason we didn't adjust the employees’ salary that much. So this year, we have a much bigger salary adjustment for employees. That's why we see Q1, Q2 you may see our expected growth, one of the portion because of salary adjustments, and also Taiwan expansion. So we hire people in Taiwan and train people, but they were ready to contribute to our revenue and profitability.
Jon Lopez: Okay, thanks. Yes, I guess that helps a bit. I guess my other question just to come back to the gross margin for a second. So to arrive at this $3 figure the north of $3 figure, especially based on what you're referencing OpEx there Charles, I mean the gross margin does need. I think, to be pretty close to 15%. As we get out of calendar Q3 and into the remainder of your fiscal year? I guess why do you think like, do any of these things feel as though you have line of sight to and ending as we look beyond calendar Q3? And if not, are you committing that you get to $3 some other way, like we rain back on OpEx or just maybe walk us through the interplay between why you might have comfort in the $3 number, if you don't have visibility to some of these logistical issues, or cost issues abating?
Charles Liang: David [indiscernible].
David Weigand: Sure, so one of the things that helps our cost structure, again, is the movement of our production over to Taiwan. So that's, we expect that to give us - benefit, as well as the attraction in our new product offerings, which we expect to bring higher margins than the traditional server business. So those are the factors that we have insight into and give us confidence that in spite of, supply chain challenges, which we've managed to meet. And in spite of higher costs, which we you know, in terms of shipping and an air freight, which we've continued to deal with, we still believe that through, price management that we can achieve the margins, which will allow us to deliver the targets that we are forecasting.
Charles Liang: Yes, the other way to answer your question more directly is that we explained our growth will be significant in fiscal year 2022 and 2023. And we are very confident to see that happen. But if in case it didn't happen, then that means we have too much resource now. So we may reduce some resources in USA quota. I hope we don't do so, but if we had to we will, and we have that option. So that will reduce our operation close over zero. I hope we don't need to go over that way.
Operator: We have a follow-up question from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is open.
Mehdi Hosseini: Thank you. Just a quick follow up. I want to get your view on current memory prices. How do you see the trend over the next one or two quarters? And I'm asking you about availability and pricing trends?
Charles Liang: Very complicated question, but very good question is how to put in take, as at this moment, we see the availability is getting better than last quarter. So on a price changes should be better than before. And as to when the price will stop growing, or a price were going down. We watch very carefully. So at this moment, no clear date, but at least we feel it’s better than last quarter.
Mehdi Hosseini: Thanks for the color. I know it’s very difficult to look beyond a couple of months. As you think about your FY '22 revenue guide, how should I think about incremental opportunities there? A lot of AI type projects that hyperscalers are expected to ramp. Do you think your FY '22 revenue guide captures some of them? Or should we wait for FY '23 to have a consistent and more meaningful material contribution?
Charles Liang: Good question. I mean for AI, we - the rule we’re very aware in fiscal year 2021. And year 2022, I believe we will continue to grow very well, maybe more than 50%, I hope. Right. And for our telco. Telco is another territory we grew very well last year. And I believe this year 2022 our telco buildings will grow much better than even last year. So last year are still very strong area for us. As to hyperscaler, with our Taiwan operation now is ready. So we have a chance to start to service some hyperscaler customer if we select to. But I believe we will be very selective for some bid of customers, where we can provide a value, we will.
Mehdi Hosseini: And Charles, when you talked about AI, does that includes kind of the arm based A6 CPU or do you lump that into the hyperscaler segment?
Charles Liang: A very future question. But…
Mehdi Hosseini: Right.
Charles Liang: Yes, we have some - we have some arm design as well. Few customer already prefer arms submission. We have some submission there under the belt.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay. So when talk about AI it’s not necessarily an arm based solution it’s more general, right?
Charles Liang: Many still are interior in the base -- in NVIDIA.
Mehdi Hosseini: Sure. But when you referenced hyperscalers that's predominantly arm base solutions?
Charles Liang: Not necessarily. I mean, as hyperscale to [indiscernible].
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay. All right. Got it. Okay. So we can't really isolate that because perhaps it’s just too early to determine arm base - independent arm base solution, right?
Charles Liang: When customer need it, we will be ready.
Operator: And for the last question we have a follow-up from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is open.
Ananda Baruah: Thanks, guys for the follow-up. Yes. Just wanted to ask any context you could give us how we think about revenue seasonality during fiscal year 2022? Will there be a seasonal pattern or will it be. I mean, there will be a seasonal pattern but will it be different than usual fairly ratable on the year-over-year basis? Thanks.
Charles Liang: Yeah. As you may know, right, September always now exceeding. So this year no exception, right? Although we have a strong demand but global shortage that major reason that we try to be conservative when we share the number with you for September quarter.
Ananda Baruah: And then Charles, through the rest of the year, should we just assume typical seasonality to get to the - into the guidance range?
Charles Liang: Yes, basically. But traditionally December and June, always our good quarter.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.

At the end of today's prepared remarks, you will have a Q&A session for sell side analysts to ask questions. I'll now like to turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Charles Liang: Thank you. Nico and good afternoon everyone. Last quarter, we have performed, our growth strategy well, by winning new key customers extended our global operation and introduced a whole new generation of hotels. We have released our fiscal 2021, third quarter financial results. Let's take a look at some highlights. Our fiscal third quarter net sales totaled $896 million, up 16% year-over-year and up 8% sequentially. For the first time in our company history since IPO, the revenue from seasonally-weak March quarter significantly surpassed that of the December quarter. Our fiscal third-quarter non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.50, above the midpoint of our previously guided range of $0.37 to $0.57. In this quarter, we also generated a record revenue from the Asia Pacific region, demonstrating our continued and expanding traction in Asia. We continue to execute our three-year growth strategy highlighted in our recent investor update on March 4th. Our progress, judged by historical industry growth rates, has propelled us to resume the position of the fastest growing U.S.-based server/storage manufacturer. More importantly, we achieved all this despite so much of our focus having been on growing the company's long-term foundation. Earlier this quarter, we introduced the industry's most comprehensive server portfolio leveraging the latest processors from both Intel and AMD. Our application-optimized solutions are gaining traction among the world's most advanced datacenters and enterprises. We have several committed early ship customers that have deployed thousands of server units, led by our SuperBlade. We also seed out optimized systems for many verticals such as artificial intelligence, telco, cloud and more. One successful example is our collaboration with Osaka University in Japan with our liquid-cooled HPC solution, which takes full advantage of the new powerful Ice Lake processors. Hundreds of other customers have already utilized our early sampling program or accessed the new systems online through our JumpStart program. These activities should accelerate the deployment ramp of this new generation of products and propel growth for this calendar year. In addition to the systems based on the new CPUs, we released an innovative new GPU system architecture last quarter with resource savings in mind. With very strong global demand, the optimized 2U 2-node GPU solution delivers great cost savings, utilizing shared power and cooling. This 2U 2-node system supports 3 double-width or 6 single-width PCIe Gen-4 GPUs, and is the best platform for video streaming, high-end cloud gaming, and countless social networking applications. We have been executing a robust manufacturing plan in Taiwan for a few years. With attractive new product lines and strong customer demand, we recognize the importance of optimizing operational efficiency and reducing cost, especially with a tighter supply chain. As one of the key elements of our strategy, our Taiwan campus expansion will increase our capacity and capabilities in production, operation, engineering, and sales to deliver more cost-optimized offerings. Manufacturing cost has been our painful challenge since company was founded 27 years ago. Now with the new 1 million square feet of manufacturing and office space added to our Taiwan campus this summer, we will become more profitable by having more control over our global supply chain and manufacturing cost. The U.S. campus expansion, which will be online shortly after the completion of the Taiwan expansion, will focus on similar operational goals but with more emphasis on security and Made-In-U.S.A. initiatives. Again, these expansions will position us well to handle the ongoing logistics challenge and rising costs while further improving our time-to-market advantages and production scale and agility. We are making progress in the key growth factors I mentioned in our recent investor event, and we are getting great traction within the critical segment of Cloud Datacenter and Enterprise accounts. We are securing new design wins and seeing expanded orders from certain high-profile customers. These customers are choosing Super Micro based on the breadth of our portfolio and our ability to deliver the best optimized system for their 5G, Telco, AI, and both public and private cloud workloads. We have been efficiently growing our high-profile accounts worldwide, and we aim to double these accounts in the coming years. Our high-profile customer initiative is a big portion of our greater organic growth strategy that has evolved and been fine-tuned over time. We also continue our sales transformation effort by broadly launch our B2B/B2C automation with the auto-configurator tool, which is already in use with many selected customers. This tool will make it much easier to share communication, technical data and product configurations among our sales, engineers, and customers, which I believe will accelerate revenue and reduce fulfillment time and cost. Strong positive momentum is building again at Super Micro. I believe our Q3 growth is just the beginning of our journey to gain more market share again. We are returning to our hallmark of consistent growth. To align my interest with the company's growth strategy, the board of directors accepted the proposal of reducing my annual salary to $1 and added an equity compensation package tied to very aggressive revenue and stock price targets. Also in our recent investor update, I talked about our path to $10 billion in annual sales in 3 to 6 years. Now I have even stronger confidence to achieve this goal. Over the past year, Super Micro has had successes in various market segments such as Storage, HCI, Cloud, AI, Machine Learning, 5G/Telco and others. We have established our technology leadership through optimized server and storage solutions. I am excited that our recent booking activities, along with our capacity expansion initiatives and improving COVID outlook give us the confidence to provide a strong Q4 guidance. Our coming fiscal Q4 revenue should surpass $1 billion, in the range of $980 million to $1.08 billion. Super Micro is finally back on track for growth, and I am confident that our growth rate will be getting faster and faster in the coming quarters and years. I will now pass the call to David Weigand, our Chief Financial Officer, to provide additional details on the quarter and our outlook.
David Weigand: Thank you, Charles. Since moving to the CFO role at Super Micro last quarter, I am even more excited about the future of the company than when I joined in 2018. We continued to execute in all major areas of the company this quarter and are pleased with our results and outlook. Our fiscal third quarter revenue totaled $896 million. This reflects a 16% year-on-year increase from the same quarter of last year and an 8% increase from the second quarter of fiscal year 2021. Systems comprised 77% of total revenue and the volume of systems and nodes shipped were up sequentially and year-over-year. System ASPs also increased year-over-year and quarter-on-quarter. Geographic performance was strong across all major geographies. On a year-on-year basis, the U.S. increased 18%, Asia increased 29%, and Europe increased 3%, Rest of World decreased 12%. On a sequential basis, U.S. sales increased 8% quarter-on-quarter, Asia increased 28%, and Europe increased 5%, Rest of World decreased 46%. From a customer point of view, we saw increases in sales to large data center and AI customers. From this point forward, unless otherwise noted, I will be discussing financial metrics on a non-GAAP basis. So working down the P&L, Q3 gross margin was 13.8%, down year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. In our February earnings call, we stated that we expected gross margin to decline approximately 120 to 160 basis points sequentially due to the lack of a Q2 discrete cost recovery of that and product mix. Due to high demand in our -- for our products and in our supply chain, we incurred higher transportation and other additional costs. I will further address this in the outlook, as we do expect some of these cost headwinds to abate in the coming quarter. Turning to operating expenses, Q3 OpEx on a GAAP basis increased 7% quarter-on-quarter and decreased 10% year-on-year to $106 million. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses increased 6% quarter-on-quarter and increased 9% year-on-year to $95 million. Recall, last year operating expenses were offset by $9.5 million related to a joint product development related settlement fee, but after removing this benefit Q3 OpEx would have been down 1% year-on-year. As outlined on the February earnings call, the sequential increase in non-GAAP OpEx was primarily due to higher payroll taxes and increased R&D product development costs due to heightened new product activity from Ice lakes products from Intel, the Milan product from AMD and A100 products from Nvidia. Other income & expense including interest expense was a $1.4 million gain as compared to a $3.1 million loss last quarter. The sequential change is mostly related to FX. This quarter our tax gain was a $0.2 million so on, $0.2 million on a GAAP basis, and an expense of $2.2 million on a non-GAAP basis. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 7.6% for the quarter. Lastly, our joint venture incurred a loss of $0.3 million this quarter as compared to a loss of $1.5 million last quarter. Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share totaled $0.50 as compared to $0.63 in Q2 of fiscal 2021 and $0.84 in the same quarter of last year. Cash flow used in operations totaled $124 million compared to cash flow from operations of $63 million in Q2. CapEx totaled $19 million resulting in free cash flow used of $144 million. Key uses of cash during the quarter included increases to inventory and receivables, as well as capital return to stockholders through $43 million in share repurchases. Our closing balance sheet cash position was $179 million, while bank debt was $85 million, resulting in a net cash balance of $94 million. Turning to working capital metrics compared to last quarter, our Q3 cash conversion cycle was 86 days, that's down from 92 days, and within our target range of 85 to 90 days. While the absolute level of our inventory increased, days of inventory at 99 decreased. Days sales outstanding was 37 days while days payables outstanding totaled 50 days. Now turning to the outlook for our business. We expect net sales for the fiscal fourth quarter ending June 30, 2021 in a range of $980 million to $1.08 billion. We expect gross margins to increase approximately 70 basis points sequentially, due to both product mix and improved management of our supply chain costs. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $108 million and include $7 million in stock option compensation expenses and $2 million in other expenses not included in non-GAAP operating expenses. We expect our Non-GAAP operating expenses to be up modestly quarter-over-quarter driven by lower NRE and continued investment in R&D with the rollout of new product activity from AMD, Intel and Nvidia previously mentioned. We expect our non-GAAP Q4 tax rate to be approximately 13% and approximately 16% thereafter. We expect other income and expense, including interest expense, to total roughly $1.0 million and expect a nominal contribution from our JV. We expect fully diluted GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.56 to $0.77 and fully diluted non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.70 to $0.90. We expect CapEx for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2021 to be in the range of $15 million to $20 million inclusive of our ongoing Taiwan building project. As Nicole, will turn it back over to you for Q&A.
Nicole Noutsios: Operator, we can start with questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Mehdi Hosseini from SIG.
Mehdi Hosseini: A couple of follow-ups. I am just trying to better understand as you look into the second half, especially given your strong revenue guide for the June quarter. How do you see momentum into September and December quarter and how do you see some of the demand drivers like new servers, CPU and other cloud, or data center related drivers impacting your revenues into the second half and I have a follow-up.
Charles Liang: Yes, I mean, as you know, we had spent a local for April to engage high profile accounts in last 3 months and I'd like to share we see it as we achieved an achievement. So now we grow a lot of high profile account and those account, lots of them start August and that's why we see March, we already have a strong quarter and then Q1 until our June quarter we are very strong, would it be the first time over $1 billion. In September, Steel, we see that pipeline is strong as well. Shortage, we will soon reach our, kind of a long-term pattern very closely and the shelter in this situation continue to be very tough, but as of today, our home is, the home is from our vendors have been praising you good. So I feel pretty comfortable, although there are strategy everywhere.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay. And in that context, how do you see increasing in commodity prices for instance, storage and DRAM impacting your margin profile into the second half.
Charles Liang: For most account indeed our customer happy to accept the higher price basically chip what has been healthy margin and viable pay course, we pay most of the customer happy to expect because it's kind of surprise basically. So we were to valuable customers will negotiate, based condition, for our sale for our customer but this year, most of the Spain. And we expect that close.
Mehdi Hosseini: Just a quick follow-up. Have you been able to build a strategic inventory so that you would benefit from lower cost, as you think about the, as you think about the shipment over the next, let's say six months or do you have to continue to buy higher cost inventory and then you would pass on that incremental cost of the customer?
Charles Liang: Well this is difficult question. Indeed we happen maturity, we have since many months ago. So yes, you are right, we had increased our inventory since I would say three months, potentially ago. So we have been lacking in that area, but still our inventory limited. We saw growing very strong demand, very soon. I mean, we had to kind of our pay higher for our newly entered this year.
Operator: Your next question is from Ananda Baruah.
Ananda Baruah: Yes, good afternoon and thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the results and I'm putting them up just after you've done the analyst event. So and that's pretty exciting to see. I guess a couple of follow-one to the direction that Mehdi was kind of asking questions could you give a little, a little more context in the key vertical areas where you're seeing the most pronounced order pick options and I guess kind of, off the top of my head, I'm thinking, hyperscale cloud customers versus large enterprise customers like on premise and also the carriers for 5G and I know there's new activity going on in all of in each of the buckets. But just interested in getting context to where you're seeing the most pronounced pickup, appreciate it. And I have a further follow up or two. Thanks.
Charles Liang: Yes, thank you. Yes, it is. Again, we have been growing well in our 5G and telco. So we saw dip in some volume in March quarter and we have a more and more telco 5G customer continued to engage or start to grow didn't have their demand, not a very good time to us. And that part of our remedy well. Other than that, you know, kind of a mega price and the senior contact very prevalent for other medical improvement. We also again some good traction there and high performance account especially private cloud and some HPC especially, HPC with new isolate in Milan in Nvidia new GPU that consume much more power than before and not by dip coding, had been we come out of as well. So it's cloud service is also for HPC customer with our very optimize dip coding solutions.
Ananda Baruah: And Charles in your prepared remarks, you imagine accelerating revenue growth, I think you said in the coming quarters. As well as kind of in the coming years as I guess coming quarters, I don't want to pin you down too much, but should we expect, can that occur over the next four quarters and how much I guess, do you have, it is a situation where you think like timeline next, let's say, four quarters do you feel like you have the account traction currently to do that or does that involve new account.
Ananda Baruah: Or sort of new penetration conversations inside of existing accounts that have yet to occur.
Charles Liang: Beneath IP, we sort our existing account are growing their demand. And that's why we have extend our capacity, especially in Asia quickly and with higher very high scale so also we are again engaged in a have lots of high-profile counting in your mines and those are going to start order and we will continue engage those high-profile accounts. We have enhanced our sales team including our B2B automation system that we are here, and all cut into sales. So our sales inputs more high-profile account now. So I too believe very strongly that there also have speeding up quarter-after-quarter and year-over-year.
Ananda Baruah: And last one for me, is it July, if I am remembering accurately June, that the new Taiwan center is opening up for production.
Charles Liang: June or July we do not final yet, it can be either way, it kind of depends on situation.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Jonathan Tanwanteng.
Jonathan Tanwanteng: Hi guys. Thank you for taking the questions and very nice quarter and nice to see that demand out there. My first question is what kind of gross margins do you think you can get in the September quarter and I know there's a lot of moving parts but, especially given the inflationary environment, you your new facility coming online which should lower your costs. You have the new sales tools, which improve your efficiency, I think you alluded also that you're burning through your strategic inventory lower costs, so I'm just wondering with all the puts and takes, do you thinking you can improve from the quarter into the September quarter and beyond that.
Charles Liang: Yes. I can say I did feel you and tell you the part of detail, I mean the March quarter, we have a lot of product ship by air because our satisfaction have been parity. So you ship by air and a lot of buyer speak of propulsion from our vendors. So we faced some overhead there for March quarter and looking forward for September situation would have been much improved. David, you can add something?
David Weigand: Yes, so as Jon, as we mentioned the ASPs are up quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. So we were looking forward to improving our margins toward us as we outlined back on March 4th of 14% to 17%. So I think that's our general guidance.
Jonathan Tanwanteng: Okay, great, thank you for that and David, can you actually talk about your expected -- your expectations on cash flow, as we get through the next couple of quarters, I know you used a lot this quarter types of these buybacks as well, but as demand ramps. Do you see yourself using more cash, or do you think you alone, you've collect some of that back. Just your general thoughts.
David Weigand: Sure. That's a good question. We because we returned $43 million back to the shareholders this quarter, in addition to growing accounts receivable and inventory. And so, and also continuing our capital improvements in Taiwan. So as we complete our build-out in Taiwan. The cash demands will abate over there and also we've already grown our inventory now to over $900 million. And so, we expect that the growth rate of inventory is not going to be the same as it was during this quarter. So this quarter was especially demanding because we had such a -- we had such high demand. And so we don't, the rate of acceleration will not be the same.
Jonathan Tanwanteng: Do you think you'll be cash flow positive in the next quarter or after I guess something that there in Taiwan.
David Weigand: Yes, it's going to depend on, it's going to depend on our growth and so that's really what it comes down to is how is -- if we go. If we exceed our growth target.
Charles Liang: We will stop of buying the stock back for this quarter that region is because our business, we have got our base strong and we need more cash flow to prepare inventory,
Jonathan Tanwanteng: Got it. Good problem to have. Last one from me, I think on Intel mentioned a bit more digestion in data center. Are you seeing that at all in your Intel product lineup, and if you are, is it your products the AMD's, AMD videos that are driving the strength that you're seeing going forward?
Charles Liang: You're are right over, we have a customer kind of require for Intel CPU, AMD CPU and NVIDIA GPU. So as it is moment we feel, it's hopefully a strong demand and also see some, the price changes as well this year.
Operator: Your next question is from Nehal Chokshi. Your line is open.
Nehal Chokshi: Congratulations on the strong results here. It's not like the drivers of the 8% be rinelative to midpoint guidance was the new customers equally between cloud apps and the customers and AI. Do these new customers come with the new products or is it using existing products.
Charles Liang: It's a combination. We have a lot of customer need new GPUs solution from Nidia, so now the Nvidia GPU has done is I say, some in the lag. So yes, most of the girls I believe with new our new product but even existing product we see a strong demand the whole limitation is kind of a shortage, so we are working very hard to improve our situation.
Nehal Chokshi: What about demand on the storage heavy side of things. Nextgen storage and JBOF storage.
Charles Liang: I would like to say not to us, not hard as AI and 5G careful but still we see us some demand.
Nehal Chokshi: But then I think there, there's been a lot of discussion during the call about price inputs and that's been an issue for a lot of companies out there. It sounds like you guys have been able to skirt that issue. Just to be clear, is it because of the strategic inventory reserves or is it because there has been a more favorable pricing environment. So you can pass on these input price increases to your customers.
Charles Liang: First, I mean that we have a long-term contract and relationship with our supplier that happen as people with cost or kind of most or at least a stable and yes, most of the plasma also except our case through the cost so in both situation I feel we are in good condition.
Nehal Chokshi: And is that what underpins the confidence and gross margin will tick back up in the June quarter.
Charles Liang: Now, gross margin pretty much because of shipping charge. It's basically some ship of the year. As you know, how the COVID-19, the ship by air cost grew about got triple, and they will not be there but in that few quarter that is the situation and also because of demand strong, so we have the production and we, in some case we had to pay extra to our vendors to our own delivery.
Operator: I'm showing no further question at this time. I would like to turn the conference back to the company for any additional or closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you, everyone for listening us today and have a good one. See you next time. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Charles Liang: Thank you, James, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we have released our fiscal 2021 second quarter financial results. Now let's take a look at some highlights from the quarter. Our fiscal second quarter net sales totaled $830 million, down 5% year-over-year and up 9% sequentially, landing at the midpoint of our guidance range. Our fiscal Q2 non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.63 compared to $0.55 in fiscal Q1 of 2021 and $0.57 in the same quarter of last year. As we expected, Q2 improved after a seasonally weak Q1. We are proud that we achieved these results despite a very challenging environment as the impact of COVID-19 was significantly worse since early November, which impacted our operations, especially in USA headquarter.  Over the same period, however, we had significant international growth to offset the weakness in the United States. Quarterly sales in many Asian and European countries were up double digit, and in some case, a very high double digit, which demonstrates the strength and the improvement of our global sales organization and channel partners around the world. I expect this strong international business growth to continue in March quarter and the future. On the topic of our aggressive growth strategy, our new high-profile customers mentioned on our last earnings call the digested recent purchase in Q2, and we remain excited about our relationship with these customers. Additionally, our sales team are continuing their efforts to expand and nurture new opportunity in these accounts for the next few quarters and years. While these efforts have been on track with our internal goal, we have recently speed up our effort to win new accounts addressing the demands. We plan to further accelerate this growth with new incentive programs and executive action. The purpose of these actions, other than to supercharge our sales force is to restore our original winning culture. We have set aggressive goal for ourselves, and my team is deeply committed to Supermicro's future with more and more passion. To support this international and global growth strategy, we have aggressively expanded our Taiwan campus capacity and capability in production, operations, engineering and sales. The new Building 62 at our Taiwan Science & Technology Park will be online early this summer, which will add another 1 million square feet of manufacturing and office space, efficiently doubling our production capacity within next 6 to 8 months. In the short term, this effort will alleviate some logistics, production and engineering impact caused by COVID-19. In the long term, I believe that our Taiwan campus start to reach higher economic of scale, revenue and profitability growth will become much stronger in the coming quarters and years. To complement our effort in Taiwan, our building transitioning in San Jose is on schedule to become online in the next quarter, which will further boost our strong American manufacturing credentials. I'm confident these actions will help us capitalize on many new key market opportunities in our approximately 100 billion TAM. Let's move on to technology and products, with the unique building block solution product approach. Our R&D organizations are hard at work to expand our optimized Intel, AMD and NVIDIA portfolios. In addition, we had doubled our software and service headcount and resource over the past 2 years. These investments are making a great impact on improving customer experience in both solution quality and security. With the upcoming new Intel Ice Lake processor, we again bring the time-to-market advantage, high-product quality and application optimized solutions to our customers. We are pleased to see a strong trend in terms of customer seeding and early deployment request, and we have started some of our early deployments to our key customers recently. True to our application optimized product strategy, we believe our Ice Lake product line will provide precisely the best hardware platforms to telco, 5G and AI as well as data center applications. As such, we are prepared for our Ice Lake product line to become a key growth driver in the coming quarters. Although COVID-19 continues to disrupt steadily, our strong foundation has safely supported our company and business. As I have mentioned, we have taken decisive actions to expand our operations, engineering and sales -- our sales team in Taiwan to further reduce the COVID-19 impact. These efforts, together with our application optimized Building Block Solution, have resulted in great progress with our focused business vertical. First, our organic business gained more than 10% new major customer server accounts in the last few quarters, benefiting from our strong product line and expanded Taiwan operations. Our B2B automation, auto-configurators as well as software and service enhancements, will continue on this growth momentum. Second, we start to refocus on large data center and OEM since about 3 months ago, right after our 10-K was filed. Two high-profile customers has started to ship in small volume recently, and we'll ramp up to a larger scale later this calendar year. We plan to add 1 or 2 more large DC, large data center, our OEM customers in this category before the end of this calendar year. Third, on 5G, telco and IoT, we have won a handful of new telco customers last year. We are currently starting to ship small volume with upside, and we expect high-volume shipments to these customers will start this calendar year as well. And number four, our B2B and B2C automation with auto congregator has been greatly improved in the past 3 quarters, which is even more critical as COVID-19 forced more remote working environment for lots of customers and our own employees. We have been developing this powerful project for the past 5 years, and it will be ready to go live by this quarter end. This will make it much easier to share communication and product correlation among our sales, engineer and our customers. As discussed in our last earnings call, we believe that Q1 of fiscal 2021 will prove to be a near-term focus in our business. And our Q2 results are the first proof point that Super Micro is indeed back on the growth track. I'm excited that our recent booking activity, along with our new business initiatives, give us the confidence to provide the Q3 guidance that, if achieved, will reflect a resumption of quick growth on a year-on-year basis. Furthermore, we are pleased to announce a newly approved $200 million of share repurchase program, which investors will view as a sign of our commitment to enhance stockholder value and our confidence in our long-term business success. I will share more detail about our strong growth plan, business scale, our unique momentum and when and how will we reach $10 billion revenue in the coming soon investor event. As the only fast-growing server solution, hardware design and manufacturer company in the U.S. in the last 27 years, Supermicro 3.0 is nearly 100% ready. I mean we are ready to grow quickly. But before I pass on, I'd like to take this chance to announce the appointment of David Weigand as our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. David joined the company in May 2018 as Senior Vice President and Chief Compliance Officer. A CPA and native of Silicon Valley, David came to Super Micro from HP Enterprise where he worked as a Vice President. He was previously the CFO of Renesas Electronics America Inc. David succeed Kevin Bauer, who is our current CFO and is leaving the company to pursue his passion at a not-for-profit organization at the end of this month. It has been a privilege working with Kevin, and I appreciate his great leadership, hardworking and dedication to Super Micro over the past 4 years. Kevin is accredited for improvement over our financial system and many system automation. I wish him a great success in his new venture.  I will now pass the call to Kevin one last time to provide additional detail on the quarter and our outlook. Kevin, please?
Kevin Bauer: Thank you, Charles. I'd like to say a few words to our employees and investors. I have enjoyed working with Charles and the very dedicated Super Micro team and helping the company through challenging times over the last 4 years. I am most proud of the work enhancing our company's financial function, providing a stronger foundation for the company to continue to grow as well as our focus on improving operations to generate cash, which enabled a return of capital to shareholders. To all the Super Micro team, we have accomplished so much together, yet there is unfinished work. Carry on. On a personal note, my new role will be in an area where I have strong passion for and also serves a community that I have a long association with. I'm excited to join as the Chief Financial Officer and key business executive to help this organization to reach its objective of delivering increasing value. When announced, this new role will make sense to you all. Before jumping into the results of the quarter, I'd like to briefly touch on several accomplishments we made this quarter on the environmental, social and governance, or ESG front, which we recognize is becoming increasingly important to investors. A few of our recent accomplishments include: one, driven by our efforts to comply with social environmental concerns, Supermicro received a near-perfect audit score from the Responsible Business Alliance at our Taiwan manufacturing site in November 2019 with a score of 196.4 out of 200 points.  In December 2020, we set a commitment letter to the Science Based Targets initiative, and We Mean Business coalition, indicating we will join other companies in striving to keep global warming to the 1.5-degree goal and create company targets. We also joined other leading companies in the Green Grid, where we believe our expertise in hardware design and energy-efficient computing can help drive forward the industry. In January '21, Supermicro transitioned its San Jose Grid Energy sourcing to wind RECs, signifying that, in conjunction with our Bloom Energy fuel cells, all our use of energy at our new and old San Jose campuses will not result in the burning of fossil fuels. We believe these recent accomplishments and milestones continue a long history of our commitment to green computing, sustainability and generally making the world a better place for future generations. Now turning back to 2Q results. Our fiscal second quarter revenue totaled $830 million. This reflects a 5% year-on-year decrease from the same quarter of last year and a 9% increase from the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. Systems comprised 70% -- 77% of total revenue, and volumes of systems and nodes shipped were up sequentially but down year-over-year. System ASPs increased year-over-year but were down modestly quarter-on-quarter. Turning to geographic performance. Our international sales strengthened from 2 quarters of softness. On a year-over-year basis, the U.S. decreased 12%, Europe increased 5%, Asia declined 3%, and the rest of the world increased 68%. On a sequential basis, U.S. sales declined 7% quarter-on-quarter, Europe increased 38%, Asia increased 27% and the rest of the world increased 86%. From a customer point of view, we saw a pickup in sales to OEM customers, but this was offset by the expected digestion after a strong Q1 contribution by new high-profile customers that we mentioned last call. From this point forward, unless otherwise noted, I will be discussing financial metrics on a non-GAAP basis. Working down the P&L. Q2 gross margin was 16.4%, up 50 basis points year-on-year and down 70 basis points quarter-on-quarter. Recall on our November earnings call, we stated that we expected gross margin to decline 160 to 200 basis points on a sequential basis, chiefly due to the absence of a, cost-recovery benefit as well as elevated freight costs. While we did see elevated freight costs, we did, however, benefit from additional cost recovery, similar in magnitude to the benefit we experienced in fiscal Q1 or about 130 basis points. We do not anticipate a similar benefit going forward. Turning to operating expenses. 2Q OpEx on a GAAP basis decreased 1% quarter-on-quarter and 11% year-on-year to $99 million. Q1 GAAP operating expense benefited from a credit of $2.1 million for an executive SEC settlement, and Q2's GAAP operating expenses contain $2.5 million in special performance bonuses. Without these factors, Q2 GAAP operating expenses would have been down more significantly quarter-on-quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses decreased 5% quarter-on-quarter and 12% year-on-year to $90 million. The sequential decrease in non-GAAP OpEx was primarily due to lower audit fees, lower R&D expense due to higher-than-normal NRE for credit -- sorry, credits for NRE work performed and overall expense discipline. Other income and expense was $13.1 million loss as compared to a $1.5 million loss last quarter. The, increased loss was chiefly driven by the remeasurement of our Taiwan dollar loans to a weaker dollar. This quarter, our tax expense was $5.1 million on a GAAP basis and $7.1 million on a non-GAAP basis. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 16.4% for the quarter. Going forward, we continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 16%. Lastly, our joint venture contributed a loss of [$1.0 million] this quarter related to an air pocket in revenue, as compared to income of $1.3 million last quarter and a loss of $1 million the same quarter a year ago. Q2 non-GAAP diluted EPS totaled $0.63 as compared to $0.55 in Q1 of fiscal '21 and $0.57 in the same quarter of last year. Cash flow from operations totaled $63 million compared to cash flow of operations of $121 million in Q1. CapEx totaled $14 million, resulting in free cash flow of $49 million. Our closing balance sheet position for cash was $315 million, while bank debt was $45 million, resulting in a net cash balance of $270 million. Please also note that we completed our previously announced $50 million share repurchase program on January 6, wherein we repurchased 1.68 million shares at a weighted average price of $29.82. As Charles mentioned in our earnings release today, we concurrently announced that we have Board-level authorization for the company to repurchase up to another $200 million of our common stock in a new share repurchase program. The program is effective until July 31, 2022. As Charles mentioned, we believe this action reflects our commitment to enhancing stockholder value and our positive long-term view of our business opportunity and cash generation prospects. We expect to execute the program in coordination with our cyclical working capital needs and growth. Turning to working capital metrics. Our Q2 cash conversion cycle was 92 days, down from 107 days last quarter, but still outside our target of 85 to 90 days. While the absolute level of our inventory declined, days of inventory at 105 days remains elevated relative to our historical levels as we prepared for the impact of the Lunar New Year logistic challenges and some tightening of components. Days sales outstanding was 36 days, while days payable outstanding totaled 49 days. Now turning to the outlook for our business. We expect net sales for the quarter ending March 31, 2021, in the range of $790 million to $870 million. We expect gross margins to decline approximately 120 to 160 basis points sequentially due to the lack of a cost recovery discrete event that we explained earlier over the last 2 quarters and also the product mix that we expect to ship in the quarter. We expect our non-GAAP operating expense level to increase quarter-on-quarter to the mid-90s driven by payroll taxes in the new year and selective investing in R&D. We continue to anticipate our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 16% going forward. And we expect other income and expense, including interest expense, to total roughly $1 million and expect a contribution from our JV of roughly $0.5 million. We fully expect fully diluted GAAP -- I'm sorry, we expect fully diluted GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.22 to $0.42 and fully diluted non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.37 to $0.57. And we continue to expect our CapEx for fiscal 2021 to be in the range of $55 million to $60 million, inclusive of our ongoing Taiwan building project mentioned earlier by Charles. James, we're now ready for Q&A.
James Kisner: Thank you, Kevin. One quick announcement before entering Q&A, we will be attending the Goldman Technology Conference on February 11 and conducting meetings with investors. Operator, we're now ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We have your first question from Ananda Baruah from Loop Capital.
Ananda Baruah: Congrats on solid results. And Kevin, congrats as well. It's been good working with you. Well, good luck and we'll miss working with you. Yes, I guess a couple if I could. I guess the first one is just broadly speaking, how should we -- how would you like us to think about the various catalysts as we move through the year and the things that we should keep an eye out for and what you're expecting to impact the business? You spoke to a number of them on -- in the prepared remarks, I would just love to sort of get to more context on how we should think about them layering in. Then I have a follow-up or 2.
Charles Liang: Yes. I believe our business have been very solid now, except COVID-19, so in USA is still very severe. So we are very carefully taking care of that, while kind of aggressively grow our operation business in Taiwan. So COVID is getting better as now we expect. Our business should be getting to a much smooth -- much strong growth period. So we have a good feeling about the coming quarters or years.
Ananda Baruah: And Charles, when you think about sort of some of the newer aspects to your business, and you mentioned Ice Lake as well in coming quarters, hyperscale, Ice Lake. You mentioned sort of the 5G systems going in to the telcos, which of those -- could you sort of rank for us, even if anecdotal, which ones of those do you think would be the most impactful when you look back on 2021, hyperscale, Ice Lake, the 5G telco business?
Charles Liang: Yes, like I just shared with everyone, we start to focus on large data center and OEMs since about 3 months ago. And we already achieved a couple of them. And they start to move. And we believe that volume we will ramp up very soon in this year and next year, I believe. As to 5G telco, again, we already engaged a handful customers, kind of the world-class telco company. So relationship has been created very solidly, and they start to move, some in small volume, and we also expect some high volume will follow very soon, and it will be long-term partnership. So overall, we are very optimistic for our long-term growth.
Ananda Baruah: Okay. Great. I'm going to sneak one last one in here. Charles, I believe it was you in the prepared remarks, you mentioned the analyst event. Do you have a time frame you're thinking about for that?
Charles Liang: Yes. You mean the investor event?
Ananda Baruah: Investor event, yes.
Charles Liang: Yes. I hope within the next few weeks because we still have the last quarter. But because of COVID-19 as really coming very bad, so we kind of take a wait-and-see. But now look like it seems getting under control. So I hope in the next few weeks, we will have a big investor event, so to share the company plan, future, the momentum with our investment.
Ananda Baruah: That's excellent. So just -- just so I'm -- just to clarify for myself. In the next few weeks, do you think you'll be announcing the date of the event? Or do you think you may actually be having it in the next few weeks or so?
Charles Liang: I guess we will announce it in the next 2 weeks, for example, and hopefully have that event in 3 to 4 weeks.
Operator: We have your next question from Jon Tanwanteng from CJS Securities.
Jon Tanwanteng: A very nice quarter. And Kevin, congratulations on moving on to the next phase. My first question is on just hearing Intel when they spoke about the quarter, they thought they were seeing another quarter or 2 of digestion in the cloud and data center space. It seems like you're not seeing that. I was wondering what kind of customer are you seeing strength from that's maybe running counter to what they're saying? Is it maybe just from AMD? Or is it another end market? Just give me a sense of why your strength is running opposite to what they're seeing?
Charles Liang: Yes. As you know, we have a very strong Intel product line. At the same time, we also have a pretty big AMD product line. So once the market have demand, we will grow. And even if the market keep flat, because of our outstanding product, our kind of data solution overall, so we believe once the market is not too bad, we will have a chance to grow smoothly kind of -- and if the market is growing, I guess our growth will be very significant. And as you know, since the company was funded since 1993 to 2017, our growth has been always much faster than the industry average, and I believe we are getting back to that position very soon.
Jon Tanwanteng: Okay. And then just on the impact that COVID has had on the business, can you call out just the impact on either the margin or the revenue that you had in December and into January so far? You mentioned higher freight expenses, but lockdowns probably had an impact as well. I don't know if you're seeing anything else such as employee absenteeism. But if you could kind of quantify or give some color on the impact of the pandemic so far, that would be helpful.
Charles Liang: Yes, it's kind of -- impact is very bad and very broadly, unfortunately, in that -- more than 9 months now. So our logistical, for example, it's become very harder to ship products. Even from Asia to U.S.A., we see the shipping delay cost increase [indiscernible] or even more, sort of logistic time-to-market delay and logistics cost increase. And then lots of customer work from home and some of our employee work from home. So all of those created a difficulty for business, especially for application optimized solution. And the good thing is that our auto congregator, which is a program to help sales, help our engineers, help our customer to work together to make the best optimized solution for them. The tool is getting ready. I believe by end of this quarter, most of our sales engineer and customer will be able to use those tools. So I'm very excited for the tool to be available in this quarter.
Jon Tanwanteng: Okay. Great. If you don't mind me asking one more...
Kevin Bauer: Yes, John, this is Kevin. I would just echo what Charles has said is that when you have work from home, it definitely reduces the coordination of the organization. So we have to push harder in that arena. And then some other examples like just having to confirm that there's someone else on the other side to receive the shipment, not all companies are open every day. So there's definitely a lot of little different things like that, that make conducting business more difficult, like Charles had said.
Jon Tanwanteng: Understood. And if I may ask, looking beyond the pandemic, and Charles, I know your new facility is opening up in the second half of this year or earlier this summer, what can margins look like on a normalized basis? So without all of these headwinds, when you have new facilities and when you have some more volume than the customer shipping, maybe share some of the plans you have and go where margins could go.
Charles Liang: Yes. As you know, we have two kind of customers. One is a high-end enterprise. We like our better product, better performance, better service. And then we also have another customer who buy high volume and they want lower cost. So before most of our operations are tied in U.S.A and with COVID-19, the impact was really big. But now we have a tower in operation getting ready, especially by early summer, we will have a much bigger capacity. So we can start to service those customers who buy high volume and cost sensitive. So we are very excited. We start to line up with those customers since about 12 months ago. Now we have some customer relationship that are already established and we already promised them that we are ready to support them. So in terms of how much impact, I would like to say maybe 2% or a little bit more than that. And 2% for enterprise, something that small. But for high-volume customer, that 2% or 3%, indeed, is a big difference for them. So we are very happy we have those opportunity now ready from Taiwan.
Operator: We have your next question from Nehal Chokshi from Northland Securities.
Nehal Chokshi: Congratulations on the strong gross margin and a very strong revenue guidance. That's a really nice outlook there. On the net income, the midpoint of the net income that implies about a $9 million [QB] decline. How should we parse that between gross margin and OpEx for the March quarter?
Kevin Bauer: Well, I think we shared that we thought that the gross margin would be declining quarter-over-quarter because of some cost increases as well as the specific mix of products that we're going to ship. So, I would say that you would weigh it probably towards what the expectations are for gross margin in the immediate quarter going forward. That would be the heavier weight, we'll put it that way.
Nehal Chokshi: That's very helpful. And then Charles, could you clarify what you mean by large OEM opportunity?
Charles Liang: Okay. I mean especially of the pandemic, COVID-19 problems happened, all our Internet, all our social networking company have a strong demand. And those high-volume customers, indeed, they move in high volume, but they want low price, right? So, before we kind of -- did not really focus on those segment of customer. But because our Taiwan operation facility is getting ready, so we start to work with those customers, engaged with them. And we got some very good feedback. So, we are really engaged with some of them. And like what I just mentioned, we ship a small volume now and the high volume should follow later this year.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. So just to be clear, is there a partnership with the HP and Dells to get to the social networks? Or are you just referring to these large Internet properties as the OEMs?
Charles Liang: The good thing about Super Micro is in the last 27 years, we already established our brand name and our credibility for quality, for service. And now, especially our management software, our service is global wide, have been well recognized by enterprise accounts. So, we are ready to work with any kind of customer, directly with any customer or we'll go through some OEM. So we open that opportunity.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. And coming back to Kevin. So, over the past few quarters, you guys have returned 50% of free cash flow to shareholders by share repurchases, which is very good. So, I know that you guys said that you wanted investors that you're evolving your capital allocation policy. But is that 50% rate at least a good way to think about how that -- you guys are thinking going forward? And then what about that remaining 50%? Is that basically near the future growth?
Kevin Bauer: Yes. So, I think what I tried to share was that in the new $200 million program, it's got roughly an 18-month or so duration given the date that it's valid through. I think investors that I've worked with know that we take an incremental approach, and we took first two steps in stock buyback program. We got feedback that if we feel confident, we should back that up by maybe a more longer-term program, and that is exactly what we have done. So therefore, it's a step-by-step process. I think the competing forces for the capital allocation is going to be the rate of our growth. That's the key thing. And we hope to be able to continue to grow strongly and have the adequate cash flow to consume or to fully execute that $200 million program over the 18-month time frame. So, it's definitely that as well as the investments we need to continue to make in R&D for continued product development.  Given that, as it relates to Taiwan, we're kind of in the late mid-innings on the investment there. Certainly, the building is close to being completed there. I think it's going to be June or something like that, Charles?
Charles Liang: Yes, June.
Kevin Bauer: And so therefore, that consumption of cash will abate for a while because our maintenance capital is like $5 million to $7 million a quarter. And so that will help free up some cash in the second half of calendar 2021. And that's kind of the moving pieces that we're thinking about. And with the continued cash generation of the company, we felt confident to get to $200 million program.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. Fantastic. And my final question, before I get back in the queue is that you mentioned that NRE work was part of that R&D Q-on-Q decline. So, what's the decision for when Supermicro sets this type of work? Can you talk about that real quickly?
Kevin Bauer: Yes. So, we worked very closely with some of our chief component suppliers to work on platforms that work with their key components. And so, we really look to work with those key vendors to enable platforms that we believe are ones that are going to get traction in the marketplace. So, we look at what's the likely popularity of those platforms and then enter into those arrangements. They tend to be rather short term in nature. So I want to share with you that it's not like a multiyear development, but rather maybe a half year development. So, it's a little bit easier to make those commitments because -- but not only they're not so large, but also the prospects for the product are pretty close in the future.
Charles Liang: Yes. I'll try to -- also the pace, basically. We have some very close partner. They really want us to present something unique, something that outperform for the market. And also some customers, they want to really outstanding, unique platform design. So we work with both vendors and customers, so for those special design and usually they pay some NRE.
Nehal Chokshi: What's the type of return in terms of revenue or gross profit dollars you can typically see when you pick this type of NRE product that expect to become a platform that drives future sales?
Charles Liang: For sure, our goal is not for NRE data. Our really goal is for a partnership. When you work with a vendor to design, really optimize the solution, then we together approach the market. Same thing for customers. Some customers with their special application or data center equipment or architecture, we have planned, designed something exactly optimized for their environment. And because of Building Block Solution nature, makes Supermicro are much easier and much more efficient to design those unique solution model.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We have your next question from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. Congrats, I guess on this awesome -- and Kevin, also great working with you in the past. I guess I wanted to ask a question about kind of where we stand on the server cycle and the impact that we can think about this having for Supermicro. So you talked a little bit about Ice Lake. You've got AMD Milan. How do you guys see the demand profile for these next-generation server CPUs materializing? And would you expect to see an ASP uplift benefit Supermicro as these next-gen CPUs come into the model?
Charles Liang: Yes. As you know, a new generation process or platform always outperform the previous generation, right? For the same price, usually, they are kind of 10% or up to 40% faster performance, right? So for sure, a lot of our large customers, they want a new generation product. And Supermicro is good for that kind of it's our building cloud solution. Traditionally, we always introduce new technology to market a few months or a few quarter earlier than others. So this time, we have that advantage again. And other than the market grows, indeed because we have better solution, or better service, better quality, so indeed, we are gaining much share from others as well.
Aaron Rakers: Okay. And I guess maybe dovetailing off some of the earlier questions around industry kind of supply chain alignment and juggling through kind of the COVID challenges that you've had. How would you characterize the component supply chain or component availability that you see in the market today? There's been some indications that certain areas have been tight or even constrained. What's your current outlook? Have you seen any constraints? And what are you expecting if you're willing to look out over the next couple of quarters?
Charles Liang: Yes. We saw a lot of constraints across almost all different kind of components. So we have been very carefully engaged with our partner and have a forecast, have a kind of a contract. So logistic costs also increased, lead time also increased. But with our contract and relationship, at this moment, I feel there are a lot of challenges, but we should be safe for our smooth growth.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. Yes. And then the final question I just wanted to ask was that I know a couple of years ago, you did have a customer that had accounted for 10% of revenue. Do you think that with these new larger data center win opportunities that sound like they're going to ramp over the next couple of quarters, do you think you'll have a situation where you have a 10% customer in the future or not?
Charles Liang: Hard to say, hard to say. But we try to have many more customer because our customer base was still small compared with our long-term goal. So with now a much bigger capacity, so we are able to engage with many more partners. So I believe that question yes or no, it will happen. It's happy to have -- it will not happen, it's also happy to be more diversified. So I'm pretty neutral attitude for that and look at where it seems will be under managed.
Operator: We have your next question from Nehal Chokshi from Northland Securities.
Nehal Chokshi: Yes. So I am actually particularly impressed with the guidance given that at the September quarter call, you guys had indicated an expectation that I think Ice Lake would become generally available for several OEM launch by early 2021. That hasn't happened yet. And that looks like it's going to be more of a 2Q '21 type of event now at this point in time. So given that context, does that mean that the rest of your business has significantly strengthened relative to what you thought would be the case back at the 3Q '20 call?
Charles Liang: Yes. As -- I guess, Supermicro a have much more diversified product line now and also customer base in terms of vertical, in terms of many more customers. So we are a much more diversified customer -- a diversified company now. And with our extension to Taiwan and also our capacity growth in U.S.A., we are ready to be a much bigger size content.
Nehal Chokshi: Great. And speaking to that much greater diversity and exposures, can you give us a sense as to what is your exposure to some of these faster-growing parts of the market that you're addressing?
Charles Liang: Yes. For example, telco 5G, we did not focus on that market before. But since about 2 years ago, we start to focus on this market, and we're already engaged with some very good partner globally. And for example, a large data center and OEM, we did not really focus on that segment in the last 10 years. But about 12 months ago or 18 months ago, we started to engage with some, and we have a good achievement. Also for IoT, we continue to extend our IoT product line. So Supermicro indeed likes to be a much more diversified, much service customer as a one-stop shopping company partner.
Nehal Chokshi: So would it be fair to say that these 3 areas that you just highlighted represent maybe 30% of revenue now?
Charles Liang: We did not see that specifically. But that's why, we just mentioned, Supermicro is great to grow company to be a $10 billion revenue company in the near future. And in our investor event, we will share more detail about that.
Operator: I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Mr. Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Sir, please continue.
Charles Liang: Yes. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today, and looking forward to meeting you next quarter. Have a nice day. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Charles?
Charles Liang: Thank you, James, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we have released our fiscal 2021 first quarter financial results. Now, let’s take a look at some highlights from the quarter. Our fiscal first quarter net sales totaled $762 million, down 5% year-over-year and 15% sequentially. Our fiscal Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.55 compared to $0.68 in both the same quarter of last year and in fiscal Q4 of 2020. As we expected, Q1 has been our seasonally low quarter after a traditionally strong quarter in June. This year, despite the continued challenges from COVID-19, we were pleased to deliver revenue and earnings above the midpoints of our guidance ranges. We have been efficiently adjusting to the new normal as a business deemed essential by the state of California, although there are still lots of areas can be and will be further improved regarding COVID impact. At the same time, we have been aggressively growing our operations, R&D and sales functions in Taiwan where the COVID-19 impact is much less than that in our U.S. and EMEA headquarters. During the September quarter, we continued to serve our current customers while enhancing our Taiwan headquarters capacity and capability in production, operation and sales force in order to support our global growth strategy. To sum up, we now have a much bigger and lower cost campus in Taiwan with better productivity for revenue and profitability growth. This is just the beginning of our turnaround effort after recent challenges that I will discuss later. I believe, as our Taiwan campus starts to reach higher economy of scale combined with our cost reduction efforts, revenue and profitability growth will be getting much stronger in the coming quarters and years. I have confidence in capitalization on many new key market opportunities in our approximately $100 billion TAM, especially in APAC, EMEA and the U.S. East Coast. We have been pretty successful at achieving a great market share in the U.S. West Coast, and we aim to duplicate this success in other geographic territories. Let me spend a minute to review our traditional business and the three new growth drivers that I stated in the past two quarter end conference calls. First, our organic enterprise and channel business; second, our new large datacenter, public cloud and OEM business; third, our new 5G, Edge and Telco businesses; and fourth, our software and global services business. We have made good progress in each of the four growth drivers. We have added more new enterprise customers to our accounts and gained a couple of top scale cloud companies. We also have won a couple of top telco partners in each of the EMEA, Asia and USA territories. Moreover, we see our software and service business continues to gain more adoptions worldwide. With the business foundation we have built and the customer pipelines we have nurtured, continued progress is expected in each of these growth areas going forward. Especially in the new large cloud and OEM and the 5G and telco markets, I believe the growth will be a big extra revenue to us. Before moving onto technology and products, I want to take a moment to recall and share the causes of our business slowdown and disruptions over the past three years. First, our 10-K delay in June 2017 followed by our delisting was a significant distraction to management and employees for over three years. Although all the concerns and issues were resolved a few months ago, this disruption had a lasting effect on our business and employee morale. However, we are recovering quickly now. Unfortunately, just as we emerged from our stock delisting and resumed growth in December 2019, COVID-19 came to U.S. and has slowed down enterprise and channel spending badly and that were our traditional focus. Our sales, operations and production performance has been impacted since the end of this March. Regardless of these challenges and disruptions, I want to share with you that Supermicro is still strong. Our strong foundation allows us to find ways to overcome these challenges. We stand alone as the only U.S. server hardware solutions company with the longest record of faster and uninterrupted growth since inception. In the 10 years between our IPO in calendar 2007 and 2017, we grew at a 20% compounded annual growth rate, well above that of the industry at about 3% compounded annual growth rate over the same time period. Our investors should keep these facts in mind. We will prove that we are able to recreate the same growth trajectory or even better very soon. Moving on to technology and products. Our unique Building Block Solution R&D organization is strong and smart at work to expand our product lines with extensive growth in our NVIDIA, AMD and Intel portfolios. Our broadest leading AI platforms and the coming soon new Intel Ice Lake product lines will prove that Supermicro again will be the true hardware industry leader. Some technology highlights in the quarter include the following. We introduced end-to-end PCI-E Gen4 based 1U, 2U and 4U AI systems that deliver 6x AI training and 7x inference performance improvement over previous generation. These AI systems are available with either the latest AMD EPYC processors or the upcoming Intel Ice Lake processors. Second, most importantly we believe our upcoming X12 Ice Lake product line is absolutely going to be the strongest product line in our history. It will be ready to ship as soon as Intel’s new CPU is available. True to our application-optimization product strategy, our X12 product line will provide exactly the best hardware platforms for 5G, AI and telco as well as mega data center applications. Third, we were also the first-to-market with a 1U NEBS Level 3 certified NVIDIA V100 GPU accelerated server, a key enabler for the transition to 5G. And we also delivered the world’s most green efficient Supercomputer presently. By collaborating with Preferred Networks, our system achieved number one in the Green500 with a record-breaking 21.11 gigaflops per watt, 15% higher than the previous worldwide record. Given our leadership in Green IT, this is reflective of the deeper mission of our Company to help preserve our only planet for future generations with products that offer unbeaten energy efficiency. Other than the four business growth drivers, our big production and operation capacity program in Taiwan, and our new strong product pipelines, the Company is also investing in business automation branch, which is our B2B and B2C online business transaction system. We started designing this system five years ago and have recently put extra efforts to finish the phase one milestone. Now, we are able to help our sales and customers to easily select the product configurations and order quickly online. This phase 1 will be open to our sales this November. After that, we aim to open it up to some of our customers in a few weeks. While we continue to fine tune phase 1 features and configuration optimization, phase 2 has already been kicked off with a command center-based structure to further speed up and optimize sales performance and customer satisfaction. This innovative sales and service software program will dramatically improve our business efficiency, scale and quality. In summary, we are back, and we will be soon much stronger than ever before. We believe that the big challenges in the past three years that badly hurt Supermicro are totally behind us now. As we continue to build a much stronger foundation globally, including the much larger new campus in Taiwan, we will leverage these investments to efficiently re-accelerate our business growth and profitability in the coming quarters and years. I appreciate the patience that investors and our employee have shown to our Company during the difficult times, and we aim to reward your support with our fast growth in the near future and long term success. And I believe that we will become one of the top IT infrastructure providers very soon. At the upcoming investor events and analyst day, we will share more details about the scale, scope and schedule of the new Supermicro progress that we have been developing to grow into a top player. The key topics will include: A, our four business drivers; B, our unique technologies and new product lines for AI, 5G telco, and Large Cloud and our organic business; C, our new campus in Taiwan to lower business cost; D, our software and service business status; and E, our B2B and B2C business automation program. Welcome to join us at that time. I will now pass the call to Kevin Bauer, our Chief Financial Officer, to provide additional details on the quarter.
Kevin Bauer: Thank you, Charles. Our fiscal first quarter revenue totaled $762 million. This reflects a 5% year-on-year decrease from the same quarter of last year and a 15% decline from the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. Systems comprised 81% of total revenue and volumes of systems and nodes shipped were down sequentially and year-over-year. System ASPs increased quarter-on-quarter and year-over-year. Turning to geographic performance, on a year-over-year basis, the U.S. increased 6%, EMEA declined 12%, and Asia declined 22%. On a sequential basis, U.S. sales declined 8% quarter-on-quarter, EMEA declined 32%, and Asia declined 22% sequentially. From a customer point of view, we saw pauses at OEM, cloud service provider and internet commerce customers following strong demand in the June quarter coupled with the normal down cycle of demand from large enterprise customers. This was offset by first time business at the new high profile customers that Charles mentioned earlier. From this point forward, unless otherwise noted, I will be discussing financial metrics on a non-GAAP basis. Working down the P&L, Q1 gross margin was 17.1%, up 70 basis points year-on-year and 310 basis points quarter-on-quarter. Recall, on our August earnings call, we stated that we expected gross margin to improve by 75 to 125 basis points on a sequential basis, chiefly due to a reduction in what were highly elevated commodity and freight costs. As anticipated, we did see improvement from these factors, but also we accrued for a recovery of costs paid in prior periods that benefited this quarter by roughly 130 basis points. Turning to operating expenses, Q1 OpEx on a GAAP basis decreased 13% quarter-on-quarter to $99 million. Recall, last quarter’s GAAP operating expenses included $16.2 million in one-time incentive awards to our employees. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses increased 4% quarter-on-quarter and 10% year-on-year to $95 million. The sequential increase in non-GAAP OpEx was primarily due to the fact that Q4 operating expenses benefitted from a bad debt recovery of $4.8 million. Other income and expense including interest expense was a $1.5 million loss as compared to a $1.3 loss last quarter. This quarter our tax expense was $3.7 million on a GAAP basis and $4.8 million on a non-GAAP basis. In both cases, this quarter benefited from larger tax deductions related to stock-based compensation. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 14.1% for the quarter. Going forward, we expect our tax rate to approximate 16%, slightly below our prior expectation of an 18% rate. Lastly, our joint venture contributed income of $1.3 million this quarter as compared to income of $3.5 million last quarter and income of $1 million the same quarter a year ago. Q1 non-GAAP diluted EPS totaled $0.55 as compared to $0.68 in both the same quarter of last year and in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Cash flow from operations totaled $121 million, driven from an improvement from cash flow from operations of negative $96 million in the June quarter, driven largely by changes in working capital. CapEx totaled $12 million, resulting in free cash flow of $109 million. Our closing balance sheet cash position, which excludes restricted cash, was $300 million, while bank debt was $36 million, resulting in a net cash balance of $264 million. And I’ll reminded everyone that we completed our previously announced $30 million share repurchase program before quarter-end wherein we purchased 1.14 million shares at a weighted average price of $26.24. In our earnings release today, we concurrently announced with that our Board of Directors has authorized the Company to repurchase up to another $50 million of its common stock in a new share repurchase program. The program is effective until October 31, 2021 or until the authorized funds are exhausted under a 10b5-1 plan, whichever occurs first. We are currently taking a tactical and opportunistic approach to share repurchase as we fine tune our longer-term capital allocation strategy. Turning to working capital metrics, our Q1 cash conversion cycle was 170 days, (sic) [107 days] up from 87 days last quarter, outside of our target range of 85 to 90 days. While the absolute level of our inventory declined, days of inventory at 118 days remains elevated relative to history given the lower sales level quarter-on-quarter. And days sales outstanding was 44 days while days payables outstanding totaled 55 days. Now, turning to the outlook for our business. The Company expects net sales for the quarter ending December 31, 2020 in a range of $780 million to $880 million. We expect gross margins to decline approximately 160 to 200 basis points sequentially due to the cost recovery discrete event mentioned earlier and higher overhead costs driven by an expected increase in freight. We expect Non-GAAP operating expense level to be flattish quarter-on-quarter. While we’re selectively investing in R&D, this is offset by lower audit costs and actions we took very late in the quarter to selectively reduce headcount. We anticipate the GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be 16% going forward. We fully expect diluted GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.25 to $0.47 to fully diluted non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.35 to $0.58. We now expect our CapEx for fiscal 2021 to be in the range of $55 million to $60 million inclusive of the acceleration of the Taiwan building project mentioned earlier by Charles. In the mean-time, we remain focused on guiding our Company through the volatility presented by the resurgence COVID-19 and ardently rebuild our business momentum as described by Charles. With that, I'll turn the call back to James for Q&A.
James Kisner: Thank you, Kevin. Operator, we are ready to take questions.
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jon Tanwanteng with CJS Securities. Your line is open.
Jon Tanwanteng: Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. And thank you for taking my questions. My first one is, I think, you guys mentioned internet and cloud as a source of strength in your Q1 results. Can you talk a little bit more about that end market, the margin profile and the revenue impact of these customers and how they factor into your guidance for the next quarter?
Kevin Bauer: We're having some trouble hearing the question. I don't know if it's -- whose line it is. We can barely hear Jon. Jon, can you speak up a little bit please and repeat the question?
Jon Tanwanteng: I was saying you mentioned cloud and internet as a source of strength in the quarter. I was just wondering if you could talk about the margin profile of those customers and how they factor into your guidance going forward.
Kevin Bauer: Sure. So, this was kind of our first take of some of these customers. I would say that, fortunately, as opposed to what some might think, our margin profile was not appreciably different from the margin profile of our other customers. So, we expect and hope that that will hold true on a go forward basis as well.
Jon Tanwanteng: Got it. Thank you. And then, can you talk about maybe the -- how you see market demand developing over the next two quarters, with the relative puts and takes, whether it be COVID, election concerns and new form launches and new product launches that you're doing internally?
Charles Liang: Yes. It's hard to predict. But, as you may know, right, enterprise and channel business may continue to decline gently. And at the same time, the cloud, social networking, communication, video streaming demand still keep strong. And that's why we have created some good customers in large cloud and video streaming territory. So, we started getting some demand from that territory. And that's why our Taiwan operation -- manufacturer in Taiwan, especially for lower cost we have as well.
Jon Tanwanteng: Great. That's a good lead off into my next question. I was going to ask about the Taiwan acceleration and how it better positions you, both strategically and maybe if you go into it. How much can you quantify the expected benefit from moving there, over maybe the near term?
Charles Liang: Yes. Let me start and Kevin may follow. So, I mean, it's investment for, I would say short-term, mid-term and long-term. So, now this means that in Taiwan cost is much lower than in our USA operation, basically it's about 35% to 50%. So, for mature product, basically we see greatly leverage, the possibility that capacity in Taiwan. And with COVID-19 hit in US is much worse than in Taiwan, in Taiwan we see there almost no impact. And that's why we quickly leveraged our Taiwan operation advantage. And I believe it’s good for our short-term, and gradually, advantage will become much clearer, and much more significant in middle term and long term.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Nehal Choski with Northland Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Nehal Choski: Yes. Thanks. And congratulations on great results all around, especially a strong free cash flow and executing on a share buyback. You guys mentioned that you noticed areas of recent improvement that gives you confidence that year-over-year growth is bottoming here. Can you discuss exactly which areas are you seeing that recent improvement in? And from what point in time are you referencing as well where that demand profile has improved?
Kevin Bauer: So, I think, we just navigated a period that was challenging. We kind of gave some guidance in terms of how we think that it is gently going to improve in the December quarter here, based upon visibility that we have. I think, also, when we talked about some of those new customers, some of the lead times for their materials are longer in length, such that we get a little bit better visibility as to their plans for the March quarter. And so, therefore, I think, it's some of those feeds of information that make us believe that as we continue to accelerate quarter-by-quarter that there is some tangible evidence of people's plans, not perfect visibility but there's some that's out there to be able to latch on to. I don't know if you have anything else in addition to that, Charles.
Charles Liang: Yes. Nehal, I just mentioned, I mean, in last quarter, I mean, especially after the impact of COVID-19, we started to focus on larger accounts, high profile, high-volume accounts for large cloud, a large data center and video streaming customer for example, 5G, telco. And we started to gain some very good partnership. And we started to ship some. And however, very high volume, it takes some time to ramp up. So, like Kevin say, I mean December quarter, we will see some help. March quarter and next year, June quarter, I believe we'll see much bigger help.
Kevin Bauer: Yes. I thought of one thing that investment community understand that a little bit better is that some of these new customers are actually ordering rack scale products from us that with that longer lead time give us some visibility.
Nehal Choski: I see. Okay. And second question I have is that the nice slide here on your key vertical markets and growth drivers. I think, this is a bit of an evolution of the Supermicro 3.0 vision that you guys had previously talked about. And within that Supermicro 3.0 vision, implied in that was a potential for margin expansion. And this new way of presenting it, does that opportunity still present itself? And can you talk a little bit about how that might actually look in terms of a long-term margin profile?
Charles Liang: Yes. Very good question. I mean, that we mentioned of our Supermicro 3.0 about three years ago, unfortunately, a 10-K delay that delayed the outcome of our project. The good thing is now it’s all over. So, we started to execute our Supermicro 3.0 now stronger. For example, 5G, edge and telco business, software and global service. So that has been helping our business and we will become a much significant help quarter-over-quarter. As to data center and cloud, even private cloud business has been growing, and we will continue to invest in that area. So, it should be a very significant driver for us in short-term, mid-term and even long-term, especially long-term I would say.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.
Aaron Rakers: I just wanted to ask a question about server cycle. You referenced in your prepared remarks, Intel's Ice Lake, you also have AMD Milan processors. It sounds like you guys continue to see overall ASP increases in your system, system sales. How are you thinking about like Intel with eight channels of memory from six? How do you think about the ASP trend relative to unit growth as you think about the setup in the calendar '21?
Charles Liang: Yes. More and more customers now really appreciate our total solutions, not just telecom but the CPU, memory, hard drive, and total solution including management software, including some even application software. So including a spatial memory, where we mention a kind of SSD NVMe, and -- total solution has been our long-term goal, and complete right solution. And very soon we will share with you even more about our private cloud total solution. But, it's a little bit too early to say too much. But yes, we are moving forward to a total solution.
Aaron Rakers: Okay. And then, maybe sticking on a similar topic. Gross margin was very strong this quarter, up quite a bit on a sequential basis. I'm just curious of what you're seeing on the component pricing environment. What are you embedding in your current quarter expectations, as far as DRAM and flash pricing trends, and any thoughts on how that sets up into next year? Thank you.
Charles Liang: Yes. I mean economical scale will help us. So, we are growing global now. And with new business drive, that will grow our revenue, our economic scale. And that will help our gross margin and then the margin ratio. At the same time, the service business, the software value is getting help to our profit as well.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Nick Heisler with SIG.
Mehdi Hosseini: Thank you. It's actually Mehdi Hosseini. I have a couple of follow-ups. Kevin, can you help us understand how OpEx is going to play out for the rest of the fiscal year '21?
Kevin Bauer: So, I think, we said that we took some actions in this quarter. We trimmed some headcount. We actually did a similar kind of trim at the end of September that kind of bore fruit here in the December quarter. I think, as we look forward in terms of the pace of our hiring, as Charles has mentioned earlier, if we're going to appreciably hire anyone that's going to be Taiwan-based over the course of time, I think, our views of OpEX now on a non-GAAP basis is that -- I think we said quarter-over-quarter, somewhat flat, may drift a little bit in the March or June quarter, if COVID lifts and we feel that it's appropriate to give merit increases. But I think we're trying to hover in the mid-90s for a period of time here. And I think that's what you were looking for.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. Got it. And then, two more questions. One for Charles, given your expansion in Taiwan, and how CapEx has effectively increased by 2 to 3 times over a two year period. In the meantime, you have been able to diversify and target a wider range of end market. How should we think or envision opportunities? In the past, you used to give us a $3 billion revenue target, you're already there. I'm not asking you, if you're going to double your revenue, given the increase in capacity. But, in the longer term, it seems to me that you can hit revenue CAGR that could be more of a double-digit growth, given the 2 to 3-time increase in CapEx over the next -- over the last two years. Is that the right way to think about opportunities in the next one or two years?
Charles Liang: Yes. I mean, a very good question. I mean, as you may know, right, I mean, our DNA, I mean, since 2000 -- year 2000 to 2017, pretty much our yearly compound growth has been about 20% yearly. So, I don't believe we won't return to that growth rate or better. We'll take the delay behind us. And although COVID-19 is challenging us, but now we enable Taiwan operation, the opportunity in Taiwan with lower cost, with almost no COVID-19 impact, I feel very confident we will get back to 2 digital growth here very soon, hopefully not just 2 digital, hopefully, we can have -- no reason we cannot get back to more than 20% or 30% growth yearly. So, I have a very good feel and very excited to -- in the next few years at least.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay. And hopefully, it will be with a higher margin business. And in that context, Kevin, how should I think about either absolute utilization rate for U.S., San Jose versus Taiwan, or if you don't want to disclose a specific utilization rate, which region is higher. I'm comparing U.S. San Jose to Taiwan?
Kevin Bauer: Well, right now, the U.S. utilization is higher. I think, you heard in my prepared remarks that at the current time, Europe and Asia are suffering a little bit more than the U.S. because the U.S. was the location where we got these new marquee customers. But, I think on a go-forward basis, that capacity utilization needs to obviously increase, and we'll get some leverage off of that. I think it's also fair to say that with -- the U.S. building is not under active construction at the moment. We're taking a little bit of a pause with it where we're moving forward with the Taiwan building. I think, once those both get built out, we may have capacity to, on a full tilt basis, almost get to like $6 billion. So, we would be building that over the course of time, as necessary. I'm just talking about the Shell and its capabilities. But, that's the kind of profile I think that we're looking at, to answer your question.
Charles Liang: Yes. Indeed, to reach $6 billion, our cap investment won't increase too much because the facility capacity pretty much ready here.
Kevin Bauer: Yes. So that kind of describes. And in previous calls, I talked about how after we get these buildings done, then our CapEx is going to go back to the modest maintenance. And now you have an understanding of where that's going to be.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop.
Ananda Baruah: A few for me, if I could. Just to start, how should we think about the drivers in the December quarter? Could you tell us what you think the biggest aspects of your business are that will influence the incremental sequential revenue in the December quarter?
Charles Liang: With COVID-19, we try to be conservative. So today, we give a range of $780 million to $880 million. I hope it's a conservative number. And again, that's why we just mentioned, we are gaining a high-profile customer in large cloud, 5G, telco and video steaming all kind of business. So, I believe next few quarters should be our good quarter to grow.
Kevin Bauer: Yes. I think, Ananda, also we're going to see some return of the customers that took the pause in September.
Ananda Baruah: Got it. Some of the more classic on-prem, on-prem so it sounds like. Is that right, Kevin? And Charles, I appreciate your comment about...
Kevin Bauer: I gave a long list of expected customers, including OEMs and such. So, it’s broad.
Ananda Baruah: Got it. And just with regards to Ice Lake, and I don't want to make -- I don't want to stitch things together that aren't intended to be stitched together. But, in the prepared remarks, I think it was Charles, you made mention of slight improvement in December. And then, it sounded like kind of in the first half of next year calendar or maybe kind of in first half, a stair step kind of take up. Those are my words, but that sounded like the spirit of it. And I guess the question is, to what degree does the availability of Ice Lake play in that relative to just demand you think can get better, regardless of Ice Lake, Ice Lake or not?
Charles Liang: Yes. As you may know, Intel Ice Lake now can be available very soon, end of this year or early next year. And we have the strongest product line ever, all available now. Once the Intel CPU in production, will be ready to ship. [Indiscernible] product line. So, we are all ready.
Ananda Baruah: And it sounds like you think that will have a pretty significant impact when availability occurs.
Charles Liang: Yes. We are waiting for the new CPU to be available.
Ananda Baruah: Okay, great. And just a linearity question, how did you guys experience it this quarter? And what are you seeing in this month to start, to start December quarter? So how did you experience in the September quarter? And how does -- how do you feel about sort of November -- sorry, October so far in the context of linearity?
Charles Liang: You mean in terms of Ice Lake or overall business?
Ananda Baruah: Overall, overall. Thanks.
Charles Liang: Overall, I believe the business will be getting stronger, getting better for us for a couple of reasons. Number one, we just created some very-high profile customer in the last few months. And those ramp-up is pretty predictable. And second is our current operation is getting ready, and we just grow some strong team in Taiwan, those team are ready to grow. So, we have a very good feeling in the near future, especially next calendar year should be a strong year for us.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Jon Lopez with Vertical Group. Your line is open.
Jon Lopez: I just want one clarification, Kevin, if I could, which is, deferred the last couple of years had trended up pretty nicely. It's kind of flattened out over the last couple of quarters. I'm wondering, is that just because unit volumes have dropped off? And is it just a function of attach, or is there something else influencing that line item?
Kevin Bauer: Well, there is some attach, but it's also true that contracts that we entered into in 2018 through early part of 2019, if you recall, had very elevated commodity costs, and the car for the service as a percentage of revenue. So, we had some more expensive contracts historically. I think, we do want to continue working on our attach rate. We do better in some regions than the other, and we need to work on some offshore attach rates, to be frank.
Jon Lopez: Got you. Okay. That's really helpful. Secondly, I'm wondering if you could just rewind a little bit, my recollection, as you guys exited the prior quarter like calendar Q2 was that the bookings activity had slowed pretty sharply. Can you just walk us from there to here? Was there a pretty appreciable increase in bookings activity? Did that occur pretty linearly? How does that look exiting calendar Q3 versus say exiting calendar Q2?
Kevin Bauer: It's gotten healthier. I mean, hence the guidance.
Jon Lopez: Fair point. Okay. Two more quick ones, if I could. My recollection is, cloud, if you look back a couple of years, I can't remember what you guys called it back then, maybe Internet data center, but it was around 20% of the business or oscillated around that level. Can you guys give us just a rough sense for where that sits now?
Kevin Bauer: Yes. We still are not splitting out our revenue segments right now. But, I will that the topography of it is quite different now. And that is, is that back in the day that you're referring to, it was a pretty large, greater than 10% customer, where we're greater diversified in that segment right now.
Jon Lopez: Got you. And just on that point, Kevin, is the right way to think about this that you guys are, I mean, for lack of a better term, kind of reentering that vertical? Maybe just talk a little bit about what you guys are perhaps doing differently now. Are you -- it sounds like perhaps diversifying the customer base is one thing. Are you guys pursuing different use cases? Is there maybe a bit more geographic spread here? Maybe just talk for a second about how you think about that vertical now versus perhaps how you did, say, two, three years ago?
Charles Liang: Maybe I can share. I mean, we saw our facility in Taiwan getting bigger. And of course, it’s much lower than our operation in USA. So, with that advantage, now we will start to approach that market much more aggressively than the last few years. So, in the other words, we will actually focus on that territory very soon.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jon Tanwanteng with CGS Securities. Your line is open.
Jon Tanwanteng: Hi. Just a quick follow-on to that question. Is it fair to say that it's the cost advantage of moving to Taiwan that’s enabling you to win those customers at this point versus whatever else you may be bringing to the table?
Charles Liang: Yes. Because those large data center, they buy a lot, but they want a more aggressive price. So, with our Taiwan operation, now we are much ready to service customers like that.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Charles Liang.
Charles Liang: Thank you a lot for joining us today, and looking forward to seeing you in person, hopefully very soon. And have a great day. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q4  (2020-08-11 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Supermicro Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2020 Financial Results. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, James Kisner, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.
James Kisner: Good afternoon, and thank you for attending Supermicro's call to discuss financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, which ended June 30, 2020. By now you should have received a copy of the news release from the company that was distributed at the close of regular trading and is available on the company's website.  As a reminder, during today's call, the company will refer to a presentation that is available to participants in the Investor Relations section of the company's website under the Events and Presentations tab. We have also published management scripted commentary on our website.  Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expenses, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook, including the potential impact of COVID-19 on the company's business and results of operations. There are a number of risk factors that could cause Supermicro's future results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our most recent 10-K filing for 2019, our March 2020 10-Q and our other SEC filings. All of these documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Supermicro's website. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.  Most of today's presentation will refer to non-GAAP financial results and business outlook. For an explanation of our non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to the accompanying presentation or to our press release published earlier today. In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today's press release and in the supplemental information attached to today's presentation.  At the end of today's prepared remarks, we'll have a Q&A session for sell-side analysts to ask questions.  I'll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Charles Liang: Thank you, James, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we have released our fiscal fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2020 financial results. Now let's take a look at some highlights from the quarter. Our fiscal fourth quarter net sales totaled $896 million, up 5% year-over-year and 16% sequentially. Our fiscal Q4 earnings per share was $0.68. We saw double-digit growth in Edge applications and some key data center and cloud customers. This was offset by softness from some customers who are seeing the worst effect of the COVID-19 threat.  Before we dive into the financial details, I want to provide you an update on our business strategy. Last quarter, we talked about our 4 strategic high-growth market segments, and we are aligning our resource accordingly to speed up our growth for the coming quarter and years. These 4 strategic market are: first, organic enterprise and channel business, including server, storage, IoT and AI, which are our historical growth areas; second, our new 5G, Edge and Telco business; third, our new large data center and public cloud; and fourth, software and global service.  I'm pleased to share that we have made good progress in 3 of these 4 market categories this quarter. The strategy enable us to win more high-profile customers among enterprise, data center and 5G, Telco infrastructure builders. In addition, we have continued our investment and growth trend in software and service by doubling this team's head count over the past year to prepare a series of higher-value product line.  Unfortunately, COVID-19 pose significant disruption on our organic enterprise and channel business and slowed their growth in the near term. But we are encouraged by our progress in our 2 new strategic drivers this quarter, the large DC and cloud as well as 5G and Telco. And they prove that our overall growth strategy is working well and will drive much stronger results in the future.  Going forward, we also plan to accelerate our unique online business into an official phase to complement our strategy. We have been preparing and fine-tuning this business for a few years. And I am optimistic that it will speed up, bringing new revenue growth and profitability to us. How do we move this business into an official phase? Supermicro pride itself in product innovation, which have been the key to our success in the past 27 years. Our server system building blocks, application optimization and resource savings design vision separate us from our competitors, and we are very excited by our recent product introductions.  Last quarter, we announced a new AI and machine learning system portfolio that supports the new NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs based on the latest AMD EPYC processors and Intel coming soon processers, armed with up to 5 PetaFLOPS of performance per 4U system with optimal thermal solution. These systems enable researchers to trend the most sophisticated AI networks at an unprecedented speed.  Next, we have introduced a new 4-way enterprise platform based on the third-generation Intel Xeon Scalable processor, which is optimized to take on deep analytics and mission-critical applications. Most importantly, this quarter, our R&D is hard at work to expand our extensive AMD product lines. And working closely with our partners to seed our next-generation X12 Intel processor-based product line. These engagements will enhance the strong foundation for our growth in the coming quarters and years.  At our recent virtual Storage Summit co-hosted with our partner, Nutanix and Intel, we discussed our completely refreshed storage portfolio. At the event, we introduced storage systems that offer highest data density and optimized system performance for our customers, including our brand-new, second-generation top loading 60- and 90-bay storage, petascale EDSFF, high-performance storage and software-defined solutions.  Switching gear to 5G. We have also been recognized recently by VDC Research as the Top 5G, Telco and Edge solution provider based on the highest customer satisfaction for its application-optimized products. As distributed compute become more critical for 5G infrastructure implementations, our Edge solutions are optimized to be deployed, managed, maintained and secured on a mass scale. We see that most of the 5G, Telco and Edge business opportunity are still in the early phase of deployments. This represent great market share opportunities for Supermicro.  I want to get back and talk a bit more about our calendar quarter and business outlook. The logistical issues, rising shipping costs and employee working from home caused by the spread of COVID-19 in U.S. to disrupt our business in short term. It lower our business and revenue by some points and increase our business cost in short term. As of this time, we have been aggressively shifting and growing certain operation and R&D works to Taiwan. By aggressively and efficiently growing our operation in Taiwan, I'm confident that this big step of change will yield bigger, long-term reward, as our overall cost will be much lower when our operation and production volume in Taiwan ramps. However, we will also continue to optimize our operation in U.S. by better business and production automation to address the ever-changing market dynamics.  In summary, we are able to continue our growth moderately despite the continued disruption caused by COVID-19. We will provide a near-term outlook today that reflects some results from those threats of COVID-19. However, we are very encouraged as we look into the future, as the digital world continue to progress, evolve and grow. Rest assured, we are using this period of disruption as an opportunity to improve our business, global structure by shifting and growing certain portion of operation, production and R&D to Taiwan, a much lower cost country and less COVID-19-disrupted area. This change will result in our mid-term and long-term business revenue and profitability growth. Our enhanced mix of hardware, software and service hybrid focus is the path forward for us to build higher product value, gross margin and revenue growth over time. Our strategy will empower Supermicro, re-accelerate our revenue growth and resume our long history of strong market share gain. With that, we remain very bullish on our long-term opportunity to penetrate our roughly $100 billion TAM.  Finally, we are pleased to announce today a $30 million stock repurchase program. Although the starting amount is modest, we would like to start utilizing our cash on hand to increase shareholders' value while maintaining sufficient cash resource to fund our operation and aggressive growth plan. The stock repurchase program reflects our ongoing commitment to improve the value of our common stock and will help us to offset dilution from our equity plan.  I will now hand the call over to Kevin to review the results of the quarter in more detail.
Kevin Bauer: Thank you, Charles. First, I'd like to thank our employees, customers, investors and partners for their support as we navigate the ongoing challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Before jumping into the details of the quarter, we'd like to provide a brief update on the status of our operations. Recall, our largest production and employee presence is in San Jose, California. We continue to operate under increased safety measures for the health of our employees. While we have adapted well to current conditions, we continue to maintain a higher level of inventory and are adjusting our logistics to moderate costs. All that said, while we aren't satisfied with our operating profitability this quarter, we are proud of our results under these unprecedented times. While we don't have unique insight into the long-term trajectory of a global economic recovery from COVID-19, we believe that much of the effects we are seeing on our financials today and over the near term will likely prove transitory.  Now let me turn to the details of the quarter. Our fiscal fourth quarter revenue totaled $896 million. This reflects a 16% quarter-on-quarter increase from the third quarter of fiscal 2020 and a 5% increase from the same quarter of last year. Systems comprised 83% of total revenue and volumes of systems and nodes shipped were up sequentially and year-over-year. System ASPs increased quarter-on-quarter but declined year-over-year.  Turning to geographic performance. On a year-on-year basis, the U.S. was up 4%, EMEA grew 13% and Asia was flat. On a sequential basis, U.S. sales grew 27% as we saw strength at a number of Internet data center and enterprise customers. EMEA grew 3% and Asia grew 2% sequentially.  Before moving down the P&L, I'd like to point out a number of discrete items worth noting for investors. First, we recorded $17.4 million in expense related to incentive awards to our employees that impacted both cost of sales and operating expense. Remember, on our February call, we mentioned that we had expected to incur additional onetime charges of $35 million to $40 million. Second, we paid out approximately $26 million for those awards whose performance criteria was achieved in this quarter. Third, we recovered $4.8 million from customers related to previously reserved bad debt. Lastly, we released $3.3 million in tax reserves following the finalization of certain foreign tax returns for prior years, and our tax rate was reduced for export sales from the U.S.  Turning back to our non-GAAP results. Q4 gross margin was 14%, down 150 basis points year-on-year and 370 basis points quarter-on-quarter. As you've likely heard from other market participants, commodity costs have been volatile. Gross margin was impacted by commodity costs, COVID-related costs and customer mix in that order of magnitude.  Turning to operating expenses. Q4 OpEx on a GAAP basis decreased 3% quarter-on-quarter to $114 million. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses increased 5% quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year to $91 million. The sequential increase in non-GAAP OpEx was primarily due to the absence of $9.5 million in R&D credits the previous quarter. G&A also benefited from the aforementioned debt recovery. Other income and expense was a $0.7 million loss as compared to a $0.9 million gain last quarter related to the foreign exchange remeasurement of our Taiwan-dollar-denominated loans.  This quarter, our taxes were a $7 million benefit on a GAAP basis and a $2 million benefit on a non-GAAP basis. In both cases, we benefited from our new tax structure and settlement on a tax audit, as highlighted in the discrete items mentioned earlier.  Lastly, our joint venture contributed income of $3.5 million this quarter as compared to a $1.1 million loss in the previous quarter and income of $0.9 million in the same quarter a year ago.  Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share totaled $0.68 per diluted share compared to $0.84 last quarter and $0.69 last year. Cash used from operations totaled $96 million as we paid out $26 million related to the onetime employee bonuses. And our accounts receivable was up $71 million sequentially on increased sales.  Timing factors contributed to the large use of cash in Q4, and we currently expect cash flow from operations to improve in Q1. CapEx totaled $9 million, resulting in free cash outflow of $105 million. Our closing balance sheet cash position, which excludes restricted cash, was $211 million. This quarter, our cash conversion cycle was 87 days, down from 92 days last quarter and within our target range of 85 to 90 days. Days sales outstanding was 37 days. Day payables outstanding totaled 52 days and inventory days was 101.  Now turning to the outlook for our business. The company expects net sales for the quarter ending September 30, 2020, in the range of $720 million to $800 million. In addition to typically somewhat weaker seasonal trends, we are cautious, given significant economic uncertainty. We expect gross margins to improve roughly 70 to 125 basis points sequentially as commodity cost pressures abate. With regard to operating expense, the $4.8 million debt recovery will not repeat, and we expect sequential increases in compensation, product development and the completion of our year-end audit. We expect audit costs to revert to normal levels in the December quarter.  We anticipate the GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be 18% for the year. We expect GAAP earnings per share of $0.03 to $0.27 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.10 to $0.35, both on a diluted basis.  Our management team is focused on guiding our company through the continuing challenges presented by COVID-19. Although we're unable to predict the extent to which COVID-19 may further impact our business operations, financial performance and results of operations, we believe we're well positioned financially and strategically as we continue to serve our customers.  Finally, as Charles mentioned earlier, we currently announced that our Board of Directors has authorized the company to repurchase up to $30 million of its common stock in a new share repurchase program. The program is effective until December 31, 2020, or until the authorized funds are exhausted under a 10b5-1 plan. With this small step, we are signaling to investors that we are committed to creating shareholder value with an efficient use of capital.
James Kisner: Thank you, Kevin. Operator, we're now ready to open the queue for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. 
Aaron Rakers: Yes. Maybe the first question, if you can just talk a little bit about the demand environment. There's been a lot of discussion out there about kind of the cloud, the Internet data center, large data center customers going through some level of a digestion phase. So I'm curious what your insight is in terms of the demand profile there that you're seeing into the current quarter and whether or not you have any kind of indicators of a digestion phase materializing and any extent in terms of how material that might be or how long that could last?
Charles Liang: Yes. Very good question. We did see a large data center, especially those social networking, those streaming even gaming large data center have a strong demand during this COVID-19 period, especially. And we have most focus on the other side, enterprise channel. So that kind of increased demand, indeed, that did not help us a lot in June. But likewise, say now, we are extending our operation and business to Taiwan. Hopefully, our cost will decrease. So we will be able to more aggressively participate in those large data center and cloud. And I believe this business may not be seen for another few quarters probably.
Kevin Bauer: Yes. Aaron, I can augment that describing a little bit of what we're seeing in the current quarter. So I think evidence that would align with what you're hearing from other parties is that as we entered into July, we definitely saw that our customers were taking a pause after having a strong June. And so I think as opposed to last quarter's comments, where I said we started off strong, and let's see where we go; this quarter, we're seeing a pause in July, yet just currently now, we're starting to see an order -- a flow -- an order flow pickup. So we hope that, that is a good turn to our July results. So a little bit different topology as compared to last quarter.
Aaron Rakers: Okay. That's helpful. And then you talked a little bit, I think in your prepared remarks, about kind of "significant component cost headwinds", but it sounds like those might be abating here as we move into this current quarter. Can you help us understand or appreciate how you're kind of seeing component cost trends into this current quarter and kind of how much of that 70 to 100 basis point improvement in gross margin might be assumed from component cost dynamics?
Kevin Bauer: Sure. I think what we're seeing is that you got a little bit heated with component costs, and things are moderating a little bit. For us, Aaron, it takes time for us to kind of digest inventories that we have on hand. And we believe that towards the end of the quarter, we'll be able to see some moderation in component costs. I think that's a fair portion of what we described in terms of our expectations for Xeon improvement.  Other things that we continue to battle are the momentary high cost of logistics and freight. As we kind of mentioned earlier, it was tough in the last quarter. It kind of loosened up in June. It was looser in July and seems to be tightening up a little bit. But beyond that, what we've done is we've looked at some of our components that we bring from Asia to look at what are those that we can start shipping by sea. It might take a little bit more in terms of inventory holding, but it's definitely worth it when it comes to some components like motherboards and those kind of things, we can afford to do by sea. So we're kind of managing that. And hopefully, we'll have some improvement in that arena as well.
Aaron Rakers: Okay. Very helpful. And then a final quick question. There's a lot of discussion out there about Intel timing, and I know it might be longer term in nature around the cadence of their product cycles. But any thoughts that you guys might offer in terms of how the cadence of Intel's moves product-cycle-wise, 10-nanometer, 7-nanometer affects your kind of outlook and appreciating that's probably a longer-term question.
Charles Liang: Yes. I mean, Intel, as you know, they postponed their 10-nanometer and also the coming 7-nanometer technology. So that did impact some to us. However, we also grow AMD product line very aggressively. So overall, there are some impact for our maybe September quarter. But long term, we should be able to adjust efficiently.
Kevin Bauer: Yes. Aaron, that's -- that's one of the considerations as we look forward when I said that product development costs may increase a little bit is that now we have to think about multiple platforms, given the dynamics of Intel's timing and pushing the pedal to the middle a little bit more on alternate processors.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah from Loop Capital.
Ananda Baruah: A few, if I could, Charles and Kevin. Kevin, to start, just a point of clarification. When you were talking about sort of seeing a pause in July after June and now seeing order flow pick up, was that your enterprise and channel business? Or was that the hyperscale public cloud business?
Kevin Bauer: I think it's -- we're seeing it on multiple fronts, so not necessarily the hyperscale, but probably more traditional.
Ananda Baruah: Okay. Okay. Great. Got it. So you're starting to see a pickup again. And I was going to ask you about the linearity of slowing, but it sounds like it was really a month of July dynamic. Are you -- do you -- any context that you can provide for how we should think about like seasonality into December? I know it's probably lack of visibility, a little murky right now. But any context just for a modeling would probably be useful for us.
Kevin Bauer: Yes. That's a little bit hard to call right now. I believe that we all are hoping that things return to normal a little bit and that we have some seasonality certainly in December and maybe a little bit better than normal. I don't know, Charles, do you have anything to augment that?
Charles Liang: Yes. I mean September traditionally our soft quarter. And December, we had 20% higher than September in the history. So this year, I believe we will have some impact like that, although coronavirus impacting us, but we are doing what's possible to adjust our workload. We will feel December will be a much stronger quarter, yes. That will be still the case.
Ananda Baruah: Really helpful. And I guess just with regards to the cost, sort of the cost optimizing, and you highlighted shift to -- kind of production shift to Taiwan. You guys -- you also mentioned accelerating your online business. Could you just walk us through the different initiatives that will help optimize the cost base? And then maybe give us some sense of timing of how sort of you might begin to be able to benefit from those optimization efforts?
Charles Liang: Yes. I mean, since about 9 months ago or even 12 months ago, we started to grow in Taiwan aggressively, including engineering, the operation and even sales, even customer service. So that transition will be up now, especially for coronavirus. As you may know, the coronavirus impact in Taiwan is much less than United States. So we are moving to Taiwan for cost reason and for coronavirus impact reason as well. And the result is gradually helping us. And I would like to say that December quarter, it will have more next year, for sure, will be much more efficient. And it's kind of mid-term and long-term investment, but December quarter, we will see some help.  As to our online business, it's basically a complementary business to help our customers to get support, especially spare parts or when they need a mobile system, they can order from online. And that system we have been preparing for many years. And now it is getting very mature. So we start to small-scale business last few quarters. And then we will have a formal official release very soon.
Ananda Baruah: That's really helpful, Charles. I really appreciate that. Let me just sneak one more in here. Just -- this is on 5G, your 5G initiatives. And then you had made mentioned a couple of times on the call about seeing public cloud progress. Could you just give us -- put some context around what's going on right now, what you're seeing and experiencing in your 5G and public cloud initiatives? And appreciating that, Kevin, you said that it's been sort of stop, start -- sort of stop, start again. But would love to get a sense of contextually what you guys see going on, the progress that you've made. And then do you think these can be, I don't know, have an impact in the December quarter if things come together for you?
Charles Liang: Good. Thank you for the question. Yes, we start to focus on 5G, Telco about 12 months ago. And now we already engaged a handful of good-sized customers. And they are very happy, very convinced with our product. So we see some production, some volume moving since last quarter. And those volumes will ramp up in this quarter and December quarter and especially for next year.  And with our operation, growing in Taiwan aggressively now, we soon will be able to ship really high-volume product from Taiwan operations. And that's why it's the time, it's mature for us to start service large-sized cloud and data center. And we already are working with a couple of those potential customers. And the response, again, so far, have been very commendable. So we will continue to push those opportunities.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And your next question comes from the line of Nehal Chokshi from Northland Capital Markets.
Nehal Chokshi: All right. Really nice June Q results, by the way. To me, significant narrative of the investment theme here is what you guys have been talking about returning to our heritage of gaining market share. So within that investment theme, can you characterize how you think you did in the June quarter? And what is embedded in your September quarter in terms of market share trajectory?
Charles Liang: Yes. I mean, last quarter, I started to share, we engaged with another 3-year business drive, right? Large 5G Telco, Large data center and cloud and then software AI and service. So indeed, all the 3 new drivers, we have been growing pretty healthy way. For 5G Telco, we already have some handful customer engaged. Large cloud, we have some customer engaged. And then software AI in service, we continue to gain customers satisfaction, and that's why we like to further promote the scope to service older customers around the world. And we expect that these -- the feedback will be pretty healthy for our business plan.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. And then for September quarter, do you expect that outperformance to continue, and that's what's embedded in your guidance, and therefore, you're actually expecting the overall market to be down as much as 15% year-over-year?
Charles Liang: To be very directly, I mean, we just moved a lot of business to Taiwan, especially operations. And September, the impacts, the advantage from that should be limited. December, I would like to say will be much more significant. And then next year, we're sure we will see a lot of benefit from that. It will take some time to warm up.
Nehal Chokshi: Yes. Understood. And then, Kevin, you mentioned -- gave some additional detail regarding order trends being relatively weak in July. Is it fair to say it was actually trending down more than 10% year-over-year during the month of July?
Kevin Bauer: Well, I'm not going to give a specific number like that, but July was one where it was certainly a weak month. And so we're glad that we've seen the trajectory turn here. So all of that is embedded in terms of the revenue range that we've given.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. And why was there a lack of the $9.5 million R&D credit? Can you give more detail on that? And how should we think about going forward?
Kevin Bauer: Yes. So last quarter, if you recall, we had a significant onetime event where we received $9.5 million from a partner for a cancellation of a program. And that's all we're just saying.
Nehal Chokshi: Got you. Okay...
Kevin Bauer: It was a discrete of significant magnitude last quarter.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to our presenters for some closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you. I would like to thank you, our employees, customers and investors for their continued support. And thank you for joining us today and see you next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

There are a number of risk factors that could cause Supermicro's future results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in our press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our most recent 10-K filing for 2019 and our other SEC filings. All of these items are available on the Investor Relations page of Supermicro's website. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Most of today's presentation will refer to non-GAAP financial results and business outlook. For an explanation of our non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to the accompanying presentation or to our press release published earlier today. In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today's press release and in the supplemental information attached to today's presentation. At the end of today's prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session for sell-side analysts to ask questions. I'll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Charles Liang: Thank you, James, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we have released financial results for our fiscal third quarter 2020. Now let's take a look at a few highlights from our Q3 results. Our third quarter net sales totaled $772 million, up 4% year-over-year. Our Q3 earnings per share was $0.84 compared to $0.49 last year, which was up 71% year-over-year. One area of particular strength in the quarter was our 5G, Edge and IoT products, which were up more than 30% year-over-year. Before we dive into the financial details, I want to provide you an update on our business vision. To make it simple, our business strategy is to build the best products for high-growing markets, leveraging our unique building-block-solutions design approach and green computing, resource-saving architecture that's beneficial to both our customers and the environment. We have been focusing on our strategic high-growth market segments and aligning our resource accordingly to speed up growth for the coming quarters and years. These 4 strategic drivers are: first, our organic enterprise and channel business, including server, storage and AI, which are our long historical growth areas; second, the new 5G, Edge and telco business; third, large data center and public cloud; and fourth, software and global services. In the enterprise space, we have acquired many brand-name enterprise customers over the years, and our plan is to win more new accounts while growing our installed base. To that end, we have our key products such as BigTwin, Ultra and MP systems, certified by leading enterprise software partners such as SAP, Oracle, VMware and Red Hat. As an important part of our organic growth, our channel business has remained strong throughout the year due largely to our building-block-solutions approach that helps our partners create the most optimized systems for their customers. In the rapidly growing AI and machine learning space, we have established ourselves as a premier AI system provider. We have recently introduced the industry's broadest portfolio of validated NVIDIA GPU Cloud or NGC-Ready systems, optimized to accelerate AI and deep learning applications. We see more AI workload moving towards the edge, where AI inferencing and 5G in the converging and driving up demand for our intelligent edge products. Our second growth driver is 5G, Edge and telco, which represent an exciting field of opportunities for Supermicro. We have designed a series of new telco and Edge-friendly product lines to help our customers build out their 5G deployments, which enable them to transform their existing proprietary hardware infrastructure to open, software-defined x86 standard hardware from Supermicro. For example, our pole-mounted, ruggedized IP65 level is perfect for 5G and outdoor intelligent edge. We also introduced an optimized short-depth 2U Ultra SuperServer that provides better features and faster performance and is ideal for telco and micro data center environments. Just yesterday, we host a highly successful online event with our technology partner, Intel. The 5G live forum brought together leading infrastructure and telco companies from globe to discuss the latest total solutions for 5G. These sessions are now available on our website. We believe the transition from 4G to 5G will provide Supermicro significant growth opportunities going forward. The third growth driver we are focusing now is the large data center and public cloud space. Our new products such as the Cloud DC systems are purpose-built for hyperscale data centers with cost optimization and ease of volume deployment. In preparation to scale for more cloud business, we have already made available 30% extra production and service capacity as of today and are also expanding our global manufacturing facilities, especially in Taipei, where lower operating costs allow us to be more competitive. The last and fourth growth driver is our software and global service. To ensure our server, storage and networking products are simple to deploy, easy to manage and secure to use, we have been investing in our software and global service over the past many years. In addition, we have certified all the major operating systems and key applications while adding more security capabilities. As more and more customers are deploying data centers at an increasingly large scale, it's paramount that we supply them with more capable cloud-scale management software that enable streamlined and fully automatic data center operations. An enhanced mix of hardware, software and services revenue will also improve our gross margin over time and provide revenue growth. In summary, we were pleased with our quarterly results despite the disruption caused by COVID-19. And at this moment, we do not plan to provide the quarterly revenue guidance. But we are very excited with our innovative product pipeline and our new growth drivers, which Supermicro reaccelerate our revenue growth and resume our long history of market share gain. I will now hand the call over to Kevin to review the results of the quarter in more detail.
Kevin Bauer: Thank you, Charles. First, I would like to thank our employees, customers, investors and partners for their support as we navigate the challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Upon the news of the outbreak overseas, our first response was to actively manage our supply chain for potential shortage risk by increasing inventories of critical components. Since that time, we have continued to add to our safety stock for key components such as CPUs, memory, SSDs and, to a lesser extent, GPUs, such that customer orders can be fulfilled as they are received. As a designated essential business, we responded to the directives of Santa Clara County and the state of California regarding shelter-in-place instructions to combat the spread of COVID-19. Our first priority is the safety of our workforce, and we immediately began to implement numerous health precautions and work practices to operate in a safe manner. Operating in the critical sector of IT infrastructure, we assessed our customer base to identify priority customers who also operate in critical industries, guiding us in our go-forward strategy. We quickly transitioned most of our indirect labor force to work from home. We also shifted some focus towards Taiwan operations from Europe and the United States. Despite this disruption, we successfully managed the last 2 weeks of March to achieve revenues at the bottom of our original guidance range. Now let me turn to the financials. Our fiscal third quarter revenue totaled $772 million, which was at the lower end of our initial guidance range given on February 6 and above the midpoint of the guidance range we gave on April 2. This reflects an 11% quarter-on-quarter decrease from the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 but a 4% increase from the same quarter of last year. Systems comprised 74% of total revenue, and volumes of systems and nodes shipped were down sequentially but up year-over-year. A number of large enterprise customers fulfilled data center projects in the December quarter and, is often the case, paused in the March quarter. ASPs increased quarter-on-quarter but declined year-over-year. Geographic performance on a year-over-year basis was mixed with the U.S. down 3%, EMEA up 20% and Asia 10% higher. On a sequential basis, the U.S. market declined 20%, while EMEA grew sequentially by 9%. Asia declined a modest 3% sequentially. There were a number of sizable discrete events in the quarter that I would like to emphasize. First, we received a settlement fee on a joint product development project for $10.1 million, $0.6 million of which reduced cost of sales and $9.5 million that reduced R&D expense. Applying our U.S. tax rate of 23% would yield a $0.14 benefit to diluted earnings per share on both our GAAP and non GAAP financials. Second, in our last call, we mentioned that we expected to incur additional onetime charges of $35 million to $40 million related to residual cleanup matters from our extended blackout period. By direction of our Board of Directors, we saw input on this matter from investors holding approximately 45% of our shares outstanding and incorporated that input to provide cash awards, many of which included performance conditions. This quarter, we recorded $10.3 million in expense, $2.9 million of which increased cost of sales and $7.4 million that increased operating expense related to the awards. As noted in our last call, we have excluded this item from our non-GAAP measures. Lastly, we recorded a provision for an SEC settlement of $17.5 million that we have excluded from our non-GAAP measures. Working down the P&L. Gross margin on a non-GAAP basis was 17.7%, 250 basis points higher than last year driven by lower commodity costs as well as favorable customer, geographic and product mix and the aforementioned settlement fee. Q3 operating expenses on a GAAP basis increased 7% quarter-on-quarter to $118 million mainly due to a $12.5 million increase in salaries and benefits, including previously disclosed performance awards and the related payroll tax withholding and the $17.5 million provision for an SEC settlement. These expenses were offset by $9.5 million related to the joint product development related settlement fee. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses decreased 15% quarter-on-quarter and increased 8% year-on-year to $87 million. The sequential decline was due to several factors, including lower audit costs and lower employee costs, including R&D expenses and the joint product development related settlement fee. Recall that concluding in our delinquent filings in the December quarter led to a sequential reduction of audit fees of approximately $6.5 million. Other income and expense was a $0.9 million gain as compared to a $0.4 million loss last quarter primarily related to the foreign exchange impact on our Taiwan dollar-denominated term loan. This quarter, our taxes were a $0.9 million benefit on a GAAP basis and a $2.9 million expense on a non-GAAP basis. In both cases, we benefited from reduced tax liabilities in the U.S. and the Netherlands. We continue to expect both our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate going forward to be approximately 20%. Lastly, our share results in the joint venture was a $1.1 million loss this quarter as compared to a $1 million loss in the previous quarter and a $0.4 million loss in the same quarter a year ago. Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share totaled $0.84 per diluted share compared to $0.57 last quarter and $0.49 last year. Cash used in operations totaled $21 million, as we invested in inventory as a defensive measure. And CapEx totaled $11 million, resulting in free cash outflow of $32 million. Our closing cash position, including restricted cash, was $319 million. This quarter, our cash conversion cycle was 92 days, which is slightly above our target of 85 to 90 days. Days sales outstanding was 41 days. Days payable outstanding totaled 61 days, and inventory days was 112. Now turning to the outlook for our business. Given the uncertainties of COVID-19, we will not be providing guidance for the coming quarter. However, to provide context around our business, we are sharing the following metrics and facts. We continue to see ongoing demand as we enter the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 and do not have significant direct exposure to industries such as retail, oil and gas and travel and leisure that have been impacted the greatest. As time passes, we may discover greater indirect exposure to distressed industries through our channel partners and OEM customers. We note that our shipments plus orders shippable in the June quarter as of the last week are up as compared to the prior quarter and are also up compared to the same quarter a year ago as well. Looking forward, logistics has emerged as a new challenge as the transportation industry restricts the frequency of departures and increases costs. We expect increased costs in freight as well as direct labor costs as we incentivize our employees to continue to work and assist us in serving our customers, many of whom are in critical industries. We expect these incremental costs to reduce gross margin by 100 to 150 basis points on a sequential basis. We also expect to record expense of $16 million to $17 million related to the aforementioned performance awards in the June 2020 quarter. Approximately $20 million to $25 million in cash will be paid in June 2020 quarter related to these performance awards. Our management team is focused on guiding our company through the unfolding and emerging challenges presented by COVID-19. Although we're unable to predict the extent to which COVID-19 may further impact our business operations, financial performance and result of operations, we believe we are well positioned financially and strategically in an uncertain business environment. With that, I'll turn it back to James for Q&A.
James Kisner: Operator, we're ready to open the queue for questions.
Operator: [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.
Mehdi Hosseini: Two items. One, on the P&L and revenue mix, can you provide some color on how the mix between server system and subsystem was in the March quarter and how you see it trending into the June quarter? And then on the inventories that went up by about $160 million, are you going to continue to build inventory in the June quarter? I mean, to that extent, how should I think about cash from operation and free cash flow?
Kevin Bauer: Yes. Mehdi, thanks for the questions. So I think the first one, in terms of systems versus subsystems, we talked a little bit about how sequentially we had some good systems purchases by enterprise customers that were project-related in the fourth quarter. Oftentimes, we get that in the December quarter and the June quarter, and those were down quarter-over-quarter. So that's primarily one of the drivers of systems being down. And then to your second question, as it relates to inventory, yes, we did build quite a bit of inventory during the quarter, as I had described, trying to get ahead of the ball game in terms of any supply issues that were out there. We will potentially continue to build inventories during the course of this quarter. I think it all depends on what we bought and then the success of our sales coming out in this quarter as well, but still in a defensive posture until we feel a little bit more comfortable about seeing the supply situation in terms of lead times coming down a little bit and then feeling a little bit better about not being bit by any logistic issues.
Mehdi Hosseini: Sure. Just a quick follow-up. In your prepaid remarks, you said you did indeed accumulate more inventory of CPU and I think you said the storage, or you may have said DRAM and SSDs. But you said not as much GPU. How should I think about the mix of inventory that you're accumulating, why less GPU and more CPU?
Charles Liang: Yes. As you may know, I mean, memory and SSD has been shortage in the market for few quarters, especially recently. That's why we shipped more memory -- I mean SSD. As to CPU and GPU, we manage relatively very well. Yes, June quarter, you already have a kind of high season. That's why we prepare a little bit more to make sure we won't have a shortage to our customer.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.
Aaron Rakers: Just kind of building on that last question. I'm just curious, I guess, first of all, on the constraint side, were you unable to ship to any customer demand this last quarter because of supply constraints or component constraints? And then on that same topic, how are you currently seeing the pricing environment? As you build inventory, there's a little bit of a debate out there whether or not memory pricing could start to turn the other direction, meaning decline going into the back half of the year. I'm just curious on what are you seeing in terms of flash pricing as well as DRAM pricing in your inventory?
Kevin Bauer: Well, I'll take the first question, and then I'll let Charles speak to the second question. As it relates to the first question, Aaron, we always exit the quarter with some portion of our demand not being able to be shipped because of shortages. That was true this quarter as well.
Charles Liang: Yes. And that's why we are watching very carefully. It's a daily base, and then we keep kind of enough SSD and DRAM as of this moment. So I believe our inventory level today should be pretty efficient to support our June quarter demand. And as for the pricing, I mean, it's hard to say. It depends on the coronavirus situation, right? At this moment, looks like it's still kind of not predictable, but we kind of keep relatively in a very high confidence level, a little bit higher inventory, but we believe we need them either this quarter or in the next few months.
Aaron Rakers: Okay. And then just kind of thinking about -- you talked about kind of the growth drivers, the vertical kind of market opportunities that you guys have between AI, ML and enterprise, Cloud, 5G, Edge, telco and then software and services. Is there -- can you help us understand the contributions of those, call it, 4 verticals to the business today? And any thoughts on what you're expecting those to kind of grow as we move forward?
Charles Liang: Yes. Thank you for the question. As you know, we just finished the 10K today, kind of a long-term program. So now we are recovering -- I mean recovering in our business, get back to a normal faster growth mode like we had in last 25 years. So I mean, other than our organic enterprise, service, storage and channel business, we are ready to fully focus on our 5G, Edge and telco market as well. So we have a dedicated team focused in that area and believe it will start to grow strongly. And the other area, kind of like a large data center and public cloud, yes, before our capacity was limited, especially in U.S.A.. And in the last few years, we extend our capacity pretty successfully in Taipei. So now we have an extra capacity in Taipei, and we believe it's beneficial to ourselves, our shareholders, to focus on large-scale cloud and to grow our economic scale. And we will be selective to grow that deal and make sure it's a positive for company. As to software and global service, I believe we shared a couple of times in our quarter end conference call, and it's continued stably growing business. With software, especially management software and our fully efficient global service, we are able to approach more enterprise customer, cloud -- private cloud and public cloud around the world. So we feel pretty comfortable to recover our faster growth business model now.
Kevin Bauer: Yes. I think, Aaron, that's another area that we hope to be a little bit more discrete about in Analyst Day.
Charles Liang: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital.
Ananda Baruah: A couple, if I could. Charles, Kevin, congratulations on the crisp execution as well. Yes, two, if I could. I guess the first is -- and I apologize if you've already spoken to this and I missed it. But Charles, in the press release, you talked about how key application adoption, I think you say all of which is accelerating as a result of COVID, and I was wondering if you could talk with a little more context as to what you're seeing there with regards to acceleration. And it sounds like you guys are leasing some good follow-through, so would love to get some context around sort of what types of applications you're seeing accelerated. You think maybe there could be some bit of a structural change, not just a little pull-forward and any other context you think that would be useful for us. And then I have a quick follow-up.
Charles Liang: Yes. Thank you. Very good question. The coronavirus indeed created a big trouble for people around the world, but it also created some strong demand for people. For example, people work for home and people stay at home, so they need a lot of networking service. So we saw a large data center communication company and other security-related organization, their demand indeed increasing kind of strongly. So good part is we have been preparing 5G, Edge and telco business since about last year. So those products are getting mature. And we gained -- getting ever more customer commit to those product. So I mean, overall, I feel optimistic for our future growth, although it has to be very carefully watched, the coronavirus. As of this moment, I feel basically positive.
Ananda Baruah: That's great. And it may be too early to ask this next question. But are you able to develop any sort of opinion on if there's going to be any degree of structural change in customer -- not consumer, your customer behavior such that maybe the level of dollar spend on those types of applications you benefit from could remain elevated given everything that's taken place? I know it's early, and I know there's a lot of opinions about that. But if you feel like you've been able to develop on that, I'd love to hear what it is.
Charles Liang: Yes. As you may know, our building-blocks solution have been helping us a lot with a lot of customer-specific application or some modification to optimize their data center structure. We are able to modify from our existing building block solution. Instead of a completely new design that may take people 1 year or 6 months, in most of our case, it took us a much shorter time frame, 2 months to 3 months. We are able to optimize exactly the application customer want, so including 5G, Edge and telco market, I just mentioned. So a lot of that, we are able to quickly win on some good commitment from certain really large-scale customers.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jon Lopez with Vertical GRP.
Jon Lopez: So my first question is, would you mind just walking through stepping back the time line or a time frame from sort of February through now? And I guess what I'm looking at or trying to get a sense for is, I'm assuming things were pretty challenging for a bit there. But I'm wondering if you could describe how the quarter ended and just how things have trended thus far as you've got into calendar Q2.
Kevin Bauer: Yes. So I kind of shared that we -- first of all, the March quarter is always a difficult quarter because of the fact that you have Lunar New Year there. So typically, what we see is that it's pretty slow in the first 2 months and then we try to predict what the third month was. This year was no different than any other. And as we guide into the March quarter -- I'm sorry, in the month of March, things turned around. We saw a solid line of sight to be able to hit the bottom of range that we were at. We were able to navigate the last two weeks as it relates to the disruptions of the workforce. And because of that, we're -- unlike others, at that time, we did not just pull guidance. We decided to wait and be able to give a new guidance in the first week of April. Thereafter, as I've said, we've seen continuing demand as compared to our metrics. So backlog plus shipped were a little bit ahead as compared to quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year. But the visibility is still very murky out there with COVID-19. We don't know the rate of people going back to work or anything like that. It's still fuzzy.
Jon Lopez: Right. No, that's helpful. But I guess the thing I'm driving at is that your fiscal Q4, and to your point, we all understand, these are not normal times, but I would imagine your backlog would be building or would be higher in a normal fiscal Q4. So I guess the thing I'm just kind of driving at, if you could compare to what would be normal, are things more or less back to normal at this point, caveated around the lack of visibility and all that stuff?
Kevin Bauer: On a year-over-year basis, it is up, that's what I said, in terms of our backlog and shipments as of this time.
Jon Lopez: Yes. Okay. Got you. Helpful. My second question, and I apologize, you may have covered some of this stuff. I was on hold for a bit. But relative to the backlog and the shippable stuff, are there anything -- other like -- and I know you highlighted logistics, but like are there things that would prevent you from shipping that backlog? And is that like part of the reason that you're -- despite having that maybe cautious or opting not to offer guidance, like could backlog be there but you would not be able to meet it for one reason or another?
Kevin Bauer: There are a number of reasons, some of which is that, at this time, especially over the last few weeks, we've had to confirm that our customers are able to receive the products, having people work on the dock to receive it. So we can't just ship product to them and have it left on their dock with no attention there. So there's a number of things like that, that are little practical items that we need to go through in greater pain than under normal times.
Jon Lopez: Yes. That makes sense. I got 2 other real quick ones, if you could bear with me. The first one, just on gross margins, you mentioned that you're going to see some headwinds cost-wise from logistics. And I think you quantified that. It's like 150, 200 basis points relative to calendar Q1. Is there anything else that we should think about gross margin-wise between calendar Q1 and calendar Q2 other than those logistical headwinds in costs?
Kevin Bauer: Well, yes, we had a pretty good product mix in that quarter. So we'll see what the product mix is when we get done in the second calendar quarter as well. Jon, now that you're on the phone, I'm going to answer a question that you're not asking because I got nudged by someone here. And that is that I wanted to highlight that in my prepared remarks, I said that our going-forward tax rate is 20%. That's our long-term going-forward tax rate, which we're still believing will apply to 2021. But obviously, we had some favorable tax treatments in the March quarter. And for this year, we expect that because of the fact that we -- our employees can now trade their options and sell shares. We're starting to get some stock comp windfall. And also, we've been able to conclude on some old tax audits. So for this year, we think the GAAP tax rate for the full year is going to be more like in the mid-teens on a GAAP basis and maybe as low as 10% on a non-GAAP basis. So I wanted to clarify that because...
Jon Lopez: No, that was on my list. That was on my list. I'm glad you did it. I'm glad you did it. The last one, to get rid of me, the -- I understand not giving revenue guidance. I guess, the one thing I'm hoping you could talk to a little bit, I mean, you can control OpEx much more readily than you can control revenue. So I know there was a lot of onetime-y stuff in calendar Q1. But as you think about the balance of the year, can you just talk through how even qualitatively you're planning on handling OpEx until visibility improves a bit?
Kevin Bauer: Yes. So we will be continuing to invest. As Charles had outlined, we're still moving to be able to grow, more so in Taiwan than others, but trying to be careful and trying to be smart as the economy reveals itself.
Jon Lopez: Okay. So it sounds like we shouldn't expect OpEx to come down a whole lot. Is that a fair way to summarize that?
Kevin Bauer: Yes.
Operator: [Operator instructions] We have a follow-up from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. Just a couple of follow-ups. As a follow-up to the prior question regarding OpEx, Kevin, you mentioned a couple of items in your prepared remarks like a higher equity, share -- equity compensation and cash award. Can you please just highlight those items? Are those all going to be in the COGS? Or how is it split between COGS and OpEx? And beyond the June quarter, how does the OpEx look like when these onetime increase go away? And I have a follow-up.
Kevin Bauer: Yes. Sure. So Mehdi, I'll step back and highlight the fact that we said that we reached out to roughly about shareholders that held about 45% of our shares to be able to craft these things. And so these are cash awards. But because of the fact that most of them have performance conditions, we have to use a Monte Carlo analysis to determine how to spread the expense over time. I think I mentioned that we had roughly about $10 million in expense this quarter. And in the next quarter, I think I said it was about $16 million to $17 million. And then there's going to be -- after that, I would expect that it's going to come down dramatically, and there will be a tail over the course of time that would be far less material as it goes. So that's the way that the expense would be spread. And then I highlighted the fact that there will be payments that will hit our cash balance in this June, as some of those conditions have been successfully met.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay. And two follow-ups here. The tailwind, as we look into the second half calendar year, does that imply like a single digit, like a $5 million-ish per quarter? Would that be a fair assumption for modeling purposes?
Kevin Bauer: Are you talking about OpEx growth?
Mehdi Hosseini: No, I'm talking about the compensation. The employee compensation in the March quarter was $10 million and then $16 million to $17 million in June, and then it's going to come down. You said there is a tailwind. And for purpose of modeling, should I assume that tailwind is like a mid-single in September quarter and beyond?
Kevin Bauer: I'm sorry. I think I've misdescribed it for you. So what I said was, is -- let me just make sure here, let me go back and refer to what I said here.
Mehdi Hosseini: I think you said $16 million to $17 million in June. And for March, it was $10 million.
Kevin Bauer: Right. So that's about $26 million or so. And if you remember, we had estimated it to be about $35 million to $40 million. It's going to be -- in the end, it's going to be maybe not quite $35 million. Does that help you?
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. And then I also want to go back to my earlier question. I was trying to figure out how the server system business tracked in the March quarter. And what should we expect in the June quarter? I didn't quite understand if it was up or down in March.
Kevin Bauer: Sorry, can you say that again?
Mehdi Hosseini: Was the server system revenue -- total revenue minus subsystem, was it flat, up or down in the March quarter?
Kevin Bauer: It was down, Mehdi. And I explained that it was driven by enterprise customers who executed on capacity projects in the fourth quarter, took a pause in the March quarter. And what I said was that by looking at what they're doing in the June quarter, they're coming back a little bit. Also, on that cash award comp, remember, we're not GAAP-ing that out. Don't forget that.
Mehdi Hosseini: Right. Sure. Okay. And I just want to go back to -- so you did increase inventory by $100-some million, and then June is typically your strongest quarter. Some of the server system that could not be shipped in March is pushed out to June. So when I look at these dynamics, it seems like your inventory should start to come down in the second half of calendar year and some -- as the supply disruption goes away. Would you agree or not?
Charles Liang: Basically, yes.
Kevin Bauer: That's right.
Charles Liang: Yes. Unless in second half, coronavirus global situation really improve, and we hope so, and then our inventory had to grow again to meet the growth.
Operator: Your next question is a follow-up from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital.
Ananda Baruah: I appreciate the follow-up. Just quickly another -- it's not really a clarification but just more context again. In the prepared remarks, you guys mentioned public cloud and some of the things you're doing around public cloud. You mentioned it a couple of times. There's also a mention of cloud in the press release. So is there -- are you -- is there something sort of new that's going on there? It sounds like you sort of teased it out. So I would love to understand -- well, how should we -- how do you want us to think about what's taking place there and what the exposure is?
Charles Liang: Yes. Very good question. Indeed, the data center and cloud are not new to us. We have been always have a cloud data center business but before with limited production capacity from the U.S.A., especially. That's why we very carefully control to engage with more cloud or large data centers. But now in the last two years, especially, we grow our capacity in Taiwan a lot. So now we have extra capacity and a very good product for cloud, especially private cloud as well. And now even for public cloud, we have specifically optimized solution for that. So we are kind of carefully select some customers, some partners to support them. And the volume can be big, but it will be under careful control.
Ananda Baruah: Charles, that's helpful. And so should we think of -- sort of the incremental growth in that area, should we think of it being served out of your Taiwan capacity?
Charles Liang: Can be. We hope so.
Ananda Baruah: Okay. And I guess my next question is then, to the extent you can share, can you talk about sort of from a customer perspective, not specific names, but would you be, on a public cloud basis, providing that -- those solutions into U.S. hyperscalers, China hyperscalers? I mean, China would make sense because they're being produced so closely. But any context there you can provide would be helpful, too.
Charles Liang: Yes. Indeed, both. Indeed, in last many years, we have been always have a large cloud partner. It was just because our capacity was limited. That's why we selected to support them. But now with more capacity available, especially in Taipei, we are ready to be more aggressive to engage with them.
Operator: Your next question is a follow-up from Jon Lopez with Vertical Group.
Jon Lopez: I had two quick ones. The first one is, Intel made some road map changes a little earlier. And I'm wondering -- with some impacts to the early part of the year, I'm wondering did that impact you at all? Just in terms of -- I mean, I know there's a whole bunch of variables you're dealing with. But did that specific variable impact either bookings visibility or anything over calendar Q1, calendar Q2?
Kevin Bauer: I don't think so, not appreciably.
Jon Lopez: Okay. Great. My second one, there's sort of a new discussion about some security measures being implemented in China. I just wanted to double check on your exposure there and -- A. And B, would you think that there's any potential impact to you to the extent that those measures move forward?
Kevin Bauer: We're not quite sure. We'll have to see.
Charles Liang: What's your question again?
Jon Lopez: Oh yes, I'm sorry. There's just -- there's sort of some renewed discussion about some tightening of security and export measures between the U.S. and China that may go into effect in a couple of months, and it's sort of an IT-wide phenomenon. Yes. Yes, sorry. No, that's it.
Charles Liang: Indeed, our operation have a major portion based in Silicon Valley, right, not since 20 years ago. And then we grew big capacity in Taipei since about 10 years ago. And then our capacity in Taipei has been very big. So that's why now, our major production operation business is still based in the U.S.A. and then Taipei and then some portion in Netherlands, B.V., right? And in China, indeed, a portion have been very limited.
Kevin Bauer: That's also true of our sourcing as well, Taiwan richer maybe.
Operator: Your next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.
Aaron Rakers: Two hopefully quick questions. Just back on this whole kind of manufacturing capacity and ability to kind of service more cloud customers. I know several years ago, in the past, you talked about how much actual capacity, how much systems revenue you could support with the footprint you have. Is there any way you can help us today of how much systems revenue could you support with the capacity you have in place? And how much has that expanded just with this expansion in Taipei or Taiwan?
Charles Liang: I can provide a rough view and picture, and Kevin maybe later can provide more detail. Basically, we have a huge expansion already in -- both in U.S.A. and Taipei. So overall, today, roughly, we have 30% extra capacity, both U.S.A. and Taipei. And that's why we are ready to grow significantly in the telco market and even the public cloud market. And especially in Taipei, now we are very aggressively increased our operation and production and service capacity because as you know, the cost from Taipei is relatively less than 50% of Silicon Valley. So we, for sure, would like to take that advantage, and it's about right time now. So our actual growth in Taipei can be pretty big.
Kevin Bauer: Yes. So Aaron, I think that you just take it from a revenue perspective, that could be maybe getting us to $4 billion or a little bit better. The capacity is there. Obviously, the labor capacity would be increased, as needed, over time.
Charles Liang: $4 billion, I think we share with more conservatism. Indeed, it can be $5 billion.
James Kisner: All right. That's all the time we have. Any closing comments, Charles and Kevin?
Kevin Bauer: Yes. We wanted to thank all of the investors listening in today as well as the analysts. We appreciate you walking this journey through with us as we continue to go through the challenges of COVID-19. We look forward to talking to you again next quarter. And as you all know, we have our Annual Shareholders' Meeting coming up, which has a very important vote on it, related to us asking for additional shares for an equity plan that is important. And we seek your support for that. So Charles?
Charles Liang: Thank you, everyone. We are ready to grow faster now and see you next week -- next quarter, sorry. Thank you.
James Kisner: Thank you for the call, operator.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Charles Liang,:
Charles Liang: Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Over the last couple of years, the Super Micro has been continuing our journey of becoming a strong global leader of server and storage solutions. We have added many new product lines and roughly doubled our operational capacity worldwide to build our products more efficiently and with high quality. Now Super Micro is the most complete company it's ever been, supporting enterprise customers and data centers with optimized solutions, plus management software and services, and providing our industry-best system building blocks to the channel. "Better, faster and greener" is what our customers demand, and it's exactly what we deliver.  Today is also an important milestone of our company as it is our first quarter after relisting on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange. We begin this new era for Super Micro, a stronger company with better financial and operational controls. Combined with the latest technology and total solutions for our customers, we are more optimistic than ever about our business opportunities ahead. I can confidently say that we are back, stronger and ready for growth.  Before we discuss this quarter's results, let me remind our shareholders about what makes Super Micro unique in our industry.  First, product innovation is our DNA. We are the only server and storage solutions provider with a majority of our engineering, product development and final assembly based in the USA. With over 1,700 engineering staff, mostly in the heart of Silicon Valley and some worldwide, our dedicated engineering strength allows us to quickly offer the most advanced technology with the broadest range of products in our industry.  We have capitalized on the industry convergence of cloud, artificial intelligence and 5G from data center to edge. These emerging technologies enable businesses and industries to utilize the growing pools of data and data analytics. Super Micro's technology innovation DNA uniquely positions us to provide timely and optimized solutions to service these key high-growth markets.  We are delivering world-class solutions for global enterprises. From the private to the public cloud, our enterprise data center solutions have been widely deployed around the world. As a certified provider of enterprise solutions from leading software applications, such as SAP, Oracle, Red Hat to name a few, we offer complete, seamless solutions based on our hardware products, service and firmware/software design capabilities.  And finally, we are positioned to be one of the fastest-growing solution providers in the growing $100 billion server/storage market. Super Micro's growth strategy based on our building block solutions business model, which configures solutions directly to enterprise companies, data centers, OEMs and also indirectly through the channel. We plan to discuss our business opportunities and strategy in more detail with investors at events later this year.  Now turning to our Q2 results. Our second quarter net sales were $871 million, which exceeded the high end of our initial guidance and up 9% sequentially, consistent with typical seasonal patterns. Sales were down 6.5% year-over-year, in large part, due to steep declines in component pricing.  Our indirect or channel business grew to represent 51% of this quarter's revenue and grew both sequentially and year-over-year. This quarterly result follows our successful launch of improved channel partner programs. At the same time, our direct and OEM businesses also grew sequentially, with the most of the growth coming from large enterprise accounts. Other than our current market focus, we are also enhancing our product offerings to hyperscale installations with highly optimized cloud DC and mega DC product lines.  Here are some key product highlights. We saw growth for our Rackmounts and multiple node product lines in data centers. This quarter, Rackmounts grew sequentially primarily due to a strong growth in our Ultra platform, which was up 30% sequentially, and BigTwin, which grew over 20% quarter-on-quarter. Ramping of AMD products and some other new Intel processor-based systems will help continue this strong momentum.  We saw sequential growth accelerated computing and launched multiple new GPU-based product offerings. Our customers choose Super Micro GPU solution over the competition because they provide the best pure performance with the fastest GPU interconnects and highest performance per dollar.  Our 5G, Embedded and IoT solution for edge computing, telco data center and appliance also grew, and we anticipate these product lines to grow significantly later this calendar year. We announced new additions for 5G cell tower deployments, leveraging fully configurable SuperServer to the edge, bringing standard x86 compute design to a traditional proprietary telco market. We also brought AI to the edge, combining ruggedized hardware and optimized software stacks to accelerate the most demanding AI workloads at the network edge.  We continue to focus on our mission to lead the IT industry with Green Computing Solutions and resource saving platforms, including the introduction of our first 12-year longevity power supply, a new part of the disaggregated architecture. With investor attention on ESG consideration, we anticipate increased demand for resource saving solutions.  Summarizing this quarter, we were pleased to see our revenue start to reaccelerate. We are also pleased to be able to move forward this quarter as a NASDAQ traded public company. We will continue to focus on transforming server and storage technologies by building upon our robust engineering fundamentals. Super Micro is ready to provide the best products to customers who are demanding innovation, quality, lower TCO and environmental-friendly solutions. I will now turn the call over to Kevin to review the results of the quarter in more detail.
Kevin Bauer: Thank you, Charles. Our fiscal second quarter revenue was $871 million, exceeding the upper end of our prior guidance range. This reflects a 9% quarter-on-quarter increase from the first quarter of fiscal 2020 but a 6.5% decrease from the same quarter of last year. Systems comprised 77% of total revenue, and volumes of systems and nodes shipped were up sequentially and year-over-year. However, ASPs for systems fell due to declines in commodity component costs.  Geographic performance was mixed on a challenging year-over-year comparison, with the U.S. up 3%, EMEA down 20%, and Asia 16% lower. On a sequential basis, the U.S. market continued to be our strongest market with sequential growth of 12%. However, this quarter, EMEA also grew sequentially, increasing by 12%. Asia had modest sequential growth with Taiwan, Korea and other Asia countries, offsetting weakness in China.  Working down the P&L, our gross margin on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis was 15.9%, 210 basis points higher than last year driven by lower key component costs as well as favorable customer, geographic and product mix.  Q2 operating expenses increased quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year, primarily due to higher employee costs, including higher R&D expense, targeting new opportunities. We had a strong central urgency to get current with our SEC filings by including the fiscal '18, '19—and '19 10-K audit as well as the first quarter '20 10-Q review. We also completed a tax restructuring project on December 1, 2019, that results in a lower corporate tax rate of approximately 20% on a go-forward basis. Concluding these 3 projects increased G&A expense by approximately $6.4 million in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter of 2019.  Other income and expense was a $1 million loss as compared to a $1 million gain last quarter, primarily related to the foreign exchange impact on our Taiwan dollar denominated term loan. Our tax rate for this quarter was 8% on a GAAP basis and 12% on a non-GAAP basis, both of which benefited from a release of reserves, following the conclusion of a tax audit in a foreign jurisdiction of $1.6 million.  Lastly, our share of earnings in a joint venture was a $1 million loss this quarter as compared to a $1 million gain in the previous quarter and a $1.8 million loss in the same quarter a year ago. Second quarter non-GAAP diluted earnings per share totaled $0.57 per diluted share compared to $0.68 last quarter and $0.66 last year. Cash flow generated from operations totaled $82 million. After deducting for CapEx and investments of $11 million, we generated free cash flow of $71 million. And our closing cash position was $309 million.  This quarter, our cash conversion cycle was 80 days, which is below our target of 85 to 90 days. Days sales outstanding was 38 days. Days payable outstanding totaled 46 days, and inventory days was 87.  In summary, we are pleased to see revenues reaccelerate. We are also pleased to be able to report this quarter as a NASDAQ traded public company with stronger financial controls.  Now turning to our outlook. The company expects net sales for the quarter ending March 31, 2020, in a range of $770 million to $830 million. In addition to typically weaker seasonal trends, we are increasingly cautious given the unfolding impacts of the coronavirus outbreak. Barring further significant disruption from the outbreak, we expect this quarter to represent a trough and see constructive trends fueling healthy year-over-year growth going forward. In particular, we are encouraged by a healthy customer pipeline supported by a number of technology refreshes and product cycles in the second half of calendar 2020.  With regard to operating expenses, we will continue to invest in personnel to fuel growth. We are also aggressively remediating material weaknesses with the goal of full remediation by June 2020. Therefore, while OpEx will decline sequentially in the March quarter, it will grow sequentially in the June and September quarter due to the audit of our financials and testing of our remediation efforts. We expect audit and remediation costs to revert to normal levels after the September quarter.  We also announced that we expect to incur additional charges of $35 million to $40 million in the third or fourth fiscal quarter that are onetime in nature. These onetime charges address residual cleanup matters from our extended blackout period. We are taking actions to address benefits that were not be able to be realized by certain of our long-term and most dedicated key employees. Further, the Board is considering an additional retention bonus to certain employees. And lastly, our Board is considering appropriate forms of compensation for both of these matters. Regarding the use of cash through the rest of fiscal '20, we will apply cash to completing two buildings, one in San Jose and the other in Taiwan, which will be completed over two years. As I mentioned earlier, we expect higher than normal costs related to audit and remediation for several more quarters. Assuming this revenue range, we expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.35 to $0.55 for the quarter. And as a reminder, these onetime charges are not included to non-GAAP EPS range.  In closing, let me highlight an upcoming event for the financial community. We will be attending Susquehanna's 9th Annual Technology Conference in New York City on March 12.  With that, I'll turn it back to Perry for Q&A.
Perry Hayes: Thank you, Kevin. I'd just like to remind shareholders who are listening in on the call, I understand that the audio may not have been very clear. At this point, I'll remind you that the transcript will be available on our website, in fact, is at this time. So if you had any questions understanding part of it, please refer to the transcript.  Operator, we're now ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will go to Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. 
Ananda Baruah: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions and congratulations on continued progress forward. This could be for both Charles and Kevin. Just starting with the revenue trajectory, you guys—there's two comments. Kevin, I believe you said Q-o-Q growth going forward, and then you also talked about, I think, in the second half of the year, a stronger R&D expense—I'm paraphrasing here but you see revenue opportunities. And the guide for the March quarter, it was 7% to 8% at the midpoint. So could you talk about how you'd like us to think about sequential revenue kind of tempo and trajectory in the coming quarters to the extent that you're comfortable? Just so we can get a sense of that. And then what some of those upcoming revenue opportunities are?
Kevin Bauer: As we highlighted this quarter, we have costs—or caution a little bit with the coronavirus that is out there. What I tried to convey is that once we get through this quarter and say there are no residual effects of that, then we like what we see in terms of what our new customer pipeline looks like as well as knowing that the technology refreshes itself at the end of the year. And so we don't normally give a longer-term guidance, but just giving you a little bit of color for the investment community to results.
Ananda Baruah: And that's the end of the calendar year?
Kevin Bauer: Correct.
Ananda Baruah: Got it. Great. And then just quickly on OpEx, if I could. You mentioned OpEx increasing in this—there's actually a couple of moving parts you sampled for the OpEx. You actually—magnitude of OpEx increasing. Well, you mentioned OpEx increasing in the second half of the year. Can you give us a sense, just for modeling purposes out of the gate year, how you'd like us to think about magnitude? And then I missed the part with regards to the audit costs. I think it's December quarter, it sounds like you're saying that normalizing. I just want to get a sense of what we—how we should expect impact on—when that rolls out as well or normalizes as well.
Kevin Bauer: Yes. So let's first talk about our R&D investments. So we mentioned that we continue to invest in R&D for future products. Another [indiscernible] of the company is to enhance our software capabilities. So some of that is really focused on software engineers. And we are signalling that we continue to invest here.  As it relates to OpEx, I understand that certainly, as we really, really focused on getting compliance in this quarter, that $6.5 million is maybe not comprehended in model. And so therefore, I wanted to address that thing that, when we had our audited booking concurrently on both '18, '19 as well as first quarter '20, we went through a peak and that's why I tried to call that out. So that $6.4 million, I think it is safe to model that, that will not occur in the March quarter. And so kind of, to reset your base, I'll keep that in mind, and then I was trying to give you the ecology of the way audits play thereafter. So therefore, we're going to be dealing in a lot of remediation activity internally. And then as funded by—we'll be working with the audit firm for [indiscernible] audit 2020 results as well as the intensity of their auditing our performance on internal control, hopefully, such that it would be remediated by 2020.  So that's the shape that I tried to give you, a reset, including into the March quarter, and then kind of like increasing through to September.
Q - Ananda Baruah: I appreciate it, gentlemen. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.
Mehdi Hosseini: Thank you for taking my questions. A couple of follow-ups. First one is for both Charles and Kevin. Commodity prices are on the rise, and your OpEx is also going to increase by June and September quarter. You're also talking about our revenue opportunities. So when I look at the trend, it seems like we shouldn't really expect any margin expansion until like a year from now or early 2021 given the commodity prices with GAAP, gross margin expansion and also increase in OpEx. Am I thinking that it's the right way? Or am I missing something? And I have a follow-up.
Kevin Bauer: Well, I think we're always looking for ways to improve, but I think maybe the increase in commodity prices, as a margin percentage, I think I articulated that, that could be a little bit of a headwind. So I think you're on track there.
Charles Liang: [indiscernible] quarter, maybe two years ago. We start with investing much more in Korea. So Super Micro [indiscernible] provide most of total solution through our enterprise customer. And unlike 10 years ago, we pretty [indiscernible]. So we can [indiscernible] as a total solution company. And this [indiscernible] we are adding more value to our product.
Mehdi Hosseini: Sure. And that's actually a good point. And it leads to my second question, just for Charles. It's good that you're not currently [indiscernible] NASDAQ, and there's significant growth opportunity. And hopefully, we get the margin expansion like this year and next year. But can you share with us, Charles, what are you doing to improve governance? What are you doing so that as you grow the business? There's also checks and balances that would help with increased confidence and—so that we could look forward and the path would be just a rear view?
Charles Liang: Yes. That is why we are saying—I mean, in [indiscernible] we start to invest more and more in the firmware, software solutions. So we are ready to focus much more on the enterprise, including governance and some other mission-critical patent. So from this point of view, we feel very comfortable to grow our [indiscernible] both in OEM and in [indiscernible].
Q - Mehdi Hosseini: Sure. That's well understood. But what are the key checks and balances that you put in place? So as you grow, there's also a more systematic approach in scaling the business so that the top line and bottom line are consistent.
Charles Liang: Kevin, [indiscernible].
Kevin Bauer: Yes. Sure. So maybe, I think I can share with you that Charles has been very, very forward and very supportive in terms of investing in the feed and ensuring that, for instance, the internal audit and the compliance group are all joined at the hip. And I will tell you that now with Don at the helm at sales and Alex being our COO, the communication of—in training across the entire organization is light years ahead of what it was a year or two ago.  And to give you a little bit of color, I think, just this quarter, we were very enhanced in terms of the way that we closed this quarter and being very interactive with the operational people to understand everything that's going on to make sure that we are fully aware of what impacts the financials. And so Charles certainly helps us make sure that we have all the resources to be able to do that. As you know, we have other remediation efforts that we need to attend to. We brought on a wonderful [indiscernible] chair that has helped us in terms of helping to get and understand ideas of how an apps deal company needs to perform revenue on a daily basis as well as follow up with requisite investments in IT. So there's a lot going on in the ecosystem [indiscernible].
Charles Liang: Yes. Especially the SAP system has been much mature than two years ago or three years ago. And we're now adding operational [indiscernible]. I would have to say, we pretty much double our [indiscernible] in compliance and financial department compared with two years ago. So all of those kind of dramatically improved our operations and financial function.
Q - Mehdi Hosseini: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Then we'll move on to our next question from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.
Q - Aaron Rakers: Thanks for taking the questions. Also congratulations on being out on the results. And so kind of building on Mehdi's question. I'm just curious, I heard the comment in the prepared remarks about positive views on the pipeline of opportunities looking through the course of this year. And I guess the simple question of that is, kind of how would you define pipeline? How has the methodology around looking at the pipeline changed? And then again, what is pipeline to you guys given, obviously, the nature of your business, it's fairly turns-oriented? I'm just curious of how you—what underlies the comment as we look forward, and I do have a follow-up.
Kevin Bauer: Yes. So I think it's probably pretty traditional in that the pipeline that I was referring to was really the targeted customers that we're trying to obtain and understanding that—what is in front of us and the level of efforts that we find to land new customers. So sometimes pipeline is referred to growing backlog and all those kind of things, which is not our business. What we're talking about is landing new customers.
Charles Liang: Especially [indiscernible], we start to have a more enterprise accounts. So those enterprise and large accounts in the area continues by the products and commerce distribution and regular data center. They change vendor kind of more [indiscernible].
Q - Aaron Rakers: Okay. And then the follow-up question is kind of tied to the pipeline commentary, is that as you move through the course of 2020, there seems to be a little bit of a different cadence to kind of server cycle dynamics. And it's particularly around the cadence of Intel's product cycles, what that means for your business. So how do you see—there's a lot of discussion out there around Cascade Lake and the ramp of that going to Cooper Lake, and whether or not there could be any kind of delays on Icelake. How do you see the cadence of kind of the server CPU cycle through the course of this year? And how relevant has AMD as compared [indiscernible] in the context of your business?
Charles Liang: Yes. I mean obviously, AMD is growing quickly, and NPLs are more dynamic new product. So basically—by the way, when they have new technology, new generation products always outperform the older product. So we have a very strong engineering team and fully focused on delivering the new economies in the market. So taking AMD alone [indiscernible], we are well prepared. And that's why we believe [indiscernible] on this calendar year and next year, I believe we will have a big chance to build much faster.
Q - Aaron Rakers: And just to slip in one other question. How quickly can you pass-through your upward pricing on the component front?
Charles Liang: Your question again?
Q - Aaron Rakers: How—as we look at component pricing potentially moving higher, I guess, particularly around DRAM, as we move through the course of this year, how do I think about your guys' ability to pass through pricing on the way up? And obviously, it's had an impact on ASPs on the way down. But as pricing comes back, how quickly do I think in your business model, you pass that back through from a pricing perspective?
Charles Liang: Okay. Basically, we have a much stronger relationship with our vendor already. And so pretty much, we are able to be deflect any price to our customers. So that overall effect should be [indiscernible].
Kevin Bauer: You're trying to understand the delay, and I think there is always a delay, but we try to be very nimble in that. And we [indiscernible].
Q - Aaron Rakers: Okay. Thank you. Please go ahead.
Operator: Thank you. And then move on to our next question from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group.
Nehal Chokshi: Thank you. Congratulations on a really strong cash from operations quarter. Looks like the drivers were across the board in terms of cash conversion cycle. Should—is this now at a level where you expect it to be? Or did you guys actually over-index a little bit on the construction of the cash conversion cycle?
Kevin Bauer: Yes, I think we had a good quarter. And I did refer to fact that it was better than what our near-term target range was. I—like every watermark, I'm not sure it will be there because—forever because we have seasonalities that we have to live with. But I think what we'll do now is kind of revisit our target. And over the course of time to be—that project can be shifted, so a little bit better performance, and we'll give an update on that.
Q - Nehal Chokshi: Okay. And I apologize if this has been asked earlier, I am having trouble hearing you guys clearly. But did you guys give any metrics on the large enterprise customer segment?
Kevin Bauer: No, we did not. We broke it down basically, in terms of our direct and our indirect channel.
Q - Nehal Chokshi: Okay. I've got a couple more questions. On the performance within the quarter, obviously, you guys did—came in just above the high end of your guidance. So that's great to see. What do you think was the delta rolls with your performance? Do you think it was the industry perform better? Or you guys performed better than what you had expected? And then relative to the prior few quarters, Super Micro revenue year-over-year growth had been underperforming the industry. Do you have a sense as far as how you guys did perform relative to the industry for the December quarter?
Charles Liang: Yes. We see the—before, we always grew much faster than the industry. [indiscernible] see a slow down. Now it's time to get back to faster growth again. So we expect that we will be able to grow a better [indiscernible].
Q - Nehal Chokshi: Is that what's embedded in the March Q guidance?
Kevin Bauer: I'm sorry, your question was a little muffled. Can you repeat it?
Q - Nehal Chokshi: Yes. Charles mentioned that expect to grow faster than the industry going forward. Now, is that embedded in the March Q guidance?
Kevin Bauer: I mean, March is a very difficult quarter. I think we're talking about beyond the March quarter, just given all of the macro dynamics that we talked about.
Q - Nehal Chokshi: Okay. Good. And then could you comment particularly on—you did mention that geographic performance was uneven, but what was the reason behind that? Was that industry or Super Micro specific?
Kevin Bauer: I think—we haven't seen everyone else in the industry breakout. We haven't compared it necessarily. But in Europe, I think we will go soft from data center customers.
Q - Nehal Chokshi: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Jon Lopez with Vertical Group.
Jonathan Lopez: Thanks so much .I have three. I hope you can bear with me. The first one, the deferred revenue continues to grow a lot, and it's like comfortably over $200 million. Can you just remind us like what's driving that? And then does that yield you any different or better visibility looking forward than was the case before the deferred balance really starting to come up?
Kevin Bauer: Yes. So I think first and foremost, it's good that we're starting to get stronger service business. Certainly, when you're attacking enterprise customers who want that white glove performance or rather expectations, that helped do that. So it is a little bit of a proxy build out. There's a lot when we add on in that deferred service revenue in terms of the length of contracts that people are signing up for. Also pricing over the course of time ends up being in the service revenue line item as well. But I think you're right in terms of it growing is a healthy thing for Super Micro. And what I said in past calls is that, so far, it is a small number from a revenue perspective, but it hopefully will be giving us some buffer in the margin area as time goes by.  So it's all just a big direct from appliances for Super Micro, and is a proof point to a certain degree, of the increase in software and service profit for the company that Charles outlined earlier.
Charles Liang: Yes. And at this stage, we started to service [indiscernible] more than 15% here. So we believe the trend will continue for next many years to come.
Q - Jonathan Lopez: All right. Great. That's helpful. My second one, if we just look at the December quarter, I don't have the exact numbers here, but if I kind of ballpark your commentary, it looks like the nonservice systems business, that's subsystems and accessories segment, was up a lot. A, drive that right. And b, like what was driving that to kind of a disproportionately high level of growth relative to service systems?
Perry Hayes: So yes, this indirect channel was higher than what we've typically seen. I just want to call out, though, that both the direct and OEM business and the indirect channel business both grew sequentially. The indirect channel, we've had a number of programs that we've launched in support of the channel. That, I think, has been helpful. Also, we've seen that the channel also includes the logistic part where we sell subsystems, but it also includes bars we have some larger customers buying systems from them. So that's primarily what we sell, larger purchases through the indirect channel from some of our larger customers.
Kevin Bauer: Yes. So I think the key thing there that Perry kind of broke out a little bit is that one cannot make a direct connection to systems versus subsystems and channel versus direct. It is quite a bit of a mix in there.
Q - Jonathan Lopez: That makes sense. Just thinking about the March, I'm not looking for segment guidance, but would you expect that growth rate to kind of normalize between the two segments looking into March?
Perry Hayes: I think we'll see contribution from those probably in the same degree.
Kevin Bauer: Yes. That would be a sequential comment. We might see the same kind of mix shift when we compare year-over-year, however.
Q - Jonathan Lopez: Okay. Got you. The last one, I'm hoping to come back to the OpEx real quick because there's a lot of moving pieces here, but if I could just ask it this way. The March quarter, it looks like you're guiding us to something in like the high 80s on a non-GAAP basis. From there, what level of increase should we expect for the balance of the year? And is there just—I'm trying to pause so we see it qualitatively. Is there a scenario where OpEx actually declines from the calendar third to the calendar fourth as some of these onetime things move to completion?
Kevin Bauer: Well, I'm glad you asked that question because you've misinterpreted what I said. We had OpEx and non-GAAP OpEx in the quarter be a little over $100 million, right? And so what I tried to say is that $6.5 million will [indiscernible] what we will come off for the March quarter. So strip off $6.5 million. And then from that new baseline, we would have some trending upward expense than that. So you already asked that one.
Q - Jonathan Lopez: Okay. And sorry, just the last part of that, is there—are you guys embedding some kind of like interim peak here in the middle to late part of the second, third quarter that then declines into the fourth? Or we'll just continue to ramp through the year?
Kevin Bauer: So it'll be continuing to ramp. And then actually first quarter '21, I think, would be a peak from an audit cost perspective.
Q - Jonathan Lopez: First quarter calendar '21?
Kevin Bauer: Yes. That's when the bulk of the work of the audit is done on June the 5th.
Q - Jonathan Lopez: Okay. Great. Thanks. I appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. Once again if you would like to ask a question that is star, one. We'll take our next question from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital.
Kevin Bauer: So I just want to [indiscernible] that I was speaking in fiscal quarter near the ending. 1Q '21 would be September of 2020.
Q - Ananda Baruah: Cool. And Kevin, just sort of sticking with that theme. This is a—more of a—definitely calendar '21—calendar—sort of calendar '21 going to calendar '22 question. More philosophically about how we should think of—how you would like to think about business model evolution, one, what sort of all the audit costs have rolled off? And you have these new programs running. And how would you like us to think about the sort of op margin, not guidance, but sort of leveraging the model, how you guys are thinking about anecdotally and philosophically funding—funding new programs, it sounds like you have at least a handful of things you're pretty excited about right now. What's the right way for us to think about as we think about calendar '21 and moving towards normalized in different [indiscernible]?
Kevin Bauer: Yes. It's a little bit mature—premature for us to be able to call that out right now. In our interactions in the past quarter or so, we've mentioned that now that we're back on the market, but we might take a little bit of time redescribing the company and preparing for an Analyst Day in which we would then present a model going forward. So I'm not quite ready to answer that question, please.
Q - Ananda Baruah: Okay. Got it. Are you—have you guys guided upon doing an Analyst Day at some point this year?
Kevin Bauer: Yes. We've kind of said late spring, early summer.
Q - Ananda Baruah: Okay.
Kevin Bauer: And we would do it—we would do so in New York.
Q - Ananda Baruah: Excellent. I often look forward to it.
Charles Liang: As you may know, right? I mean, from [indiscernible] last year, previous, we see a Super Micro [indiscernible] and extend our business through a total solution, not like the five years ago from the [indiscernible] hardware company. So now we are moving to not just hardware company, but total solution, including firmware, software and service. So there, we're putting more value to our business.
Operator: Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Nehal Chokshi.
Nehal Chokshi: Yes. Thank you. On your last slide of your presentation deck, you have 3.0 solutions, management software and then global services and support that's been driving us for the past three years. What is the level of your global service and support personnel to date?
Charles Liang: Our global support team is getting stronger, too. Kind of—it's not like—in terms of hardware, we feel we are more completed system, higher value, even improving our security management feature and kind of the whole cloud in those pipeline. And other than that, we started overall inside the [indiscernible] in some other [indiscernible].
Q - Nehal Chokshi: Okay. Could you give any commentary as far as how large is the global support staff at this point in time?
Kevin Bauer: Yes. We don't have that number on our fingertips. But what I can tell you is there are some reasons that we work with partners through our offices as well. So our strategy has been work with partners in new markets and then [indiscernible] where we have scale, so to speak. So I think [indiscernible] next time. I think they're providing that there's going to be [indiscernible] becomes more meaningful for the company.
Q - Nehal Chokshi: Great. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And it appears at this time, we have no further questions. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Liang for any additional or closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Yes. Thank you for joining us today, and have a great one. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the Super Micro Second Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Conference Call. We do appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time.

You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our most recent 10-K filing for 2017 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the investor relations page at Super Micro's websites. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.  Most of today's presentation will refer to non-GAAP and natural results and outlook. At the end of today's prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session for sell side analysts to ask questions. I'll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter revenue will be in the range of $788 million to $798 million, which exceeds midpoint of our quarterly guidance of $780 million. Our non-GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 15.1% to 16.3%. Non-GAAP earnings per share will be in the range of $0.61 to $0.65 compared to the range of $0.66 to $0.70 last year, in the range of $0.57 to $0.61 last quarter.  System revenue was approximately 80% of total revenue. System ASPs were lower year-over-year due to lower memory and SSD pricing, which impacts revenue. We see continued demand in the channel. We have upgrade of our portfolio and put to market innovation allow our partner to also application optimize solution to their customers. In addition to seasonality in the September quarter, there were several factors impacting our top line revenue. And overall industry wide slow down due to economic uncertainty, some push in purchasing from major data center customers and price reduction on key components using our systems. As recorded by our peer and industry analysts, server revenue has been down in 2019 and we saw that trend continue for our business in the second quarter. However, as we reach the end of this quarter, we’ve begun to see signals of stabilization and early sign of seasonal straight from our key customers, as we begun including our inventory to take advantages of the opportunities.  Super Micro has long history that application optimal product will maximize our growth. We continue to develop new products and solutions, hopefully across major server and storage markets, including total solution, AI machine learning, 5G, IoT and data center. Combining the advantages that were introduced to our green computing and resource savings platform, we delivered concrete solution offerings with Red Hat, VMware, Nvidia and SAP providing certified and tested configurations that can reduce risk and accelerate ROI for our customers. Our offering [ph] between hyper converged [indiscernible] continue to be the most optimized solution for new generation solid customer delivery basically in cars feature, support, [indiscernible], NVMe, predictable IO, and high TTP of Intel 2nd Generation Xeon Scalable Processors.  With SAP we delivered the two new four way super servers as part of our Intel Select Solutions, with up to 12 terabytes of memory, that brings the power and cost saving of data center, system memory to the SAP HANA platforms. We cooperate with Nvidia homemade [ph] HGX Edge solution allowing customers to be manage their AI application on Super Micro’s extensive edge GPU product line in cloud native environment. Moreover, we introduced a new class of 5G ready software defined networking platform that can be optimized to deliver accelerated AI differencing to their network page.  On AMD side, we start shipping Super Micro systems based on second generation AP processor, which [indiscernible] our previous generation A Plus system and provide much better performance and value. Last but not least, we have begun to deliver a set of [indiscernible] system product target for mega data centers. These products are uniquely optimized for the specific requirements of high volume scale data center customers. Our business solution allow us to leverage our existing product designs and customized performance, efficiency and cost requirements on demand. We see a similar opportunity for cloud data centers, optimized design and have therefore underway to deliver additional [indiscernible] to specialized products. Looking ahead, we see the pace of processor refresh cycles accelerating and has repeat our sales with the next level product update in the coming quarters. [indiscernible] we had keep up developing of our next generation Experia architectures for a complete family refresh. This new architecture we’ll take full advantage for the upcoming innovations of Intel new processors like PCI Gen-4 more flexible IO, higher performance architecture, and new storage form factors. We have already started engaging with selected of our customers. Important to achieving our stated goals, we continue to innovate and improve our operational efficiency and scale, building a stronger global foundation. We have increased our capacity in engineering, manufacturing, operations, and service in our key strategic locations. This includes over 200,000 square feet of new facility space in our [indiscernible] completing path and more at our headquarters [ph]. In summary, although market conditions have been challenging, we continue to deliver significant server and storage innovations to the market. More importantly, we have globalized our R&D sales and operations to grow the discipline and focus needed to expand our market share. Fundamentally, we are more confident than ever in the strength of our products and operation improvements, which will empower us to achieve our business goals. And now, I hand the section over to Kevin.
Kevin Bauer: Thank you, Charles. First, I will address the current health of the business by providing an overview of our financial performance for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. I will then make a few comments about our progress on our SEC filings. As Charles mentioned earlier, we estimate our fiscal first quarter revenue within the range of $788 million to $798 million. Geographies were lower on a year-over-year basis with EMEA approximately 21% lower, Asia 22% lower and the U.S. 18% lower. Our estimated gross margin range on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis grow from 16% to 16.2% and 16.1% to 16.3%, respectively. Our margins improved from last year and benefited from lower key component costs, as well as favorable customer, geographic and product mix. Our operating expenses were slightly lower this quarter due to lower reserves for bad debt, offset by the effect of annual salary increases and higher research and development expenses. We estimate our non-GAAP diluted EPS range this quarter was from $0.61 to $0.65 per diluted share. Due to the need to rebuild inventory this quarter for seasonal demand, cash flow generated from operations was lower than recent quarters at $5.5 million. After deducting for CapEx and investments of $13.3 million our free cash flow was negative $7.8 million. Our closing cash position was a robust $239 million. This quarter, our cash conversion cycle was 89 days, the day sales outstanding was 43 days where days payable outstanding was 48 days, with inventory days increasing to 93. Our cash conversion cycle target remains 85 to 90 days. Now, let me comment on the progress of our remaining delinquent SEC filings. Last quarter, we reported that we had submitted our fiscal 2018 financials for audit. We're now able to report that we had also completed work on the fiscal 2019 financials under both the 605 and 606 revenue recognition standards and submitted them for audit at the end of September. Concurrent with the financial statement audit, we have continued the testing and assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting. As a result, we have prepared drafts of our SEC filings. The team remains laser focused on becoming fully current on our SEC filings, which also includes the 10-Q filing for this first quarter of fiscal 2020.
Perry Hayes: As indicated previously, we will have an abbreviated Q&A. In which sell side analysts will be permitted to ask questions. Operator at this time, we're ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Nehal Chokshi of Maxim Group. Please go ahead. 
Nehal Chokshi: Yes. Thanks and congratulations on solid results relative to the guidance, especially on the gross margin very nicely done there. On the guidance here, looks like at the midpoint, you're getting to up 5% Q-o-Q. How's that compared to your typical seasonality?
Kevin Bauer: So in general, we believe that it's similar to our normal seasonality. As Charles outlined, we saw some signs of stabilization and a little bit of growth as we enter into the next quarter. So we believe it's kind of in line.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. And I think you gave the color on why the gross margin was up year-over-year. And I think one of the elements was component costs declining rapidly. And that's certainly true on a year-over-year basis, but I was under the impression on a Q-over-Q basis. There has been some pressure yet you did see strong gross margin on Q-over-Q basis. So could you tease that out as far as why did you also see the strong Q-over-Q gross margin?
Kevin Bauer: Yes, I think we had mentioned last quarter that, as compared to the quarter previous to that that still there were some mix and customer influences that are in there. And certainly that was the case this quarter as it rebounded back. So, we continue to look at that gross margin, trying to ensure that we make some periodic progress overtime that we have talked about the quarters on quarters. But without getting into too specific details, we're really calling out the fact that on a sequential basis, this is really going to be customer and mix orientation and it will be less of the impact on the sequential basis related to the component changes.
Nehal Chokshi: Understood. Okay. And looks like there was about $2.5 million of incremental OpEx Q-over-Q basis; A, is that correct? B, can you help guide us which buckets we should attribute those to?
Kevin Bauer: You mean in terms of…
Nehal Chokshi: For the September quarter, yes.
Kevin Bauer: Yes, so I called out that the key things in terms of the sequential basis were really that we had less bad debt. And then in addition to that as we go into the September quarter our annual merit increases are always affected with our fiscal new year in January 1st. And then, as Charles had mentioned, we have some new product development initiatives that were sequentially increased quarter-over-quarter.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay, I'm going to yield the floor for now. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator instructions] Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Aaron Rakers : Yes, thanks for taking the questions. I want to first just ask you kind of on a demand environment. I know you talked about demand, the demand environment being somewhat challenging. But you also mentioned that you started to see signs of improvement. There has been some kind of mixed data points on some of the hyper scale cloud demand, some suggesting that there might be a push out in server refresh cycles.  I'm just curious of how would you characterize the cadence of your customers as it relates to kind of server, refreshes, do you think that there could be any kind of a pause in front of some of the timing around things like Cooper Lake from Intel, or even Ice Lake, just any kind of color on what you're seeing as far as purchasing behavior for the customers and particularly some of the hyper scale customers you have?
Charles Liang: It's a very dynamic market and that’s we say new processor is getting available. So as technology leading company, we have very strong new product available each month or each quarter. So overall we feel pretty positive as to the macro market and the whole industry demand at this moment we feel it's still kind of hard to predict. But overall we feel not too bad. 
Kevin Bauer: But I think on the backdrop we reminded you of this a number of times that our exposure to hyper scalars is not nearly as much as some of the other competitors that you may have in mind.
Aaron Rakers : Okay. And then as my follow up on the component pricing dynamics, I know just kind of thinking about the progression as you see going forward between DRAM and SSD pricing, there's been some indication that the SSD pricing seems to be stabilizing and maybe turning a bit higher. DRAM, however, continues to be on a downward trend, just as you think about the current quarter how would you characterize what you're seeing from a component pricing environment perspective?
Charles Liang: Yes, I mean, after many years improvement, our procurement department have been a much stronger than before ever. And also our economical scale help us to not only see NVMe especially SSD prices are getting growing and DRAM price continue slowly dropping. So both I guess about offset the next few months, I believe.
Aaron Rakers : Okay, I'll slip one final one in that there's obviously some changes in the competitive landscape from a server CPU perspective, you mentioned in the trance in your prepared remarks, the progression with Rome or the second generation AMD processors. How would you characterize your ability to maybe leverage a bit of a changing competitive landscape in server CPUs what are you seeing in terms of the demand profile the appetite for AMD relative to server CPUs versus say Intel?
Charles Liang: As I just say our AMD platform outperform the previous generation AMD solution allow more Qualcomm, almost double Qualcomm. So performance advantage which we had [indiscernible] so we feel pretty positive for AMD product line. As to Intel product line, again, our product line has been stronger than before ever. So we have good feeling for both Nvidia [ph]. 
Aaron Rakers : Okay, thank you. I'll leave the floor. Thanks a lot. 
Charles Liang: Thank you.
Operator: It appears at this time, we have no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Liang for any additional or closing comments.
Charles Liang: Thank you for joining us today and have a great day. See you next time. Bye.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the Super Micro first quarter fiscal 2020 business update conference call. We do appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you.

I'll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Perry and good afternoon everyone. Our first quarter revenue will be in the range of $825 million to $835 million which is the midpoint of our quarterly guidance of $[800] million, it is 15% lower than last quarter and 11% higher than last quarter. Full-year fiscal year revenue was approximately $3.5 billion and represents an increase of approximately 4% from last year. Non-GAAP earnings per share will be in the range of $0.57 to $0.61 compared to that range of $0.75 to $0.79 last year and the range of $0.48 to $0.52 last quarter. System revenue was approximately 81% of the total revenue. System ASP were a bit lower year-over-year mostly due to lower period and then price which impacts revenue. We launched a comprehensive portfolio of over 100 lean server and storage system supporting a new second-generation Xeon scalable processor called Cascade Lake. The new product bring world record performance and efficiency improvement to enterprise, Cloud, 5G and AI reached up to 50% TCO. We have seen strong interest in this new product and advance over our new product that outpace previous generation. It was a challenging period for traditional strong quarter. Volatile market conditions end up in trade tension and some key component price reduction impact our quarterly revenues. However, the trade challenge, including tariff impact will minimize our strong U.S. based manufacturing presence and our distributed global manufacturing footprint in the USA, Taiwan and in Netherlands. We also see positive signs with our key product names such as BigTwin and SuperBlade which achieved higher sales on both quarterly and yearly basis. Importantly, we see great opportunity as our long-term investment in operation and improved internal efficiency and we are in the growth of our product assume the market demand for application optimized high performance driven products and not declined. On our product side, we remain focused on that delivery solution based on our new resource driven architecture, Super Micro’s unique architecture, this aggregate major sub-systems separating compute, storage, higher power, and reduce those can be differentiated along upgrade independently allowing data centers to reduce different cycle cost and their impact to the environment by reducing power consumption and [e-waste]. Some components such as an opportunity power price encourage us than IoT devices can remain in deploying for up to 20 years. Saving achieved through sheer power including whereas vehicle intrusion. On the typical three to four years cycle, Super Micro reached, they delivered up to 30% hardware costs each new operating cycle. We continue to deliver positive market products introducing first-based server and storage system that supported EDSFF storage drive. This optimize NVMe drive deliver up to six days mostly and up to five days reduction of which additional storage which is ideal for the highest performance worked for our applications requiring higher apps such as autonomous driving, engine, cloud database, artificial intelligence, HPC, scientific research and more. We believe EDSFF will become main storage contractor in the near future. For 5G, Super Micro is convenient to providing them most advanced solutions for age, the modern micro data and core networks that provide the security, IoT, multiple access is complete. Open radio access network, the need for powerful server across a wide variety of implementation will only increase which continue to allow the 5G network. Super Micro H server and who transform enterprise and important this intelligent connectivity from IoT devices to cloud. AI from H also made across as we provide, optimize and validate NVIDIA, CPU collaborating and engineer to our customers. Saving the space for last, let me have a brief review of our trending architectures with many innovations for high speed connectivity design. These new products online as you know assistance connectivity and continue and basic, two of this new exciting projects are called (inaudible) service but at the same time target in Q1, 2010. In summary, we see tremendous potential opportunity in our enterprise, cloud, 5G and AI that will benefit the Super Micro results that we published. I’m very confident in the strength of our products and continue improvement of our operating fundamentals. Regarding our market cycle, our business model first go to market design that delivers breakthrough innovation in performance efficiency and TCO, we achieve comfort. Moreover we will conveniently invest more effort in our strategic relationships to build a stronger presence in key market and target the vertical customers. I expect this action will result in continued market share growth and improvement of our financial performance and now I will hand the section over to Kevin.
Kevin Bauer: Thank you, Charles. First I will address the current health of the business by providing an overview of our financial performance for the fourth quarter of 2019. I will then make a few comments about our progress on our SEC filings. As Charles mentioned earlier, we estimate our fiscal fourth quarter revenue was within the range of $825 million to $835 million. Our geographies were lower on a year-over-year basis with EMEA approximately 14% lower, Asia 19% lower and the U.S. 14% lower. Our estimated range of gross margin on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis was 14.7% to 14.9%. Our margins have steadily improved since last year and then benefited from improved customer mix, product mix and better component pricing. Operating expenses were slightly lower this quarter due to lower reserves for bad debt offset by higher sales and marketing expense. We estimate non-GAAP diluted earnings per share range, this quarter was within the range of $0.57 to $0.61 per share. We continue to generate cash and estimate cash generated from operations was approximately $81 million. After divesting CapEx of $11 million, we estimate free cash flow of approximately $70 million for the quarter. On the cumulative basis over the last four quarters, we estimate free cash flow with approximately $259 million, this quarter our cash conversion cycle decreased to 91 days, the decrease was primarily due to a 21-day increase in inventory days to 92 days. Actual inventory on a dollar basis declined sequentially. Our cash conversion cycle target remains 85 to 90 days. Now let me comment on our progress on our remaining delinquent SEC filings. We recently completed our work on the fiscal 2018 financials and have submitted them for audit. We're now working on fiscal 2019 inclusive of the efforts, finalized revenue under both the 605 and 606 revenue recognition standard. We will be under a two-year engagement with our auditors for both fiscal years 2018 and 2019 that will enable some efficiency. The team remains focused on becoming fully trained on our SEC filings. As indicated previously, we will have a Q&A session with sell-side analysts will be permitted to ask questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we’ll go first to Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead sir.
David Ryzhik: David Ryzhik for Mehdi, thanks so much for taking the question. Just a quick question on gross margins. I believe they were down from the prior quarter, I guess from around 15.5% to 14.7% to 14.9%. Just wondering what the dynamics were over there. Obviously revenue ticked up, components, prices probably tick down. So just wondering if what was driving the decline and I had a follow-up.
Kevin Bauer: Sure, no problem. This is Kevin. Last quarter when we highlighted the fact that we were in the mid-15s, we've cautioned the group that we looked like we had a very good quarter in terms of everything aligning up perfectly. And as we talked to this same question last quarter, we highlighted the fact that we were in the mid 13s not too long ago had broached 14 towards the mid-year of 2019 and we're in between 14 and 15 and so we highlighted that as being some steady progress as we went through the quarters. So we highlighted that that last quarter things lined up very, very well. So I don't necessarily think it's declined. I think that our continued progress is not perfectly linear.
David Ryzhik: And perhaps maybe you can talk about the overall server pricing environment and maybe provide an overview of just demand trends that you're seeing in the current quarter and what your outlook is moving forward? I appreciate that and then a follow-up.
Charles Liang: Yes, I mean as you know the market, this is choppy and macroeconomic that it be soft. However our solution outperform others especially wins to Cascade Lake, very big product name, yes just a bit of it. So we expect our business will continue improvement although maybe not very fast but achieving revenue is booming and especially in the new technology we have the positive sign for our business.
Kevin Bauer: Yes, this is Kevin. I think if we put our lens a little bit shorter in time as you know we've looked at this quarter's guidance certainly we are observing and are part of the macro situation that many of our competitors have already voiced out. Usually this quarter is seasonally down and when the macro conditions are like this sometimes visibility is poor. And so we have those three elements that were in our mind as we set guidance to this next quarter.
David Ryzhik: Got it, thanks. And then just last one we'd love to get an update on where you are in your enterprise efforts. This is something you've mentioned in the past as far as building up the Enterprise effort services software maybe Fortune 500 accounts just would love an update there maybe new customer account figures anything there would be helpful? Thank you.
Perry Hayes: Yes it’s Perry. So yes, UK portion of our business which includes that enterprise section was approximately 20% little bit better than 20% of the overall revenue. Within that the enterprise section that's up year-over-year by about 12%. So we're making steady progress in there with the number of customers that we have in the business that we're doing.
David Ryzhik: Thank you, I'll get back in the queue.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Nehal Chokshi from Maxim Group. Please go ahead.
Nehal Chokshi: Thanks and congrats on what I think is a fiscal year that represents records on cash from operations and non-GAAP net income. So you now have a $36 million net cash position. That's 29% of your market cap. And yes, I think on your trailing 12-month midpoint EPS that you've provided for the past 12 months looks like you're trading at 5x even net income. So are you guys willing to put that net cash to work in terms of buybacks once you're able to i.e. once the 10-Ks are indeed up to date?
Perry Hayes: Yes, I think if you look at the cash that we have now certainly we have harvested some of that from the balance sheet. I think roughly I've got $259 million working capital harvesting with roughly about $70 million of that and we know that we're going to leave that soon and we continue to grow again. So I know this is a question that came up last time, we are just going to continue to plot forward in terms of understanding what our working capital needs are as growth returns. We feel pretty strongly about that.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. And then that's great that you've estimated the fiscal year 2018 financials for finalization by your auditors. Can you confirm that the submitted financials are within the previously announced revenue and EPS ranges?
Kevin Bauer: No, I'm not going to be able to confirm that. That's not something that I addressed at this moment.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. I will get back in the queue. Thanks.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jon Lopez of Vertical Group. Please go ahead.
Jon Lopez: Hi, thanks. I’ve got a couple of clarifications first did you guys give us rather would you give us the number, the service system number please as a percentage of the business that was service systems?
Charles Liang: Yes, we said in the script -- it's Charles script that was about 81% was services, I'm sorry servers.
Jon Lopez: 81? Okay 81, I’m sorry I missed that thanks. My second question we don't really have all the moving pieces I guess but it looks like OpEx was kind of flattish sequentially. A, I’m wondering if you can confirm that and then B just any thoughts on how that ought to trend obviously you guys know that the environment's not terrific right now. So I’m wondering if you guys are doing anything proactive for the balance of the year on the OpEx side?
Charles Liang: So it was relatively flattish. We talked about the two components that wiggled. I think as we look forward, we will you know we have confidence in our long-term business -- to investment. I don't see that would have large increases in OpEx for in line with what we think needs to be investment for the future.
Jon Lopez: Got you. Okay, helpful. I was a bit surprised by one of the comments you guys made I apologize, can’t remember who made it but some version of the Cascade Lake pacing is ahead of prior generations. I’m wondering if you could just flush that out a little bit maybe not entirely consistent with we're picking up elsewhere, so I'm wondering if it's specific to your, mix your SKUs. So if you guys could just spend a second on that and then in doing so, I know you're not going to give guidance on that, I’m not asking for it but as you think about trending toward the end of the calendar year. Any thoughts on just seasonality and how applicable that may be given the environment and given what you're seeing with the Cascade Lake based projects? Thanks.
Charles Liang: Yes, thank you. I mean as you know we are technology leading company. So one-day, everyday a new technology, we had chance to grow better. Given the macroeconomic [inaudible] choppy in coming months. So we tried to be conservative. However, our Cascade Lake I think [has grown] very well especially the new platform including BigTwin, there had been continued growing (inaudible) retail savings, they start to get more and more attraction and like I just mentioned the recent results launched another tool, new platform including [inaudible]. So although it is in early stage, we believe in [inaudible] those new technologies, we have our growth [inaudible].
Jon Lopez: If I could just follow-up on that, you make a good point which is you guys have put a lot of SKUs out around Cascade Lake, it appears as though significantly more in relative basis than your peers have and so I’m wondering do you -- would you view Cascade Lake as perhaps an opportunity for maybe like disproportionate share gain with cycle like i.e. are your competitors perhaps less focused on this excuse me on this iteration or this portion of the Intel platform than you guys are?
Charles Liang: As you know there are lots of technology, kinds of ideas available including I just mentioned EDSFF and Samsung the [N81], those product line continue to gain market share. Although they are pretty new technology, but we see a [inaudible] data this year or early next year is where [inaudible] growth.
Jon Lopez: That's great. Thanks very much, I appreciate it.
Charles Liang: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini of Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead.
David Ryzhik: Hi, David Ryzhik for Mehdi again. Thanks for taking the follow-up. Just back to gross margins, I guess moving forward with lower component prices. Should we expect that to serve as a tailwind to gross margins moving forward?
Kevin Bauer: Well, I think the reduction in kind of price obviously has slowed down but we've gone through a pretty steep ramp that we went through the last few quarters. We're not going to have that same kind of ramp on a go forward basis. So I think in terms of it helping us as one of the components in terms of improving our gross margins, I don't think that that's going to be in the same sustained uplift because those prices are the reduction in those prices is flattening out.
David Ryzhik: Has that altered your decision making around inventory management as far as memory? Are you strategically adding components given the flattening out?
Charles Liang: I will have to say we have been controlled everywhere in this DRAM and then price drop periods. So we will continue to monitor very closely.
David Ryzhik: Great, and then just a question on storage. Would you be able to share the growth in NextGen storage versus traditional storage and overall storage?
Charles Liang: Yes indeed. As basically our new storage form factor and any one is basically like EDSFF. We have plenty of new platform and we have a [good feeling] about in [inaudible].
David Ryzhik: And just lastly Charles would love to get your take on what you're seeing in hyperscale or internet data center, I know that's part of the G2000 but would love to hear what trends you're seeing amongst your customers there?
Charles Liang: [inaudible] while we share with you, we continue to grow our economical scale in Taiwan and also in USA. So when our scale continues to grow in US we will be more competitive to beat those larger scale data centers. And we are preparing now.
David Ryzhik: Thanks very much.
Charles Liang: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi of Maxim Group. Please go ahead.
Nehal Chokshi: Yes, so I think you stated that you expected to have gained market share during the quarter. So what do you think the market actually did because Intel data center group revenue was down 10% year-over-year about but their enterprise and government was down 31% year-over-year and you just said that you guys were up 12% year-over-year on the enterprise side. So just maybe give us a sense as far as what you think the market did and what portions of that Intel data center group metric are probably actually most relevant for gauging Super Micro performance?
Charles Liang: Nehal, we don't always track a one-to-one request what their group does. And then again if you look at what they're tracking to and lot of it would be hyperscale et cetera and what that's not a major part of our business although we have some customers there. At the enterprise would be a separate sort of group there.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay, thank you.
Charles Liang: What I would say overall I mean we follow economics with scale compared to those, we would be more aggressively in both enterprise and super scale data centers.
Nehal Chokshi: Got it, thank you.
Operator: It appears at this time that we have no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Liang for any additional or closing comments.
Charles Liang: Thank you for joining us today and have a great day.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude the Super Micro fourth quarter fiscal 2019 business update conference call. We do appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-05-17 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Super Micro Computer Inc. Third Quarter Fiscal 2019 Business Update Conference Call. The company's news releases issued earlier today are available from its website at www.supermicro.com. 
 [Operator Instructions] Afterwards, securities analysts will be invited to participate in a question-and-answer session, but the entire call is open to all participants on a listen-only basis.
 As a reminder, this call is being recorded, Friday, May 17, 2019. A replay of the call will be accessible until midnight, Friday May 31, 2019, by dialing 1 (844) 512-2921 and entering replay pin 3378860. International caller should dial 1 (412) 317-6671. 
 With us today are Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Kevin Bauer, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Perry Hayes, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. 
 And now we would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Hayes. Mr. Hayes, please go ahead, sir. 
Perry Hayes: Good morning, and thank you for attending Super Micro's business update conference call for the third fiscal quarter 2019, which ended March 31, 2019. 
 During today's conference call, Super Micro will address the company's filings of the Form 10-Q/A and Form 10-K for 2017 and efforts to become current with its remaining SEC filings and the company's preliminary financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2019. References to any financial results are preliminary and subject to change based on finalized results contained in future filings with the SEC. By now, you should have received a copy of the news release from the company that was distributed at the close of regular trading and is available on the company's website. 
 Before we start, I'll remind you that our remarks include forward-looking statements. There are a number of risk factors that could cause Super Micro's future results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our most recent Form 10-K filing for 2017 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available from the Investor Relations page of Super Micro's website. 
 We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Most of today's presentation will refer to non-GAAP financial results and outlook. At the end of today's prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session for sell-side analysts to ask questions. 
 I'll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. 
Charles Liang: Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me first comment on our 10-K filing. We are pleased to have filed our fiscal 2017 10-K. Not able to ensure the accuracy of our financial reporting has taken more than 18 months of focus and collaborative work between Super Micro's team and our outside adviser teams.
 It became clear through this effort that some of our process and procedures had not kept up with our faster growth, the size of our company and the pace of our business. The team acknowledged that necessary internal control need to be strengthened for precise revenue recognition quarter-by-quarter. Despite all of our business, transaction result in eventual revenue. Most importantly, I would like to thank all of our Super Micro employees, partners, customers and investors for their dedication and support during this period. Although our sales effort had been certainly impacted by our 10-K filing delay and fourth negative place [indiscernible] last year. This did not affect our growth plan, and our foundation had been the strongest in our 25 years history.
 Now let me comment on the March quarter. Our third quarter revenue will be in the range of $742 million to $752 million, which is below our quarterly guidance and represents approximately 5% year-over-year deduction. The main reasons had been the key components price drop and volatile microeconomic condition.
 Earnings per share will be in the range of $0.48 to $0.52 compared to the range of $0.48 to $0.52 last year and the range of $0.57 to $0.61 last quarter. System revenue was approximately 81% of total revenue for at least last year.
 Both system and node ASP were higher year-over-year due to mutual mix of computer system. Revenue from Global 2000 accounts and accelerated computing were higher year-over-year, offsetting lower storage and IoT revenues. We are increasing our capacity for future growth. As our business continue to rapidly scale with over 1.2 million servers and storage systems shipped globally last year, increasing our production and service capacity and capability is vital. 
 We recently held groundbreaking ceremony for our Asia's Science & Technology Park expansion. It was attended by over 200 business and government officials. The new 800,000 square feet building will expand our production capacity, hardware and software R&D and our RSD2 methodology based on our resource saving design and rack scale design technologies. RSD2 will enable us to provide a more power efficient, cost effective and flexible data center Building Block Solutions to the market, including application optimized solutions for medium and small-sized customers in data centers. 
 We are also expanding our Silicon Valley stakeholders. Building 23 is the third of 5 new facilities in our San Jose Green Computing Park as the only global Tier 1 server and storage provider to manufacturing Silicon Valley. We are aware of producing to provide the best possible solutions to the most innovative enterprise, data centers, channel and cloud customers.
 Super Micro leads the industry with the second-generation Intel Xeon Scalable processor efforts. The recently launched Xeon processor known as Cascade Lake is a refresh of Skylake launch last year. The frequency of CPU and memory module refresh highlights the importance of our resource saving design to the industry and to the environment. Supporting new CPU with new technology, including Intel Optane DC persistent memory NVMe, NF1, and EDSFF. The new Super Micro X11 generation [indiscernible] put online again is offering leading performance in the base of TCO and TCE, total cost to environment, for all of our data centers around the world empowered by highly efficient, longevity subsystem that lasts over 12 years, the recent service system especially optimum for feed deployment on edge [indiscernible] and remote micro data centers.
 Our high-density systems such as BigTwin when you cannot scale NVMe storage, resource saving SuperBlade and MicroBlade have been the preferred choice for many public and private cloud customers. This low-latency, high-frequency, high-density, high-capacity system are exactly the basis of solutions for supporting the strong wave of 5G, deep learning, AI and cloud age applications. With that, I expect that this optimal server solutions will show strong growth momentum in a way our market growth time faster than the IT hardware industry average.
 In summary, we are pleased to have filed the 2017 10-K and began the process of improving our internal controls. Now we are able to focus more on the bright future and tremendous opportunities ahead of Super Micro. We are moving towards the meeting with our increased global manufacturing capacity and innovation such as the resource saving design. 
 I'm fully confident that we will continue to rule the market and to provide the best server installing solutions for today and tomorrow's demanding workload. With 25 years of strong foundation paved by the best engineering minds, enhanced operations and focused sales force, Super Micro is on the rise again. 
 For the fourth fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2019, we are guiding net sales in the range of $770 million to $830 million with great position to start our faster growth trend again. 
 And now, I will hand the section over to Kevin. 
Kevin Bauer: Thank you, Charles. First, I will address the current outlook of the business by providing an overview of our financial performance for the third quarter of 2019. I will then make a few comments about our progress on our SEC filings. 
 As Charles mentioned earlier, we estimate our fiscal third quarter revenue was within the range of $742 million to $752 million. On a year-over-year basis, EMEA was the weakest geography with a decline of approximately 21% followed by a 10% decline in Asia, offset by a 7% increase in the U.S.
 Our estimated range of gross margin on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis was from 15.5% to 15.7%. Our margin benefited from improved customer and product mix, partially due to lower sales to Asia, lower storage revenue and better component pricing.
 Operating expenses were lower this quarter due to lower employee bonuses, offset by an increased reserves for bad debt. In this quarter, we released $3.2 million tax reserve related to a lapse in the statutes of limitation in the tax jurisdiction. 
 We estimate non-GAAP diluted EPS this quarter was within the range of $0.48 to $0.52. We continued to generate cash and estimate cash generated from operations was approximately $112 million. After deducting CapEx of $7 million, we estimate free cash flow of approximately $105 million for the quarter. 
 On a cumulative basis over the last 3 quarters, we estimate free cash flow of approximately $189 million that has allowed us to pay down our loans and reach a positive cash position. This quarter, our cash conversion cycle increased to 106 days. The increase is primarily due to an increase in inventory days. Based on the methodology of averaging with the previous strong quarter, actual inventory declined sequentially. Our cash conversion cycle target remains 85 to 90 days. 
 Now let me comment on the filing of our fiscal 2017 10-K. We are very pleased to have filed our Form 10-K of -- for 2017 that included the restatement of our financial statements for fiscal 2015 and 2016. This was a comprehensive undertaking that involved a detailed and thorough examination of our historical financial statements as well as our accounting policies and procedures and our internal controls. The primary cause of restatements and adjustments was the timing of revenue recognition and certain changes to accounting for inventory and other adjustments. All the sales that we examined will be ultimately recognized as revenue.
 As Charles said earlier, in our 2017 Form 10-K, we acknowledge weaknesses in our internal controls that existed as of June 2017. I encourage everyone to fully read our report on internal controls over financial reporting where we articulate our remediation plan and progress to date. 
 We're a different company today and are better able to address our remaining challenges. So to close, I would like to thank the extended team of devoted employees who put in countless hours to achieve this goal. We are turning our attention to finishing fiscal 2018 for audit and are remain focused on becoming fully current on our SEC filings. And to our shareholders, we appreciate your support through this long process and look forward to updating you again next quarter. 
Perry Hayes: As indicated previously, we will have a Q&A session next where sell-side analysts will be permitted to ask questions. Operator, at this time, we are ready for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll first go to Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna Financial Group. 
David Ryzhik: This is David Ryzhik for Mehdi Hosseini. First off, congrats on the 10-K filing for fiscal '17. So I just wanted to understand March quarter. In mid-February, you offered the target of $800 million to $860 million and it came out materially lower. What happened between mid-February and end of March? Was it just customers pulling orders? Or just wanted to learn more about what happened there? And I have a follow up. 
Charles Liang: Kevin, you want to take that one? 
Kevin Bauer: Yes, sure. So certainly, as we went through the quarter, we saw the same softening that the rest of the industry saw. We did observe customers' behavior towards the end of the quarter. We've gotten some feedback that they were digesting purchases as regard towards the end of the quarter. And so that was news that we found in that second part of the quarter. 
 And as Charles articulated earlier, we're giving similar guidance a little bit lower as we go into the next quarter. So we think that the first half, we will have to go through a period of digestion in the industry that maybe we didn't fully comprehend 90 days ago. And certainly, we look forward to the second half of '19 depending upon how the macro situation clears up over time. 
David Ryzhik: Okay. And in storage, Charles, you touched on storage maybe a little softer. Can you elaborate on the trends there? Was it end demand driven macro or market share driven? Just would love any more info on the storage business? 
Charles Liang: I guess, the macroeconomic in the lower key components price as well as the tariff that will have some impact. At the same time, we are aggressively moving to a new NVMe storage solution, and we see some signal to recover gradually. 
David Ryzhik: Got it. And then on gross margins, it looks like a pretty sizable uptick. Perhaps, maybe you can rank the drivers, mix, components or geographic mix, would love a little more detail there? 
Charles Liang: Kevin, you want to take that one? 
Kevin Bauer: Yes. In rank order and don't know about the relative materiality of these in the way that they are ranked, but I think really the product mix in terms of storage was probably the most large impact than probably the customer mix and then lastly, the component pricing changes over time. 
David Ryzhik: And is it safe to say that we can anticipate this type of level for the June quarter and the balance of the year? 
Kevin Bauer: Yes. I wouldn't necessarily say that. I think we have a very good alignment of vectors in this particular quarter to the extent that we have continued decline in component costs in terms of memory and NVMe. We will have some continued improvement over the quarter that we have before, which was roughly about 14% or so. But certainly, I don't expect that it'll be up to this level. I think we had a great confluence of events this quarter that put us 1 quarter ahead of what we expect to do in terms of some sustainable, modest improvement in our gross margin profile that -- from our historical patterns over the course of time. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Nehal Chokshi from Maxim Group. 
Nehal Chokshi: Based on the gross margin approximation and the EPS, it sounds like OpEx was down significantly Q-over-Q, is that correct? 
Kevin Bauer: It was modestly down. So as we said, the key things were that since we had smaller revenues, we made a lower purchasing for employee bonuses, suffered a little bit in terms of some bad debt, but not significantly on a non-GAAP basis. There are a little bit more spread on GAAP basis and that we had some costs associated with the restatement as well as last quarter's activity related to responding to the article that were less in this quarter. 
Nehal Chokshi: Right. So on a non-GAAP basis, R&D would have been about flattish Q-over-Q? And therefore, that's one of the reason why you remain confident in the long-term outlook? 
Kevin Bauer: If I recall correctly, R&D grew a little bit, but it wasn't tremendous. 
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. And then there've been some reports, I think, from Bloomberg that Super Micro has asset suppliers to move their supply chain out of China, is that true? And is that -- first address that maybe. 
Charles Liang: Yes. Basically to fulfill our increasing the business, we believe that demand from the market will continue to be strong. So we are indeed growing our capacity goal in Silicon Valley, in Taiwan and in Netherlands. So it's part of our long-term growth plan. 
Kevin Bauer: Nehal, I think that those articles that you've referenced were not accurate in reporting. We are increasing our capacity, as we mentioned, in our Taiwan facility, primarily for growth as well as for the Building 23 that we're building here in San Jose, again primarily growth, for future expectation on our growth. 
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. To be clear, I think that the article was saying that Super Micro was asking its motherboard suppliers to move manufacturing out of China, not so much Super Micro's assembly and internal manufacturing capacity. So... 
Kevin Bauer: Yes. We are not going to comment on the stories. Can you have another question? 
Nehal Chokshi: Sure. You have thoughts on how HP Enterprise buying Cray may change the competitive dynamics for the high-performance computing portion of Super Micro's business? 
Charles Liang: Indeed, our overall business still are growing well. And we believe with the new Cascade Lake solution, NVMe, as you may know, we are truly build for new generation memory, NVMe, NF1, EDSFF. So we do believe our growth will be strong in the coming future. 
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. And can you give approximate performance by verticals, those being storage, data center, IoT, high-performance computing, enterprise and channel? 
Kevin Bauer: Nehal, we are not going to break that out at this time. 
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. All right. And can you provide some guidance as far as what was actually the fully diluted shares outstanding for the March quarter? 
Kevin Bauer: I will provide that to you after the call. 
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. 
Kevin Bauer: Yes, it's still roughly about $50 million or so. 
Operator: And we will take our next question from Michael Staiger with Odeon Capital. 
Michael Staiger: On the gross -- just kind of a clarification on gross margins. Are we -- should we expect a similar level? Or is there a range that you think you can provide movement into the next few quarters? And on top of that if you are expanding capacity, are you expecting, let me just say, radical shift in demand? What was the demand pressure look like into the next few quarters? 
Kevin Bauer: Yes. So as I said earlier, we certainly had a great confluence of events this quarter that led us achieve the gross margin results for the quarter. We had been, not too many quarters ago, in the mid-13s and last quarter, I think, we hit 14.1%. This quarter we had that sizable jump because of all of those events. We do have the ability to get cheaper cost for a moment in time before they are passed on to customers and the ramp and severity of those price changes could occur into the future, but maybe not to the extent. So to kind of give you some kind of a feeling for that, I think grounding ourselves in that low 14% gross margin and then modest improvement over that is really good trend that we had articulated last quarter. And I think that, that's still the case today. 
Michael Staiger: And just as a quick follow-up. Can we expect the cash flow performance to be in a similar range going forward? 
Kevin Bauer: Our cash flow is very much tied to our working capital means. So the cash flow probably will consistently work along those lines that we have today until we start to show significant growth. And when we have significant growth, we will have to reinvest in working capital in order to achieve that. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from John Lopez with Vertical Group. 
Jonathan Lopez: My first question, I think, the first half weakness is certainly understandable given the confluence of things happening around you. As far as my question for you here is, as you think about the second half of the calendar year and particularly about the Cascade Lake pipeline, can you just categorize how things are shaping up? I mean one way to look at this is Intel's implied guidance suggests a very strong second half of the calendar year. I'm wondering if that's consistent with how you guys think about the second half of the year or is there something either customer related, mix related, geographically related that may make you marginally different from that implied outlook? 
Charles Liang: Yes. We believe second half will be stronger this year for a couple of reasons, one is Cascade Lake system [indiscernible] already qualify and it's much better performance [indiscernible], which will move that aggressively. And second is the second-generation storage, NVMe including EDSFF and NF1. We see customer start to ready to move [indiscernible] and together with our 10-K delayed program had been almost fit. So that will be a positive trend for us. 
Jonathan Lopez: Excellent. My second question is, again, I'm obviously not looking for guidance here, but just conceptually, you guys are pretty comfortably outpaced the server market in aggregate for the last multiple quarters. I'm wondering as you think about, say this calendar year, would you expect to continue to be able to do that. Or again sort of same question there may be some geographical product exposure things that may make that different or more difficult in this calendar year versus the prior 2? 
Charles Liang: Yes, we are prepared for the tariff, the trailer program and continue to make our capacity, our capability and product line ready. So we believe the near future and [indiscernible] and yet to come future will be great thing for us, especially our internal control system have been tremendously improved and new SAP implement has been much stable now. So our business is getting ready for another trend of faster growth, I believe. 
Jonathan Lopez: Okay. Helpful. A quick question, I haven't gotten through the refiled document entirely, but my recollection was counter Q3 or so of 2017, China was about 10% of your total revenues. I'm wondering: a, can you just update us at least directionally on what your China exposure is right now? And b, well, I guess, b and c; b, any thoughts, I know you just referenced tariffs, but any thoughts in terms of local consumption, what if anything recent developments mean? And I guess, c, Huawei is, obviously, I believe, the fourth-largest server rendered by units as in the last quarter, not a lot in the U.S., but certainly a lot of European exposure for them. I am wondering, just conceptually, what do you think the current developments may mean for perhaps share potential for you in geographies where you overlap? 
Charles Liang: Basically, we continue to grow globally. I mean U.S.A. and Russia are our main market, but Europe, Asia, including the Japan, China, we continue our plan to global -- to grow globally. And we are much [indiscernible] forever to grow globally. 
Jonathan Lopez: That's helpful. Would you mind just updating on that China exposure specifically though? 
Charles Liang: China market, indeed, we feel nothing really has changed. So we just continue to rollout stable plan and our partnership there also is stable growing. 
Kevin Bauer: John, our China exposure can be in any quarter somewhere between 10% to 15% of the overall revenue. As you know, the March quarter, there is a lot of seasonality with the China's lunar New Year, et cetera, that impacts our revenue for China. 
Jonathan Lopez: Sure. That's helpful. So my very last question, I understand that -- I don't understand entirely, but it sounds like there's clearly been some working capital held on the cash balance, and I think you guys started to get a bit more proactive on some of those metrics. At the moment you've got over $160 million of cash on the balance sheet and I realized, what you are, I think, effectively telling us is that, that's going to reflect around a little bit as working capital trends up, but I'm wondering just in light of events over the last 2 years or so, any higher appetite for things like share repurchase or some amount of capital return or is that tables until we get some level of visibility into what maybe more sustainable free cash generation looks like? 
Kevin Bauer: Yes, I think we had a good run over the course of the last 4 or 5 quarters. And as you said, we've paid more attention to it. We have been able to drive cash flow. I think we need more time to make sure that we go to a few cycles to get a real confident and grow our cash flow and then I think it would be only some later date that we would look to think about those things as being potentials on the table. But at the moment, we don't foresee any repurchase plans that we would take to the Board or suggest to them. 
Operator: And it appears at this time, we have no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Liang for any additional or closing comments. 
Charles Liang: Yes, thank you for joining us today, and have a great one. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude the Super Micro Third Quarter Fiscal 2019 Business Update Conference Call . We do appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you.

Most of today’s presentation will refer to non-GAAP financial results and outlooks. At the end of today’s prepared remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session with sell-side analysts. I’ll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me first of call comment briefly on our second quarter performance. Our second quarter revenue will be in the range of $915 million to $925 million, which surpass our quarterly guidance and represents approximately 9% year-over-year growth. It is our 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Our growth momentum in three market segments continue with gain in Global 2000 Enterprise, Storage and desperately the Computing. Computer system revenue was approximately 82% of total revenue, up 16% year-over-year, driven by higher ASP growth continued. We’re pleased to the growth – continue the growth of our business this quarter both in the Data Center and the age despite a macroeconomic challenges. Super Micro is rare producing to drive continue on the revenue growth and win market share as we did this fiscal quarter. Our fiscal year today total revenue approximately 23% ahead of last year, in line with our traditional growth trend. Our Global 2000 business continued to show strong performance with 16% growth year-over-year. Our Global 2000 business utilized a entire Super Micro Computer encompass in compute, storage, accelerating the computing, networking, managing this ROI and service. Last quarter, our achievable rate, which is grew significantly and how our Twin Family grew 28% year-over-year, substantially supported by our midstream products. We’re consistently trends in our management ROI and service opening to provide additional value and revenue based through our customer total life cycle. I would like to remains top quality, our resource saving system, which is ability to deliver superior total cost of ownership TCO along with the use environmental impact will have significant interest with the private companies. We continue to invest in our resource saving solution improving this aggregate system and research and development on Pentium lifecycle in closures past type and ROI subsystem. This technology we have our customers stays on both hardware and on the cost, where reduce IT with which lower our total cost improve environment TCE in their data. Storage grew 24% over last year, comprising approximately 26% of total revenue. Our Petascale remain of full-fledged NVMe only storage service delivered a industry-best performance in latency, higher and bandwidth according to next generation based technology such as U.2, Samsung NF1, Intel Ruler and EDSFF, form factor SSD. Super Micro enables the software defined storage market with optimized high performance storage systems, unlike other competitors who offer higher cost with proprietary over hedge. We are excited to see many industry leaders adopted this new over hedge technology offering a real time to value advantage to their next generation roadmap. In machine learning and artificial intelligence, we see a strong growth accelerated computing applications, continue to grow, and making new possibility in both the marketing detail and scientific verticals. We also manage additional optimized market for GPU system in numerous phone tech designed to accelerated data center capability and cloud computing and [indiscernible]. Super Micro’s new NVIDIA HGX-2 with SuperSever supporting NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs with over 80,000 core delivering a niche performance of up to 2PetaFlop for AI and machine learning. Looking ahead to new engineering developments and growth opportunities. Last quarter, we begin seeding the upcoming future generation Intel Xeon Scalable processors to key customers, that we begin later in the quarter. We launched 30 programs for those new Scalable processor along with Octane PC for system memory. We have received very positive initial reaction from customer field and we anticipate the upcoming server replace cycle, we are prepared for the revenue growth for Super Micro in the upcoming quarter. As the market moves to 5G, Super Micro is uniquely positioned to address solution from [indiscernible] to the cloud. We expanded our selection of compact IoT service solution to address a wider range of verticals including networking, communications, security and industry automation operates with wide new module, network edge prefer, of course up to 36 network calls, and it is used for network function virtualization and totally defined networking SDA. There’s a put on market below CPU cut and market below LPGN within AI and accelerated computing to 5G. In summary, we achieved an important milestone this year, delivering 10% order wise in systems according to industry reporting. We will continue to gain next year with our resource-saving acknowledge to save cost of hardware producing cost, while improving their overall TCO and TCE. With our U.S. headquarters and the manufacturing and global scale, we are uniquely position to gain optimized design and competitive – our faster growing and large system verticals such as cloud, AI and 5G. We are also focusing on hardware technology decision for both compute, the new second generation Intel Scalable processor and storage including NF1, Ruler and EDSFF. [indiscernible] large scale design win. This momentum will prepare Super Micro to power growth of it’s large scale in 2019. And now, I will hand the section over to Kevin.
Kevin Bauer: Thank you, Charles. First I will address the current health of the business by providing an overview of our financial performance for the second quarter of 2019. I will then make a few comments about our progress on our SEC filing. As Charles mentioned earlier, we estimate our fiscal second quarter revenue within the range of $915 million to $925 million. With that results, we have exceeded our revenue guidance range over my tenure for the past three quarters. Our customers continue to grow their business with us and drive digital transformation using Super Micro’s cloud and edge portfolio. On a year-over-year basis, you may enjoy the highest growth approximately 28% followed by the U.S., which grew approximately 11% offset by a decline in Asia-Pac of approximately 11%. Other regions grew approximately 23%. Our estimated range of gross margin on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis was from 13.9% to 14.1%. Our margin benefited from improved customer mix, partially due to lower sales to Asia and lower provision for excess and obsolete inventory. Operating expenses were higher this quarter related to product development materials, employee bonuses, audit fee and a provision for a bad debt. We estimate non-GAAP diluted earnings per share this quarter within the range of $0.57 to $0.61. We continue to generate cash and estimate cash generated from operations was approximately $42 million. After deducting CapEx of $4 million, we estimate free cash flow of approximately $38 million for the quarter. On a cumulative basis over the last three quarters, we estimate free cash flow was approximately $114 million. That has allowed us to pay down our loan, and reach positive cash position. This quarter, our cash conversion cycle increased to 96 days from 92 days in their prior quarter. Day sales outstanding decreased slightly, while inventory days increased. Our near term target remain from 85 to 90 days. We are guiding net sales for the third quarter in the range of $800 million to $860 million. We are announcing normal business trends in every fields from sizable business renewals that existing customer. We believe we are back to business as usual. Now let’s turn into progress we are making on our fiscal 2017 10-K. If you recall, we concluded last quarter that restating prior periods was necessary, as we announced in our current report on Form 8-K filed November 15, 2018. Since then we have worked diligently and the company has achieved significant milestone in this process. We deliver a draft of the fiscal 2017 10-K with restating financial statements from 2015 and 2016 to our independent auditors in late January. They are reviewing the draft 10-K and are working to complete their integrated audit. As a result of our conclusions, our independent auditors continue to perform more testing of our accounting analyzes and internal control assessment. We are working closely each day with our independent auditors to complete the remaining audit procedures. Our internal audit team is developing a prioritized remediation roadmap to address the material weaknesses from our internal control assessments. We continue our procedures on fiscal 2018 financials in parallel and are making solid progress. So to close, we remain laser focused on resolving our SEC filings. We continue to build industry-leading technology solutions for a data hungry world. We’re excited for the rest of 2019 and beyond. As indicated previously, we will have a Q&A session, which sell-side analysts will be permitted to ask questions. I would like to remind you that your question should be directed to the business update that we have just provided. We may decline to answer questions relating to the audit committee investigation or the delayed filing of our 10-K because of pending litigation. Operator, at this time, we’re ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, our question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] And we’ll first go to Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna Financial Group.
David Ryzhik: Thanks so much. This is David Ryzhik for Mehdi. Just a few, if I could, Charles maybe – would you be able to give us an update on the macro environment, demand across regions, and what you’re seeing in the current quarter? And maybe you can talk about what drove the EMEA strength and then I had few follow-ups.
Charles Liang: Yes. Thank you for the question. Yes. We did observed macroeconomic and it will be choppy and we believe we have add weaker than last year. However, we saw new fallback have been very, very strong, get Cascade Lake in storage and other platform. So we believe this year, I mean, at 2019, we happy to see our growing year in term of our market share. And we are carefully observed the change in Cascade Lake. And our memory price travel well everything is under careful control from Supermicro point of view.
David Ryzhik: And one of the larger enterprise storage vendors, on its earnings call yesterday had noted some weakness with large enterprise companies in the U.S., elongated purchasing decisions, more scrutiny around buying systems. Have you seen this as well? I was just curious.
Charles Liang: Yes. From our point of view, I mean, March quarter had been very deteriorate result quarter over in the history. Well, this year, we can feel so far so good. We see all our change is – we feel really positive to us.
David Ryzhik: And on the last update call in November, you had noted that you were beginning to see some demand return from customers that initially paused after the Bloomberg article. Has this continued? have you seen an improvement from customers that initially had made a pause?
Charles Liang: Yes. We see the improvement and the business is going down, put it in normal and positive from our cutting the fee.
David Ryzhik: Great. And then just on Cascade Lake, just wondering what your expectations are. I guess from a calendar year 2019 perspective, when does this start ramping for Super Micro from a revenue perspective? And you made some interesting comments around Optane DC persistent memory, would love your opinion on how material this could be in this cycle or do you think that it really ramps in subsequent server cycles? Thank you.
Charles Liang: Yes. thank you. We believe what Cascade Lake would be a big change for Super Micro? Although we’ve started shipping our central recently now would this be not interest from customer side, because that would be the performance and as toward DC persistent memory, it’s a good way on the niche market and we have some customer really interest for those applications kind of large database and kind of a big data kind of application. We did see some customer meeting in case in that area.
David Ryzhik: And what drove the high ASP per compute node?
Charles Liang: More and more customer buy or compete with the solution, not really including or a hardware and some management sort of layout. So, because higher percentage of – much higher percentage of computer system instead of platform not to our ASP would continue to grow. And also more people move to a price, especially NVMe that also grow our ASP and this trend will continue for 2019 after this.
David Ryzhik: Great. Thanks so much. I’ll get back in the queue.
Charles Liang: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group.
Nehal Chokshi: Yes, thank you. And congrats on strong results, strong guidance. Difference between systems and components, did you give that, if not, can you?
Charles Liang: We did not, but the second – systems were 82%.
Nehal Chokshi: 82%. Great. And just to be clear, were you saying that this guidance reflects a normal seasonality or not?
Kevin Bauer: Well, certainly, it’s normal seasonality, but as we had said last quarter, we are cognizant of the macros that are out there. And so therefore we’ve tried to factor that into our thinking. We also know that customers are trying to determine, if they go for the next technology recycle or not, so that could pause their decisions a little bit. And then lastly, certainly, there are some components that are declining in value and customers’ time, their purchases sometimes around that. So those are the kinds of the themes that we thought.
Charles Liang: Yes, talking about Intel, new CPU, Cascade Lake Zen [ph] with our about April timeframe.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. Got it. And then historically Super Micro has had four to six quarters of 20% plus year-over-year growth. You guys just did that from; I think beginning of 2017 to September of 2018. And then you have sub-20% year-over-year growth and it looks like we’re looking at two quarters of that being the case, it all averages out to 20% to a 20% CAGR over what the past 12 years, which is incredible. But well, why shouldn’t we believe we are at the beginning of a digestion period at this point here?
Charles Liang: Yes. Again, this quarter, I mean on the March quarter, I guess about two major impacts, one is on memory price in fresh NVMe price drop, now as you’re aware lower Aspeed that it will beat and also sort marcoeconomic and process cascade won’t be ready then perhaps until April or May, that’s what we try to be conservative with this quarter, March quarter.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. All right. And then, let’s look at non-GAAP OpEx was up about $6 million versus Q2, it is some expenses, Kevin done not too sure if that was included a non-GAAP OpEx or not, but can you just give it a little bit more color around that Q2 uptick?
Kevin Bauer: Yes. So, I had mentioned in the call that there were expenses related to certainly our engineers, developing first products for Cascade Lake. And so that was one element of them pulling materials for that. I mentioned that we had employee bonus this year and we have this quarter rather. And we did have something unusual for the company and that we did have a reserve for credit loss, which doesn’t happen very often.
Nehal Chokshi: And what was your reason for apparent loss?
Kevin Bauer: Just a customer having problems.
Nehal Chokshi: Got you. Okay. And thoughts on how this OpEx should trend and also gross margin should trend for the march quarter?
Kevin Bauer: Yes. So certainly, the gross margin for this quarter was quite an uptick as compared to what we’ve had historically, most recently as you remember, I called about that we had customer mix that went into our favor as well as we did have a pretty good excess inventory quarter. I’m not sure that EN always going to repeat over the course of time, but do you remember that what I’ve said is that we would be trying to work on gross margin at a modest pace over time. So, this quarter, we certainly had a good one, but in the trends, we’re trying to improve modestly over roughly about 13.5% that we’ve been at for a period of time.
Nehal Chokshi: Thank you very much.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]
Kevin Bauer: Operator, I think there’s one more question on the queue.
Operator: Yes. We’ll take our follow-up question from Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna Financial Group.
David Ryzhik: Hi, thanks. David Ryzhik kicking in for Mehdi. thanks for the follow-up. Kevin, you didn’t note lower memory pricing as a reason for the strength in gross margins. Was memory a benefit to gross margins in the quarter?
Kevin Bauer: As I said earlier, it’s really customer mix. Since I’ve gotten here, we’ve done a little bit more in terms of looking at our gross margin mix by customer and our portfolio. So, we want to be cognizant of the fact of where we have margin for customers, kind of like in a banding way. And so that allows us from time-to-time, when we want to bid to win business, we do it in the context of the entire portfolio. And so, I think it’s just really looking at our customer mix a little bit more sharply, not necessarily a significant impact from memory in the December quarter.
David Ryzhik: And any reason for the tick-up in inventory days?
Kevin Bauer: Yes. We made some purchases at quarter-end that we thought were advantageous.
David Ryzhik: Great. And I was just curious on the storage and overall storage; I believe I heard 20% growth year-over-year. Any sense on, maybe the breakout within that of traditional versus NexGen?
Charles Liang: I guess both of our traditional and new generation, we’re able to grow with most of our new generation especially SSD NVMe based, we believe, it will be much higher pressure to grow.
Kevin Bauer: Yes. traditional came down a little bit and NexGen grew handsomely.
David Ryzhik: Okay, great. Any color around what drove that, that growth in NexGen?
Charles Liang: NexGen as you know, I mean, we are the fourth company to delivers order with new form factor memory to the market as U.2, Ruler, NF1 on Samsung and EDSFF exactly the market leader and that kind of go to customer have very good response.
Kevin Bauer: I think in addition to that we’ve been talking about G2000 customers and as we have now left year, some of those G2000 customers have, we have an appreciably stronger business with them then we did 12 months ago.
David Ryzhik: Great. And what percentage of overall revenue is G2000 is – I think in the past, you’ve maybe called it enterprise, but what percent of revenue is that driving?
Kevin Bauer: Yes. we’re probably not going to break that out right now.
David Ryzhik: Okay. Okay. And then last one, IDC, what percentage of overall revenue was that and have you seen any wins with new customers in the IDC space?
Perry Hayes: David, this is Perry. So, G2K that we talk about is a combination of both the IDC group that we used to talk about. And it also includes the enterprise group that we’re now talking about. So they’re actually gathering what Kevin’s already provided.
David Ryzhik: understood, understood. Thanks so much. I really appreciate the follow-ups. Thanks.
Operator: And it appears at this time, we have no further questions. I’d like to turn the call back to Mr. Liang for any additional or closing comments.
Charles Liang: Thank you everyone for joining us today, and have a great day. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the Super Micro second quarter fiscal 2019 business update conference all. We do appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you.

Perry Hayes: Good afternoon, and thank you for attending Super Micro's business update conference call for the first quarter 2019, which ended September 30, 2018. During today’s conference call Super Micro will address the company’s effort to become current with its SEC filings, the business and market trends from the first fiscal quarter of 2019 as well as the company’s preliminary financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. References to any financial results are preliminary and subject to change based on finalized results contained in future filings with the SEC. By now, you should have received the copy of the news release and 8-K filings that were distributed at the close of regular trading and are available on the company's website. Before we start, I'll remind you that our remarks include forward-looking statements. There are a number of risk factors that could cause Super Micro's future results to differ materially from our expectations.

I'll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me first of all comment briefly on our first quarter performance. Our first quarter revenue was in the range of $952 million to $962 million, which compared to our quarterly guidance and represents approximately 20% increase year-over-year. Our momentum in market vertical continues with strong growth, especially in Global 2000, Storage and AI machine learning. Computer system revenue was consistent with last quarter at approximately 34% of revenue and up 56% year-over-year. Our total ASP growth continues with higher add value sale of our industry-leading technology innovation and more high-end computer systems. Kevin will provide a more detail on our financial results. The focus of our strategy in the past few years had been our Global 2000 business, which grew 132% year-over-year. Now resource-saving architecture had been the key message of that focus, leveraging our breakthrough product and further to mark advantage to deliver significant saving to customers. We've achieved greater success story with company like NASA, Intel and many other industry leaders. The resource-saving architecture reduced TCE, total cost to the environment, which brings significant TCO saving along with environmental benefits. The resource-saving chip operate – that might operate this aggregated design enables the independent upgrade of system components, by navigating and replacing the entire hardware system realizing the customer can save up to 60% in system deflation cost and reduce IT waste up to 50%. Now resource saving between [indiscernible] could only optimize power-saving design, basically, air cooling including sheer power, and cooling could deliver power with improvement in power efficiency over traditional servers. Now on top NVMe match inside support together with the resource saving feature mixed between one of the highest volume server platform in the industry today. Without stable 1U Petascale all-flash NVMe system, that when combined with high-performance fabric and open rack scale management software can be used to dynamically provision critical assets, such all-flash NVMe, GPUs and [indiscernible] saving cost and reducing e-waste. We have a broadest portfolio of all-flash NVMe system with more than 150 system model available, making Supermicro the benchmark leader in storage. With that, Storage was again one of our strongest segments that drives revenue across multiple verticals including Global 2000 and next-generation storage. This advanced storage solution provide a real time-to-value competitive advantage for users with data-intensive workload like a Big Data, autonomous driving, AI, and HPC application against traditional SSD. We recently launched all-flash 32 hot-swappable EDSFF driver in the high-density 1U system designed to deal the way for NVMe technology partially we team there. This means that we should approve full petabyte of high-performance all-flash storage in 1U with an outstanding 30 million IOPS and 52 petabyte per second throughput. Samsung has also partnered with us to develop 1U NF1 storage server featuring the most power-efficient high-bandwidth loaded density next-generation flash technology, which is the highest storage density and gives higher performance currently available on the market. Deeper learning, machine learning and artificial intelligence that we should grow very well and was up 26% from last year. At a supercomputing conference in Dallas, Texas, this week, we showcased our cloud server based on the NVIDIA HGX-2 platform. The SuperServer 9029GP combined 16 Tesla V100 32-gigabyte SXM3 GPU, connect via NVLink and NVSwitch to work as a unified to pent up accelerator with half of terabyte of aggregate memory to deliver unmatched computing power. Moreover, our new SuperServer 6049GP is optimized for the modern AI inference. This 4U system achieves maximum GPU density and performance with the support for up to 20 NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPUs with Turing Tensor Core technology. Now let me move to other business highlights. This September, Super Micro celebrated our 25th anniversary. The Company was founded in San Jose, California in 1993, in the heart of Silicon Valley. Over last 25 years, we have grown from a Silicon Valley start to a Fortune 1000 company global leader. As we have grown, we had built our space within the city of San Jose by investing hundreds of million of dollars in local infrastructure and people and had become one of the San Jose's largest employer. We own more than 1.5 million square feet state-of-the-art facility for producing best quality product and improving production efficiency. We have also recently broken ground on a new business partner, that we are continuing extending our design, manufacturing and business across the valley. More than 70% of our engineers and employees are based in Silicon Valley and we assemble and integrate more than 60% of our servers and storage systems in the U.S. much higher percentage than any of our largest competitor. Finally, I would also like to comment on a legendary new story. We're feeling confident that recent allegation from a single publication about malicious chip supposedly being imprint on our hardware during manufacturing are not only impossible but also wrong. Over the years, we had produced millions of motherboard, 1.3 million last year alone, yet we have never been contacted by any customer with regard to a malicious chip.  Also we have never been contacted by any U.S. or foreign law enforcement or intelligence agency alerting us of malicious chip on our hardware or of any such investigation. We continue to work with our customers to address any security concerns and to ensure the quality and integrity of our products. In summary, we are still on a fast pace of growing U.S.-based manufacturer of server and storage. Our first quarter growth of 40% year-over-year is a great start to fiscal year 2019. Expanding and deepening our customer base, we saw this was significant in offering the best of quality products for trusted solution. We'll drive our continuous success.  Also, I want to thank our entire Super Micro team for staying focused on our goal. Many tech companies have been talking about digital transformation across the enterprise. Super Micro is building it every day. It has been great 25 years for Super Micro, and I am looking forward to continue our journey to bigger success. And now, I will hand it over to Kevin.
Kevin Bauer: Thank you, Perry. Thank you, Charles. Today, we issued a press release announcing our solid financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We also filed a current report on Form 8-K disclosing the Company's decision to restate certain prior financial statements.  First, I will address the current health of the business by providing an overview of our financial performance for the first quarter of 2019, and I will then make a few comments about the decision to restate those prior financial statements. Super Micro had a strong first quarter of revenue in net profit.  As Charles mentioned, we estimate first quarter revenue within the range of $952 million to $962 million. It was approximately 40% higher year-over-year and above our guidance range of $810 million to $870 million. We grew revenue in all market verticals with key markets growing significantly year-over-year. Global 2000 grew approximately 130% year-over-year. Internet data center grew approximately 150%. While non-Internet data center grew approximately 95% year-over-year. Accelerated computing was up 26% and Embedded grew approximately 30%. On a year-over-year basis, U.S. enjoyed the highest growth at nearly 45% followed by EMEA that grew nearly 50% and Asia Pac that was up approximately 30%. Other regions grew approximately 15%. Our estimated range of gross margin on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis was from 13.2% to 13.4%. Our customer mix contributed to the rebound in margin this quarter. Compensation costs increased across the board in both manufacturing and operating expense this quarter related to annual merit increases as well as performance bonuses or profit-sharing payments to non-executives. We also celebrated our 25th anniversary in grand fashion. We estimate non-GAAP EPS range this quarter was from $0.66 to $0.70, more than double year-over-year. For the first quarter, we estimate cash generated from operations was $50 million. After deducting CapEx of $4 million, we estimate free cash flow of $46 million for the first quarter. This quarter, our cash conversion cycle increased seasonally to 92 days from 82 days in the prior quarter. Both day sales outstanding due to collections and inventory days increased to position stock for the second quarter was offset by increasing days payable. Our near-term target is to stay in the range of 85 to 90 days for the cash conversion cycle. Now let's turn to the progress we are making on the fiscal 2017 Form 10-K. The company has substantially completed its testing and assessments. The day we announced that we are determined to restate prior period financials and provide an estimated adjusted amounts. We are in the final stages of preparation and conclusion, so that we will continue to work with our auditors to complete our 2017 Form 10-K. The core basis of the restatements remains timing of revenue recognition. Based on our assessments to date, the company confirms that although in our restated financials, some revenue recognized in prior periods will be recognized in the subsequent period. All revenues and customer transactions in the period subject to the restatement is valid revenue. During our review of prior periods, we also discovered additional errors relating to the classification of certain inventory. The number and breadth of the adjustment, coupled with their aggregate magnitude, was significantly enough for us to conclude that restating prior periods was necessary. Today, we believe total cash flows from operating, investing and financing have not been impacted with the exception of certain balance sheet classification errors that have been determined to have an inventory effect on cash and cash flow from operations. Based on our findings, we expect to material weaknesses over financial reporting. We have, depending on the matter, begun remediation measures to varying degrees. Along the way, we have developed stronger revenue policies, trained employees and developed new standards. There are number of remediation efforts. Let me share a few examples. We have hired senior revenue talent and grown our revenue team, implemented strong cutoff controls, including walking and shipping dock at the close of the quarter and enhancing our revenue testing. And we've revamped the sales sub-certification process at quarter-end. In addition, we have formed a new internal audit team that is conducting testing on the second half of 2018 and absorbing the transfer of knowledge from the efforts of our advisers in the process. Our efforts on completing the filings for fiscal year 2018 have been running in parallel and are well underway. We are working diligently to complete this testing and the rolling of the account conclusions from fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2018. This should enable us to have the fiscal year 2018 financials and updated assessment on internal controls of our financial reporting ready for audit, largely in parallel. Lastly, we are guiding net sales for the second quarter in the range of $830 million to $890 million. We note there is much anticipation around slowed IT infrastructure spending, and we have adjusted our guidance accordingly. Also we experienced a pause in October from some customers following the unwanted hardware hacking article. However, we've begun to see those customers returning, but we will not understand the full impact until after the quarter ends. Order to date, compared to last year, we are materially ahead on a billings and open order basis. As indicated previously, we will have a Q&A session where sell-side analysts will be permitted to ask question. I would like to remind you that your questions should be directed to the business update that we just provided. We may decline to answer questions relating to the Audit Committee investigation or the delayed filing of our 10-K because of pending litigation. Operator, at this time, we are ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. [Operator instructions] And we’ll take our first question from Nehal Chokshi from Maxim Group. Go ahead, sir.
Nehal Chokshi: Yes, thanks and congrats on an amazing quarter. 41% year-over-year growth on top of 26% year-over-year growth with prior quarter, that's massive, and 15% revenue itself. Congratulations, especially in the face of that Bloomberg Businessweek article. Could you provide some – what was the year-over-year growth for the components in revenue and the percent mix between those two? I'm sorry, between components and systems?
Perry Hayes: Yes, just one second. Nehal, this is Perry. The systems was 84% of total revenue.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. And how we should grow year-over-year?
Perry Hayes: That was consistent with the last quarter. I think probably we need to look that one up and get back to you later.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay, all right. And then Kevin, you talked about that the guidance reflects a slowing down IT environment as well as potential impact from the Bloomberg Businessweek article. So there is no potential there having been demand called in from the December to September quarter? That's also part of that weekend guidance or it's completely the first two items that you talked about?
Kevin Bauer: Well, I mean, I think there is also possible speculation that customers could have potentially ordered early to try and beat tariffs. We don't have a specific evidence of that but that could be possible.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay, thank you. I’ll get back in the queue.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We’ll take a follow-up question from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group. Thank you.
Nehal Chokshi: Thanks. All right, so the $50 million cash from operations, that's very impressive. And you mentioned that there was a 10-day increase in the cash conversion cycle, which is indeed seasonal. But I would expect that there would have been a significant consumption of cash then. And so what was the balance sheet item that did actually enable the generation of cash?
Kevin Bauer: Yes, we're not disclosing too much more. I think, one thing that has helped and I’ve mentioned this before is that our shipment linearity is much better now, so we are shipping more early in the quarter and have that opportunity to kind of collect that. So I think that's a good portion of that.
Nehal Chokshi: Got it, okay. And then finally, with respect to the 8-K that was filed that shows the ranges of likely restatement. It looks like to me there's about a net $60 million of revenue that's shifting out from those periods of fiscal year 2015 or fiscal year 2017 into fiscal year 2018 and beyond. Is that a correct characterization, I do recognize that's really only 1% of cumulative revenues, but just want to make sure I'm understanding that correctly?
Kevin Bauer: So as of late, if you're trying to understand what the impact there will be on fiscal year 2018. That will be limited to table that's shown in fiscal year 2017. And then if you recall that I mentioned that we would be continuing to apply the same procedures as fiscal year 2018, so there will be a continued roll effect.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. And then finally, if I look at the net income, that's been shifted out. That's $10 million. So if you take that $10 million divide that by $16 million, that's about – 13% net income ratio? That's much higher than what your corporate average was during those periods. So what's the explanation for that? It seems like the revenue that's been shifted out tends to the higher net income margin.
Kevin Bauer: Yes. So I think there is other elements in that reduction of income. If you remember, we said that the primary effects are related to sales as well as inventory. So to the extent that there are inventory debits, those won’t move into fiscal 2018.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay, all right. Thank you. That’s it from me. Thank you.
Kevin Bauer: Nehal, the system revenues last year in the same quarter was 75%.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And next we’ll go to Hosseini with Susquehanna.
David Ryzhik: Hi, thanks so much for taking the question. David Ryzhik here for Mehdi Hosseini. Would love to dive in a little more in storage, can you remind us what you said around NexGen Storage, what the growth rate was and some of the trends you're seeing there? And I had a follow-up.
Charles Liang: Yes, we see people really moving in NVMe [indiscernible].
David Ryzhik: Great. What was the growth rate again?
Kevin Bauer: I’m looking at my notes. I see didn't share that. It's over 50%.
David Ryzhik: Storage as a whole or NexGen Storage?
Kevin Bauer: That’s storage as a whole.
David Ryzhik: Understood. And would love to get your thoughts on the memory components and impact to margins. It seems like things are obviously easing. It was a headwind before. Just how are you guys thinking about the impact of DRAM and NAND flash pricing moving forward and the impact to your business?
Charles Liang: Yes, very good question. We expect both SSD and NVMe pricing continuing to be lower and so as DRAM, pricing to become softer and softer in the next few quarters. So from this point of view, we believe all our profit – I mean profit margin will be keeping as same as before or slightly better. However, the revenue maybe slightly lower because of that cost for memory and flash are lower. But basically there are good signs to us, basically.
David Ryzhik: Okay, great. And then just for the outlook for the December quarter. What specifically have you heard? Is it just like broader macro or is it specifically based on just some customer conversations that you have had that has resulted in the lower outlook?
Charles Liang: I would have to say it is micro business. IT industry just like I mentioned slowed a little bit over.
David Ryzhik: And just lastly, I – one of your customers in IDC for a while had announced a big acquisition in the cloud space. Just wondering if that, if you view that as an opportunity for Super Micro going forward? Just any thoughts on how that shapes up for you?
Charles Liang: Yes, I mean, for change, basically, we see how it is positive to our business.
David Ryzhik: Thank you so much. Thank you.
Charles Liang: Thank you.
Operator: And next question from Jon Lopez with Vertical Group.
Jon Lopez: Hi, good evening. Can you hear me okay?
Charles Liang: Yes.
Jon Lopez: Okay, great. Thanks. I'm wondering, you made a comment in the prepared remarks relative to – it was some reference of the orders or perhaps billings measured year-on-year that you were tracking comfortably ahead. If you remind me just flushing that out a little bit. Just what do refer and just may be some level of magnitude, just given ballpark on a year-on-year basis?
Kevin Bauer: Yes. What we were trying to share was that if memory serves me, we did roughly about $851 million in the quarter a year ago. And our guidance is slightly above that range. What we were trying to differentiate here was that given that were macro considerations as Charles mentioned as well as we've had the Bloomberg impact. The other key thing that we wanted to share is that, even though our guidance range is still within that metric as compared to last year, our quarter-to-date progress is ahead of that. And we think that it is healthy ahead, but we're not going to give our specific metric.
Jon Lopez: Okay, understood. I apologize. Is trying to communicate the business is sort of running better than what the year-on-year guidance implies and you're losing yourselves to account for macro considerations, et cetera?
Kevin Bauer: We are saying that we have better identification than last year as it relates to getting to $850 million or $860 million or whatever within our range.
Jon Lopez: Okay, understood. Second question, could you just possibly flush out a little bit the comment you made around the article? May be specifically, just may be offer a bit of a cadence like, I'm assuming that there was sort of all hand on that scramble period directly after the article, but if could you walk us how the interaction has been? And just any anecdotes or offer a little bit more detail on the idea of customers perhaps starting to migrate back, is that sort of appear to have been largely a non-issue? Can you maybe just spend a second on that? Thanks.
Kevin Bauer: Yes. So we are not going to get ahead of ourselves in that. I think we've had communications directly with customers and the way that we feel about the business is in relation to those discussions with customers.
Charles Liang: From our couple of estimate, we don't believe it happened to our hardware. So basically, we don't believe there is chip.
Jon Lopez: Understood. I guess what I'm just trying to get a little bit sense for is was there a period like a complete freeze up around sort of customer dialogue and then bought out pretty fast or was there not that? I guess, I was trying to get a characterization here that was two months out, if you guys sort of have a feel that the crux of the problem has largely moved passed you. I understand that there is some uncertainty left, but I'm just trying to get a sense of progress, between point A and point B?
Charles Liang: I would have to say, I mean, we don't believe their balance sheet and most of our key customers don't believe that too. So at this moment, we feel pretty comfortable for our future business.
Jon Lopez: Okay, understood. Last question, I apologize. On the December guide, can you just offer some qualitative commentary around that cloud vertical? It’s obviously been very strong for a couple of quarters. And I'm just wondering, are you guys factoring in some easing whether that’s project related or potentially pull forward related? Or just any characterization as to what that specific segment is doing as you go from calendar Q3 to calendar Q4?
Kevin Bauer: Yes, we don't provide forward guidance by market vertical.
Jon Lopez: Understood. Is it too much to ask just to say whether it would be up, down or flat?
Kevin Bauer: I'm not sure what you're trying to get at.
Jon Lopez: I'm just trying to get a sense…
Kevin Bauer: Basically, we believe with our macro ITP may slow down relative, basically from a lot of our vendors, our competitors and industry analysis result.
Jon Lopez: Okay, thanks. Just so it's clear what I'm trying to get. That business tends to be a little bit more lumpy and project related and sometimes travel independent macro. It's been very strong for a couple of quarters. So I'm just trying to get a sense of whether you had some temporary pause in some activity that may be contributing to what you're seeing in December?
Kevin Bauer: Assign it to macro.
Jon Lopez: Thank you very much for all the thoughts. Really appreciate it.
Kevin Bauer: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And at this time, it appears we have no further questions in the queue. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Liang for any additional or closing comments.
Charles Liang: Thank you, everyone, for today. And have a great day. See you next quarter.

The company's news releases issued earlier today are available from its website at www.supermicro.com. During the company's presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, securities analysts will be invited to participate in a question-and-answer session, but the entire call is open to all participants on a listen-only basis.  As a reminder, this call is being recorded, Tuesday, August 21, 2018. A replay of the call will be accessible through midnight, Tuesday, September 4, 2018, by dialing 1-844-512-2921 and entering replay pin 3269-159. International callers should dial 1-412-317-6671. With us today are Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Kevin Bauer, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Perry Hayes, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. And now, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Hayes. Mr. Hayes, please go ahead, sir.
Perry Hayes: Good afternoon, and thank you for attending Super Micro's business update conference call for the fourth quarter fiscal 2018, which ended June 30, 2018. During today's conference call, Super Micro will address the current state of the company's efforts to file its delinquent SEC filings, the business and market trends from the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018, and the company's estimated financial results for the fourth quarter and for fiscal year 2018. References to any financial results are preliminary and subject to change based on finalized results contained in future filings with the SEC. By now, you should have received a copy of two news releases from the company that were distributed at the close of regular trading and are available on the company's website. Before we start, I'll remind you that our remarks include forward-looking statements. There are a number of risk factors that could cause Super Micro's future results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our most recent 10-K and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available from the Investor Relations page of Super Micro's website. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Most of today's presentation will refer to non-GAAP financial results and outlooks. At the end of today's prepared remarks, we'll have a Q&A session, in which sell-side analysts will be permitted to ask questions. I'll now turn the call over to Kevin Bauer, Chief Financial Officer.
Kevin Bauer: Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon. Today is the first trading day because our very good quarterly results are overshadowed by the news of our filing status. We remain undeterred in our efforts to complete our financial reports. We have worked diligently and deployed significant resources towards completing the 2017 and 2018 financial statements, but are not able to file by the deadline of August 24, 2018. This was the deadline given to us by the NASDAQ Appeal Panel when they granted the company an exception to the listing standards requiring timely filing of SEC reports. We've made tremendous progress on this matter, having completed the analysis of specific revenue transactions identified through our audit committee's investigation. To date, our cash flows have not been impacted by our findings and no transaction reviewed by the company as part of this process has involved revenue that could not ultimately be recognized, nor have we concluded that a restatement to financial result is necessary. The question you must be asking is, why is this matter taking so long? The answer is that in order to be thorough, we're reviewing transactions near the end of each quarter for similar issues, found in the earlier testing. But particularly, as it relates to the matching of purchase order and shipping terms to the timing of revenue. As we're a high volume business, this entails locating documentation that is on-site, archive or at third-parties and reviewing thousands of revenue transactions in detail using the structured approach. There are a number of issues, however, let me share an example of an issue that has arisen in our reviews. We have from time-to-time offered free shipping to customers even though terms of our agreements with those customers, provided that the customer would arrange for its own shipping company to pick the products up at our factory shipping dock. This package had the unintended accounting consequence of converting the transaction from an ex-works transaction to an FOB transaction. If end of the quarter shipments are adjusted in this way, it can cause the appropriate date for recognizing the revenue for their shipments to slip from one quarter into the next. This is one example of what we are looking for as we review thousands of transactions. The company believes the revenue recognized for review transactions is valid revenue. The main issue is the quarter in which revenue must be recognized. We have not yet determined whether the magnitude of any timing adjustment will be material to any of our previously filed financial statements. We continue to work diligently to complete the review, assess the impact, and complete our financial statements and assessment of internal controls over financial reporting. We've engaged KPMG to assist us with our review, and we are also working closely with our independent auditor to complete the job. We appreciate the efforts of both KPMG and Deloitte. Finally, we are also working closely with the agent of our bank group to inform on the testing process as well as our progress toward completing all the SEC filings. As a result, we expect to continue to have adequate lines of credit to fund the continued growth of the company. We're not able today to project the date by which we will complete this review and file all our delinquent SEC reports, but we believe that date is not too far in the future. Thankfully, however, our business remains healthy and has grown during this time, as a result of our fourth quarter reflect. Turning to a brief overview of our financial performance during the fourth quarter of 2018, Super Micro had strong fourth quarter revenue and net profit. We estimate fourth quarter revenue was in the range of $986 million to $996 million. It was approximately 39% higher year-over-year. With this strong quarterly revenue, we achieved a fiscal year revenue of approximately 3.3 billion. We estimate fourth quarter non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share within the range of $0.75 to $0.79. We grew revenue in all market verticals with key markets growing significantly year-over-year. Global 2000 more than tripled year-over-year. Internet data center more than quintupled year-over-year and non-Internet data center grew nearly 50% year-over-year. Accelerated computing was up over 90%, embedded grew 20%, storage and channel were up 9% and 3% respectively. On a year-over-year basis, the US enjoyed the highest growth of 48%, followed by EMEA that grew 28% and Asia-Pac that was up 24%. Other regions grew 56%. Our estimated range of gross margin on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis was from 12.8% to 13%. Our customer mix primarily affected margin this quarter. We estimate non-GAAP EPS range this quarter was $0.75 to $0.79, which was a record high and almost double year-over-year. For the fourth quarter, we estimate cash generated from operations was $38 million. After deducting CapEx of $8 million, we estimate free cash flow of $30 million for the fourth quarter. Last quarter, we mentioned our effort to manage our working capital. This quarter, we reduced our cash conversion cycle to 82 days from 99 days in the prior quarter.  We achieved improvements in days sales outstanding due to collections and improved shipment linearity and reduced inventory days by being more precisely timing purchases, that was offset by reducing days payable. All in all, our business is strong and we improved performance by working diligently, concurrent on filing our financial reports. Let me now turn it over to Charles for his comments.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Despite our substantial efforts and progress to complete our SEC filings, I'm very disappointed that we denominated a filing payment. Personally, I cannot convey how much pain I feel in this unfortunate development. This, however, has not affected my confidence in Super Micro's strong foundation. In the meantime, we are achieving record high revenue and profit, and continue to introduce new unparalleled product innovation. We are committed to completing our SEC filing as soon as possible and making sure this problem will never happen again. Completion of the audit is our first big step. We have been investing to further improve our people, skill, process and to meet the highest financial standard and to meet the need of rapidly growing USA-based global technology companies. We need to make sure our infrastructure has a strong asset that accelerates our growth and deliver flawless customer experience. A change is being made and already improve our business operations. We add new management across the business and financial operations of the company. [indiscernible] and experience in large scale operations. We also add a new Chief Compliant Officer and a new Vice President of Internal Audit, and strengthened our revenue recognition team. [indiscernible] 31% in the last year, despite the disruption caused by the continued delay to our 10-K filing. Today, Super Micro's business and product technology leadership has never been stronger. Our fourth quarter revenue will be in the range of 986 million to 996 million, approximately 13% higher year-over-year, and was a new record high. With this strong quarterly revenue, Super Micro surpassed 3.3 billion for fiscal 2018. Record revenue and profit are strong indicators of our continued success of our product and market focus. We continue to expand our technology leadership with new products that deliver game-changing performance. [indiscernible] and Big Data applications. For AI machine learning, we have partnered with NVIDIA to view the most powerful platform. That combines 16 Tesla V100 GPUs and 2 PetaFLOPS SuperServer, partnered with NVIDIA in the same store. We delivered a new class of high data throughput that is [indiscernible]. That can deliver up to a petabyte of high-performance All-Flash NVMe storage in the compact 1U system and can deliver up to 18 million IOPS. I am more confident of our abilities and technical opportunities than at any time in our 25-year history. We are clearly focused on meeting our obligation for SEC reporting and operating low cost business. We have many great things going on at the Super Micro, as we continue to bring to market our new innovation. The resource facing technologies are enabling great opportunities for us, especially for the upcoming 5G transition, enterprise Global 2000, and AI machine learning. I am looking forward to sharing more of these exciting opportunities, which will be in future quarters. And now, I will hand over to Kevin.
Kevin Bauer: As indicated previously, we will have a Q&A session with sell-side analysts, who will be permitted to ask questions. I would like to remind you that your question should be directed to the business update that we have just provided. We may decline to answer questions relating to the audit committee investigations or the delayed filing of our 10-K because of pending litigation. Operator, at this time, we're ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we’ll go first to Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group.
Nehal Chokshi: Thank you and really phenomenal results. But Kevin, as you know, the stock is reacting to delayed filing and really great color on some of the examples that's going on. You made a statement at the end that you believe that the ability to file these filings is not too far away, but in the second press release today, it does say that there is still significant work to do. So, can you help bridge the delta between the verbal comment and what's in the filing -- and what's in the 8-K?
Kevin Bauer: Yeah. So, I think it is true that we still have a substantial amount of work to do. I think what we've said in terms of being able to see it in the future is that, now that we are later in the process, we actually have pretty good visibility on what it takes to remain to be able to complete the process. So that's how I would string them together is that it's one of better visibility, but there's still a fair amount to do.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. So, the process that was defined on what needs to be done to review a transaction was established relatively late, relative to when the investigation started about a year ago. Is that fair to say?
Kevin Bauer: Well, certainly as the results of the investigation came in, we were able to see a little bit more in terms of the processes that we were need to do, so certainly it was evolving.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. And just to be clear, you said, significant transactions left for review, but you've already reviewed hundreds of transactions. So, are you only a fraction of the way through, are you like 10% to 20% the way through or are you more like 80%, 90% of way through, what needs to be reviewed?
Kevin Bauer: Yes. We really can't go into that level of detail. What I can share with you is that we've taken the approach of largest transactions and are now going towards smaller transactions.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. Understood. So onto the fundamental stuff, at the midpoint for the June quarter, you had 25% Q-over-Q growth, and that's about 1,000 basis points above your typical seasonality. And you did see gross margin tick down at that Q-over-Q, so can you parse that between potential drivers of mix, component, input costs, competitive pricing, and then an upside lever that all these three should be also offsetting -- should have been volume as well. So maybe you can also comment on how much of a positive factor volume would have been, if the other three items were held constant?
Kevin Bauer: That's a lot. So, I’ll tell you that, we are certainly aware of the fact that the industry is growing. We are benefiting from that. We are happy with the significant enterprise wins that we are getting. I will share with you that as I looked at the margin mix, a lot of it had to do with just the quarter-over-quarter mix in terms of some of our customers. So some of that is related to the products that they buy, others are related to the aggressiveness sometimes that we have on larger deals. So I think that's -- those were the two primary factors.
Nehal Chokshi: Would you say that the pricing environment has become more competitive relative to a quarter ago?
Kevin Bauer: I wouldn't say that universally, no.
Operator: We’ll go next to Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.
Jake Wilhelm: Hi. This is Jake Wilhelm on behalf of Aaron Rakers. Congrats on the strong results. I was wondering if you could give me some color on what you're seeing with AMD's traction, with their [indiscernible].
Charles Liang: Yes. You can see the AMD products have been getting popular, and we ship kind of much more products than last quarter. So the change should be continued.
Jake Wilhelm: Thank you. I was also wondering if you could give me some color on Intel's Optane product and the traction you're seeing around that with Intel's 10-nanometer challenges?
Charles Liang: Yeah. We continue to ship Intel Optane technology. Again [indiscernible] people want a lower latency, kind of higher bandwidth and Optane technology provides excellent solution in that area. And we have a great product line, we’re the earliest player in the market. As to 10-nanometer technology from Intel, as of this moment, we tried to observe and overall we feel very optimistic still.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Let’s take a follow-up from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group.
Nehal Chokshi: All right. Thanks. So your midpoint guidance is down 15% Q-over-Q, which is 1,000 or 1,500 basis points more than what I'd consider seasonal. So can you give some color as far as what's below seasonal guidance? Obviously, you did have some incredible Q-over-Q growth over the past two quarters, but just wanted to make sure there's nothing more to it than that?
Kevin Bauer: No. I think, our primary view of this quarter is really seasonal, I don't think there is anything unusual as it relates to the guidance. Hopefully, we'll do well.
Charles Liang: Now, with our guidance, 810 million to 870 million, and that would be -- this quarter, September quarter, will be still a strong quarter basically.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. And non-GAAP OpEx plans for September quarter. Can you give any color there?
Kevin Bauer: Yeah. We're not giving any guidance other than revenue at the moment.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. All right. And are you going to be able to provide some color on system volume, system ASP, node volume, and node ASP for the June quarter?
Kevin Bauer: No.
Operator: We’ll go next to Jon Lopez with Vertical Group.
Jon Lopez: Hi. Thanks. I'm wondering if you can just spend a moment, because it's not really that apparent to me by the wording that you offered in the release, specifically you referenced in the second press release, the review of hundreds of transactions and then in the same sentence, the conclusion that you don't believe a restatement is necessary. So I guess what I'm hoping you can expand upon a little bit is, what exactly have you found as you've gone through these hundreds of transactions and what are the points of focus and what in that work has led you to conclude that a restatement is not necessary? And then, last part of that, what would make you conclude prospectively that one might be necessary.
Kevin Bauer: So the predominant pattern that we're seeing is that there are ins and outs across the quarters. And so, so far, they've kind of netted each other out to a great degree and that's really what the primary modus operandi is.
Jon Lopez: Okay. And could you just speak a little bit more to the progression of that analysis over the period that you've referenced, i.e., fiscal '15 through '17? I mean, is it fairly uniform across these periods or do you see more congestion in one period versus another?
Kevin Bauer: Yes, I really can't speak to that, but by virtue of the fact that there's not been significant distortions, it doesn't say that there's a big difference in the pattern.
Jon Lopez: Okay. Understood. The second clarification I was hoping you could offer is -- you don't reference fiscal '18 at all. And I understand that’s not a period that you've provided SEC filings, but are you reviewing transactions for FY18 as part of this as well or has FY18 been for lack of a better term immunized just based on some of the focus and activities that went into motion when you discovered this issue?
Kevin Bauer: Well, I can share with you that as we've gone through the year and things have come to like the investigation, we have had our eye on that as it relates to how we have estimated the quarters over ‘18. So we have incorporated some of that. We still will have to go through the transactions at the end, but we've been improving as you go so to speak.
Jon Lopez: Understood. The next question I have was just your commentary around the credit lines. My recollection and it’s a little foggy, my recollection is that there was some contingencies tied to the filing of the SEC documents. Can you just revisit that topic quickly? Are there procedures or do you have to go through separate processes on the credit side now that this deadline won't be met? And then what would be the timeframe over which those would be transitioned to outcomes?
Kevin Bauer: Yes. So the credit line, the way that it was structured is that it was a one-year term. If you remember, we closed this in April. So, therefore, it had one-year term or completion of our delinquent filings. And then upon the earlier of one of those dates, we would be able to convert it into phase II, that phase II actually allowed for an expanded credit facility, so that's the nature of it.
Charles Liang: [indiscernible]
Kevin Bauer: That's right.
Jon Lopez: No. That's right, but that could change. I mean, your access to credit could change I suppose as driving that. And it sounds like what you're saying is that you still have some amount of duration on that one-year term?
Kevin Bauer: That's correct.
Jon Lopez: Okay. Sorry, could you just remind like approximately when does that duration end?
Kevin Bauer: It's like the third week of April, I believe.
Charles Liang: 2019.
Kevin Bauer: Yeah. 2019.
Jon Lopez: Okay. Understood. And so, at that point, for whatever reason the situation is unresolved, then there would be a separate process you'd have to undertake from that perspective?
Kevin Bauer: Yeah. We're getting a little ahead of ourselves.
Jon Lopez: Sorry, just a couple of questions on the business, real quick if you wouldn't mind. Can you guys just offer a rough split between what your service systems business did in June relative to the accessories portion of the business, compared to subsystems, excuse me?
Kevin Bauer: Yeah. So our systems business was roughly about 84% in the last quarter.
Jon Lopez: Okay, 84%. And would you expect a material change in the segment splits looking into September?
Charles Liang: The systems business is still continuing to grow stronger.
Jon Lopez: I'm sorry, the systems business will continue to outgrow the subsystems business?
Kevin Bauer: You're talking amongst verticals?
Jon Lopez: No. I was really just looking at the split between the two reportable segments, you have the service system segment in every subsystems business, the other 16%, I'm just asking as we go into from June to September, are you anticipating any kind of sizable shift between those revenue buckets?
Kevin Bauer: No. It's been a slow increase towards systems, and it would continue to have that kind of movement.
Jon Lopez: Okay. Understood. And sorry the last question on the gross margin side. I think I heard what you said earlier, I guess, I'm just looking for a little bit more on trajectory. I mean, you've obviously seen some portions of the component bill of material become a little bit more favorable. Your gross margin obviously went the other way. It sounds like that was vertically related. I'm assuming that was hyperscale to an extent. But as we just think about the next several quarters to the extent that bill of materials buckets continue to trend favorably, is there a reason that you wouldn't expect your gross margins to begin to trend back up toward the mid 13's, low 14's. I mean I'm not asking you to quantify that range, I'm just saying directionally would you expect improvement as the cost side continues to be a bit more favorable.
Kevin Bauer: Modest improvement overtime.
Operator: And it appears at this time, we have no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Liang for any additional or closing comments.
Charles Liang: Thank you everyone for joining us and see you very soon. Thank you. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude the Super Micro Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2018 Business Update Conference Call. We do appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you.

The company's news releases issued earlier today and are available from its website at www.supermicro.com. During the company's presentation all participants will be in a listen only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded, Thursday, May 3, 2018. A replay of the call will be accessible until midnight, Thursday, May 17, 2018, by dialing 1 (844) 512-2921 and entering replay pin 2033-880. International callers should dial 1 (412) 317-6671. With us today are Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Kevin Bauer, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Perry Hayes, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. And now, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Hayes. Mr. Hayes, please go-ahead, sir.
Perry Hayes: Good afternoon, and thank you, for attending Supermicro's business update conference call for the third quarter fiscal 2018, which ended March 31, 2018. As announced in our press release earlier today, the company has completed the previously disclosed investigation conducted by the audit committee. In furtherance of the preparation of the financial statements, the audit committee is overseeing additional testing that the company believes is nearing completion. To date, the company's cash flows have not been impacted by the findings of the investigation or the additional testing. Additional time is required to analyze any impact of the results of the investigation and additional testing on the company's historical financial statements as well as to complete additional reviews before the company will be able to finalize its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. Otherwise known as the 2017 10-K. The company presented an updated compliance plan to the NASDAQ stock market hearings panel on April 26, 2018. And the company requested an additional exception period for continued listing of its common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, through August 24, 2018, in order for it to complete and file its 2017 10-K and subsequent delinquent SEC quarterly filings. The company is unable at this time to provide a date as to when the 2017 10-K will be filed or to predict whether the company's historical financial statements will be adjusted or, if so, the amount of any such adjustments. The company intends to file its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended September 30 and December 31, 2017, and March 31, 2018, promptly after filing the 2017's 10-K. Based on these delays, during today's conference call Supermicro will address business and market trends from the third fiscal quarter of 2018 and will discuss estimated financial results. But reference to any financial results are preliminary and subject to change based on finalized results contained in future filings with the SEC. By now, you should have received a copy of today's news release that was distributed at the close regular trading and is available on the company's website. Before we start, I'll remind you, that our remarks include forward-looking statements. There are number of risk factors that could cause Supermicro's future results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our most recent 10-K and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available from the Investor Relations page of Supermicro's website. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Most of today's presentation will refer to non-GAAP financial results and outlooks. At the end of today's prepared remarks, we'll have a Q&A session, which sell-side analysts will be permitted to ask questions. Questions should be directed to the company's business update covered in today's call. The company will not address any questions regarding the audit committee investigation or the delay in the filing of the company's 10-K. I'll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Perry and good afternoon, everyone. Let me summarize the third quarter. Our third quarter revenue will be in the range of $785 million to $795 million, which surpass our quarterly guidance and represents approximately 26% increase year-over-year. This was the sixth straight quarter of double digit -- 20%-plus growth, which demonstrates the success of our Supermicro efforts to scale our people, process and operations to support strong customer demands. On a year-over-year base, we grew in almost all market verticals, including growth of 102% in accelerated AI machine learning. 244% in enterprise, 58% in Internet, data center and cloud, 9% in IoT and embedded, 14% in channel and 15% in storage. In a traditionally soft quarter, we were able to succeed despite shortage of both minor and key components. But results could have been stronger even not for the component shortage and supply chain uncertainty. Our systems revenue reached 80% of total sales, demonstrating our customer confidence in our integrated products and total solutions. The total number of nodes shipped last quarter was up by 13%, compared to last year. We shipped over 1.2 million total units, including subsystems and completed systems in 2017 calendar year, and we are also recognized as the third largest provider of server in the world by IPC at the end 2017. ASPs of node grew 28% over last year. Due to increased demand for fully integrated systems with Supermicro qualified and validated components. Most of them notably the SuperBlade and the [indiscernible] Twin family were in high demand and contributed to higher ASPs. The Twin family was 30% of total revenue and was up 72% year-over-year. The SuperBlade was up 470% compared to last year. Other higher ASP products including rack solutions, which was up more than 300% and other systems that grew about 10%. [Indiscernible] computing has also been a priority at Supermicro and we have introduced our new resource savings architecture to further improve data center cost efficiency and environmental friendly entities. The system architectures can achieve up to 60% hardware acquisition cost savings. By the using of system [Indiscernible] cables, power supply, networking, processor modules, storage modules and cooling fans. Furthermore, resource saving systems are capable of achieving 1.5 PUE in data center to save millions of dollars in energy costs, while significantly reduce waste. More resource saving advantage can be realized in the scaled data center environment, leveraging Supermicro rack scale design, or RSD, to manage racks of disaggregate server, throughout composable storage and networking with industry standards Redfish workflow API. We have already had larger scale deployments and a design win with our strong resource saving products portfolio including a disaggregate ray and BigTwin and other products in our enterprise and large data center customer base. That resource savings technology drives dramatically improved efficiency. Increased utilization, reduced initial acquisition cost and TCO. Most importantly, it can help our mother earth because of reduced pollution and energy consumption. From the new technologies, Supermicro continues to bring numerous breakthrough innovations to the market. For storage, we've introduced a new highly configurable 1U All-Flash storage platform. Supporting the latest storage media such as [Indiscernible] Flash and the Samsung NF-1 NVMe that deliver up to 300% decrease in storage density, with significantly higher performance and bandwidth at a scale. For AI and machine learning we've introduced the broadest selection of GPU server platforms supporting NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs in both PCIE and FXM form factors. Now 4U GPU system. In particular, can support up to 8 GPU from a single root with the update NVLink, offering optimal performance in a hyper scale environment for application in self-driving car, smart-tv, healthcare, scientific research, Big Data analytics and more. On the Networking side, we are the first to introduce a wide range of 25G NIC solutions that deliver 100% better performance per dollars, backward compatibility, plus a future-proof upgrade path to 100G. Supermicro also recently announced new additions to its extensive IoT, network edge and security appliance portfolio, featuring systems based on the new SOC, System on Chip, Intel Xeon D-2100 processor, with high RAS features available in ultra-dense, lower power device. Supermicro's X11 IoT platform delivers balanced compute, storage and networking for the intelligent age and the emerging scale -- emerging cost of new 5G-enabled service. Lastly, to support increasing demands, we extend our Silicon Valley operation to over 2 million square feet, which does, when opening of Building 22 at our computing campus. The expansion allows for additional capacity for system integration and a dedicated rack integration for [CETs], powered by one of the Silicon Valley's first green source energy. At 3-megawatts, the facility features automated rack burn-in with autonomous guide robot in operation. Currently, 60 racks are built and burning simultaneously, with capacity of delivering more than 600 computer racks per month. In summary, Supermicro is continuing to execute on its Supermicro's Supermicro 3.0 strategy and drive a market share gain in total solution and direct end-user engagement with large enterprise and data center customers. Our [6th and 60th] quarter of double digit growth, despite of global components shortage, reflects our advantage of first-to-market technology and products, which will continue accelerate customer demand for Supermicro. And let me hand it over to Kevin Bauer for more financial details.
Kevin Bauer: Thank you, Charles, and good afternoon, listeners. In addition to the growth rate Charles highlighted on a year-over-year basis, I'd like to provide a longer-term view of our performance. Our success as the third largest supplier in a growing market, it's evidenced by our performance in the following areas, by comparing with the last 12 months to the preceding 12 months. In other words, the last 12 months, as of March 2018 revenue, compared to last 12 months, as of March '17. In the area of accelerated AI and machine learning, our last 12 -- our last 12 months' performance was 148% over the previous 12-month period. In Enterprise, our last 12-month performance was 162% over the previous 12-month period. In IoT and Embedded, our last 12-month performance was 19% over the previous 12-month period. And in Storage, our last 12-month performance was 28% over the previous 12-month period.  Turning to the quarter and sequential comparisons. This quarter we saw our strongest regional growth in EMEA, that was up 63%, offsetting slow performance in China due to the lunar new year holidays. The U.S. remained our biggest market with approximately 46% of revenues. Our estimated range of GAAP gross margin is from 13% to 13.2% and includes stock-based comp of 0.4 million and this quarter accelerated building depreciation expense of 2.6 million, that's related to a partial demolition of a building in our new green computing park. Without these two items, our estimated range of non-GAAP gross margin is from 13.3% to 13.5%. Despite continued component pricing pressure, our gross margin remains stable. I'd like to make a few comments in specific areas of progress made over the last quarter. In financing, we recently closed an expanded new credit facility for an amount of up to $250 million. That increased our domestic borrowing capacity by 60%. In addition, this new facility provides a conversion opportunity to expand borrowing capacity to $400 million, after certain conditions have been met. With this new source of capital, we increased our network of relationship banks and are able to invest in additional working capital to continue to execute on our long-term growth strategy. At the same time, we have exercised our organization to improve on all three facets of the cash conversion cycle, by focusing on customer collections and being more precise about payments to suppliers and the scheduling of incoming inventory materials. We immediately reduced our outstanding balance from the prior loan and that will partially offset the interest related to the loan rate increase during Phase I of the loan facility. In our sales organization, we are pleased with Don Clegg's leadership of the sales team. He has summoned the team's bench strength to step up to new challenges. He has further upgraded the team to bring enhanced professionalism and stronger strategic selling capability to bear in our efforts to win and serve our target customers. Don is emphasizing a stronger team approach, utilizing the company's technical experts, to improve customers' experience. The sales team is retooled and ready to compete and will help us fully achieve Supermicro 3.0 objectives. The SEC filings process. As we stated in our press release and as Perry articulated during the introduction, we continue to expend great effort to complete our financial statements and work with our independent auditor to complete the fiscal year 2017 audit process and ultimately file our delinquent reports with the SEC. As previously indicated, we'll now have a Q&A session, where sell-side analysts will be permitted to ask questions. I'd like to remind you that your questions should be directed to the business update that we just provided and we'll not answer any further questions relating to the audit committee investigation or the delayed filing of our 10-K. Operator, at this time, we're ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna Financial Group.
David Ryzhik: This is David Ryzhik for Mehdi Husseini. Charles, regarding the enterprise, it seemed pretty strong, 244% growth. Can you offer any more metrics around maybe customer growth? Whether that is solely in North America or globally? Just any other insights would be helpful, and I had a follow-up.
Charles Liang: Yes. In enterprises we continue to grow very strongly. Primarily as U.S. based, because of our on-site service and kind of management sort of we all ready now and we also start to extend to Asia and Europe. So, it's kind of global available now. And we anticipate the strong growth to continue.
David Ryzhik: And just on gross margins, would you be able to comment on component conditions? I guess, your estimate for gross margins suggests, maybe, flattish -- you see revenue tick down seasonally but year-over-year you grew revenue very strong and you noted that China was a little weak in the quarter. So just wondering, what hampered your gross margins from kind from growing -- from expanding more, given the volume?
Charles Liang: As you may know, DRAM and SSD price is getting stabilized, especially as SSD is slightly dropping now. So, this is we're ahead -- or looking forward at gross margin as ERP. And plus, our economical scale continues to grow, they were ahead too.
Perry Hayes: I think one other little unique item for the quarters is that we took a little bit more in E&O provision as well.
David Ryzhik: What percent of systems were new processors? In the March quarter? I think you've provided that in the past?
Charles Liang: It is 100% [indiscernible].
Perry Hayes: So, we're talking about Skylake?
David Ryzhik: Yes.
Perry Hayes: So, it looks as if -- as a percentage of revenue for Skylake this quarter was roughly about 18%.
Charles Liang: And it came from stably growing in last year.
David Ryzhik: I think it was 12% a few quarters ago, any reason why it's not accelerating further? Or you guys just think that the tail is going to be longer? Or when do we reach that 30%, 40%, 50%?
Charles Liang: I guess it's still maybe two quarters away. Talking about 40%.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.
Aaron Rakers: So, I want to go back to the component side of the equation, as you look out over the next couple of quarters. What -- you mentioned that SSD pricing starting to come down, I think your word was slightly, how are you seeing component pricing and availability play out? Not just out over the next quarter or so. But looking into the second half of the year, there's been some -- some questions about whether or not, particularly, [Indiscernible] flash and DRAM would tighten back up into the second half?
Charles Liang : Yes, as you may know, right. DRAM continues to have a certain shortage. But much better comparison than before. While -- they see kind of a pricing is gradually dropping now, so that means that the price is more than enough. However, we did see global other components in shortage, including PCB and material and all others small components like PPL. So, it was surprising. But that looks like those small components shortage may continue for many quarters to go.
Aaron Rakers: And can you quantify how much of an impact that has had on your ability to generate revenue? How much more revenue would you have generated if it weren't for some of the component shortages?
Charles Liang: I would have to say that more components global shortage had impact our revenue last quarter, even the March quarter. But looking forward, we continue to enhance our relationships and our effort to create a better relationship and a better safety inventory. So hopefully, that impact won't be too big.
Aaron Rakers: And then kind of a couple of other quick questions if I can. It looks like your cash balance continues to kind of come down here a little bit. You're definitely doing some things on the debt side. So, I'm curious of how we should think about, it looks like utilizing your revolver with -- while still having about $140 million in cash. So how am I thinking about, I guess, why use the revolver? How do I think about the capital management side for the company?
Perry Hayes: Yes, so under the new revolver as I mentioned we, upon getting funding, we actually drew down less than what our existing balances were. And what I was trying to signal to you, as we go forward is that our cash balances will probably be smaller than they had been historically. And we're going to be borrowing just in time to a greater extent so that we can mute the interest cost impact of the rate while we're in this period of where the rate is more expensive.
Charles Liang: Yes, at the same time, the group ARPU had been very stable -- stably growing, so I personally do not feel cash flow will be a pressure. So, with the new loan system and systems that are here, the cash flow should not be an issue...
Aaron Rakers: And it looks like your cash balance is more or less flat sequentially so I apologize for that misstatement. The real final thing for me would be, just remind us again as you kind of build out, it sounded like 2 million square feet of manufacturing capacity, how we should think about the company's current capacity situation relative to your systems business? Just remind us again, your total capacity in terms of what you can produce on a systems level?
Charles Liang: Yes. As you know. We have been faster-growing company from the subsystem to completed system to completed solution and now completed rack, high-speed and kind of completed data center solution. So, we have been growing very aggressively. And that's why economical scale has been always a challenge. The good thing is in all the area I just mentioned, including total solutions and rack scale, now our economic scale has been much better than before. And situation can be only better. So that's why those capacity we prepare will be a big help for our future growth.
Perry Hayes: So, Aaron, as you know prior to this additional building, which we talked about today on the call. We had a capacity in the neighborhood of $3.5 billion. And that fit nicely with the run rate that we're on. With the additional capacity, we're above that now, we're more in the range of $4 billion to $5 billion.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our follow-up from Mehdi Hosseini.
David Ryzhik: This is David again. For storage, would you be able to provide a little insight into next gen versus legacy, what the growth rates were?
Perry Hayes: Yes. So, are you talking about period-over-period?
David Ryzhik: Year-over-year.
Perry Hayes: Year-over-year. Yes. So, as it relates to year-over-year in terms of [IBC and non-IBC.] Yes. So, I think, quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year. So non-IBC, I think, enterprise, as Charles highlighted, was 244% and enterprise was like about 54%.
David Ryzhik: Sorry, I was referring to the storage business, just within storage there's legacy and then there's next gen?
Perry Hayes: I am sorry. Yes...
Charles Liang: Storage, I guess, over all, is about 15%, okay? and...
Perry Hayes: Yes, I'm sorry. Traditional up about 29% and next gen about 2%.
David Ryzhik: Okay. Any -- are you seeing anything in the market for NexGen? For the slower growth, hyper converged All-Flash, you know anything that would account for some of the softness?
Charles Liang: Yes, I guess, overall talking about next few quarters or next few years. We will continue to have a strong growth on both sides. Traditional storage and next gen. Last quarter, specifically 2% only for next gen, I guess is just a coincidence. Though overall there will be a continuous strong growth, both Traditional and next gen.
David Ryzhik: And just one for Kevin, just if you can provide an update for your cash cycle efforts, any measures that you've taken already. And when we can expect improvements to the cash conversion cycle?
Kevin Bauer: Yes. Naturally that's going to take some period of time, as I mentioned earlier, we worked on the collection side, being a little bit tighter in terms of not shipping until we saw customers become current, just basic blocking and tackling. On the payment side, we worked to tighten up when we pay customers and then, as I said earlier, we're being more precise about when we bring in inventories, so to the extent where maybe we brought in stock for the whole month in the beginning of the month, I am exercising the organization to be a little bit more just-in-time as it relates to when we bring in inventory. That's going to take some time to bear fruit. So, stay tuned.
Charles Liang: I mean as you know we are quickly grow in enterprise and enterprise, we provide total solution. That's why the cash here cycle time is a bit longer. However, we'll continue to work with our customer for kind of better payment terms and we got a very good support from some enterprise customers basically.
Perry Hayes: And we've had some suppliers help us out too with terms being a little bit longer.
Charles Liang: So overall cash flow should be safe.
Operator: Your next question will come from Michael Staiger with Odeon Capital.
Michael Staiger: Are you guys seeing any increase in RFPs for designs that incorporate GPUs or ARM-based servers? And if so, where would you expect those segments to break out in the future on a percentage revenue basis? And would they be accretive to your current programs or would they be a replacement or a substitution of like the traditional builds that you're doing? And what will the gross margin profile look like on those as well?
Perry Hayes: Big question. So, when it comes to GPU, that's included in our high-performance computing or in AI. So, we just shared that year-over-year that grew 102% so that's within our current tracking. So, you'd want to keep your eye on that.
Michael Staiger: Are ARM-based servers part of your build cycle right now or...
Charles Liang: We do not ARM-based.
Michael Staiger: That's a no?
Charles Liang: No ARM-based.
Operator: Our next question will come from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim. And your line is open. Please go ahead.
Nehal Chokshi: I've been skipping between calls so this may have been asked before but with your -- congratulations on the debt raise. And I'm wondering what kind of number one, where their other banks that actually participated in the debt raise or did they just simply indicate interest and Bank of America is responsible for all the debt that increased that capacity that you have right now?
Perry Hayes: Nehal, now I'm going to answer that question. The syndicate that we had actually was, as you pointed out was, broad. We increased a number of our relationships with a number of new banks that joined and in addition to that, I will also tell you that the commitments were oversubscribed and we had to cut back. So, it worked out very well for us. Not only did it increase the facility size but also new banking relationships for the company.
Nehal Chokshi: What kind of due diligence were they able to do, do they have full access to the investigation that was done? And then the follow-up question is, I just want clarity on what does testing mean? I'm not too sure what that means.
Perry Hayes: I'll answer the first half of that. And I'll let Kevin answer the second half of that question. So, with regard to the bank group, as is typical, they are under NDA kind of arrangements with us and so we could provide a bit more information to them than we could to investors who are not under an NDA. So, yes, a little bit more information was provided.
Kevin Bauer: In addition to that we held weekly meetings with them where we showed our cash flow and they saw how we, as a new team, managed cash and were very impressed by that. So, I think they gained comfort over the fact that our cash flow continued to be strong and came to their conclusion. As it relates to the additional testing, I'll remind you that we're not going to be answering questions about that. But it's just the continuation of the process to get our arms around all of the issues that occurred during that timeframe. So, as we said, we believe that we think we're nearing completion there and we're working in parallel with other teams to be able to our get our filings done as expeditiously as possible and we'll leave it at that.
Operator: Our next question will come from [Jon Lopez] with Vertical Group.
Unidentified Analyst: I have a couple of quick ones if you guys don't mind. The first one, the data center -- the internet data center vertical, looks like it was pretty healthy. I know the disclosures have gone a little bit all over the place but it looks like it was comfortably double digits sequentially and up, as you guys said, 58% or so year-on-year. Can you just talk a little bit about what's driving that and in particular are you seeing any resurgence in what used to reasonably large customer for you after they took a break for a while there?
Charles Liang: All our customer continued to adopt our product and we also continued to win more new customers and the key reason I believe because our green computing, followed by resource savings. So, the green computing and resource savings solutions is not just save customers energy costs, initial hardware acquisition cost. But also, I mean [indiscernible] and also kind of help our mother earth from its pollution. So, all are positive factors. And we believe we will continue to grow strongly in those areas.
Unidentified Analyst: So, it sounds like -- to rephrase what you said, but it sounds like that's a reasonably diversified kind of resurgence in that segment, is that a fair way to characterize it?
Charles Liang: Yes. Again, most kinds of our multiple like Twin and the Twin Pro and BigTwin product 9 as we're including continued growth resurgence as you describe the customer coming back and then we've had a sprinkling of new customers too.
Charles Liang: Indeed, a major impact, a negative impact in last few quarter is the shortage. Kind of memory shortage, SSD shortage followed by a small component shortage. So, we have been suffering a lot before and [Indiscernible] quarter for shortage and issue and the good thing, the situation is getting better.
Unidentified Analyst: That actually hands up nicely to my second question, which is -- I know you guys aren't going to give us explicit guidance but just conceptually, given that we're seeing a little of leveling off and some easing in memory, which is reasonably large for you as bill materials and I understand some of the problems in other places like capacitors and things like that but those I think are reasonably small, certainly relative to memory. So, I guess the thrust of my question is, as the year progresses, is it reasonable for us to see the gross margin lift from this kind of flattish range you've been in from the last three or four quarters or are the headwinds in those other buckets enough to prevent that?
Charles Liang: In terms of shortage and the component pricing, I believe looking forward, next few quarter will be in the positive side.
Perry Hayes: I think, it will be positive but modestly, I think, or I expect, that we'll operating in this gross margin range for now, not anything appreciably large but certainly now that I've been on the top for roughly about 90 days and after we get job 1 done in terms of getting our SEC filings done, we'll be able to devote more attention to developing programs internally to improve gross margin over time. And in over time, we'll look forward to sharing progress with you in that regard.
Unidentified Analyst: Two more really quick one, I apologize. If I look at the OpEx it's kind of implied in where things are shaking out, it looks like OpEx has been pretty flattish non-GAAP at about 68, 69, in that ballpark for the last couple of quarters. Is that an area you would expect to hold, in this same range or do you think as some of the facility spending and whatnot layers in that we'd expect OpEx to maybe pick up a little bit?
Perry Hayes: Well, facility spending is mostly going to be in the manufacturing arena so it will be hitting gross profit as we turn it on. But it will be at a modest pace. In terms of OpEx we're continuing to invest and hire to scale so it will have some modest up-drift as we go forward.
Unidentified Analyst: And the very last one. Just coming back to the cash really quick. I just want to understand the dynamics. Your gross cash as was noted, was up like $1 million but you drew like an extra incremental $9 million off the facilities, roughly. My question is, was that timing related to an extent? As you're getting rid of the old facility and bringing the new facility on? Or if not, kind of what drove that draw in the revolver?
Perry Hayes: That was just needed to -- for working capital and specifically to buy inventory. Recognize that we closed the new facility in April, which is after March, so there's no history there. That's why I wanted to preview for you that as compared to our current cash balances, don't be surprised in June that our cash balances are going to come down because of the fact that we're going to be much more prudent in terms of borrowing, and managing closer.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. We should see [indiscernible] down, in other words, in June?
Perry Hayes: Yes. 
Operator: Thank you. And it appears at this time we have no further questions, I'll turn the conference back over to Mr. Liang, for any additional or closing comments.
Charles Liang: Thank you for joining us today and we'll be looking forward to finish fiscal year 2018 on a strong note. Thank you, everyone. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. And again, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the Supermicro Third Quarter Fiscal 2018 Business Update Conference Call. We do appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you.

I’ll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Charles Liang: Thank you Perry, and good afternoon everyone. Let me summarize the second quarter. Our second quarter revenue were in the range of $840 million to $850 million surpassing our quarterly guidance and exceeds our long term guidance of reaching the $3 billion of run rate by December 2017. The long term investment to grow our large enterprise customer base along with our investment in global operational infrastructure, data center management software, and global service continued to increase in revenue and non-GAAP profitability. We were also able to improve our non-GAAP operating margin and EPS by increasing over side and control of our operational spending growth. In this seasonally strong quarter we achieved over 30% revenue growth year-over-year and we saw the [past supplement] throughout our quarter. We grew in all market vertical including accelerated, AI, machine learning, storage, IoT embedded, Internet data center, cloud and particularly strong growth with large enterprise customers. Our completed season business reached more than 175,000 nodes which result in an increase of our season business to approximately 77% of our total revenue. We also grew in every geography, with the biggest growth again being in Asia Pacific and in China specifically. Our performance this quarter demonstrated that our aggressive execution on Supermicro 3.0 is a great strategy to grow our business. We saw accelerated growth in design wins and revenue with large enterprise customers. Expansion in large volume sales to Internet data center and growth in our traditional channel business as well. We are also seeing a strong ramp of our new system Tesla Intel scalable process of family. The Skylake product now grew more than 100% quarter-over-quarter. With the new X11 Skylake systems, we introduced much leading innovation, the BigTwin system featuring 4 new processor node in 2U and truly a product unmatched in the industry. It is the industry's only non-comprised multiple solution that delivers the best-in-class hyper convergence and efficiency, while also supporting fuller performance 205 watt CPU, 24 DIMMs for maximum memory, All-Flash NVMe, low latency and expanded I/O flexibility. We are seeing strong growth across multiple markets with the product and we just fully enhanced the product with [indiscernible] design delivering an extra 30% performance gain in certain applications. NVMe flash storage continues to play a major role in our surface with our open traditional storage platform growing 47% year-over-year. Super Micro's new All-Flash NVMe 1U JBOF NGSFF All Flash and 1U SuperServer with support for 32 3.0 NVMe or Internet ruler NVMe or 36 Samsung NGSFF NVMe more than key product All-Flash storage capacity of previous 1U solutions and we are provide petabyte scale storage in a single 1U system. We also released new All-Flash NVMe system design for high performance storage delivering up to 18 million IOPS with latency under 10 microseconds. While orders are steadily growing large enterprise customer base, we announced that to get any certification of SAP HANA on Supermicro 2U for popular SuperServer with up to 6 terabyte of memory and All-Flash NVMe or SSD leveraging high memory processing speed and multiple core processor technology. Our SAP HANA solution is capable of running advance analytics alongside high speed transaction and get accurate real time routes. We want to partner with NASA to have expanded their research capability. To meet NASA's Center for climate simulation needs for expanded advanced computing and data analytics used to start the earth, solar system and universe. We deployed a turnkey next-scale solution already built and integrate at our Silicon Valley headquarter. The Super Micro effective base solution have expanded NASA's research capability with the combination of density, system performance and optimized cost bringing an additional of 1.5 better flow to NASA research. 11 years ago we introduced the concept of green computing with power optimize and energy efficient systems. This quarter we were pleased to take a green computing to the next level with industry first resource savings architecture that expanded green computing beyond just power savings for our overall conservation of various inter resource. The resource saving architecture contributes to a greener data center and deliver property savings in operating cost and up to 40% savings in hardware system application cost. It reduces resources consumption using versus depreciation and depreciation to more optimal performance quicker. The architecture is a beauty in key Super Micro innovations including our this aggregate MicroBlade design the resource pulling of our latest shaper and storage server product [indiscernible] and our open industry standard next scale design management are aware. We also expanded our Silicon Valley manufacturing headquarter with a new rack integration facility to support the increase capacity of rack scale deployment. The facility features one order largest clean energy, fuller autonomous rack scale integration and manufacturing size. In summary, Super Micro's momentum our strong growth increased in our second fiscal quarter of 2018 and we exceed our target for $3 billion annual run rate based on our customer wins and from pipeline business. We expect to continue this growth in the upcoming quarters. Moving forward, we will remain highly focused on executing our Supermicro 3.0 strategy and increasing the large enterprise customer base. Let me take at this time to introduce Kevin Bauer, our new CFO. Kevin joined Super Micro over a year ago as the Senior VP of Corporate Development and Strategy. Kevin had over two decades of experience in financial leadership including multiple CFO role for high tech company here in Silicon Valley. I’m looking forward to Kevin’s contribution in the success of Supermicro 3.0. Let me hand it over to Kevin for some brief comment. Kevin?
Kevin Bauer: Thank you, Charles and good afternoon listeners. For those of you who may be new to Super Micro, I have just succeeded Howard Hideshima as CFO. Let me take a few minutes to summarize my background which was provided in a press release earlier today. Prior to joining Super Micro, I was Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at Pericom Semiconductor Corporation from February 2014 until its sale to Diodes in November 2015, and thereafter, assisted Diodes with the integration of Pericom until November 2016. Prior to that, I was Chief Financial Officer of Exar Corporation from June 2009 through December 2012 and Corporate Controller from August 2004 to June 2009. Between these roles, I gained additional experience by assisting a CFO colleague in his effort to bring a company current in its SEC filings. Since January 2007, I've been at Super Micro in the role of SVP, Corporate Development and Strategy. During this period I have focused on financial planning and analysis to further strengthen our forecast capability. I now have a number of experienced financial planning and accounting professionals that have joined my team. I believe this broadly experienced talent will bring additional value when combined with the existing dedicated accounting staff with deep Super Micro experience. We announced our preliminary financial information today in today's press release which you can refer to. Looking forward, the company expects net sales in the range of 700 million to 780 million for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 ending March 31, 2018. While we work to complete our number one priority of compliance with our SEC filings, we will not be making any comments on the preliminary financial results. Again, I'm excited to work with Charles just as Super Micro is ramping and I look forward to engaging with our investor community and sharing more about our progress after we have met our SEC filing requirements. Let me now turn the call back to Charles and Perry for Q&A.
Perry Hayes: Thank you. As indicated previously, we will have a Q&A session now in which sell-side analyst will be permitted to ask questions. I would like to remind you that question should be directed to the business update that we have just provided. We will not answer any questions relating to the audit committee investigation or the delayed filing of our 10-K. Operator, at the time we’re ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will first go to Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo.
Joe Quatrochi: This is Joe Quatrochi on for Aaron. Few questions if I could, first I think last quarter you gave us kind of some details related to some of the segments growth like high performance computing, enterprise, storage stuff like that. Is there anything you could give us this quarter to help us out?
Perry Hayes: Yes, certainly we can do that. Again these are preliminary numbers, so these are our best estimates at this time. Storage was about 22% and of our total revenues and that is up about 22% year-over-year. Our Internet data center cloud vertical was over 11% and let me go on here accelerated computing again over 10% this quarter, the amazing thing about the accelerated computing is that it grew about 134% year-over-year so that’s continuing to show a lot of momentum. Our IoT and embedded was approximately 9% and that was up also about 23% year-over-year. Enterprise was approximately 7% and continues to show very strong growth based on this huge revenue base that we have for this quarter. Last but not least is our channel and that's about approximately 42% or so. There is a little bit of overlap as you know from prior times we spoken that some of our businesses captured in channel and where they do some things for some of our customers. Is that helpful?
Joe Quatrochi: Yes, that’s very helpful. Thank you. And then maybe just a follow-up to that, when we look at the due performances this quarter relative to the guidance that was laid out, how do we think about what was the underlying driver for the upside, was it broad-based or is there any particular market or partner you could point to?
Charles Liang: Overall growth will continue to be very strong other than there is some component shortage global wide. So we believe growth will be continued pretty soon.
Perry Hayes: Just would add here that as we said in Charles remarks earlier that it was very broad based. Every single vertical was up and we were up in every geography.
Joe Quatrochi: And then maybe just one more and I’ll see the floor. The management resignation that you outlined in the press release how - specially related to the sales leadership. How do we think about those relative to the audit that was just completed are those related or they're separate and then how do we think about your ability to forecast revenue kind of going forward?
Perry Hayes: So, just as you know - that we wouldn't comment on the audit committee investigation and the delayed financing 10-K and definitely we’re not at liberty to discuss anything related to the audit committee. So I’m going to have to decline your question on that, but with regard to we did announce a new person to head up our sales our worldwide sales, his name is Don Clegg, that was in the press release only today. He is a great guy. He in the company for many, many years. He is often stepped into the role when people were absent in traveling. So he has a wealth of knowledge about the company and how it operates. With regard to forecasting future, Kevin would you like to make a couple of comments.
Kevin Bauer: Yes, I think first I’d say that like most companies of our size we have a bottoms up process for forecasting and there are many players that are very savvy and very skilled in terms of doing the forecasting. That is one of the areas that I've been working on as well to kind of really focus in terms of our estimates for our top customers. So I think we have the wherewithal and the bench strength to be able to do that well in this time of transition.
Charles Liang: In past I mean in that solid four years we had been - we are prepared for Supermicro 3.0 so which is higher and change not for internal sales expertise. So our team is becoming much stronger than before ever.
Operator: And our next question will come from Mark Kelleher from D.A. Davidson.
Mark Kelleher: Congratulations on very strong revenue result, I kind of expected a little more to drop to the bottom line. Could you talk a little about gross margin, your expectations there, I know we kind dipped again memory pricing maybe worked that in. And then talk about the operating lines if you can in terms of, is there increased spending I know you said you’re going build out and you are building up the finance team a bit is there more G&A. Where can we expect some puts and takes on the operating expenses? Thanks.
Charles Liang: Basically our revenue have been growing very strong. In next couple of quarter we are continuing our stronger trend. However, our memory price still go in higher unfortunately. So net margin gross margin have been about flat, I guess like so other than that our business have been very strong and we foresee a very strong growth in the next few quarter, at the least.
Perry Hayes: I’ll just add to that, it sounds a little bit like last quarter. We had geographic mix with very strong China revenue. We continue to have product mix where a lot of our products have more component reliance to them so that impacts that. And again we're still in the Grantley lifecycle technology. So, as Charles mentioned in his comments that our Skylake grew 100% but it was also a low base. So the big part of the ramp on Skylake is still ahead of us. We said that now for the last several months that beginning 2018 we will start to see that that go higher. And then lastly - based on the report of our estimated EPS, you can probably tell from that that we did make some significant progress in terms of our EBIT margin. That was up significantly as we were able to control OpEx.
Mark Kelleher: Just one last one the tax rate with the changes in the law. What tax rate should we be assuming?
Kevin Bauer: So I think as we go forward our tax rate will probably going to be in the mid-20s or so.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna Group.
David Ryzhik: This is David Ryzhik for Mehdi. So just wanted to get a sense of deadlines that we’re working with, I think in January you filed an 8-K regarding a bank extension suggesting that you have to file by March. Just wanted to think up on that to see 5th March is really like a deadline that you’re working with for the 10-K?
Perry Hayes: David we are working as hard as we can with - in conjunction with the independent auditors to try and complete this process as soon as possible. But as we have already described at this time, we’re not able to really determine the date when that will happen. We do have a NASDAQ extension until March 13 and our bank line with Bank of America we have an agreement which we've previously announced that sinks up with that March date.
David Ryzhik: And I mean is that a hard deadline that March date with Bank of America or do you anticipate flexibility around that if you need a little more time?
Perry Hayes: David we’re not going to comment about our discussions with Bank of America at this time.
David Ryzhik: And so we came across some order from TSMC to Super Micro, there is some public filing. Just wanted to get a sense of what therefore I think it was - there was a $40 million order to Super Micro in December quarter and maybe we saw follow on orders. So just wanted to get a sense of what those order are for is that Internet data center business or not and how sustainable is that demand from that customer?
Charles Liang: Basically we don’t comment with specific customers with business condition. However I'm happy to share our big win with lots of large enterprise account had been continuing going very strong. So we do feel very positive. We will continue to grow in this segment. It’s kind of indeed many enterprise customer had been growing business with us.
David Ryzhik: And you touched on the component environment, would just love to get sense on how you see DRAM and NAND today relative to your business and how you anticipated impacting your March quarter?
Charles Liang: Yes, DRAM price continues to grow temporarily, and other components even [indiscernible] we did see some shortages global wide. Basically our growth have been much faster than the average overall industry. So we did see a shocking challenge but with getting stronger relationship with our vendor. So there are some challenges but I believe it will be okay.
David Ryzhik: And just wanted to get a sense of - there was a public discussion around the meltdown inspector vulnerabilities. How do you foresee that to impact the Skylake cycle? Do you actually believe that could actually drive some incremental refresh activity?
Charles Liang: Yes, good question. I mean our Skylake indeed grow more than double over last quarter and we did see a strong growth this quarter and next coming few quarter. So, our overall Skylake will go strong but overall next generation business is strong. So especially we have lot of embedded IoT customers. So overall our growth will be pretty smooth I believe.
David Ryzhik: And then just last one from me if you can talk about storage, I think you gave a total storage was 22% of total revenue but any sense on next-gen storage?
Charles Liang: Next-gen storage continues to grow year-over-year stably and some quarter grow more, some quarter grow less but overall next generation storage will continue to grow strongly.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll now go to Nehal Chokshi from Maxim Group.
Nehal Chokshi: Congratulations on the strong results and at least dropping some of that rather seeing the 10 million OpEx year-over-year increase result and then operating profit increase on a year-over-year basis, so that’s good to see. The guidance for the March quarter brought while relatively broad range at the midpoint and price will be done 12% Q-on-Q which is an average I think is usually down the mid single digits. So what greater levels of seasonal decline that you guys are projecting?
Charles Liang: We believe growth will be strong in March quarter even if this seasonally slow quarter but because of that shortage, I mean component shortage global wide so we try to be more conservative not over a big range 700 to 780.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. And then…
Perry Hayes: Nehal, I think just add as well, as you know - for the industry historically there's lot of seasonality in this March quarter right with the lunar New Year and some of this other events that are happening. So it’s a little bit hard to gauge with that, plus all the comments that Charles made.
Nehal Chokshi: And then what was the reason for the resignations of the sales leadership?
Perry Hayes: Nehal, appreciate your question but I don't know whether you're listening earlier. We’re not at liberty to discuss the audit committee investigation.
Nehal Chokshi: So I just point out by saying that you’re not at liberty to say that then the assumption will be that those resignations are indeed related to the audit in some way or another. So, hopefully you can give a little bit more color as far as what’s the driver here?
Perry Hayes: Again Nehal your conclusion is your own, that is nothing that we have said or discussed in any of our press releases and we are not going to discuss the audit committee investigation.
Nehal Chokshi: And then I did have one more question which is audit related but I think it's clarification so hopefully you can answer but just to be clear - what was close about the audit committee's investigation was that it was purely on the revenue recognition timing is that correct did I recall that correctly?
Perry Hayes: That is what we have said in previous press releases.
Operator: And that is all the time we have for questions today. I'll turn the conference back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you for joining us today and we're looking forward to a strong 2018. Thank you everyone. Have a great day.
Operator: This concludes today's presentation. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2018 Q1  (2017-10-26 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Super Micro Computer Inc. First Quarter Fiscal 2018 Business Update Conference Call. The company's news release issued earlier today is available from it's website at www.supermicro.com. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded, Thursday, October 26, 2017. A replay of this call will be accessible until midnight, Thursday, November 9, 2017, by dialing 1 (844) 512-2921 and entering replay pin 9330570. International callers should dial 1 (412) 317-6671. With us today are Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Perry Hayes, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. 
 And now I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Hayes. Mr. Hayes, please go ahead, sir. 
Perry Hayes: Good afternoon, and thank you for attending Super Micro's business update conference call for the first fiscal quarter 2018, which ended September 30, 2017. As previously disclosed by the company, additional time is needed for the company to compile and analyze certain information and documentation and finalize its financial statements as well as complete a related audit committee review in order to permit the company's independent registered public accounting firm to complete its audit of the financial statements to be incorporated in the Form 10-K and complete its audit of the company's internal controls over financial reporting as of June 30, 2017. 
 Based on these delays, during today's conference call, Super Micro will address business and market trends from the first fiscal quarter of 2018 and will discuss estimated financial results -- but reference to any financial results are preliminary and subject to change based on finalized results contained in future filings with the SEC. By now you should have received a copy of today's news release that was distributed at the close of regular trading and is available on the company's website. 
 Before we start, I'll remind you that our remarks include forward-looking statements. There are a number of risk factors that could cause Super Micro's future results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2016 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available from the Investor Relations page at Super Micro's website. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Most of today's presentation will refer to non-GAAP financial results and outlooks. 
 At the end of today's prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session, which sell-side analysts will be permitted to ask questions. Questions should be directed to the company's business update covered in today's call. The company will not address any questions regarding the delay in the filing of the company's 10-K. 
 I'll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. 
Charles Liang: Now thank you, Perry, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me summarizes our first quarter. [indiscernible] Super Micro launched last quarter. We have sped up our already strong growth in revenue market share and brand name value. Our new quarter results come from that we had been and continue to be the first tier, growing tier 1 [indiscernible] provider, capable of delivering first-to-market product innovation at a global scale with quality management software service and support. In addition to strong revenue growth, we kicked off several strategical product in strong margin technology market that should deliver significant future growth. 
 Earlier in the quarter, we launched our complete portfolio of new X11 products based on the new Intel Xeon Scalable processor or Skylake family. This launch was the product of over 2 years of effort with about 2,000 of engineer. As a result, we were ready at the launch with over 100 product offering. The X11 business quickly ramp with new systems representing 12% of all processors shipped. 
 The key to the successful ramp was the breadth of our portfolio and our time-to-market advantage with powerful new technology built into the new platform. We will continue to leverage our new product advantage in the coming quarter and ramp continuously. 
 Computer system accounted for a great portion of our business at approximately 75% of our overall revenue. The growth of computer systems, it has been driven by new technologies, such as support of [indiscernible] NVMe, higher memory density, accelerated computing, higher TDP CPU support, and higher bandwidth connectivity. These technologies benefit from our in-house engineering, design and dedication to provide a customer with higher performance, visibility and quality solutions. Moreover, our computer system carry a higher average sales price ASP and strategically increase the opportunity for additional management software and global service revenue. 
 Delivering superior product and data center technology to the market continues to be the cornerstone of our company. And this quarter, we saw strong performance for our twin -- [indiscernible] systems, storage, especially our All-Flash NVMe [indiscernible] platform, GPU-accelerated computing and blade servers. Our new multiple-node BigTwin architecture is one of our fastest-growing new product launched ever. The BigTwin provide both higher density and efficiency than traditional [indiscernible], while supporting state-of-the-art features, including All-Flash NVMe, 24 DIMM memory and the highest-performing Intel Xeon Scalable processors. Our [indiscernible] NVMe server also perform well. With more expandability option, they are optimized for high-performance storage, analytics and in memory application. For example, the 2U [indiscernible] NVMe [indiscernible] platform delivered a record-breaking 80 million tie ups. The design utilize an unbroken architecture allowing [indiscernible] PCI-E band to the [indiscernible] NVMe SSD directly for uncompromised direct connection to achieve maximum storage performance. 
 In storage, which accounted for 20% of our overall business, we saw strong customer demand. Our capacity maximizes top-loading storage portfolio, is anchored by our 90- and 60-bay storage server and [indiscernible]. To strengthen our portfolio and increase customer choice and efficiency, we have started high-volume promotion -- high-volume production the 45-bay storage server with NVMe caching option and high TDP CPU support. 
 We have also launched a new category of 1U peta-scale products. The All-Flash NVMe 1U [indiscernible] of flash; and the 1U SuperServer which support for 32 hot-swappable NVMe SSD providing high-performance capacity at petabyte scale. Think about that, 1 petabyte in 1U. The new 1U NVMe storage server and [indiscernible] provide a shared storage pools. They are definitely becoming the [indiscernible] hardware infrastructure for demanding big data analytic applications, such as autonomous driving and real-time financial fraud detection. Up to 12 host can be directly connect to the 1U pool NVMe storage. Alternatively, for customer who want to deploy an NVMe [indiscernible] solution, hundreds of host can be connect to the high-performing NVMe storage over [indiscernible] or PCI-E. 
 After the market shifted to more flash-based solutions, we see much stronger adoption of NVMe in both hybrid as well as All-Flash solution, especially for OpenStack, cloud and hyper-converged solution. Coming this quarter, our new [indiscernible] NVMe solutions will be first-to-market with truly NVMe-optimized server that provides higher density bandwidth and improved latency for big data analytics and rack scale solution. 
 We are especially excited about our high-performance and accelerated computing business, which was approximately 11% of our total revenue for the first quarter. And that grew more than double from last year. We continue to develop our accelerated computing product line targeting machinery, people learning applications and AI. As we indicated last quarter, we are working with a number of automotive companies for autonomous driving technology, which require accelerated computing as well as NVMe storage solution to achieve that desire compute, IOPS and latency combination. 
 Most recently, Super Micro announced optimized solution for the new NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU. Our 4U system support up to 8 V100 GPUs with [indiscernible] design for HPC cluster and the hyperscale workload. We also have a single root complex PCI-E design that support up to 10 GPU in 4U, which has shown dramatically improved GPU peer-to-peer communication and performance compared with previous generations. For even greater GPU density and scalability, our 1U solution that support up to 4 V100 GPUs per system or up to [indiscernible] GPU per standard rack. 
 Other than GPU, we have developed a brand-new blade solution featuring the new [indiscernible] family accelerator from Intel. Our 8U SuperBlade can now be configured with a mix of Scalable processor blade and [indiscernible] blade optimized for AI training and inference application. 
 The [indiscernible] blade is just a start of our [indiscernible] learning engagement into this exciting market. By partnering with the leaders, the leading accelerated computing and semiconductor company, we develop next-generation [indiscernible] learning and AI platform. We had invest additional engineering resource this quarter to codesign these solution. They will present us with significant market opportunity going forward. 
 We also launched a new 6U SuperBlade solution designed to future-proof our customers' investment. Codesigned with Intel, that disaggregated architecture enable us independent upgrade for CPU and memory, I/O, storage as well as the power and cooling. This low initial acquisition cost and TCO, the new architecture provide higher return on investment by supporting market for generation of independent technology refresh. 
 SuperBlade and BigTwin system are optimal block for rack-scale solutions. Along with the Super Micro RSD software, our rack-scale total solution empower cloud service provider, [indiscernible] and Fortune 500 company to develop their own agile-efficient software-defined data center. The solution deliver up to 54% improvement in cooling power efficiency, preventing [indiscernible] business solution [indiscernible] with open industry standard [indiscernible] and Redfish API designed to lower management overhead in large-scale data center and other enterprises. 
 Before ending, let me circle back with some detail on business side. From a geography perspective, North America remain consistent at more than 50% of our business. Asia Pacific, our second-strongest geography, [indiscernible] growth, and we expect that it will be more than 25% of our overall business, with China making up the majority. India was lower as seasonal effect impacted result. 
 Here are some updates on a few other key market verticals for this quarter. Our IoT embedded activity continue to represent approximately 10% of our business. Internet data center, IDC, improved due to more project wins, and we expect it will be approximately 10% of our business. The overall enterprise business continue to grow. Our China business is in the range of low-to-middle 20% of our business. 
 Super Micro's momentum of strong growth continue into our fourth quarter of 2018. We recently expect to report revenue for the quarter at the top end of our original revenue guidance, which will be about 29% growth from last year. 
 As I had mentioned earlier, we are initially multiple -- we have initiated multiple high-potential platform codeveloped with our strategic partner during this quarter. We have invest our resources to embrace this new opportunity ahead of us, and we will eventually execute our strategy. 
 In summary, we have begun fiscal 2018 on a strong note. With our fiscal quarter revenue continuing the momentum of the past several quarters, we are fully prepared for the ramp or the technology transition that is just beginning. With our industry-leading product line now shipping, we are on track for a $3 billion run rate in the December quarter. 
 Let me now turn the call over to Perry. 
Perry Hayes: Thank you, Charles. As indicated previously, we will have a Q&A session in which sell-side analysts would -- permitted to ask questions. I would like to remind you that your questions should be directed to the business update that we have provided. We will not answer any questions related to the delayed filing of our 10-K. 
 Operator, at this time, we're ready for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll now take our first question from Alex Kurtz with KeyBanc Capital Markets. 
Alexander Kurtz: I have to say, this is unusual circumstances. So I have to say the questions I need to ask are related to the business update. And hopefully, you can touch on them at some level. What gives you the confidence to provide forward guidance into the current quarter given that the audit committee is reviewing transactions that may still be part of the business today? 
Perry Hayes: Thanks very much. It’s a good question. We feel pretty confident that in the revenue number that we've indicated today, that it is within a prudent range. And even though we really can't provide a total -- a complete baseline yet because 2017 isn't finalized, we do feel confident that within this range that we've indicated, at $675 million to $685 million, that it is an appropriate range. Going forward, we are continuing with the momentum of business that we've had in the past, if you look back to starting with last December, and it's based on a great mix of new customers and market verticals that are all growing, as you can see from what we've reported. So we feel pretty confident. In addition, as we've been saying for several quarters as well, we think that we'll end the calendar quarter at a $3 billion run rate. And Charles has just reiterated that in his remarks. 
Alexander Kurtz: Okay. I'm just still a little confused by why even go out on a limb and provide December guidance. But maybe just it’s something you just can't talk to right now. 
Perry Hayes: Well, we do think it's important to provide trend and the growth indicate -- direction of growth. And it was also indicated in the current quarter number, which we just provided you as well. 
Charles Liang: But again, I just mentioned, I mean, $3 billion run rate should be achievable. 
Alexander Kurtz: Last question for me. Can you give us any update on your CFO, Howard, and his status with the company at this point? 
Perry Hayes: Howard is working very hard on the issues related to the filing of the 10-K at this moment. 
Operator: We'll now take our next question with Brian Alger with Roth Capital partners. 
Brian Alger: Just for a clarification point, reading through the release today and kind of going back to the delay that we're incurring here on the 10-K. To be clear, what's being evaluated by the audit committee isn't whether or not the revenues were real, but rather not the documentation around which period the revenues were recognized, is that the case? 
Perry Hayes: Brian, as indicated, we're not going to answer any questions related to the filing of the 10-K. 
Brian Alger: Okay. I thought it was in the press release today, but okay. Coming back to the update with the margins that you guys -- the range of gross margins that you're providing, it would indicate that we're not seeing any improvement in the dynamics from the memory side of the equation. Is that still what's pressuring the gross margins at this point? Or has there been a shift from product dynamics? 
Charles Liang: Yes. I guess the memory price [indiscernible] is a little busy this quarter again. But this mean we have a good inventory, I mean, in good relationship with vendor. So we believe business will continue to grow smoothly. 
Brian Alger: Okay. And are you continuing to purchase inventory in advance for key customers, specifically memory inventory? 
Charles Liang: Kind of mixed. But the overall memory is in good condition -- in a good condition, I would like to say overall. 
Perry Hayes: Yes, I think you can safely say what we've been doing over the past several quarters, we are continuing to do that. We are continuing to hold inventory going into the quarter. It's still not enough to see us through the whole quarter. As we've talked with investors previously, we are, during the quarter at some point, still acquiring inventory to support our customers. 
Brian Alger: Okay. And then other than the efforts going on surrounding the review here with the 10-K, has there been any structural changes that would affect the operating expenses of the company outside of normal business operations? 
Perry Hayes: No. Everything is pretty much the same. We have a great business. We wanted to do this business update because it is a very strong business. It is growing very strongly, and we have tremendous opportunities. As Charles mentioned in his remarks, we have great opportunities in new projects with some of the leading semiconductor companies for revolutionary designs in AI. And as a result of that, we've added some engineering headcount in the previous quarter. That is one of the things that impacted operating expense somewhat this quarter. But no, everything is on track. 
Charles Liang: Especially the new processors, Skylake and NVMe product line have been all ready to ship. So we believe that business will continue to grow strongly. 
Brian Alger: Okay. And then just one final one. You mentioned IoT and data center each being roughly about 10% of the revenues. I'm curious how the storage business was tracking for the company, given how fast that's been growing for you guys over the past couple of quarters. 
Perry Hayes: Yes. Storage business was -- we called out here that it's greater than 20% of the entire business. It continues to grow. In fact, I think you could say this quarter, we actually saw our open storage grow a bit faster based on some of these designs, which Charles called out, especially the top load, especially some of the NVMe solutions, they're growing very rapidly. 
Charles Liang: For the big data, AI, HPC, and we have been growing very well, including storage solution in -- for that market. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will now take our next question from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group. 
Nehal Chokshi: There will be no presentation or CFO commentary because, obviously, the results have not been audited yet, correct? 
Perry Hayes: That is correct. 
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. Charles did run through some of the vertical data. But Perry, could you just run through that one more time real quickly. I'm sorry. 
Perry Hayes: Yes, sure. We said storage was greater than 20% of our business; accelerated computing, also 11% -- well, greater than 11%. IDC was approximately 10%; IoT, again, approximately 10%; channel was sort of mid- to low 40% of total business; and enterprise was approximately mid single digit, call it, 5%, a little bit more than 5%. 
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. And the reason why there's more uncertainty around what channel was as a percent of revenue is that that's where the uncertainty resides with the one revenue recognition. Should be getting done. Is that a correct interpretation? 
Perry Hayes: Again, Nehal, we're not going to discuss anything related to the 10-K filing. 
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. All right. And then what's the status of the repurchase program? I believe that it was -- it expired, and I think you repurchased close to $20 million at one point in time. Would you guys consider opening this back up? 
Perry Hayes: Yes. Your numbers are correct. We did have it. It expired in June. It has not been reauthorized. 
Nehal Chokshi: Would you consider -- is there a proposal on the table or consider proposing it to restart the repurchase program? 
Perry Hayes: It always is something that's in the back of our minds. At this point in time, we want to invest in our business to provide a greater return for shareholders. 
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. And it sounded like inventory is up Q-over-Q and, therefore, your cash conversion cycle continues [indiscernible] year-over-year. Because you're making sure that you have enough inventory to fill up demand, is that correct? 
Perry Hayes: That is not correct, Nehal. We haven't provided that level of detail. Cash was up somewhat higher than it was on the previous quarter, and that's pretty much the extent of what we've provided. 
Operator: We'll take our next question from Mark Kelleher with D.A. Davidson. 
Mark Kelleher: I know one of those numbers -- Perry, could you reiterate what percent of revenue was Skylake? I think that was given out. 
Perry Hayes: Yes, what we talked about is X11 platforms. X11 platforms represents the Skylake. It also represents -- a portion of it is UP and DP. But overall, X11 represented approximately 12% of the total processors that we shipped out. 
Mark Kelleher: And those processors typically carry higher gross margins, those systems, correct? 
Charles Liang: Basically. 
Perry Hayes: Yes, they do. 
Mark Kelleher: So that didn't seem to help the gross margins in the quarter. Is that being offset by the memory issue being a little bit more significant? 
Perry Hayes: We can't -- well, as we've been saying, we're very much in the early days of the ramp, okay. And the DP portion of X11 is still ahead of us. We'll get a little bit more here in the December quarter, probably improve quite a bit. And then really, the ramp starts to take hold beginning the calendar year. As you know, that would be about 6 months since the launch, and that's when -- there starts to be a lot more allocation in the market. Gross margins, overall, were impacted by seasonal utilization, impacted by geographic mix with strong China revenue, impacted somewhat by product mix to more component-reliant systems. Plus, we're also in this transition phase from a mature Grantley life cycle technology to the new Xeon Skylake family, and so that's still going on. And yes, there were some continuing component pricing at SSD and DRAM issues. 
Operator: It appears at this time we have no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Liang for any additional or closing remarks. 
Charles Liang: Thank you for joining us today, and we're looking forward to talking to you at the end -- in the end of this quarter. Thank you, everyone. Have a great day. 
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude the Super Micro First Quarter Fiscal 2018 Business Update Conference Call. We do appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you.

All of those documents are available from the Investor Relations page of Super Micro’s website. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Most of today’s presentation will refer to non-GAAP financial results and outlooks. An explanation of our non-GAAP financial measures can be found in our slide presentation or in our press release published earlier today. In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today’s press release and in the supplemental information attached to today’s presentation. I’ll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Perry and good afternoon everyone. Let me summarize our fourth quarter. Revenue was $717.9 million. It’s 36.9% higher year-over-year and 13.7% higher than the previous quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $20.7 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.39 per diluted share compared to $0.38 last quarter and $0.20 last year. Non-GAAP EPS was 95.8% higher year-over-year and 20% higher than last quarter. Super Micro achieved new record high in revenue in the first quarter which exceeded our expectations. Throughout fiscal 2017 our revenue was over $2.5 billion or 14% better than last year. We’ve been remarkable is that our fiscal 2017 second half achieved 37.6% growth over last year, which is many multiples higher than the overall industry and any other Tier 1 vendors, which owes our payments rates and some momentum as we finish the fiscal year and coming to a major technology refresh cycle [indiscernible] Super Micro had built a strong foundation, for sustaining high gross, while maintaining profitability every quarter for 24 years. Over the last three year, we’ve made a significant investment in global production capacity operations, system solutions, quality, global service and management software. In [indiscernible] our engineering staff by over 60% bringing the most advanced in both these portfolio of server and storage, global service and management software to the market. [indiscernible] investment that we are proud the new Supermicro 3.0. Supermicro 3.0, positions us as the fastest growing Tier-1 IT Infrastructure Provider, capable of delivering first to market product innovations in global scale with quality, management software, on-site global and support to engage our rapidly growing enterprise customer base. The record high revenue in strong second half growth rate is a direct result of Supermicro 3.0 investment. With the major fundamentals in place and the new Skylake product portfolio shipping, future investment and expenses will begin to flatten driving improved profitability moving forward. The new foundation of Supermicro 3.0 has three potential locations worldwide totalling almost 3 million square feet with a [indiscernible] including dedicated record ever integration, conversion and validation combined this capacity can support annual revenue up to $5 billion on hardware alone. In 2017, we ship approximately 1.2 million [indiscernible] storage notes in systems and subsystems based on [indiscernible] estimates. This [indiscernible] is about 10% over our total number of system shipped in the world. Under Supermicro 3.0, our direct deals in large enterprise datacenter storage and people learning is expanding rapidly. We are seeing significant engagements with large enterprise customer than they were before from Fortune 100 companies in technology, social media, [indiscernible] news media, cable companies and Internet [indiscernible] We are engaging earlier for technology optimization and providing more total solutions which include complete assistance software integration, quality reputation, solution optimization, datacenter management software and global on-site service. Our channel strategy have also evolve under Supermicro 3.0, we are working more closely with the channel and with their end user to provide solutions that drive the demand to our partner. Channel accounts for 46.3% of our revenue, and we are becoming most strategic vendor to those channel partner [indiscernible] which contributed to the gross of total system revenue of 74.3% over a quarter. Under Supermicro 3.0, we also continue to invest in new product [indiscernible] to enhance our [indiscernible] solutions including our [indiscernible] of over 100 new X11 system model based on Intel [indiscernible] solutions have been optimized to deliver the high scale performance and efficiency from the new Intel processor, and latest NVMe innovations especially All-Flash and hybrid NVMe solutions. We have seen our major design wins for our new 2U 4-node, BigTwin offering in both service provider and as well as major storage OEMs. The advanced feature of our 2U 24 OEM [indiscernible] at a major financial service company. And we have seen triple digit growth in our GPU and [indiscernible] system sales. We continue to be the leader in NVMe technology, and our [indiscernible] over NVMe sale is growing dramatically. We secure several new major [indiscernible] specific robotics such as autonomous driving based on our NVMe competitive advantages. NVMe storage delivers orders of [indiscernible] better performance than Chetana Solutions. And we have over 18 optimized designs available [indiscernible] capable of delivering 16 million IOPS, which is one of the highest performance system in the whole industry. Our global service and management software have [indiscernible] for the Supermicro 3.0, they provide a Tier 1 experience for our server and storage portfolio. They create a stronger and deeper relationship with our customers. Our service teams will [indiscernible] with our enterprise customer to provide a high-speed performing in most efficient datacenter in the world. Our software tools are tightly integrate into our customer environment [indiscernible] We achieved $50 million of [indiscernible] from global service and management software in 2017, that is nearly doubled from the last year. And we will continue to double yearly moving forward. With higher margin and amortize the new model to increase profitability overtime. Looking forward, the combination of new Intel [indiscernible] processor and advanced in NVMe product make this technology transition cycle, one with our most significant activity for our customers [indiscernible] Along with the Supermicro 3.0 we have the foundation, the product and a strong pipeline to maximize the advantage of this technology transition. We believe that fiscal year 2018 will be one of the strongest years in Super Micro’s history. For more specific on our fourth quarter, let me turn it over to Howard.
Howard Hideshima: Thank you, Charles and good afternoon everyone. I will focus my remarks on earnings, gross margins, operating expenses and similar items on a non-GAAP basis which reflect adjustments to exclude stock compensation expenses. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statement of the company in today’s earnings release and in the supplemental details in the slide presentation and prepared remarks accompanying this conference call. Let me begin with the review of the fourth quarter income statement. We end fiscal year 2017 with a record $717.9 million in revenues for the fourth quarter and executing on a number of strategic investments which put us in a very strong position as this technology refresh cycle begins. The investments across a number of markets vertical and geographies around the world have expanded our business opportunities with the host of new and existing customer especially in large enterprise. The increase in revenue from 36.9% from last year was wide spread across our market vertical such as enterprise, storage, IoT and accelerated computing this was offset in part by a decline in IDC. On a geographical basis we had strong growth in Asia, Europe and the U.S. The 13.7% sequential increase in revenue was primarily driven by strength in Asia in particular China once up 35% as we leveraged our growing partnerships. Non-GAAP gross margin was 13.5% down, 60 basis points from 14.1% a year ago and down 50 basis points from 14% sequentially. The decrease from prior year and sequentially was primarily due to cost increases in memory and SSD. Higher sales in Asia, which is typically more competitive and sales of later-stage life cycle products also affected margins. Offsetting these work, operational efficiencies which we have made over the past few years through capacity utilization, economics of scale, more complete solution sales with higher content of software and services. Non-GAAP operating margin was 4.5% up 1.4% from 3.1% a year ago and 20 basis points from 4.3% sequentially. The increase from prior year and sequentially were primarily due to growing revenue at a faster pace than our operating expenses. This year, we plan to tighten our headcount and expense control with the goal of continuing to leverage the investments we have already made and drive improved profitability. Net income was $20.7 million up 100.2% from $10.4 million a year ago and up 2.1% from $20.3 million sequentially. On a non-GAAP basis fully diluted EPS was $0.39 per share which was up from $0.20 per share a year ago and up from $0.38 per share sequentially. The number of fully diluted shares used in the fourth quarter was $53 million. Turning to free cash flow on a sequential basis. Cash and cash equivalents, short and long-term investments were $115.9 million, up $5.4 million from $110.5 million in the prior quarter. In the fourth quarter free cash flow was a negative $12.3 million primarily due to an increase in AR of $92.1 million offset in part by a decrease in inventory net of accounts payable of $40.9 million. The increase in AR was primarily due to higher revenues which accelerated late in the quarter. Overall cash conversion cycle days was 95 which is five days lower than the prior quarter and four days higher than the same quarter of last year. We didn’t expect the SSD and memory issues to last through the end of the calendar year. Now for a few comments on our outlook. As we enter the first of fiscal 2018 we see strong growth opportunities from a technology refresh cycle which is just started. We continue to see strong traction for our leading solutions in our growing customer base especially in large enterprise. Lead factors coupled with the investments we’ve made in our future, during the past few years gave us strong momentum to accelerate our growth in the many market verticals we serve as exhibited by last quarter’s result. Therefore the company’s currently expect net sales for the quarter ending September 30, 2017 in the range of $625 million to $685 million. Assuming this revenue range the company expects non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.30 to $0.40 for the quarter. At the midpoint this will represent an increase of 24% in revenues and 9% in EPS from the prior year. We continue to expect to reach the $3 billion run rate by the end of the calendar year. It is currently expected that the outlook will not be updated until the release of the company’s next quarterly earnings announcement with subsequent development. However, the company may update the outlook or any portion of it at anytime. With that let me turn it back to Charles for some closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Howard. We finished the fiscal year 2017 with record revenue and a strong momentum. Supermicro 3.0 provides the foundation and product to take advantage of this cycle of technology transition. We believe that fiscal 2018, will be one of the strongest year in Super Micro’s history. Operator at this moment we are ready for questions.
Howard Hideshima: Operator we’re ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we’ll take our first question from Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna Financial Group.
David Ryzhik: Hi, thanks. This is David Ryzhik for Mehdi. Just a few, if I can. The midpoint of your revenue guide comes out to around – down 9% Q-over-Q. Just wondering what are the factors there particularly given that year entering the product cycle. It assume that it would be ramping in the September. And I had a follow-up. Thanks.
Howard Hideshima: This is Howard. Yes, we are seeing the ramp up as Skylake has launched here. Again, [indiscernible] is seasonally soft and this guidance is about seasonal averages.
David Ryzhik: Got it. Thanks. And regarding gross margins if memory pricing was at 50 to 70 basis point hit and I assume it was 70 basis point that would have put your gross margins at 14.2. Given the, in this June quarter, given the high volume, the favorable mix from the lower Internet data center just would have thought that the normalized gross margins would have been higher perhaps from capacity utilization. Can you just talk about what are the other impacts, I mean you mentioned Asia business. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on some of the mix and if there is any kind of pricing impact that we should be aware of in gross margins. Thanks.
Charles Liang: Last quarter memory and flash drive grew more than 20% and this quarter although we – we are seeing an improvement may grow 10% for [indiscernible] for the whole quarter I hope. So the price stay high. And that is why I would try to be conservative because for memory, for flash [indiscernible] are a known factor.
Howard Hideshima: And David I’d just add to what Charles was saying with regards to that. Again, we are at the end of the technology refresh cycle when coming into a brand new technology re-price cycle, specifically at the end of the cycle, our pricing gets a little bit more less on the older technology.
David Ryzhik: So, I guess the fall would be, should we expect given that you are entering the product cycle the favorable margin impact, should we expect QoverQ increase in gross margins.
Howard Hideshima: Yeah, I think the ramp for the product cycle we talked before, it is probably going to be towards the December quarter, you need to take some about two quarter to ramp the production through the new chip set.
David Ryzhik: Great thanks so much.
Operator: And we will move to our next question from Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Joe Quatrochi: Great this is Joe Quatrochi on for Aaron. Thanks for taking the questions. Just want to go back to the September quarter guide and I am talking about that it is a above seasonal, Skylake is going to be more of a kind of December quarter story a ramp, what’s the kind of outline driver for the September guide?
Howard Hideshima: Well I think we talked about a number of new engagements and new customers that we are bringing on board. The pipeline is very strong.
Joe Quatrochi: Okay, maybe can you talk a little bit about the growth you are seeing in China, what is driving that. Is it the FiberHome, partnership or something else.
Charles Liang: Our presence in China continue very be strong and we see a – we continue to gain a major partner, I mean especially a large corporate. And in that channel we will continue.
Joe Quatrochi: Okay, thanks and then just a quick follow-up on the gross margin. I don’t think, and may be I have misheard the manufacturing utilization this quarter and do you think this could be the bottom of gross margin as we kind of work through some of those memory cost increases.
Charles Liang: We hope so.
Joe Quatrochi: Okay thanks.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Brian Alger with Roth Capital Partners.
Brian Alger: Hi guys good afternoon, congrats, on a good finish to the year. Obviously a bit challenging with memory, but congrats on the loss. As you look in, the full year outlook that you talked about, Super Micro 3.0, is there this diversification that you are now enjoying. Is there a new focus for the company or is diversification really the name of the game as we look going forward.
Charles Liang: As you may know, we invested a lot, as we grew a 50% engineering manpower. That is why we are able to implement our global service team and we are able to make our service reach, datacenter management, completed already, so we saw those were the I mean now we are able to continue to gain enterprise customer. In 3.0 [indiscernible] last clear miles we won more than 50 large enterprise customers. And deeply we believe we will accelerate the large enterprise customer gaining.
Brian Alger: Fantastic.
Charles Liang: That mean we are truly integrating function like a two tier one company that which are including service.
Brian Alger: Great. And I guess maybe a technical question, obviously storage was a really strong performer in this past quarter up significant both year-on-year as well as sequentially. In the past, historical Super Micro, you guys just ship a lot of JBOD basically. Now you guys have a very strong NVMe product portfolio and I’m curious as to how much of your storage solutions you stays are solid state as suppose to rotational?
Charles Liang: And [indiscernible] we grew above 30% in that storage season mobile and looking forward, we will continue to have a strong growth in storage, especially NVMe space.
Brian Alger: Is there a margin difference? If we normalize availability of NAND and DRAM. Howard, is there a significant difference in terms of the gross margin that you guys can generate with these NVMe systems as suppose to the JBOD systems that you were shipping previously?
Charles Liang: Basically NVMe new technology, we suppose to have much better product margin. However with that shortage, and to sent them we need a much more area because we are past growing. So in that case, we had to pay premium to gain more [indiscernible] that’s why margin was low.
Brian Alger: Understood, understood. Okay, thanks, again and congrats on the rest of the year.
Charles Liang: Thank you.
Howard Hideshima: Thanks.
Operator: We move to our next question from Nehal Chokshi from Maxim Group. Please go ahead.
Nehal Chokshi: Thank you. Two part question here, so first memory in NAND flash prices increases for the quarter. How much was that you guys on a [indiscernible]
Howard Hideshima: Well, as Charles mentioned earlier, we saw price decreases around 20% within the commentary, I said there has about 50 to 70 impact to our gross margin.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. So I guess there is some customers that did not have some price increases where you had an existing fixed price contract. And what I’m trying to get as – there must have been some percent of customers that didn’t accept that. And A, what is that percent? And then B, it seems like, given the incremental revenue and then there was actually negative incremental EPS as from what I can help that this was actually a negative incremental gross margin business, because they didn’t accept the increase price. So be that correct, and then if that is correct, why honor that contract?
Howard Hideshima: Again, the contract was in place, its expiring [indiscernible] you negotiated. So again, we had contracts there. We terminated, but again, the volume went up and a bit hard as a bit as we mentioned earlier in our press release. We’ll soon rectify.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. If I may, I’d like another follow-up questions different topic. At ASP per server really took off, it was up 43% year-over-year and 13% Q-o-Q, what’s behind its a significant increase?
Howard Hideshima: Well, I think like I said we’re getting to more full boxes now. As Charles mentioned we’re building our breadth into the large enterprise that customers and if I’m customers are taking full boxes, previously if you remember our server solutions category had everything from barebones to complete services. So we’re now moving or into complete server solutions including software and support services.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay, thank you. I’ll move back into the queue.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Alex Kurtz with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Alex Kurtz: Hey guys, can you hear me okay?
Howard Hideshima: Okay, Alex.
Alex Kurtz: Great. So just on some numbers here, what was the utilization rate in the quarter and what was the merging growth - the emerging storage growth rate?
Howard Hideshima: Yes. For the quarter, Alex is about 60% on utilization.
Alex Kurtz: Yes. And the emerging storage names.
Howard Hideshima: Let me get back to you on that question.
Alex Kurtz: Okay. My question for you guys is just taking a deeper look here at the datacenter business obviously IBM was a tough comp in fiscal 2017, but even if you I think exclude IBM out of the datacenter number was down this year in fiscal 2017. Historically the VIP, IDC business has been a good business for you guys. So what’s going on there, even if you exclude IBM, it looks like things were down in this business. Can the IDC business grow in fiscal 2018 at the same growth rate of, as the rest of the business?
Charles Liang: Yes, indeed in that year, including last quarter. The major challenge to us was the [indiscernible] memory. Not just the price is high, but in lot of case, we had to wait for memory. So now we have memory and some time we had to wait for refresh. So that kind of intact and that is why we have the best IDC, Internet data center especially.
Alex Kurtz: So memory specifically held up projects, Charles, is that right?
Charles Liang: Your question, again.
Alex Kurtz: So memory impacted your ability to deliver on some opportunities in the IDC space. Is that what you are saying?
Charles Liang: The part of the reason, but also because memory price is so high and as you know, internet data center probably margin basically more than it. That is why we had a bad sale in the area.
Alex Kurtz: And just last question for Howard, I can get this story somewhat later, but what would stop you from getting back to like a 15% plus gross margin exiting fiscal 2018? Howard, assuming that memory does play out the way, you think it does, and you have Skylake kicking in which always is helpful for you. So why can’t investors think about a 15% plus kind of gross margin on exiting fiscal 2018, if all of those things were to come together?
Howard Hideshima: I think it is largely to – while we talked about here Alex, we have got a numbers of investors, who will be leveraging our investments, being better on our operational efficiencies and operating expenses. So obviously there are a lot of opportunities for us to grow that margin, through this year, especially with the refresh cycle coming. With regard to – I just sort back on the next-gen it was about 76% year-over-year growth.
Alex Kurtz: And do you guys still feel that you did have that one vendor that was acquired by a larger OEM. And that hasn’t impacted your emerging storage business yet?
Howard Hideshima: No it hasn’t and probably it would provide with great opportunities going forward as well.
Alex Kurtz: To work with that OEM that acquired that company? Okay. Great, thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We’ll take our next question from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group. Please go ahead.
Nehal Chokshi: Yes, thanks, one housekeeping question, number of subsystem units?
Howard Hideshima: Number of subsystem units was 1 million and 14 thousand.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay, thank you. And then of the 15 new large scale enterprise customers in fiscal year 2017? Having them began in this quarter?
Howard Hideshima: Can you say that again, Nehal, sorry.
Nehal Chokshi: So in the presentation there was a statement that there was 15 new large scale enterprise customers during fiscal year 2017. I’m wondering how many of those actually started deployments within this June quarter?
Charles Liang: Indeed, [indiscernible] in last year and half of them started move on June quarter. But because it’s new, that’s why the [indiscernible] is not at stake. That’s kind of relatively a very decisive though.
Nehal Chokshi: And so, effectively I think it was like a 170% Q-to-Q increase in the enterprise revenue, was that because of all these new large scale customers? Or was it because you had significant expense from the large scale customers?
Charles Liang: I tell you majority from the new enterprise customer.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. And then for those that become Super Micro customers at the beginning of the fiscal year. How has cadence of orders been from those large scale customers?
Howard Hideshima: Definitely the opportunities are there and we’re going to be – as we said earlier the pipeline is very good for us.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay, great. Congratulations, this is very encouraging.
Charles Liang: Yes. Last year, we won our belief more than 15 large enterprise customer. This year, we will see at least win another 25 or 30.
Nehal Chokshi: Great, thank you.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead.
David Ryzhik: Hi, thanks. This is David Ryzhik again for Mehdi. Just to clarify what percent of total revenue in the June quarter did enterprise make up? And just giving your target of adding 30 new customers in fiscal 2018, do you have a target of what percentage enterprise can make up of total revenue exiting of the fiscal year?
Howard Hideshima: Yeah, for the quarter, David, it was about 8% of total revenue.
David Ryzhik: Great. And do you have a target exiting 2018?
Howard Hideshima: We haven’t put a target out there. Certainly, we have plenty of opportunities.
Charles Liang: Hope…
David Ryzhik: Great, great. And just related to that, how can we think about OpEx for fiscal 2018. You do have an aggressive strategy to add onboard these new customers. I would assume they would require some investment yet in your Slide deck you talked about that leveling off. Just how can we think about the quarterly OpEx has moving through fiscal 2018?
Charles Liang: Yeah, as in that chart we share with you, last three years we grew about 450 engineers, we have to [indiscernible] and pretty much that whole program already established. So, looking for where we don’t have to reinvest actual – don’t have to invest the much actual in business.
David Ryzhik: Got it. And so, I guess, so no real need to invest in sales and marketing capacity to onboard additional enterprise customers or you feel like you have what you need?
Charles Liang: Pretty much ready.
David Ryzhik: Okay.
Charles Liang: We have to hire more…
David Ryzhik: Got it. Thank you. Yep, thank you.
Charles Liang: Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Aaron Rakers: Yeah, thanks for taking the questions and I apologize for kind of joining a little bit late, maybe some housekeeping things, first. How should we think about the progression of the tax rate?
Howard Hideshima: In the prepared remarks, this is a new concept for us a bit, Aaron. So, if you look at our website, you’ll see some prepared remarks for us. It will say that we do a guy for this quarter of about 34% on the tax rate.
Aaron Rakers: Yeah and I guess I was asking more beyond that. I mean it’s been somewhat volatile quarter-by-quarter over the last few quarters of understanding it somewhat driven by the international mix et cetera. But, again, I think it’d be helpful to understand with some of the taxing that you’ve done over the last few quarters. What should we be thinking about the progression? Where do you think a normalized tax rate kind of falls out for the company?
Howard Hideshima: Well, I think, certainly it gets better for us as we go further and go further offshore and increase our foreign presence, but at this point we’re guiding 34% for the quarter.
Aaron Rakers: Okay, fair enough. If you didn’t have the constraints this last quarter on DRAM and it sounds like maybe a little bit of flash or SSDs as well. What do you think your revenue could have been? Was that a $20 million impact, $30 million, $50 million? I am just kind of trying to frame how constrained you are in terms of fulfilling the potential incremental revenue?
Charles Liang: Indeed, it’s a lot more.
Aaron Rakers: I missed that. Was that a lot more?
Charles Liang: No…
Howard Hideshima: Aaron, I think we’ve done a very good job of managing this – going through the process of managing this. And so quite frankly we’re delivering orders and doing it. We saw some acceleration at the end of quarter, but again we’ve done a very good job of managing this, going through the process of managing this. And so quite frankly, we are delivering orders and doing it, we saw some acceleration at the end of quarter, but, again we’ve done a pretty job of managing the SSD and memory storage.
Aaron Rakers: Okay, how much strategic inventory on memory and SSDs are you carrying, coming out of this quarter? I think last quarter you talked about kind of $63 million of excess inventory.
Howard Hideshima: It is similar to that.
Aaron Rakers: It’s similar to that, okay. And your current view of when things kind of get back to normal, where you’re executing in a quarter that there is no supply constraints. When would you expect that to be?
Howard Hideshima: Yeah, we are not – we haven’t forecasted that, for say, we said [indiscernible]
Charles Liang: It’s in the memory and [indiscernible] program wherever you are getting better from now. So by December quarter, I believe we will see some significant improvement.
Aaron Rakers: Okay. And then the final question, I am sorry to go back to it, but the Enterprise business growing as much as is pretty remarkable. As that grows and becomes a larger potential piece of your overall business. How do we think about the margin profile of that vertical, relative to the margin of your overall business today? It’s relative to the 13.5% growth. I was just trying to understand, how we should think about that, given what should be a positive mix of software, maybe servers that are wrapped around that traditional enterprise customer base?
Charles Liang: Yeah, basically enterprise customer are more [indiscernible] so the margin will be slightly better at least.
Aaron Rakers: Yeah. Okay, any – is it 200 basis points?
Howard Hideshima: We haven’t quantified that, Aaron it’s going to be better.
Aaron Rakers: Okay, fair enough. Thank you very much.
Operator: And that does conclude today’s question-and-answer session. Mr. Liang, at this time, I’d like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you for joining us today and we look forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you everyone, have a great day.
Operator: And this concludes today’s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today's press release and in the supplemental information attached to today's presentation. I'll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Perry and good afternoon, everyone. Let me summarize our third quarter. Revenue was $631.1 million. It's 18.5% higher year-over-year and 3.2% lower than the previous quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $20.3 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.38 per diluted share compared to $0.48 last quarter and $0.36 last year. It was 5.6% higher year-over-year and 20.8% lower than last quarter. Overall, we exceeded our previous financial guidance and achieved our highest financial fiscal third quarter revenue ever. In many ways our revenue result was exceptional. We saw double-digit revenue growth overall and triple-digit growth in some key segments. Our revenue growth was exceed despite of this seasonally challenging quarter. Revenue were achieved despite continuing shortage for memory and SSDs, resulting in a significant components price increase. Compared to last year, our revenue was more broadly distributed across our customer base without relying on any single 10% customer. On the product side, we continue to offer the industry's largest portfolio of server and storage systems and to be first to market with new products and technologies. Customer are anticipating the technology transition to the next-generation Intel Xeon processor-based platforms, codenamed Skylake. We're ready to deliver a comprehensive portfolio of next-generation X11 systems, supporting new features and higher performance offered by the Skylake processor and our new innovations. Early shipments of X11 solutions will begin in early May. We introduced a new fifth-generation print design, a 2U 4-node, BigTwin, delivering the highest performing Twin multiple-node system supporting 205 watt 2U Xeon processors, 24 DIMMs and All-Flash NVMe per node. We anticipate the new 8U SuperBlade leveraging the advantage of blade computing with other traditional blade cost of premium and proprietary knock in. Looking at our core markets. We saw strong distribution in -- we saw strong contribution in storage and IoT and achieved triple-digit growth in our enterprise and accelerated computing segment from last year. Storage was, again, our strongest segment with 22.5% of total revenue, up 28.7% from last year. Our next-generation storage partners account for 53.2% of this storage revenue and grew a strong 74.2% year-over-year. Our customers choose Super Micro based on the advanced features and capability of our All-Flash and hybrid NVMe SSD systems. We also saw strong growth in our traditional enterprise storage from the capacity maximized top-loading 4U 90-bay and 60-bay solutions. And coming soon, we will introduce a volume-centric, 45-bay system to the portfolio. Internet data center was 10.7% of total revenue, down 51.4% from last year which included 10% customer. We're working closely with large and medium-sized private and public cloud customers on the new-generation agreements and implementing our super rack scale design solutions. IoT embedded was 10.5% of total revenue and was up 38% from last year. We saw a $10 billion estimated addressable market from age to cloud across the traditional embedded demand. Our IoT embedded portfolio will see continued strong growth. Enterprise private cloud is the key to our revenue and margin growth strategy and grew 578% year-over-year from a relatively small base. Our engagements with the leading Global 1000 companies increased to the highest level ever, including a Silicon Valley Fortune 100 enterprise company with over 30,000 MicroBlades. That is one of the world's largest and most efficient data center with a PUE of 1.06 and 280 nodes per rack LSP. Our management software and global service grew 87% year-over-year, providing the ability, serviceability and quality for our rapidly growing -- expanding enterprise customer base. Accelerated computing solutions for AI people learning, machine learning and HPC was 5.9% of total revenue and saw triple-digit growth of 176% from last year. We offer the most advanced NVIDIA, Tesla and Intel Xeon-Phi and air PGA designs, including 1U 4 Tesla P100 solution and the new 4U design that support 10 GPUs with direct BMA support. New air PGA-based solutions provide compression, encryption and visualization are emerging and we have several air PGA customer design wins underway. Finally, from a geographic perspective, Asia was our strongest geography for growth last quarter and up 92% over last year and reaching 23.9% of total sales. China revenue grew triple-digits, up 138.9% year-over-year. Looking ahead, our previous strategy for long term investment in global service, management software, engineering, product solution, operation and worldwide manufacturing capacity are finally providing leverage and better economics of scale for continuous revenue, profit and max share growth. We will continue to lead with innovation and being first to market with the most advanced solution for the next-generation processor, new NVMe, new storage architecture, rack design and cloud scale architectures. In summary, we're getting recognized as the new model for Tier 1 solution provider and have been the fastest-growing server and storage systems company in the world for multiple years. Our double-digit revenue growth demonstrates that we're on the right path and our triple-digit growth in key segments and markets demonstrated that our business model and strategy is working well. I'm pleased with the growth in our business opportunity as we enter the new technology driven cycle. For more specifics on our third quarter, let me turn it over to Howard.
Howard Hideshima: Thank you, Charles and good afternoon, everyone. I will focus my remarks on earnings, gross margins, operating expenses and similar items on a non-GAAP basis which reflects adjustments to exclude stock compensation expenses. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company in today's earnings release and in the supplemental detail in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Let me begin with a review of the third quarter income statement. Please turn to Slide 5. Revenue was $631.1 million. It's a record third quarter for Super Micro, up about 18.5% from the same quarter a year ago and down 3.2% sequentially. The increase in revenue from last year was widespread in terms of market verticals. We saw growth in storage, enterprise, IoT and accelerated computing. This was offset in part by decline in Internet, data center and cloud. On a geographic basis, we had strong growth in Asia of 92%, followed by Europe at 23.1% and the U.S. at 2.3%, while the other was down by 8.5%. The 3.2% sequential decrease in revenues was less than seasonal declines we experienced over the past 2 years of 6% and negative 17%. The improvement over normal historical seasonality was primarily driven by our strength in Asia, up 9.4%; and in other regions, up 20.5%. In particular, China was up 29.3%, as we leverage our growing partnerships. Slide 6. Turning to product mix. Proportion of revenues from server systems was about 70% which is comparable to 69.9% the same quarter a year ago and from 68.1% last quarter. We shipped approximately 139,000 nodes in the quarter which compares to 145,000 in the prior quarter and 126,000 in the prior year. ASPs per compute node was about 3,200 per node versus 3,100 per node last quarter and 3,000 per node last year. We shipped approximately 1,085,000 subsystems and accessories which is up from 950,000 last year and down from 1,214,000 last quarter. We continue to maintain our diverse revenue base with over 700 customers. No customers represented more than 10% of our quarterly revenues. Cloud, Internet, data center revenue was 10.7% which was a decrease from 13.8% in the prior quarter and a decrease from 26% in the prior year. 52.9% of our revenues came from the U.S. and 46% from our distributors and resellers. Slide 15. Non-GAAP gross profit was $88.7 million, up 11.6% from $79.4 million in the same quarter last year and down 5.4% from $93.7 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, gross margin was 14%, down from 14.9% a year ago and from 14.4% sequentially. Price changes from Ablecom resulted in no basis point change to the gross profit in the quarter, with total purchases representing approximately 11.5% of total cost of goods sold compared to 12.2% a year ago and 11.6% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease in gross margin of 90 basis points was primarily due to the cost increase of memory and SSD components which we could not pass on to some of our server customers as well as many of our systems being based on mature late life-cycle processors such as Grantley which means lower prices. Geographically, we had higher sales in Asia where pricing is typically more competitive. Utilization on a global capacity basis was lower at about 54.6% compared to about 63.9% a year ago. This resulted in approximately 20 basis points of negative effect on gross margin. Sequentially, gross margin was down 40 basis points primarily due to the cost of memory and SSD components continuing to rise during the quarter which in some cases was over 30% which we could not pass on to some of our server customers. In addition, lower utilization of our global capacity which was 54.6%, down from 65.8% last quarter, resulted in 10 basis points gross margin decrease. Slide 16. Operating expenses were $61.4 million, up from $51.1 million in the same quarter a year ago and from $57.2 million sequentially. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses were 9.7% which is up from 9.6% in the same quarter a year ago and up from 8.8% sequentially. Operating expenses were higher on an absolute dollar basis year-over-year by 20.1%, primarily in R&D as we invested in personnel expenses to support the development of our total solutions and rollout of new products for the upcoming technology refresh cycle. We increased 157 headcounts in R&D which is about a 14.9% increase. Sequentially, operating expenses were higher by $4.2 million or 7.3%, primarily due to translation foreign exchange loss of $1.5 million which is a $2.1 million delta from last quarter and $1.2 million higher R&D component -- compensation expense. In authorical the $1.5 million foreign exchange loss represented about $0.02 in fully diluted EPS. The company's total headcount increased by 168 sequentially to 2,965 total employees primarily in operations to support the growth of the business. Operating profit was $27.2 million, down by 3.8% from $28.3 million a year ago and down by 25.3% from $36.5 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, operating margin was 4.3%, down from 5.3% a year ago and down from 5.6% sequentially. Net income was $20.3 million, up 7% from $19 million a year ago and down 18.8% from $25 million sequentially. On a non-GAAP fully diluted basis, EPS was $0.38 per share which is up from $0.36 per share a year ago and down from $0.48 per share sequentially. The number of fully diluted shares used in the third quarter was 52,978,000. The tax rate in the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis was 23.7% compared to 32% a year ago and 30.5% sequentially. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 was lower than last year due to the release of liability for completion of a tax audit in foreign jurisdiction. We expect our effective tax rate to be about 32% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis, Slide 17. Cash and cash equivalents, short and long term investments were $110.5 million, down $21 million from $131.5 million in the prior quarter and down $68.6 million from $179.1 million in the same quarter last quarter. In the third quarter, free cash flow was a negative $41.3 million, primarily due to an increase in inventory of $44.8 million, an increase in AR of $24.7 million, offset in part by an increase in accounts payable of $7 million and net income of $16.7 million. Accounts receivable increased by $24.4 million to $391.3 million due to higher revenue at the end of the quarter as customers came back from the Lunar New Year holiday. DSO was 54 days, an increase of 5 days from 49 days in the prior quarter. Inventory increased 43 days to $642.3 million. Days in inventory were 103, an increase of 12 days from 91 in the prior quarter and an increase of 6 days from 97 in the prior year. The increase is primarily to support the continuing tight supply of memory and SSD and sourcing for new product lines related to the Skylake launch as well as for the upcoming seasonally strong quarter. Had we excluded the increase in SSD and memory from September quarter and -- of about $62.7 million, our days of inventory would have been 93 days. Accounts payable was $6.8 million -- up $6.8 million which was 57 days, an increase of 5 days from 52 days in the prior quarter and down 3 days from 60 days in the prior year. Overall, cash conversion cycle days was 100 days which is 12 days higher than the prior quarter and the same quarter of last year. Adjusting for the effect of the increase in inventory in SSD and memory, as noted above, the cash conversion cycle days would have been 90. Now for a few comments on our outlook. As we enter the last quarter of fiscal '17, we see strong growth opportunities from a technology refresh cycle, especially in the Skylake launch. We continue to see strong traction for our leading solutions in our growing customer base especially in large enterprise. These factors, coupled with investments we have made during the past year, put us on our strongest position to accelerate our growth in the many market verticals we serve. Therefore, the company currently expects net sales for the quarter ending June 30, 2017, in a range of $655 million to $715 million. Assuming this revenue range, the company expects non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.40 to $0.50 for the quarter. At the midpoint, this would represent an increase of 31% in revenue and 125% in EPS from the prior year. It is currently expected that outlook will not be updated until the release of the company's next quarterly earnings announcement. Notwithstanding subsequent developments, however, the company may update the outlook or any portion thereof at any time. With that, let me turn it back to Charles for some closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Howard. We're now reaping the benefits of our very strong ambitions that we have built over a long period of time. This quarter's revenue was the strongest third quarter in our history and again, demonstrates the advantages of our product portfolio across many different verticals, especially among our enterprise customers. With that, I'm very confident that our strong foundation and products will make Super Micro one of the most successful companies in the IT industry. Operator, at this time, we're ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And we'll go first to Aaron Rakers with Stifel.
Joseph Quatrochi: Okay. Great. This is Joe Quatrochi on for Aaron. I was just curious. I wanted to kind of double click on the SSD constraints that you're still seeing. Did that impact your ability to fulfill or rather recognize additional revenue in the quarter?
Charles Liang: I guess it's both. Because of that shortage, we saw some [indiscernible] relationship and the other reason is that because the price rose, so we had to raise the price to customer. So that, too, did impact our business.
Joseph Quatrochi: Okay. And how do you think about that going into the current quarter? Do you see a similar impact?
Charles Liang: Looks like both fee dwen and flash memory, SSD will continue to rose in price, but where we also get in accessorized. So won't grow that much as the last few quarter. I would have to say, for example, in module. In last 3 quarter, the price had been grow almost double. So next quarter or 2 quarter I guess, the growth will be slower.
Joseph Quatrochi: Okay. And then just for follow up. Can you talk about the timing of Skylake relative to what Mellanox had kind of talked about last night? It seemed like they might be seeing a little bit of a pushout. I was just curious if you're seeing any difference from what we talked about 90 days ago.
Charles Liang: Yes, the good news is Skylake, our product have been developing very smoothly. So today, we have almost complete product line ready to ship and we already promised to some customer start ship early next month. And India official launch, I believe, is still early July.
Operator: And we'll go next to Mark Kelleher with D.A. Davidson.
Mark Kelleher: Howard, I want to talk a little bit about the gross margins. Is this the low point, do you think, the 14%? Or do the continued price hikes in the memory mean we're going to dip below that?
Howard Hideshima: Mark, this is Howard, thanks. Again, December as a quarter, we don't typically guide gross margin. But December as a quarter is usually a very seasonally strong quarter compared to -- I'm sorry. The June quarter is particularly a strong quarter compared to the March quarter. So typically, it's not as competitive as the March quarter. So we get usually a margin boost from that. However, as Charles alluded to, the tightness in SSD and memory is still out there. We're saying we're doing our best to manage our way through that and have done better, I think, probably in the last quarter versus the September quarter. So we're -- December quarter. So we're going to continue to do that as well.
Mark Kelleher: And are you going to continue to build inventory of memory to stay ahead of this? And when do you have the cash, kind of burning some cash here? How do you feel about your cash position?
Howard Hideshima: We're okay with regards to cash position, Mark and we have lines of credit that we can draw upon and can expand it and access the capital there.
Mark Kelleher: But inventory is still going to go up or putting more memory in?
Howard Hideshima: We're preparing right now for the launch -- for the Skylake launch coming up here. So some of the inventory build from this last quarter was for a part of that per se and then part of that was for the larger quarter. So if you look at the end of the June quarter, typically, you'll see a decline in our inventories because we come out of a seasonally strong quarter going into somewhat of a seasonally weak quarter.
Operator: And we'll move next to Mehdi Hosseini.
David Ryzhik: This is David Ryzhik for Mehdi Hosseini. So it is already almost a quarter of overall revenue and you guys delivered some strong growth in China. What areas of the product portfolio are most responsible for that growth? And I had a follow-up.
Charles Liang: For China, I believe still our NVMe and SSD product line have been very attractive in the market. And also, kind of high-density storage as well as GPU for AI, I mean, machine learning, people learning, those areas have been growing very strongly in China market.
David Ryzhik: Great. And for next-gen storage, obviously very impressive growth. So 2 questions. Is this an above gross margin business for you? And the other one is just wanted to understand. It seems like some of the larger storage OEMs are pivoting to this supply model for third-party sourcing for hardware. How big of an opportunity do you view this to be? And are you selling any next-gen storage into the enterprise opportunity? And do you see that as an opportunity for you?
Charles Liang: Yes. Indeed, next-gen storage will continue to grow customers. And also, our customer are growing. Plus, we have a more -- new architectural advantage for the market. For example coming soon, Op10 from Intel and as well as the people -- some people call JBOF -- JBOD for fresh solution. So we have a very strong product and lots of new architecture is coming.
David Ryzhik: Great. And would this be an above gross margin business for you?
Charles Liang: Theoretically it will, but because memory and SSD prices are rising very fast, so that may offset our margin for short term. But long term, yes.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Alex Kurtz with Pacific Crest Securities.
David Kurtz: Could you take us through the dynamics again, Howard, on the data center -- the Internet, data center business? And it looked like one of your strategic 10% data center customers was talking about expansion recently. So that's question one, sort of what are the dynamics in the June quarter guidance around that vertical and what happened in March? And then also, one of your strategic, emerging storage partners was acquired by one of your competitors and was just wondering what the plan is there as far as working with that emerging storage vendor going forward now that they're part of a larger entity?
Howard Hideshima: Okay. Alex, thanks. With regards to the Internet, data center, cloud area, we noted in the call that represented about 10.7% of our revenues in the previous quarter, in the March quarter. That's down from 26% last year. You'll recall that we had about a 12% customer last year that we did in the greenfield opportunities and build-outs there. But that's a customer -- still purchasing from, but that's majority of the decrease that happened between years per se. As we talk about going forward, we're still selling to that customer. And again, with the technology refresh cycle coming up, it presents opportunities for us to do, again, not just refreshes with them but with other customers as well. So we're pretty bullish on the Internet, data center vertical for ourselves going forward as well as we enter there.
Charles Liang: And the good thing is we start again impede to say lots of new customers, new private cloud especially that help our business grow for long term. And as to the, you just mentioned some of our customer was bought by a big company. We're improving that relationship. So it looks like so far so good.
David Kurtz: Okay. So there's no plans on them moving to their own contract manufacturer partners? Immediate plan is to keep it with you guys?
Charles Liang: So far we feel pretty good.
Operator: We'll move next to Nehal Chokshi from Maxim Group.
Nehal Chokshi: On the gross margin, however, just to be clear, the component charges or price increases rather, if it had not been for that, it sounds like then you would've actually had a gross margin uptick Q-over-Q? Is that the correct way to interpret this?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, there's still pressure out there, yes. I mean, if you look at the 40 basis points of decline in our gross margin sequentially, 10 basis points was attributable to the utilization per se. If there was not any of this memory type stuff, I believe it's fair to say that we would have gotten most of that back.
Nehal Chokshi: So then it would have been flat Q-over-Q had it not been for utilization decline and component price increases then?
Howard Hideshima: It could have been higher. I mean, we also had the geographic that was in there that weighed us down a bit.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. And then data center was already talked about a little bit on the prior question. But that was down Q-over-Q and in the last quarter, there was I think a good amount of excitement of having a more diversified base of hyperscalers. And I think that large prior 10% customer that had gone from greenfield to just sort of maintenance increases, that had already kind of petered out. So I guess my question is that the decline on a Q-over-Q basis of the hyperscalers, was that a surprise?
Howard Hideshima: Well, I think if you look at the decline quarter-over quarter, again, it went from about 13.8% of revenues in the prior quarter to about 10%. If you look at our seasonality again and not to say that they're totally tied to seasonality, you'll see us anywhere from 6% to 17% down sequentially over the last couple of years. So some of this has to do with seasonality. I wouldn't say that it was a decline or a loss of opportunities. I think we feel pretty good that we have more opportunities going forward and stronger in that segment than we have in previous quarters.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. Very good. By my math, the revenue from the channel, it accelerated quite significantly. Can you put a narrative behind that?
Howard Hideshima: The revenue from the channel, again, the percentage of revenues, again, we're -- fairly stable there with regards to our -- them being about 46% this current quarter and then 46% in the prior quarter. So on an overall percentage basis, they were fairly stable.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Brian Alger with Roth Capital Partners.
Brian Alger: I guess if we're looking at the quarter, there's -- this time of the earnings season, there's always a bit of mixed news. I'm wondering if the strength relative to expectations from a demand standpoint, was it all attributable to your 2 primary competitors going through major mergers in the past quarter? And if so, if you expect to be seeing any snap-back or any normalization of market share that may have been gained.
Howard Hideshima: Yes, Brian, this is Howard. If you talk about like, for example -- one person talked about Nimble and HP in the storage area, our storage area is very strong still. And if it's EMC you're referring to with regards to Dell, going back, it's -- again, in the storage area, we're continuing to do great in the storage area, as Charles alluded to. And we're getting more customers in that base as we go. So again, we're not seeing it slow down or just being -- because of our partners doing mergers that we're gaining more traction in that area.
Brian Alger: Okay. I guess it's sort of what I was getting at. It wasn't as much focused on the storage side of it, but rather just whenever a major merger is going through, there tends to be an opportunity to gain share as channels oftentimes get conflicted. But it's good to hear you guys are gaining on the merits of the product portfolio. Moving forward, you guys, it seems as though, are getting some good traction from the AI push and certainly, there is a lot of attention being put towards the GPUs. And I noticed you highlighted the NVIDIA solutions as well as Intel's. How -- do you have a sense for how you stand relative to the competition there? Is there an advantage that you guys might have over, call it, the slower-moving OEMs in this space for that type of a customer?
Charles Liang: Indeed, for both storage and GPU as well as Xeon-Phi total market share, I believe we will continue to grow in 2 area. One is we continue to have more customer, especially enterprise corporate customer. And also, we're working with a superscale company as well. So once we have good product, I mean, we're openminded to work with any customer.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And we'll move next to Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna Financial Group.
David Ryzhik: It's Dave Ryzhik again for Mehdi. Howard, can you talk about -- how can we think about OpEx rolling over the balance of the year? Obviously, your enterprise remains very small as a percentage of overall revenue and we'd assume that you guys are continuing to invest in that in the sales and support effort. Just any way to think about OpEx over the balance of the year would be great.
Howard Hideshima: This is Howard again. The OpEx this quarter was affected primarily -- one of the major increases was basically the translational ForEx gain/loss. So again, that would -- you can -- we don't predict that per se or fill that into our planning. But again, excluding that, I think the first quarter is always the toughest at tax rates. Our people's tax deductions get reset and what have you. So that rolls into the compensation expense. As we go throughout the year, that gets filled up and it gets taken off from there. Apart from that, we're still focused on leveraging our op expense investment that we have made. So again, grow our revenues faster and we're going to roll our operating expenses and see that leverage drop to the bottom line.
David Ryzhik: Great. And just to clarify, the 30,000 MicroBlade deployment, is that in the enterprise revenue category?
Charles Liang: Yes, for corporate private cloud basically.
Operator: And this does conclude the question and answer session of our conference call. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Liang for any closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you for joining us today and looking forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you, everyone. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the Super Micro Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Conference Call. We do appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect at this time. Thank you.

And now, I'll turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Charles Liang: Thank you Perry and good afternoon everyone. Please refer to our slide 4 through 10. I will now summarize our second quarter. Our revenue over this period was 652 million, it’s 23.3% higher than last quarter and 2% higher year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was 25 million. This is 50.1% higher than last quarter and 34.1% lower year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.48 per diluted share compared to $0.32 last quarter and $0.73 last year. We are pleased to report an all-time record high quarterly revenue of 652 million which exceeded our guidance. We achieved this record revenue against tough compare, which included a 15% customer last year. Having a more diverse customer set provides a stronger base for our return to our faster growth trends. In fact, we now have minimal customer engagement than ever from the Fortune 500 and Global 1000 companies. While most of them are still new partner to us, this means we have viewed our reputation, support structure and production capacity that these large scale enterprise customer trust. With these assets, our strength in long term growth become much healthier in both revenue and profitability. As I have mentioned in the previous quarters, we have been building a much stronger foundation by enhancing our technology, operations and global onsite services, as we evolve into a true tier 1 server and storage solution company. This past quarter, the industry faced so much challenges from tightening in the supply of memory DIMM and MEM fresh. We saw a 30% price hike in some cases, [indiscernible] significantly impact on some orders. However I'm pleased that we are able to overcome this challenge since our relationship with vendors and safety inventory systems are much stronger than ever before and are able to help our customers continue along with their beginnings. Page 8 please, from a geography perspective, our continued effort and investment to expand globally and deliver a better global distribution of our revenue. The US market accounts for 55%, Asia 21%, and Europe 20%. Asia has shown a very strong momentum, up 43% from previous quarter. In particular, our China business where we have focus on technology enabler to our partner in China was very strong and up 53% year over year.  Last quarter, it was announced that Super Micro had partnered with Fiberhome, telecom technology company in China to form a joint venture, to further pursue our strategy of working with local partners. With our 30% stake in the joint venture, Super Micro will share technology and products to enable our local development of solutions for certain important vertical market in China. We do go forward to growing this relationship in years to come. Next page please. Now, let’s talk about specific products. Enterprise private cloud is a key to our revenue growth strategy this year and it grew 221% from a relatively smaller base. We saw outstanding growth in the quarter. Our recently introduced MicroBlade product with several major large scale customer wins in the quarter. Most of them notably a sizable installation happen here, local in Silicon Valley. The data center achieved a super efficient 1.06 power usage effectively, PUE optimized by the MicroBlade’s outstanding thermal structural design. [indiscernible] design also support a record high computing intensity at [indiscernible]. We introduced our fifth generation twin design. The new BigTwin is the industry’s most optimized multiple now twin architecture, supporting the four-inch CPU up to 205 watt maximum memory with 24 DIMM, NVMe empowered by the patented titanium efficiency power. Our R&D teams are really in the developing cycle of our X11 DP products which is based on the next generation Intel Xeon, co-name Skylake processor. We again aim to be the first to market with the optimized Skylake system, process already been underway. We are continuing to see strong 90% year-over-year growth in our combined management and global service business, providing durability, serviceability and quality for our expanding enterprise customer base. As to accelerated] computing solutions, for [indiscernible] artificial intelligence was 6% of total revenue, up 122% from last year. [indiscernible] applications require processing power of multiple GPUs that communicate efficiently and effectively to extend the GPU network. Super Micro’s single GPU system allows multiple GPU to communicate with minimal details and maximum bandwidth. The single one complex PCI-E have been proven to dramatically improve GPU peer to peer communication efficiency over, which we have 221 higher QPI throughput and 60% lower retention compared to previous generation products. Our new 4 Pascal GPU design incorporates the data and reading the GPU interconnect with the independent GPUs team along, ensuring uncompromised performance and stability. The new 4U Design supports up to 10 PCI-E Pascal of GPU and delivers up to 187 tera peak performance per system. The third region was again one of our strongest segment, with 24.3% of total revenue, up 19.7% from last year. Our next generation storage account for 48% of this storage revenue and grew a strong 55.6% year-over-year. We’re ahead of pace and produce All-Flash NVMe systems in the industry, which is 60 plus system available today. We have several significant cloud and enterprise NVMe design wins in the quarter as customer can only find a truly optimal NVMe solution from. [indiscernible], we introduced an advanced SBB platform, the 240 drive All-Flash NVMe dual pass system. Our traditional storage such a simple tablet [indiscernible] driver systems, also so strong growth as many customers prefer to complete the system, build and aided by Super Micro without any superior system quality. We also like it since it significantly improves customer’s quality and service satisfaction. In summary, this quarter we had begun to continue the robust growth pace. That had been our legacy. MicroBlade, NVMe, BigTwin and upcoming X11 Skylake, we have drivers for growth moving forward. With our strong foundation in place, we have more opportunity for large customer engagement than we have ever before in our history, especially our Fortune 1000 enterprise private cloud customers. We expect to take advantage of this tremendous opportunity and reach new high.  For more specific on the second quarter, let me transfer it over to Howard.
Howard Hideshima: Thank you, Charles and good afternoon, everyone. I’ll focus my remarks on earnings, gross margins, operating expenses and similar items on a non-GAAP which reflects adjustments to excluded stock compensation expenses. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements for the company, in today’s earnings release and in the supplemental detail in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Let me begin with a review of the second quarter income statement. Please turn to slide 4. Revenue was 652 million, up 2% from same quarter a year ago and up about 23.3% sequentially. The increase in revenue from last year was primarily due to our increase in subsystems and accessories, which was up 12.3%. This is consistent with the increase in sales to distributors, which was up 4.4%. In terms of verticals, we saw a growth in next-gen storage enterprise and HPC of 55.6, 220.7% and 122.3% respectively. Offset in part by a decline in Internet sales and cloud of 52.6%. On a geographical basis, we had strong growth in Asia of 55.9%, followed by Europe at 14%, while the US was down about 12.1%. The 23.3% sequential increase in revenues is primarily due to an improvement in server solutions, which was up 24.2% due to more sales from our next gen and open storage business, which grew 25.4% and 28.5% respectively as well as growth in the internet data center cloud of 31.3%, BPC of 92.3% and our enterprise business of [indiscernible]. On a geographical basis, all regions showed seasonal strength with the US up 21.1%, Asia up 43.1% and Europe up 14.4%. In particular, China was up 71.4% as we leverage our existing partnership and created new partnerships such as the one with Fiberhome Telecommunications Technologies Limited, a major telco infrastructure provider in China. Slide 6. Turning to product mix, promotional revenues from server systems were 68.61% of total revenues, which was down from 71% the same quarter a year ago and up 67.6% last quarter. We began to provide the complete note which we have shipped during the quarter, since we believe it gives an idea of the increasing density which our solutions are providing. We pioneered the concept for multi note systems about ten years ago with the introduction of our twin architecture and continue to lead the way in this area. We shipped approximately 145,000 nodes in the quarter, which compares to 122,000 in the prior quarter and 133,000 in the prior year. ASPs per compute node was about 3100 per node versus 2900 per node last quarter and 3400 per node last year. We shipped approximately 1,214,000 subsystems and accessories, which is up 1,092,000 last year and 1,144,000 last quarter. We continue to maintain a diverse revenue base with over 700 customers. No customers represented more than 10% of our quarterly revenues. Cloud Internet data center revenues was 13.8%, which was an increase from 12.8% in the prior quarter and a decrease from 29.7% in the prior year. 55% of our revenues came from the US and 46.2% from our distributors and resellers.  Slide 11, non-GAAP gross profit was 93.7 million, down 12.1 million from 106.6 million in the same quarter last year and up 16.6% from 80.4 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, gross margin was 14.4%, down from 16.7% a year ago and from fifteen 15.2% sequentially. Price changes from resulted in no basis point change to gross profits in the quarter with total purchases representing approximately 11.6% of total cost of goods sold compared to 13.4% a year ago and 11.2% sequentially.  The year-over-year decrease in gross margin of 2.3% primarily was due to the cost of memory and SSD component causing cost increases, which we could got pass on to some server customers and as well as many other of our server systems being based on mature late lifecycle processors such as GPU, such as, which mean lower prices. Geographically, we had higher sales in Asia, where pricing is typically more competitive. The utilization on a global capacity basis was lower at about 65.8% compared to 75.2% a year ago. This results in an approximately 10 basis point negative effect on gross margin. Sequentially, gross margin was down 80 basis points, primarily due to the cost of components such as memory and SSD rising during the quarter, causing some cost increases which could not be passed on to some server customers. This is offset in part by higher utilization of our global capacity, which was at 65.8% up from 51.5% last quarter, which resulted in 30 basis points gross margin improvement. Slide 12 and 13. Operating expenses were 57.2 million, up from 53.5 million in the same quarter a year ago and from 55.7 million sequentially. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses was 8.8%, which is up from 8.4% in the same quarter a year ago and down from 10.5% sequentially. Operating expenses were higher on an absolute dollar basis year over year by 7% primarily in R&D as we invested in personnel to support the development of our total solution and roll over of our new products for the upcoming technology refresh cycle. We increased 139 heads in R&D, which is about 13.8% increase. Sequentially, operating expenses were higher by 1.6 million or 2.8% due to higher sales and marketing expenses due to promotional and trade show expenses of 1.5 million and increased sales payments of about 600,000 due to higher sales revenue and 900,000 higher R&D compensation expenses. This is offset in part by a 1.1 million of foreign exchange gains and 1.1 million lower audit and legal fees. The company’s total headcount increased by 66 sequentially to 2797 total employees primarily in the operations to support the growth of the business. Operating profit was 36.5 million, down 31.4% from 53.1 million a year ago and up by 47.6% from 24.7 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, operating margin was 5.6% down from 8.3% a year ago and up from 4.7% sequentially. We continue our efforts to leverage the investments we have made during the past year. Net income was 25 million, down 34% from 38 million a year ago and up 50.1% from 16.7 million sequentially. Our non-GAAP fully diluted EPS was $0.48 per share, which was down from $0.73 per share a year ago and up from $0.32 per share sequentially. The number of fully diluted shares used in the second quarter was 2,555,000 shares. The tax rate in the second quarter on a non-GAAP basis was 30.5% compared to 28% a year ago and 31.7% sequentially. The effective tax rate for the second quarter for the fiscal year 2017 was higher than last year due to the reinstatement of the Federal Reserve R&D credit in December 2015. The sequential increase in tax rate was due to -- decreasing tax rate was due to continuing improvement in our new global corporate structure, which will be implemented in May 1, 2017. We expect our effective tactic to be about 25% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 through the release of liability for completion of an audit, tax audit and as we continue to improve our execution of our new corporate structure as we grow our business being served offshore.  Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis, cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term investments were 131.5 million, down 17.9 million from 149.4 million in the prior quarter and down 41.1 million from 172.6 million in the same quarter last year. In the second quarter, free cash flow was a negative 49.6 million, primarily due to increase in inventory of 101.9 million and an increase in AR of 38.9 million offset in part by an increase in accounts payable of 53.4 million and net income of 22 million. Accounts receivable increased by 38.6 million to 366.9 million due to higher revenue sequentially.  Day sales outstanding was 49 days, a decrease of five days from 54 days in the prior quarter. Inventory increased by 99.3 million to 599.3 million. Days in inventory were 91, a decrease of six days from 97 in the prior quarter and an increase of nine days from 82 in the prior year. The increase is primarily to support the tied supply of memory in SSP as well as for the shutdown of vendors in Asia for the Lunar New Year. Accounts Payable was up 53.4 million which was 52 days, a decrease of three days from 55 days in the prior quarter and up two days from 50 days in the prior year. Overall, cash conversion cycle days was 88 days, which is eight days lower than the prior quarter.  We continue to guide that the cash conversion days and the ratio above should be viewed on an annual basis since there is a seasonality to our business, which affect these ratios quarter to quarter. Now for a few comments on our outlook. As we enter 2017, we see growth opportunity from both a more optimistic economic outlook as well as a multi-faceted technology refresh cycle. Both of these coupled with the investments we have made during the past year have put us in a great position to re-accelerate our growth in the many market verticals we serve and leverage the investments we have made.  Therefore, the company currently expects net sales for the quarter ending March 31, 2017 in a range of 570 million to 630 million. Assuming this revenue range, the company expects non-GAAP per fully diluted share of approximately $0.34 to $0.42 for the quarter. At the midpoint, this would represent an increase of 13% in revenues and 6% in EPS from the prior year. The start of a [indiscernible] strategy to take advantage of the options we have to take market share and keep control of our operating costs. In July, 2016, the company announced the company's board of directors had adopted a program to repurchase from time to time at management’s discretion up to $100 million of the company's common stock in the open market or in private transactions during the next 12 months at prevailing market prices. As of December 31, 2016, we have purchased 888,097 shares of common stock, totaling $18.5 million at an average price of $20.79 per share. It is currently expected that the outlook will not be updated until the release of the company’s next quarterly earnings announcement, notwithstanding subsequent developments. However, the company may update the outlook or any portion thereof at any time. With that, let me turn back to Charles for some closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you, how. Although we’re pleased to beat expectation and deliver record high quarter, we are mostly excited to focus and on pace to return to that strong growth trend that have been our legacy with our robust global operation in these foundations and in the chip based server storage product portfolio. Super Micro is well positioned and ready to set a new standard for our industry and to achieve greater things. Operator at this time, we’re ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we’ll go first to Aaron Rakers with Stifel.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. This is [indiscernible] on for Aaron. Congrats on the quarter. Just a couple of questions if I could. First, I want to go back to, you guys talked about you're seeing the impacts from memory pricing and SSD pricing. Did you by chance, I mean, can you give us any color there, did you sound like in a green and blue supplier like you did similar to your hard disk drive back when they had the Thailand flood? And then just kind of coupled with that, how should we think about gross margin because in the past, we've seen gross margin decline sequentially into the March quarter. So I mean is this -- should we expect a similar trend this quarter? And then I have a follow up.
Howard Hideshima: Yeah. Joe, this is Howard. Again as Charles mentioned, we did see some pricing increases up to about 40% plus in some of the pricing between say September and December, but we have taken measures to invest in our inventory as you noticed that we talked about $100 million of increase in inventory and much of that inventory is being invested in component to put us in a good position with regards to the shortages that they exist or tightness that may exist in the market.
Charles Liang: And mostly important is we had continued to improve our relationship with key vendors. So as of today, our relationship, partnership have been much stronger than before ever. So that’s why we’re able to guide a relatively more consistent price.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And then just on the cloud business, it's down year-over-year. I understand it’s a tough compare, you had a 15% customer last year, but even if you strip that out, I think you’re still down year-over-year, just wondering if you can give any color, what type of demand trends you're seeing there?
Charles Liang: Yes. We did have really a huge IDC customer, internet data center customer, but with again a lot of Fortune 500 private customers. And we didn’t, I would anticipate much more [indiscernible] become a more stable for both revenue and profitability.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.
Mehdi Hosseini: Thanks for taking my question. On the datacenter trend, it is interesting to see more than 30% sequential growth, but you didn't have the 10% plus customer, can you elaborate on diversification of your customer, are these some of the wins from six nine months ago that is now materializing, any color here will be great to better understand the dynamics behind this revenue?
Charles Liang: Yes. As I just mentioned, in last quarters, indeed we went out to a, I would say a Fortune 500 credit card customer and their demand had been consistent and because several of them, that's why it's more or less stable and we believe this trend will continue.
Mehdi Hosseini: So you have, you now have more than one significant data center customer and they’re ramping and is there any opportunity to continue increasing the mix of these customers or now you have multiple customers and they're going to continue to ramp?
Charles Liang: Both. I believe we continue to have more Fortune 500 private cloud customer. This will drive sales. At the same time, when our capacity allow, yes, we are also open to grow the relationship with POM, internet data center as well.
Mehdi Hosseini: Sure. And one rather technical question for you Charles, within the ME adoption increasing, do you see a trend with NVMe on fabric and is that happening, how is that going to impact your all flash rate product solution.
Charles Liang: A lot of our NVMe solutions are already fabric based. It’s kind of based on PCI’s reach building in our area. So indeed, the last quarter, we have a specific deal because of those technologies, and we’re detecting that in the marketplace and we saw more and more customer like PCI based NVMe solution.
Mehdi Hosseini: Would that cause you a risk of marginalizing your all flash array customers or products?
Charles Liang: Basically that will improve our profit margin a lot. However, last quarter, the fresh price also raised that up. So it’s kind of partially offset by that.
Mehdi Hosseini: But I’m just wondering if there is any cannibalization of some of the other customers that are just more of an all flash array solution.
Charles Liang: Yes. We saw more and more customers out there.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Mark Kelleher with D A Davidson.
Mark Kelleher: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Nice quarter guys. Just wanted to go back to the component shortages. You mentioned that perhaps you weren't able to pass along the price increases for that. Will you be able to, will you be able to work your prices up to incorporate that. That's the first question. And the second question is, can you just explain a little bit more about how building the inventory helps with that issue. Did you get pricing discounts or buying? Just curious.
Howard Hideshima: Hi, Mike. This is Howard. With regards to the passing on pricing to our customers, we are obviously, last quarter, we saw the price increasing quite fast probably in the middle of the quarter. And so some of the contract appeals were already set. Now that we see this out there, we are working with our customers obviously to pass on the differentials with them. So we're actively working on that. With regards to the inventory, how does that benefit us, again, as you see, the prices going up, some extent, we procured inventory, already made the investment into our inventory, so that as prices go up, we do have inventory that we procured at a lower cost to the relative current prices.
Charles Liang: Especially because we see some significant order is kind of coming continuously. That's another reason why we keep a higher inventory.
Mark Kelleher: Okay. So could we assume that the shortfall or the surprise this quarter will lead to higher gross margins sequentially, is that a safe assumption?
Charles Liang: It’s hard to say, because we don't know what way the prices really change during the quarter.
Howard Hideshima: We bought some of the inventory, Mark, but then again, it keeps on going, we keep on buying inventory, and there still shortages and things of that nature out there.
Mark Kelleher: Okay. And then just a second question, your sub-assemblies and systems did very well, could you just kind of explain the dynamic between that and servers? I know servers have been growing at a pretty good clip and it seems we're having some success back at the subassembly side. What's your thought on that split?
Howard Hideshima: Yeah. I think again with some of the distributors, you saw me mentioned percentages with regard to the distributor percentages growing in there. So some of that distributors are coming to us quite frankly with regards to our products. And then obviously from last year, again the decrease in our data cloud is primarily short server systems affected the mix what percentage is between subsystems and assemblies and complete solution. So again, part of that is driving some of the percentages.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Rich Kugele with Needham & Company.
Rich Kugele: Thank you. Good afternoon. Just a few questions. First when I was just revisiting the gross margin, if you’ve got, I believe you said about ten basis points hit from the utilization and then how, is there any way to quantify the breakdown between pricing versus the component shortages?
Howard Hideshima: Sure, Mark. I think if you look at the sequential decrease which was about 80 basis points, probably that's more again, if you take a look at that, I think you'll see that we had a thirty basis points improvement with regard to utilization and quite frankly, the only other mention in my commentary was the component pricing per se. So if you take a look at all the other factors, you probably see a plus 100 basis point impact from the component pricing.
Rich Kugele:  Okay. All right. That makes sense. And then, Skylake has come out we believe mid-year and so does your guidance include whatever type of air pocket there might be ahead of that arrival?
Charles Liang: Yes. This project will be a big thing to us, however early seeding indeed didn’t stop for much. So I believe there will be not much impact for this quarter. As for the official release from Intel, I believe it’s still of our early Q3. So and a really big impact will be Q3 this year, I mean September quarter and early premier for March can be CRD meeting.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we’ll go next to Alex Kurtz with Pacific Crest Securities.
Alex Kurtz: Yes. Thanks guys and congrats, Charles and the organization on a good quarter here. Just want to clarify, Charles, the Skylake comments. So it sounds like you have some early availability to certain customers in the March quarter for Skylake or the ability to get some initial pricing and benchmarks out to customers in March?
Charles Liang: Yes. We start seeding, [indiscernible] much more simple, but really are start seeding, early deployment won’t be a stand much. So how much we can look how with our vendor and our customer.
Alex Kurtz: There is a possibility that you can recognize some Skylake revenue in Q2 then?
Charles Liang: A little bit in Q1, more in Q2 I believe.
Alex Kurtz: And then Q2, sorry, Q3 is when, so the September quarter is when the real ramp would occur?
Charles Liang: Yes.
Alex Kurtz: Okay. And then Howard on the tax rate, I just want to make sure I got this right, 25% non-GAAP for March?
Charles Liang: That’s correct.
Alex Kurtz: That's obviously a big step down here. So should we be modeling 25% going forward or you should be normalizing them back to 30% in the June quarter plus?
Howard Hideshima: The 25% includes related to a tax audit that we completed. So again that would come out like, I think if you take it down to around the 30% or 32%, that’s the improvements that we’re making.
Alex Kurtz: Okay. So the 31 is the more normalized level?
Howard Hideshima: Yeah.
Alex Kurtz: Okay. And Howard, I think I missed the number of units you shipped for ASPs for the subsystems and the units for the components, can you just repeat that again?
Howard Hideshima: Yeah. I’ll remind you, we changed the notes. So for the quarter, we shipped 145,000 notes in the December quarter. That compares to 122,000 notes in the prior quarter and 133,000 notes in the prior year. The ASPs per not was 3100 in the quarter, in the December quarter, 2900 and in the prior quarter and then 3400 in the same quarter of last year. And then, I’m sorry, you asked for the subsystem and assembly. Okay. That was 1,214,000 subsystems and accessories.
Alex Kurtz: 1.214?
Howard Hideshima: Yes. 
Alex Kurtz: Okay. All right. Can the emerging storage grouping, you said I think it was up plus, it was up plus 55% for that specific group of customers?
Howard Hideshima: Yes.
Alex Kurtz: Okay. And then last question, the success in Asia, was that specific to one of these big Internet data center customers or was that just generally the x86 market in Asia this quarter?
Charles Liang: I would like it is spread to stable customer.
Alex Kurtz: Okay. And sort of larger data center type customers Charles?
Charles Liang: Pretty wide combination.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Brian Alger with Roth Capital Partners. Mr. Alger, please check your mute function. Your line is open.
Brian Alger: Sorry about that guys. Hopefully, you can hear me now. Congrats on the quarter. Want to dig in a little bit on the subsystems. Obviously, it was good in the quarter, but it's showing growth again and it's two quarters in a row where we've been up year-on-year after pretty steady, pretty substantial declines throughout all of fiscal ‘16. Is there a specific growth driver here, is it tied to the growth that you're seeing in the embedded and Internet of Things side of things or is there more behind it than just catch up in the channel.
Howard Hideshima: I guess the major reason is because we just finished our operations there. I mean, in that four quarter, as we mentioned, we spend a lot of effort to build up global operation and including IP implementation and global warehouse. So now, all of those have been ready and global onsite is the most ready now. That’s why we’re able to focus on building it and start to grow and we will be coming soon and also on happening new product line. We do believe that the future will be come back to a strong growth again.
Brian Alger: So we should be thinking of the subsystems segment as one of the many growth drivers that are running through the system right now and not being a drag on growth?
Howard Hideshima: I guess it grows overall. 
Brian Alger: Right. Following up on that, the IoT embedded slide, obviously that's now become effectively 10% of the revenue mix. And it's growing at a pretty good clip that market obviously is pretty fragmented and very diverse. Is that a growth rate that we should be at this point or is it just too early days to really get a handle on the forecasting?
Charles Liang: Actually I am very sorry, I mean our focus on IOT have been very consistent, growth should be continuous strong.
Brian Alger: Okay. Great. And just a house keeping Howard, if you can help us out, you were able off a whole bunch of growth rates for different segments like HBC and whatnot. Going back to the part of the prepared remarks, just say those again.
Howard Hideshima: Sure. It was in the sequential or in the year-over-year. Year-over-year, okay. So in terms of verticals, we saw growth in next-gen stores, enterprise and HPC, right, 55.6%, 220.7% and 122.3% respectively offset by decline in Internet based cloud of 52.6%. That’s the year over year’s.
Brian Alger: Great. That’s what I was looking for. Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group.
Nehal Chokshi: Thank you. One is that, you increased the number of sizable customer engagement, is that, it sounds like that's the mix between hyper-scale and large enterprise customers, is that a correct characterization there?
Charles Liang: Indeed in private cloud customer, and based on micro product and some other between [indiscernible].
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. And how big of a driver is IBM’s open-power architecture to the large enterprise customer as well as hyper-scale, the increasing number of hyper-scale customers that you’re seeing? Well, so, I think a couple of months ago, there was a press release on IBM’s open-power architecture, winning a key customer and also highlighting Super Micro as a key supplier within that supply chain. So the question is that, is that a big driver in the increasing number of sizable customer engagements that you’re seeing?
Charles Liang: We have some customers like [indiscernible] but at this moment, it’s too early to say.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. And specifically within the private cloud customer, traction that you're getting, it sounds like you're starting to really break through here, are you seeing good traction across all deals or is it specific to say Asia or specific to the United States?
Charles Liang: Indeed, it will stop from USA and East Coast, West Coast, we see a lot of demand. And primarily because of our on-site service, product line, visibility of that.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. My second topic is visibility. Your guidance range is again a little bit no more narrow than the prior quarter and two quarters those are very wide. So I take that as an indication of increasing visibility, is that a correct characterization there?
Howard Hideshima: I think that's fair, Nehal. I think like I said, we're coming into the quarter, we're on the edge of a technology refresh cycle. We see a lot of great opportunities as Charles has already talked to about some of the new customers, engagements that we've got going on, those seem to be very good for us.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. Has that improved visibility also partially potentially a result of the different way that you're doing or forecasting and it seems that you have a little bit more consistency in being able to hit your targets over the past few quarters.
Howard Hideshima: Yeah. If we go back historically, we went through a lot of investments last year with regard to SAT and our warehouse and our reorganization. Those investments have been made and have been into the system for now over a year, or year and a half, so some of those things have helped us improve our overall efficiency for that way. 
Operator: It appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Liang, I would like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Thank you for joining us today and we look forward to talking to you again at our end of this quarter. Thank you everyone, have a great day.
Operator: This does conclude today’s conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Charles Liang: Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon, everyone. Please refer to slide four. Let me provide with summary of our first quarter. Revenue was $529 million. It's 0.9% higher than last quarter and 1.8% higher year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $16.7 million. It's 16.9% higher than last quarter and 1.1% higher year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.32 per diluted share, compared to $0.20 last quarter and $0.32 last year. We are pleased that Super Micro was able to deploy revenues at above and probably at a higher end of our expectation for our first quarter. Last quarter, system sales were 67.6% of revenue, with 50% coming from direct customers. The key large segment that drive our systems business improved, starting with 23.5% of total revenue, up 10% from last year and 24% from last quarter, against average sales to the [indiscernible] decline in market those performed strongly. We are seeing an increased number of customers as up to all fresh NVM solution and expect strong NVM system growth in 2017. Internet data center and cloud comprised 12.8% of total revenue, down from 25% last year and down from 18% last quarter. We took some times in the past couple of quarters to review our pipeline in this segment. Now we are at with product therefore it would nice with better dilute. We are expecting win in this – in the near future in this large board of segment. Despite early fair in some margin pressure, we are confident that how datacenter will continue and grow our economical scale in last year. IoT and embedded comprised 10.7% of total revenue and was up 12.9% over last year and up 10.2% from last quarter. A key driver of our success is been the focus on that case in IoT and embedded themes that dive our business. From a geographical perspective, Europe and Asia show strong improvement from last year, with Europe contributing 21.5% of revenue and Asia contributing 18.2%. The US market was 55.0% of revenue, representing ARC balance of US and international revenue. Last quarter we discussed the restructuring of our global operation on inward ratio, including our new SAP implementation, tax restructure and bonded warehouse. This quarter was so much smoother operation and reduced impact from the transition. We expect to 100% complete of that transition in this December quarter and see sustained long-term improvement to our operational efficiency and probability. Now IoT us structural market is experiencing moderate growth according to most of the analyst. But particular segment of the market growing three to four times faster than the overall market. Most of our focus is on the faster growing market segment, like the next generation storage, high density and pre-architectural, rest to be our services embedded and IoT and X-rapid GPU computing. Not other company is better positioned in these market segment, which we are creating big growth opportunity for our business. Our portfolio of workload optimized systems deliver tangible performance and efficiency advantage and we are consistently foster to market with key new technology innovation, that enable our customer to deliver depreciative more powerful and efficient solution. Super Micro is a leader in the next generation storage market, providing NVM all fresh NVM and high storage solution to our customers, including the top storage OENs. We have most completed storage portfolio with more than 70 NVM server storage systems, that deliver all those magnitude better performance multiple times the price performance and vision and traditional storage solutions, including a simple pre-architecture and 60 page and 90 page capacity optimized storage platforms using that new tool and do the NVM interface. We continue to define the stay order at architecture by introducing the first 2U 4A fresh NVM solution with growth system and data pass redundancy bring all fresh NVM to the mission critical enterprise. As a result of our 20 year strategy and investment storage has become one of our largest revenue and faster growing segments. In Rack Scale data center we saw outstanding growth in the quarter while center introduced a micro pace of that. We have several major larger scale customers wins for micro [ph] that were based on micro combination of high performance, high density and networking and IoT efficiency. We also continue to offer most innovative multiple system portfolio including the twin family and [indiscernible] and had consistent growth of that portfolio with particularly strong growth for our micro pace. The rate IQ was special my next hearing market a gross according to most of the entities five particular segments of the Maki growing three full-time fosters in the overall market.

Let me begin with review the first quarter, please turn to slide four. Revenue was 500.9 million of 1.8% for your help about .9% sequentially. The increase in revenue last year was primarily due to our increase in specific countries, which was up 4.9%. The significant increase in sales to distributors which was up 11.6%.

Charles Liang: Thank you, Howard. In summary our outlook for December quarter, we had a fixed our seasonality expectations. The backlog in a stronger gross now much segment we expect these quarter see you contribution and nine installment demand for modest always Michael Brady and that's you accelerated computing and not be surgeon not demand in the college and innocent mall over the expecting the completion of our new global operation was we were achieve that and some improvements to our efficiency in the public. Indeed, we are very excited about phase the market opportunity. And at the other companies in a position, we in the idea was special market. Operator, at this time, we are ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Rich Kugele with Needham & Company.
Rich Kugele: Thank you. Good afternoon. A few questions, so I guess first clarification, Howard Can you repeat the growth rates for next in enterprise and HPC, HPC particular I didn't catch it sounded like it was some of the hundred percent is clarify that?
Howard Hideshima: Rich, on a year-over-year basis NextGen towards enterprise and HTC in the 36.9% next doors are .7% for 597.5% for the cable and sequential bit NextGen NextGen storage grew at 26.6% and 21.8%. Our practice is to our point okay the PC side is there any commentary you can provide likely the particular environment is going into the unique configurations you can talk to really nice with educational area would think of the 51.
Rich Kugele: With regards HPC area that was on the out the platform and was very pleased okay. And then in terms of just where we are in the process recycle. Can you talk about demand for the current series of Intel products and any in the early indications on demand for the future launches next year earlier go and 95 most have been?
Howard Hideshima: GPU and 900 and much and then you said available so we have a strong mine oboes the quarter was company and we expect that gross us to in the including not local and ENG for enterprise. We had a strongest product line that will not be the 40 great in growing model okay. And so your sense of how to LNG. Now with Nvidia and until most now we see excellent the queue. Thanks very much.
Operator: We'll go next to Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group.
Nehal Chokshi: Thank you. And congratulations on a strong quarter. Great gross margin and good guidance here. impressive the concept of datacenter sales were down 47% year-over-year and 29% to so you talk a little further about why that ourselves continues to decline on a Q-o-Q basis?
Howard Hideshima: Thank you for the kind remarks, we talked about it the quarter as we thought it build out and data centers all last year for cellulose build out that I have been gone for staying Outlook and will technology refresh and demand for your additional client into the data center again audio talk about that within our guided we have great opportunity there to grow as as we go pipeline in that area yeah. So, I like men know you have a one-off most those on the full view quarter. Mike stated, we did not I would say I'm not a couple of floods the site in the private I get into the local and the fees will be.

In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today's press release and in the supplemental information attached to today's presentation. Now, I'll turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon, everyone. Please refer to slide four through slide six. Let me provide you with the summary of our fiscal fourth quarter. Revenue was $524 million. It's 1.6% lower from last quarter and 8.6% lower year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $10.4 million. It's 45.4% lower from last quarter and 65.4% lower year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.20 per diluted share, compared to $0.36 last quarter and $0.57 last year. As previously announced, this quarter, our results was below expectation. While we continue to grow in middle-size accounts, our business has become more depend on large datacenter customers. And we had two specific large datacenter customer project that impact the quarter, reduce business from our large datacenter customers result revenue volatility, which in turn lower our manufacturing utilization globally by 14%, which had negative impact to margin and profitability. We are undergoing the restructure of our operational infrastructure, including our global SAP implementation, new global tax restructure and bonded warehouse. These investments will help to streamline the business, improve efficiency and increase profitability in long-term. But unfortunately, to lower our (05:42) costs from business is traction and slowdown in the quarter, that impact execution and pricing flexibility. We expect to complete the whole restructuring in the December quarter this year, and after that, we will be more efficient than ever before. Last quarter, system sales were 65.5% of revenue, compared to 61.7% last year, as we continue to see success in our efforts to grow the higher value total system business. The two key vertical that drive our system business are: first, Internet cloud data center, comprise 18% of total revenue, but had been temporarily slow in the past two quarters; and storage, which was 19% of total revenue, down 15% from last year. However, storage sale to hyper-converged and software-defined market was up both sequentially and year-over-year. And with our strong NVMe leadership, we expect continuous strong growth this year. From a geographical perspective, we saw mixed results. The USA market was 62.2% of revenue, and was flat with last quarter and lower by 8.6% from last year. Europe saw weaker results. It was 17.5% of revenue, slightly lower sequentially, and down by about 16% year-over-year. Asia was in the bright spot last quarter with 15.8% of revenue, up 5% quarter-over-quarter. While we did not achieve the results we want in Q4, we continue to be focused and confident in the long-term growth of our business. We continue to see the move to carve (7:55) the quick growth of IoT and rapid innovation as the drivers of our long-term growth. Our core strategy remain unchanged. First, we focus core market with new innovation and deliver the broadest choice of server and storage system in the industry. Second, emphasize strategic relationship in our key verticals and utilize our server building blocks to create the best value on our application-optimized solutions. Third, continue growth of our software and service portfolio to provide the reliable serviceability and quality for our customers. With the completion of our new global operation foundation, we will target the following specific actions to achieve a stronger growth and financial performance. We are confident that these actions will be successful and will enable us a return to strong growth. First, we will leverage our increase manufacturing capacity and improve operational efficiency to be a more flexible and competitive in winning business in our current large customers and to ensure new major customer wins. Second, we will expand our current focus on our fast-growing Internet of Things, IoT market, which cover Edge server, networking, appliance, surveillance and other embedded solutions. Slide six, please. Let me now comment on our product portfolio, which is at the heart of our strategy. Over the last few quarters, we continue to expand the product portfolio ,and we introduced a number of strong new products and innovations. First, we continue to be the industry leader in NVMe, All Flash NVMe, and hybrid storage solution. We now have more than 60 NVMe server storage systems that deliver orders of magnitude better performance, multiple times the price/performance ratio and efficiency than traditional storage solution, including the Simply Double Architecture and 60 Bay and 90 Bay high-capacity optimized storage platform. We expanded the serviceability and capability of our NVMe system with hot-swappable RAID option and UNO (10:58) dual-port systems. Second, we are ready to deliver an advanced architecture leverage in software-defined solutions, with the introduction of our Super Rack Scale Design (sic) [Supermicro Rack Scale Design] (11:12). Super Rack Scale Design (sic) [Supermicro Rack Scale Design] (11:15), we call SRSD. Now SRSD architecture leveraging our industry-leading product lines to delivery the ultimate in resource optimization on rack platform, rack form factor. This dynamic management technology will enable our data center and cloud customer, especially private cloud customers, to accelerate deployment time and to simplify their management resource overhead. We are an integral part of the deep learning, machine learning, and artificial intelligence solutions, which drive the adoption of today's big data universe structure. This quarter, we have introduced systems supporting the new Intel Xeon Phi x200 processor in both 2U, 4-node and tower form factor. When combined with Omni-Path, our EDR fabric, that delivers incredible performance, that made the research effort possible for more students, professors and the industry. Moreover, we introduced 1U (12:34) NVIDIA Pascal GPU solution, which is capable of supporting up to four P100 GPU – Pascal GPU I mean, in a slim form factor. We recently delivered a solution to rather university, leveraging the Omni-Path networking, that was recognized as one of the best top 500 HPC cluster. This solution also optimized for transcoding and streaming compression. Our IoT business provides one of the brightest spot this quarter. The worldwide IoT market is growing at about 11%, according to IDC. And our IoT business grew even faster, at about 30% last year, and now account for about 10% of our total revenue, at about $200 million. We can invest R&D resource initially in industrial PC, core IPC, and IoT gateway products. And now we have hundreds of optimized IoT and embedded solutions in just three short years, providing a complete product portfolio from the Edge to the cloud. Just recently, we increased R&D investment, expanding our product line, providing a new, really low power and really small form factor IoT solutions, which successfully engage with customer in medical image, security, surveillance, manufacturing and retail, automation. In short, we expect to see a hopefully more than 30% growth in IoT and embedded market this coming fiscal year. In summary, we had never seen a stronger in term of our product portfolio and our global operation in automation have been significantly improving. We know the urgency to improve and we are leveraging all of our strengths and capacity to create a competitive value proposition for our customers. We are investing more effort in our strategic relationship, building stronger presence in key markets and continue to develop a new customer in target vertical. We are confident these action will result in a greater improvement of our financial performance, when we go into the new fiscal year. For more specific on the fourth quarter, let me turn it over to Howard.
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Charles, and good afternoon, everyone. I will focus my remarks on earnings, gross margins, operating expenses and similar items on a non-GAAP basis, which reflects adjustments to exclude stock compensation expenses. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company in today's earnings release and in the supplemental detail in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Let me begin with a review of the fourth quarter income statement. Please turn to slide nine. Revenue was $524.3 million, down 8.6% from the same quarter a year ago and down 1.6% sequentially. The decrease in revenue from last year was primarily due to our decrease in subsystems and accessories, which was down 17.6%, and a decrease in sales to distributors which was down 14.8%. These are offset in part by growth in HPC, cloud Internet datacenter and next-gen storage of 93%, 6% and 9% respectively. On a geographical basis, we had a decrease in Europe of 15.9%, followed by U.S. at 8.6%, while Asia was about flat. The sequential decrease in revenue was primarily due to weakness in server solutions, which was down 7.8% due to less sales from our cloud Internet datacenter segment, which was down 31%, offset in part by strength in our subsystems business, which was up 12.9%. In addition, next-gen storage grew at 10.8%. On a geographical basis, we had a decrease in the other regions of 31%, primarily due to our cloud Internet datacenter projects. Europe was down 1.8%. U.S. was flat while Asia was up 5.2%. Slide 10, turning to product mix, the proportion of revenues from server systems was 65.5% of the total revenues, which was up from 61.7% the same quarter a year ago and down from 69.9% last quarter. ASP for servers was $4,100 per unit, which is the same as last year and down from $4,400 last quarter. We shipped approximately 84,000 servers in the quarter and 1,165,000 subsystems and accessories. We continue to maintain a diverse revenue base with over 800 customers. No customers represent more than 10% of our quarterly revenues. Cloud Internet datacenter revenue was 18.1%, which was a decrease from 26% in the prior quarter and an increase from 15.5% in the prior year. 62.2% of our revenues came from the U.S. and 46.8% from our distributors and resellers. Slide 11. Non-GAAP gross profit was $74.1 million, down 17.7% from $90 million in the same quarter last year and down 6.7% from $79.4 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, gross margin was 14.1%, down from 15.7% a year ago and down from 49.9% sequentially. Price changes from Ablecom resulted in no-basis-point change to the gross profit in the quarter, with total purchases representing approximately 12.4% of total cost of goods sold, compared to 11.9% a year ago and 12.2% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease in gross margin results from lower utilization of our global capacity, which is about 50%, compared to about 70% a year ago. This resulted in appropriately 0.5% effect on gross margins. The other 0.3% is attributable to higher inventory reserves on product transitions. Sequentially, gross margin was down due to about 0.3% from lower utilization of our global capacity, which was about 50% to about 60% last quarter. In addition, 0.3% and 0.2% are attributable to higher warranty and inventory reserves on product transition, respectively. Slide 12 and 13, operating expenses were $57.9 million, up from $45.3 million in the same quarter a year ago and up from $51.1 million sequentially. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses was 11%, which is up from 7.9% in the same quarter a year ago and up from 9.6% sequentially. Operating expenses were higher on an absolute dollar basis year-over-year primarily in R&D, as we invested in personnel expenses and materials to support the development of our total solutions. Sequentially, operating expenses were higher due to higher material and testing fees of about $2.9 million, and higher marketing and trade show cost of $2.7 million to support the development and sale of new products. The company's head count increased by 88 sequentially to 2,699 total employees, primarily in R&D. Our forecast for the next quarter, we do expect operating expenses to decrease as we expect to leverage the investments we have already made, offset in part by annual salary increases. Operating profit was $16.2 million down by 63.8% from $44.8 million a year ago and down from 42.8% from $28.3 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, operating margin was 3.1%, down from 7.8% a year ago and down from 5.3% sequentially. We will increase our efforts to add additional value to our solutions for our customers, while at the same time, leveraging investments we have made during the past year. Net income was $10.4 million, down 65.4% from $30 million a year ago and down 45.4% from $19 million sequentially. Our non-GAAP fully diluted EPS was $0.20 per share, down from $0.57 per share a year ago and down from $0.36 per share sequentially. The number of fully diluted shares used in the fourth quarter was 52,955,000. The tax rate in the fourth quarter on a non-GAAP basis was 34.4%, compared to 32.6% a year ago and 32% sequentially. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2016 was higher due to higher tax expenses associated with the implementation of the company's new global corporate structure on May 1, 2016. The impact was about $0.06 per diluted share. We expect the impact to be about $0.04 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and to decline as we continue to grow our business offshore and shift our existing offshore customers, who are serviced from the U.S. to locations overseas. We expect our effective tax rate to be 40% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and to decrease as we go forward through the fiscal year. Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis, slide 14. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments were $183.7 million, up $4.6 million from $179.1 million in the prior quarter and up $85.6 million from $98.1 million in the same quarter last year. In the fourth quarter, free cash flow was $5.7 million, primarily due to a decrease in inventory of $27 million, and net income of $7 million, offset in part by a decrease in accounts payable of $31.1 million. Slide 15. Accounts receivable increased by $3.2 million to $288.9 million due to lower revenue sequentially. Day sales outstanding was 50 days, a decrease of one day from 51 days in the prior quarter. Inventory decreased by $30.3 million to $449 million from the lower forecasted revenues. Days in inventory were 94; a decrease of three days from 97 in the prior quarter. Accounts payable was $249.2 million, which was 53 days, a decrease of seven days from 60 days in the prior quarter. Overall, cash conversion cycle days was 91 days, which is three days higher than the prior quarter. Now for a few comments on outlook. As we enter fiscal year 2017, we look to leverage the investments we have made in our operations, such as our SAP implementation, global reorganization, and new facilities, while containing through our expenses to drive growth and profitability in a seasonally weak quarter for the industry. Therefore, the company currently expects our net sales for the quarter ending September 30, 2016 in a range of $470 million to $550 million. Assuming this revenue range, the company currently expects non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.15 to $0.30 for the quarter. At the midpoint of this, it would represent a decrease of 2% of revenue and a 30% decrease in EPS for the prior year. Looking forward beyond this quarter, we have updated our targets for the coming two years to be 15% to 17% in gross margin and 6% to 8% on operating margin. These targets reflect our strategy to take advantage of the opportunities we have to take market share and keep disciplined control of our operating costs. On July 18, 2016 the company also announced the company's board of directors had adopted a program to repurchase from time-to-time, at management's discretion, up to $100 million of the company's common stock in the open market or in private transactions during the next 12 months at prevailing market rates. To-date, we have purchased 513,194 shares, totaling about $10.3 million at an average price of $19.97. We certainly expect that the outlook will not be updated until the release of the company's next quarterly earnings announcement. Notwithstanding subsequent developments, however, the company will update the outlook, or any portion thereof, at any time. With that, let me turn it back to Charles for some closing remarks.
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Thank you, Howard. For the entire fiscal year, we saw 11% revenue growth for the year, which means Super Micro is still one of the fastest-growing company in the IT industry. We are much better positioned with our new global SAP implementation, new global operation, and corporate tax restructure and bonded warehouse. Despite softening of our revenue and the temporary setback of our operation this quarter, our long-term growth trend remain intact, based on our even stronger product portfolio, and we are looking forward to a strong new fiscal year. Operator, at this time, we are ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, our question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. And we'll go first to Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. My first question is for Charles. I'm looking at your slide number seven, and I don't see the new server CPU architecture like a Skylake-M. Is that having an impact on your ability to forecast? And how this changes in both CPU and graphics are impacting your server business? And I have a follow-up.
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Okay. Thank you. I mean, we have a lots of new design just available like Intel Xeon Phi. We will start to ship high volume now and also like NVIDIA Pascal, we have a product fully ready to ship about this month, I mean, August. And as to Skylake, yes, we have very strong product portfolio, which is also a new architecture. And, unfortunately, it's a product for next year. We have been developing this product line for almost nine months, while daily (28:59) production it will be next year, maybe around summer timeframe.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group: Okay. And then follow-up question for Howard. Can you please provide some color on a unit and ASP for both server and subsystem segments?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Sure. On the units side of it, for servers, Mehdi, it was 84,000 units for server units shipped during the quarter. The ASPs were about $4,100. On the units for our subsystem and accessories that was about 1,164,000 and quite frankly, I didn't divide out the numbers there with regards to that. It's a mix of number of different things that's really hard to gauge with the ASP there. So we've never given that out.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group: Sure. And so, did you 1,160,000 units?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: 1,164,000 units.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group: Okay. Thank you.
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Sure.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Aaron Rakers with Stifel.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, thanks. Thanks for taking the questions. Two as well, real quick. So first of all, as you guys go through – it sounds like a realignment and focus on operational efficiencies. Can you just remind us again where you stand in terms of your manufacturing footprint? And whether or not these efforts have included any reduction of that manufacturing footprint at this point?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Yes. Thank you for the question. Basically, it's a big transition, right? Not just SAP implementation global-wide, but also a big impact from our restructure for our production, operation and also global tax, new season. And we also created a bonded warehouse, new bonded warehouse that kind of limited a lot of production decision (30:55). And I would have to say that most impact that people had to pay attention to the new system, prepare (31:03) product here and there, and that's why it slowdown our business a little bit.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay.
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: But as for our position, especially, we already finished, I'd rather say that at least 90% job already finished. And in next few months, we will finish everything. And hopefully, the system becomes perfect in early Q4 this year, and after that, our operations should be much more efficient thereafter.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Maybe to ask it a little bit differently. Your updated two-year kind of target models 15% to 17% gross margin, can you help us frame of, what it would take to get to the midpoint of that gross margin range from a utilization perspective from your manufacturing?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: So I think – as you look at my utilization numbers this past quarter, we had gone to about 70% last year about the same quarter in the fourth quarter. And that's moving down to about 50%. This past quarter, you saw about 30 basis points of movement there. So as you go forward, Aaron, as we increase our efficiencies and what have you, you can see that type of impact to our margins with regard to as we increase our utilization and improve our utilization. So I'd frame it in that way going forward. Anywhere from 30 basis points to 50 basis points, I think, you see them wide spreads on the – in my commentary on utilization.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And I'll flip one final thing and just housekeeping, no 10% customers in this quarter, did I hear that correctly?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: That is correct.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Mark Kelleher with D.A. Davidson.
Mark D. Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I want to focus on the storage side. I'm not sure, I heard everything you were saying about that. Down 15% year-over-year, I think you said, and hyper-converged was strong, I think I heard. Could you just review what you're seeing in storage and what your expectations are going forward?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Yeah. The drop of overall storage revenue, I believe, major is about two customers. So we compete with aggressive price from our competition. And because of SAP implementation, I would have to say we are a little bit too slow to dynamically respond to the price competition. So we lost to some big peer there. And this will be (33:38) the reason I believe. However, for hyper-converged, in our software-defined storage, we'll be globally (33:48) though basically. And I believe we will continue to grow very strong in hyper-convergence in software-defined storage. Even for regular storage, I believe, we will recover to peak growth very soon.
Mark D. Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: So that was more of a market share loss there rather than a weakness on the...
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Yes. In last quarter, we kind of a little bit too slow in an enterprise response.
Mark D. Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. Great. Thanks.
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Rich Kugele with Needham & Company.
Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Thank you. In terms of the Internet datacenter side, do you believe that now with a different margin profile, you would be able to regain business on that side. And how does it work from an ordering cadence? Do they typically order transactionally active every quarter or is it more lumpy than that?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. Rich, this is Howard. With regards to that, we've always said that the cloud Internet datacenter has been more project-based, as we're bringing up datacenters from quarter to quarter, or what have you, so it is project based per se. And some of that accounts for some of the – what range that we put on this quarter. We do have some projects that are either going to be this quarter or next quarter, and we're still waiting to see if – when those are going to occur. But it is project based.
Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Yeah. And the business that you lost in the quarter, they don't have any issues with your technology or your value proposition right? Is this entirely just basically price or being responsive?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Yes. I would like to say in term of technology, in term of product portfolio, we feel much stronger than before. But yes, in term of price competition, especially dynamic price support, dynamic local support we were (35:51) in that quarter.
Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. And, well, I'll take it – all fine. Thanks. Take care.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Brian Alger with ROTH Capital Partners.
Brian Alger - ROTH Capital Partners LLC: Good afternoon, guys. Kind of want to follow-up on the same train of thought. Just trying to get an understanding of what really went on in the prior quarter. It sounds as though pricing was the primary issue here and you weren't responsive to the changes in the marketplace. I'm trying to understand what shifted from the competitive landscape and what lesson has been learned that it won't happen in the future?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: I believe the relationship has to be further improved. Kind of when customer asking for lower price, our people did not response quickly enough. And because it's the first time we faced such a big impact, so we then (36:54) – the whole company (36:57). We – come our new system. The good thing is new SAP system now we have with us, much easier to calculate our (37:05), so we can response to customer quicker as well. And with our capacity now much bigger, right, so we are more willing to support certain product much more aggressively.
Brian Alger - ROTH Capital Partners LLC: Okay. So I guess I'm looking at a bit of history here and that the hyperscale customers that have driven a lot of a growth for your company over the past couple of years, they have a track record of being very aggressive on pricing. And what I guess, I'm hearing, and I want to make sure I'm hearing it correctly is that, in the future, you're going to be better positioned to react to that price aggression, which may allow us to retain the revenues but would that not negatively impact the gross margin profile of the future revenues?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: I think – Brian, this is Howard. With regards to that, again, given that we have some excess capacity or additional capacity right now, it allows us to kind of balance out some of those. We may give up a bit on pricing, but we will fill up the plant and reduce the overhead burden that we have by filling it up.
Brian Alger - ROTH Capital Partners LLC: Okay. And, Howard, do you get the sense that anything has shifted from the competitive landscape in that your competitors' ability to customize or to deliver feature-rich products has shifted such that your – the advantages – the strategic advantages of the business and its flexibility have altered at all?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, with regards to our products, I think, Charles has said already. We still believe we provide the best solutions and best values out there, bar none, from any of our competitors out there.
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Especially, like NVMe, kind of like a dual-port (39:04) NVMe, kind of a like BigTwin (39:06) our new accelerator is coming very soon. And, kind of, I just mentioned that our Super Rack Scale Design (sic) [Supermicro Rack Scale Design] (39:12) [indiscernible] (39:14) and indeed we saw customer engage very well with our new design.
Brian Alger - ROTH Capital Partners LLC: Okay. Great. I appreciate the candor, guys. Thank you.
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Alex Kurtz with Pacific Crest Securities.
Alex Kurtz - Pacific Crest Securities: Hey, guys. Can you hear me, okay?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Yes.
Alex Kurtz - Pacific Crest Securities: Okay. Great. I just want to follow-up on Brian's question, because I think it's really important that – well, first of all, was the competitive loss in the quarter really localized to one or two customers? I jumped on the call late, so I'm sorry if I missed that. Or was it misses across a host of customers in the web scale market?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. It was just a couple of customers, Alex.
Alex Kurtz - Pacific Crest Securities: Okay. And, Howard, I think, as Brian alluded to, and I think it's a really great question is, historically, you guys have always positioned yourself as the application-optimized technology that would maybe be next to an ODM kind of server, right? And you guys added more value. And I guess, what I'm trying to understand here is, was there some very specific situations with those two accounts in the quarter, or is there a sort of like a bigger trend happening with that business, and with that vertical?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: I guess, for that couple customer, it's purely because of our – I would like to say, a little bit too relax. Sorry to say that, but we should response more aggressively and more dynamically, in term of what customer really need. But to answer your question of application-optimized, yes, we, indeed we've become much stronger than before even, like our NVMe, now the strongest product line in the world, that our (41:13) between the (41:16) design. All kind of, we show customer the advantage from Super Micro. And also I mentioned about our IoT product line, which we grew about 30% last year. This exactly a better margin, a better profit margin product line. And we started to invest aggressively about three years ago, and last year – first year we see a such a strong growth. And we believe in the next coming many years, we will continue to invest more on IoT embedded.
Alex Kurtz - Pacific Crest Securities: Okay. We'll talk a little bit more offline. Thank you very much.
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group.
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC: Thank you. I do have a few questions, and I will move to the question of the day. But before I do that, I think you did provide some color around what you expect for OpEx for next quarter. Can you just review that again?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Hi. I mentioned that we are – we do expect to see a decrease in our op expenses for next quarter.
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC: Okay. And so, should we be thinking that gross margin will be effectively flat Q-over-Q, or are you guys trying – still trying to say, given you have a very large range for revenue and EPS, but if we take the midpoint, are you guys trying to imply that we should expect gross margin to move up slightly Q-over-Q, or should that be flat to actually down?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Well, I think we haven't given gross margin guidance out there. Certainly, we have – we're doing our best to maintain gross margins, but as Charles mentioned, we're going to be looking at our pricing and our flexibility there as well, to grow our market share, as we always have.
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC: Okay.
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: But I guess start from December quarter, right? Start from October, for example, as our SAP global re-org become much more stable, become more ready. Our iteration (43:26) will grow and our volume per share will grow.
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC: Okay.
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: And that will improve our profit margin...
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC: That's correct.
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: ...and overall profitability.
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC: Right. And then, you have a wider-than-usual revenue guidance, and I assume that's a result of a reduced visibility. Can you talk about what parts of the business are you seeing that reduced visibility with?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Still, I mean, that our big data center customer, we try to be more cautious this time, because from last quarter, we experienced the first time bigger impact, we tried to be more conservative.
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC: Okay. Now, with respect to the question about being more nimble with your pricing, are you explicitly just simply talking about lowering your pricing, get your utilization up, and therefore that will offset some of your – that will (44:24) allow you to basically have that volume without actually impacting the overall gross margin, because you'll be driving your utilization up, or are you actually talking about more nimbly configuring the products to what the customer needs, to what the competition has out there, to be more optimal in terms of your COGS configuration, and therefore still win the deal?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: I guess it is a combination, plus, now, we have a much stronger manufacture capacity in offshore. So once we are able to leverage that need for CET (45:01) in offshore, then we will know our overall operation and manufacture cost.
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC: Okay, all right. And then Howard, that financial framework that you gave out for gross margin and operating margin, did I hear that correctly, 15% to 17% and operating margin of 6% to 8% over the next two years?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: That's correct.
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC: Okay. And now, when you say over the next two years, are you essentially saying that this is something that we should be thinking about for fiscal year 2018, and fiscal year 2017 will represent an on-ramp towards that model?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: It's a target model out there two years.. now.
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC: Okay. All right. And while you didn't have a 10% customer within the quarter, did you still have a 10% customer for the full fiscal year?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Yes. We did.
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And we have a follow-up question from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group: Yes. Just looking at the revenue mix, your datacenter revenues have been declining and for the two consecutive quarters. And I'm just trying to better understand, is the ASP pressure coming from this is specific segment or is it more in the core server business? And I have one more follow-up.
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Mehdi, this is Howard. With regards to the ASPs, again it's a combination of all of our business. 18% of our business to the (46:34) was Internet datacenter part of it, and you know, there is still another 80%, 82% that's other business areas. So again, it's a combination of all. With regards to that, the last couple of quarters from 26% to 18% (46:49), again we haven't lost any customers, we're still competitive, it's just projects.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group: Okay. And then...
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: And then, we said, we would try to win those customer back and create more new customer.
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: That's correct.
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: I believe that once our global operations system really stabilize, we will become a bit aggressive in that area.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group: Okay. And then with the embedded segment becoming 10% of your revenue, are you going break this out going forward so we could better model this?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Yeah. IoT will be a very strong territory for us. Again, with our application-optimized as building blocks vision (47:38), we are in a very good position to grow in IoT embedded market. And last year, again, first time we separated product line.
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Yes.
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: And we saw a 30% growth. This year, no reason we cannot grow more than 30%.
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: So we'll be providing color going forward on and as a separate product line.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group: Okay. Great. And Howard one for you, the cash cycle went up by three days. Any particular reason here?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: It's more align to the lower balances underneath, the dividers. We had lower revenues.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group: Okay.
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And we have a question from Brian Alger with ROTH Capital Partners.
Brian Alger - ROTH Capital Partners LLC: As a follow-up on the declining revenues from the datacenter segment, that end-market itself hasn't seen a decline in demand. Obviously, it's been one of the fastest-growing segments within IT hardware in general, which clearly implies that you guys are losing share to someone, somewhere, even if it's project oriented. Who is gaining market share at your expense and is it purely on price?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: I guess a combination of price and also our response to customer demand. So we have really learned a big lesson how to work with customer closer to response customer demand quicker. So that area, for sure, we very aggressively done and I believe we are ready for that. As to the cost price competition, and that's another reason why we restructured our global operation and production facility. And pretty much, we already are, I would like to say 90% finish. So within next few months, we will have a much stronger operation manufacturer facility and cost structure in Asia. So then we will support our growth in large datacenter business.
Brian Alger - ROTH Capital Partners LLC: I guess, Charles, the question I have is, who is winning if you're losing? Is it the traditional large OEMs like Dell and HP that historically have been lethargic and unresponsive and not having dynamic product portfolios? Are they winning now-a-days? Or have we seen the lower, more simpler ODMs, the Compals, Foxconns, Hon Hai et cetera of the worlds improve in terms of their system expertise, moving up the food chain, to be more competitive against you?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Basically we saw some from Asia.
Brian Alger - ROTH Capital Partners LLC: Okay. Thank you. I appreciate the help.
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Yeah. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our final question today from Aaron Rakers with Stifel.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for the follow-up. Two real quick questions. First of all, can you talk – there has been a lot of talk in the market about component pricing, particularly around drives, but also in the memory space. Have we seen pressures and would you expect pressures from an upward pricing environment on the components to the gross margin line over the next couple of quarters?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Yeah. We see some change. I mean, it looks like the market is kind of – nothing is stable, right? So Q3, maybe, the cost will be a little bit higher, but how much we are higher and what would be the trend, we still pay a close watch. And we try to – we are prepared, I believe, as the market is changing.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then the final question for me would be, in the past, you've talked about kind of the trajectory of how you thought you could grow your revenue. And I think in the framework of the model that you provided 2015 to 2017 at 6% to 8%, I'm curious of how you see, if you look out over the next couple of years, what kind of revenue levels supports let's say the midpoint or even the low-end of that target model range?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Yeah, I mean we still are very – we'll try to be very aggressive to grow our revenue, and that's by end of 2017, we still try to (52:15) revenue, and then we'll have the scale, we will have our cost. And also by a transition production, expanding to Asia now we have our cost (52:28) as well.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So I'm really clear here, so you're saying, you expect to be at an annual run rate of $3 billion exiting fiscal 2017.
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: By December, December 2017.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Of the calendar year, okay?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Calendar year, yes.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, thank you.
Operator: And that does conclude the question-and-answer session of our conference. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Liang for any closing remarks.
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman: Yes, thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you, everyone. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude the Super Micro fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 conference call. We do appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you.

Charles Liang: Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to slide four. First, let me provide you with the highlights of our fiscal third quarter. Our revenue was $532.7 million, it’s 16.6% over from that quarter and 13.1% higher year-over-year. Year-to-date revenue grew 19% over the same third quarter period last year. Non-GAAP net income was $19 million it’s 15% from last quarter and 23.8% lower year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.36 per diluted share compared to $0.73 last quarter and $0.47 last year. In the seasonally weaker second quarter, we saw softer market demand than anticipated therefore results for this quarter were at the low end over our revenue due to some softness with some key customers. January and February were particular while March show improved momentum. However, revenue continues to grow at industry leading pace by growing 13.1% over last year. This growth was led by our two strongest segment of [indiscernible] and cloud as well as storage. We’re confident that Super Micro will continue to consistently gain market share and grow multiple times by industry’s growth rate. Strategically, we remain focused on our core market with the cloud and storage which are growing faster than the overall market. In addition we continue to grow our computer system business mostly through our direct sales. Computer Systems Incorporated over a component into a turnkey solutions deliver our data customer experience high revenue and value and account for 70% of our total revenue in the quarter. Internet data center and cloud was 26% of total revenue, up 40% year-over-year. We’re participating in the overall move to the cloud with our key customers in this segment including several order in global cloud data centers. We continue to work closely with these leading cloud industry providers at a scale as well as key new projects leveraging innovative new technologies such as [indiscernible] architecture. We’re very committed to winning in the cloud segment and new designs and architectures to be critical opportunity moving forward. Storage was 21% of total revenue and grew more than 23% year-over-year. Our storage sales to cloud and enterprise customers grew 30% and our sales grew hyper-converged system suppliers who combine our system into their product grew 14%. Our storage products are the best fit for open source software defined storage and all flash NVMe solutions. The application optimize billion box architecture provides the best performance and efficiency for big data and cloud open stack solutions. Our storage solution recently received the innovative [indiscernible] award from IT brand survey. This award acknowledges Super Micro over innovation in system for software defined storage. Slide 5, our core server business remains strong, we continue to be the industry leader in all flash NVMe solutions and are investing to rapidly expand our ecosystem. We now have more than 50 NVMe ready server storage systems to meet the need of any work load. Super Micro’s NVMe solutions actually [indiscernible] and deliver multiple times price performance ratio advantage, our traditional data or SSB solution. The twin portfolio as well as other products reached high record in March. We’ve introduced SIOM networking options of core 1G, 10G, 25G and up to 100G ports for [indiscernible] and Intel based connectivity. At the end of our third quarter we launched the industry’s portfolio, our server and storage systems based on the new Intel GM E5 2600 [indiscernible]. We introduced new products across our entire portfolio of Super server, super storage, super workstation and CPUP manageable products over 200 billion box solutions, we provide customers early [indiscernible] through Q3 to see at our market and expect these new systems to be adopted by our customer base. We continue to expand our product offering and innovation for our rapidly growing storage business. Our storage systems and industry [indiscernible] 48 basis with second of easy access externally driver base. A rate in the patent began shipping in [indiscernible] continue the strong adaption of our maximum capacity for united [indiscernible] storage systems. This system can drive up to nine petabyte per 40 -- and we expanded the offerings with [indiscernible] and storage server option. To address the strong demand and opportunity for embedded and internet solutions we have expanded our product lines with new Intel GM processor SOC and system enabling new cold, warm and hot storage. IOT gateway and compact server providing complete IOT portfolio from the edge to cloud. Our server management sort of in global service continues to be some of our highest margin product lines and continue to grow multiple times faster than the rest of business. The global services business is implementing through year, amortization beginning to compound and improve economical scale for business. Our software defined total solutions based on open industry standard and industry leadings partners continue to grow at accelerated rate quarter over quarter. We announced seven new software defined storage and cloud solution in the quarter delivering end to end solutions with industry medium partners. Slide six please. Geographically United States was 61.3% revenue and was up 19.3% year-over-year. Europe was 17.5% of total revenue and up 5.7% year-over-year. In Asia revenue were 14.7% of the total revenue and up 5% year-over-year. We are seeing that our strategy of folks in North America and Europe is paying dividends income of overall future growth and profitability. We are continuing our global expansion completing new construction phase of our green computing park in Silicon Valley and utilization in our recently expanded European production facilities. Operationally we have managed to get investments in our SAP transition global operation impacts –optimization. Our OY factory utilization rate is about 30%, sorry 60% with extra capacity ready to support our future growth and profitability. We anticipate that this one-time investment will deliver short term and long term benefits to our scale and profitability. In summary our third quarter growth still greatly outpace overall industry growth. Strategically we are well position with both our extensive new product portfolio and our focus in the higher growth storage and cloud solutions. For more specific on the third quarter let me turn it over to Hayes.
Howard Hideshima: Thank you, Charles and good afternoon everyone. I will focus my remarks on earnings, gross margins, operating expenses and similar items on a non-GAAP basis to reflect adjustment to exclude compensation expenses. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company and today's earnings release and in the supplemental detail in the slide presentation accompanying the conference call. Let me begin with the review of the third quarter income statement. Please turn to slide eight. Revenue was $532.7 million, up 13.1% from the same quarter a year ago, and down 16.6% sequentially. The increase in revenues from last year was primarily due to our increase in Server Solutions, which was up 23.3% led by our growth in cloud datacenter of 14.4% and storage of 23.3% year-over-year. On a geographic basis, we had strong growth in the U.S., up 19.3%, as well as growth in parts of Europe and Asia. Our Services and Software business has also grown by 147% which continues to show investments we have made in developing our complete solutions platforms are ramping. The sequential decrease in revenues was primarily due to seasonal weakness and software demand from larger customers. Our direct customer business was down 22%, and our distributor revenue was down 9%. Complete Servers was down 17.9%, and subsystems and accessory business was down 13.4%. And our cloud datacenter business was decreased by 27.1%. Turning to product mix. The proportion of revenues from server systems was 69.9% of total revenues, which was up from 64.1% in the same quarter a year ago and down from 71% last quarter. ASPs per servers was $4,400 per unit, which is up from $3,900 last year and consistent with last quarter. We shipped approximately 85,000 servers in the quarter and 950,000 subsystems and accessories. We continue to maintain a diverse revenue base with over 700 customers. One customer did represent more than 10% of our quarterly revenues at 10.2% cloud datacenter revenues was 26% and storage with 20.7% of quarterly revenues. 61.3% of our revenues came from the US and 45.6% from our distributors and resellers. Slide ten, Non-GAAP gross profit was $79.4 million, up 3.1% from $77 million in the same quarter last year, and down 25.5% from $106.6 million sequentially. On percentage basis, gross margin was 14.9% for the quarter. Price changes from Abelcom resulted in no-basis-point change to the gross profit in the quarter, with total purchases representing approximately 12.2% of total cost of goods sold, compared to 14.7% a year ago, and 13.4% sequentially. Gross margins of 14.9% is lower than prior year's gross margin of 16.3% primarily due to lower utilization given the additional investments we have made for our future growth and product mix such as [DCO] servers which were sold which we sold more of this year. Gross margin sequentially was lower primarily due to seasonally and seasonality and lower utilization on a worldwide basis. Utilization on a worldwide basis was about 60% where it has been above 6% sequentially and in the same quarter last year. Taiwan utilization was 51.4% versus 51.2% sequentially and 46.4% in the same quarter last year. Lower utilization was primarily due to reduced revenue as noted above and from the recently added capacity to support the future growth of the company in the US and other ones. These additions are consistent with our strategy go further in other parts of the US as well as increase our presence in Europe. The utilization is based on using a single shift, we do have opportunities to use second shift before making additional investment and further leverage our existing investments. Slide 11 and 12. Operating expenses were $51.1 million, up from $42 million in the same quarter a year ago and down from $53.5 million sequentially. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses was 9.6%, which is up from 8.9% in the same quarter a year ago and up from 8.4% sequentially. Operating expenses were higher on an absolute dollar basis year-over-year primarily in personnel expenses to support development of our new products such as our MicroBlade and Simply Double Storage Solution, as well as our software and support services. Infrastructure investments also for going live on January 1, in the Netherlands and Taiwan on SAT and to launch the corporate reorganization on May 1 to better service our customers overseas have also been made. Sequentially, operating expenses were lower due to lower marketing and advertising expense and a difference in foreign exchange gain or loss of approximately 0.8 million The company increased headcount by 86 sequentially to 2,567 total employees. Operating profit was $28.3 million, down by 19.1% from $35 million a year ago and down from 46.7.9% from $53.1 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, operating margin was 5.3%, down from 7.4% a year ago and down from 8.3% sequentially. Net income was $19 million, down 23.8% from $24.9 million a year ago and down 50% from $38 million sequentially. Our non-GAAP fully-diluted EPS was $0.36 per share, down from $0.47 per share a year ago, and down from $0.73 per share sequentially. The number of fully-diluted shares used in the third quarter was 53,119,000. The tax rate in the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis was 32%, compared to 28.3% a year ago, and 28% sequentially. The rate was higher sequentially, primarily due to the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in December 2015. We expect the effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis to be approximately 31.6% for the June quarter. The company will go live on a global restructuring on May 1, in order to more efficiently support this foreign customer base as such we do expect to see change to our tax rate in the coming years.  Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis, slide 13. Cash and cash equivalents in short- and long-term investments were $179.1 million, up $6.5 million from $172.6 million in the prior quarter; and up $67.1 million from $112 million in the same quarter last year. In third quarter, free cash flow was negative $4 million, primarily due capital expenditures of 9.9 million offsetting part by cash from operating activity of 5.9 million. We are working on executing our loan facilities [indiscernible] growth of the company both domestically and abroad. Slide 14. Accounts receivable decreased by $28.5 million sequentially to $285.7 million, due to lower revenues in the seasoning quarter. DSO was 51 days an increase of seven days for 44 days in the prior quarter. Inventory decreased by $7.3 million sequentially to $479.3 million, days in inventories was 97 an increase of 15 days from 82 days in the prior quarter. Accounts payable was $277.3 million, which was 60 days, an increase of 10 days from 50 days in the prior quarter. Overall, cash conversion cycle days was 88 days, which is 12 days higher than the prior quarter and was primarily driven by lower revenue and cost [indiscernible]. Now, for few comments on our outlook. In the third quarter, we grew about 13.1% in a seasonally weak quarter in which we continue to expand our product lines when live on SAT overseas and compared for corporate reorganization. Year-to-date our revenue growth is 19.3% for the year as we enter the fourth quarter, we see ramping of the Broadwell launch in a traditionally seasonally strong rev quarter for the industry. However, we are cautious of the current macroeconomic environment. Therefore the company currently expects next sales per quarter ending June 30, 2016 in the range of 580 to 640 million assuming this revenue range the company expects non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.46 to $0.58 per share for the quarter. At the midpoint this will represent a growth of 6% of revenue and negative 9% in EPS from the prior year. This will also represent a growth of 16% in revenues and negative 11% in EPS for the fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015. We have made many investments during the past year on our structure as SAP in our corporate reorganization. Two additional facilities are brought in domestically to technology to broaden our solutions, software and service platforms. We believe that many of these investments will put us in a great position to capitalize on the opportunities we see ahead and further expand our business and grow the profitability globally. It's currently expected that the outlook will not be updated until the release of the company's next quarterly earnings announcement. Now with outstanding subsequent development however, the company may update the outlook or any portion there are at any time. With that let me turn it back over to Charles for some closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Howard. We see significant opportunities with Super Micro to continue our industry leading growth in the next quarter and long term. We are actively participating and leading the IT evolution to the cloud. We are helping the market to accelerate the shift to software defined big data and cloud based solutions. With our extensive application up to many product portfolio and first to marketing innovation., we are well positioned for solid growth in the long term and will continue to outpace overall industry growth story. Operator at this time we are ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we will first go to Aaron Rakers with Stifel.
Joseph Quatrochi: Okay, great. This is Joe Quatrochi on for Aaron. Maybe couple of questions if I could. First kind of going back to some of the utilization that you are talking about, how do we think about your investments and your manufacturing footprint, you’ve outlined over the past several quarters relative to the demand environment that you are seeing currently and then kind of in connection with that are you still supporting the 3 billion revenue target?
Charles Liang : Very good question. Indeed we have been very aggressively expanding our global operation including Asia and Europe. And that’s why we are in better on those factors for CT, to hire people, train people and now our utilization rate although only 60% now we believe that we’ll continue to grow quickly. And as to 3 billion target I guess it won’t be too far away maybe in one or two quarter from our original expectation because of our macro economy.
Joseph Quatrochi: So just I’m clear that pushed out from fiscal 2017 and into the fisca1 year over the course?
Charles Liang : Yes, maybe from two quarter to end of calendar year 2017.
Joseph Quatrochi: Okay thank you that's helpful. And then just one more if I could can you maybe talk about the demand that you are seeing for Broadwell and then maybe the timing of [indiscernible]?
Charles Liang : Yes, I mean we [indiscernible] much better performance per dollar and perform well, we did see quicker growth and together we saw NVMe kind of available across our product line, we did, we do expect quicker growth with our NVMe solutions.
Joseph Quatrochi: Thank you.
Charles Liang : Thank you. 
Operator: And we will next go to Mark Kelleher with D.A. Davidson.
Mark Kelleher: Great, thanks for taking the question. If we look at, let me start at the revenue line if we look at the strong December you guys posted was there an element of pulling in of orders do you think from the March quarter and if the follow-on to that you lifted a lot of areas that were very strong where were some area that were weak whether products or regions and then could you specifically talk about how your government business is doing? Thanks. 
Howard Hideshima: Hey Mark, this is Howard. Yes with regards to [indiscernible] to say in the quarter between as December and March quarter there was no that I say I think the seasonality is really the big story between the two quarters. Again December quarter was seasonally strong as it was for the industry and quite frankly for ourselves as well then there is some softness that happens right after that in the March quarter. The big difference between the two quarters is primarily seasonality but we did see some softness in some of our customers as well.
Mark Kelleher: Any particular vertical?
Howard Hideshima: I think you saw that like I said, if you want to call it was pretty wide spread around variety of different markets that we talked about here.
Charles Liang : Especially big data center, pricing it would be more competition that's something we saw.
Howard Hideshima: Yes, we talked a little bit about the product mix with regards to selling more datacenter optimized products, the DC products that refer to on the phone and that is specifically geared toward the I will call hyper scale, kind of guy.
Mark Kelleher: Alright and then just one quick second question. If I look at gross margin and utilization and try to match those up, what should we expect, should we expect that utilization slowly increases and gross margins kind of hang here around 15% or does that get filled up quickly. How do we think about gross margin versus utilization?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, Mark we have just brought on board as Charles and I both mentioned, increased expansion primarily here in the US and in Europe to match up with some of the great opportunities that we see there and also our goal is to go on and expand in further parts of the US and in Europe. So again, we are hopeful that as we fill the opportunities up there that we will continue to fill up the demand capacity.
Mark Kelleher: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. We will next go to Alex Kurtz with Sterne Agee.
Alex Kurtz: Hey guys you can hear me okay.
Charles Liang : Yes.
Alex Kurtz: Hey Howard. So I just want to understand the short form the direct business, it sounds like there wasn't in the datacenter business right because that nicely 26% year-over-year or may be up in the 20s year-over-year. So I guess what I’m trying to understand here is, are there a couple of large enterprise direct customers that you usually sell through the channel that drove the short fall here?
Charles Liang : Yes, we are continuously growing in the enterprise as well especially software defined storage and cloud as well. But last quarter unfortunately the big order from some big datacenter kind of slowing down that impact us a lot for the March quarter.
Alex Kurtz: I know Charles, but would you classify those orders of those large customers as attritional like internet datacenter customer or more like an enterprise customer like a fortune 100 or fortune 5000 kind of company?
Howard Hideshima: Direct sales. 
Alex Kurtz: What was that Howard?
Howard Hideshima: Direct sales.
Alex Kurtz: Okay. And then, taking another turn at this Broadwell release, any policy around the Broadwell pipelines as you guys are building up that channel? I know this historically been the air pockets around that kind of a release cycle?
Charles Liang : Yes, we do see some customers start to have [indiscernible] for our Broadwell and not just Broadwell, again NVMe solution. Our NVMe solution have been exactly the strongest player at this time I believe.
Alex Kurtz: I guess, so would you say that beyond seasonality there was some specific pipeline pause or have new chip releases?
Charles Liang : We did have some pipeline waiting for shipping the Broadwell and NVMe solution.
Alex Kurtz: Okay, alright. Thanks guys.
Charles Liang : Thank you. 
Operator: We will next take a question from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.
Bill Grinstead - SIG: Yes, thanks guys this is Bill Grinstead in for Mehdi. I wanted to take another turn on gross margins here. I know you guys gave a few bullets for why it was more pressured year-over-year but even comparing against your fiscal first quarter, the September quarter similar revenue volume, but the gross margin was still down 50 to 100 basis points and so I was wondering if you guys could lay out for us or weight the impacts of lower utilization versus how your revenue makes in the datacenter that might be able to hone in kind of what gross margin is going to look like going forward? Thank you. 
Charles Liang : I guess the last quarter another factor to lower gross margin was the market going down right so key component was memory and hard drive prices are lower than before. And other than that utilization rate now we have plenty enough space so we can continue to grow our revenues without investing more on those facilities so that's some positive sign.
Howard Hideshima: Just to add to what Charles said to, I understand that we just bought some of our investments on board for our capacity that weren’t there in September. So again, if you are comparing September quarter versus the March quarter with regard to two seasonally weaker, there was some different investment that we just brought online for further capacity and utilization that is in particular this quarter. 
Bill Grinstead: Okay, great that's helpful. And then, again on the Broadwell launch and you guys have historically spoken about the pause that was just referenced kind of leading up to one of these refreshes. And then, the big revenue quarter, the big paint of demand the kind of unleashes and that would be in the June quarter here. But the midpoint of guidance is up 14% and I understand you guys called out some macro weakness and you pushed out the three billion target of it. But are you guys seeing the normal type of activity that your headquarters testing all the different sockets, the normal type of demand leading into one of these refreshes would you characterize this any differently?
Charles Liang : We would be, our growth will be very strong still multiple time or industry average gross rate. However, again the macro environment looks like it will be solved that's why we would be more conservative.
Bill Grinstead: And would the softness be characterized on the datacenter side or the enterprise side or across the board?
Charles Liang : Yes, we do see kind of [indiscernible] datacenter pricing become more competitive than before. And again, as you know we are selective to take [indiscernible].
Bill Grinstead: Okay. Alright thank you guys.
Charles Liang : Thank you.
Operator: We will next go to Rich Kugele with Needham.
Unidentified Analyst: In for Rich just sticking with the gross margin at the low end of your guidance range what would you expect gross margin to be?
Howard Hideshima: We haven't given specific gross margin guidance on the ranges there, so I think you guys can trace it back along the EPS.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay thank you. 
Operator: We will next go to Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group.
Nehal Chokshi: Thank you. Could you talk about the progress you are seeing with the larger enterprise center plus you mentioned your software services were up around 47% year-over-year if I recall correctly I think you were talking about doubling or tripling of that opportunity. So could you revisit that where you guys are at relative here of your expectations one two quarters ago?
Charles Liang : Yes, we do see, our management survey defines [indiscernible] for cloud continue to grow quickly. Again 2x or 3x yearly. And we believe this change will continue.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay, thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of our conference call and I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. Liang for any closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you for joining us today and we look forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you everyone, have a great day.
Operator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the Super Micro third quarter fiscal year 2016 conference call. We do appreciate your participation, you may disconnect at this time. Thank you.

In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today's press release and in the supplemental information attached to today's presentation. I'll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to slide four. First, let me provide you with the highlights of our fiscal second quarter. Second quarter revenue was $639 million, another record high for Super Micro. It's 23% higher quarter-over-quarter and 27% higher year-over-year. Super Micro is a long-term, very high growth company. We have grown five times since Q1 2009. We are on target for meeting our fiscal 2016 revenue and growth rate projection of greater than 20%. Our calendar quarter is above target, as well as our year-to-date fiscal first half performance. Non-GAAP net income was $38 million and was 13.4% higher, compared to last year. Super Micro's non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.73 per diluted share, compared to $0.32 last quarter, or $0.65 last year. In the seasonally strong second quarter, our growth rate was more than four times the industry's average, and we continue to strongly increase market share. Our growth was mainly driven by our Complete System Solutions, which account for 71% of our total revenue in the quarter. We also saw growth across our strategic verticals, with the cloud and Internet data center representing 30% of total revenue. Storage solutions, again, showed strong growth, up 58% from last year and now accounts for 21% of total revenue. These high-growth segments have contributed to our strong business growth. We have been securing new design-wins with superior first-to-market technology and application optimization. They are keys to our winning strategy for our Completed Systems and Solutions. A couple of strong examples of growing partnerships in this quarter include a Fortune 50 company that started to shift new private cloud and storage appliance with our high-storage density and NVMe supported twin architectures. Another Tier 1, also a new big customer, kind of big data Internet company who just scale from development to a hybrid (6:13) using the 4U (6:18), our FatTwin that delivers the (6:20) power efficiency, computing density and performance (6:26). These are truly win-win scenarios. Our product portfolio provides our customers incredible flexibility. Our first go-to-market innovation enables them to deliver the most optimized solution, and our expanding enterprise capabilities provided them the global support and serviceability they require. Slide four, please – slide five, please. The strong growth of our storage business has been driven by the rapid market adoption of software-defined storage. We should update this storage hardware portfolio in the industry. A large number of storage appliance vendors rely on Super Micro to build their (7:17) storage platforms. Revenue from our storage appliance partners was a significant contributor in our overall storage growth. On the product and technology side, we are an industry leader in hybrid and all-flash NVMe storage systems, empowering software-defined storage solutions that dramatically outperforms our legacy proprietary storage technology. We introduced our Simply Double Storage architecture with an industry-first to you hot-swappable four tier (7:51) base system. We patent the second level of tier of storage which delivers up to (8:03) capacity of comparative systems. We has seen strong demand for our new 3U MicroBlade with its high-computing density, supporting up to 8 Xeon processors per 1U. The compute is combined with an impressive storage capacity for traditional Datacenter and also a greater choice for all-flash hybrid storage applications. Betting on the strong success of our 4U 90-bay Storage TwinPro we are expanding the product line with 90-Bay and 60-Bay storage service systems and more. The revenue on the (8:53) and Datacenter optimize, TCO recommends several products grew more than 50% year-over-year. Customers like our extremely high memory and storage capacity and I/O expandability, while offering the lowest TCO via high power efficient system design. With the coming months of new Intel GM processor, code name Broadwell we are expecting continued strong growth on the (9:28) and TCO products as many datacenter will upgrade to the faster and more efficient technology. Continuing to deliver on our first to market strategy we are already providing many Broadwell based products to customers, seeking early development and testing. Our software portfolio in global service grew relatively new and starting from a small base. Continue to be our fastest growing high-margin product line. The software and service products are key to the success of our overall solution, sales strategy and critical contributor to our long-term margin growth. Over the last year, we doubled our Super Server Manager, or SSM software user base and more than doubled our software and service revenue. These numbers will now only continue to grow as we continue to promote and expand our SSM features. On our global service, we are continuing to invest in our service capability, capacity and expanding fleet application engineering to support our growth in the enterprise market. Slide six please, Geographically, North America was 63.7% revenue and was up 41.9% year-over-year. Europe was 17.9% of total revenue and up 24.6% year-over-year. In Asia, revenues were 13.8% of total revenue and up 3.5% year-over-year. We have seen that our strategy of focusing on North America and Europe is paying dividends in term of overall revenue growth and better profitability. We are continuing the effort of global expansion as we complete new construction bases of our green computing parts in Silicon Valley. And doubled our production facilities in Europe. Latin America increased our manufacturing scale to service our customer worldwide. In summary, Super Micro had, again, set a record high quarter for revenue and earnings. We are in the strongest position that has ever been. And we are growing multiple times faster than the overall industry. Now, we are extremely focused on executing our strengths in technology and leveraging our global foundation. We believe heading to 2016 will be a very strong year for Super Micro. For more specific on the December quarter, let me turn it over to Howard.
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Charles. And good afternoon, everyone. I will focus my remarks on earnings, gross margins, operating expenses, and similar items on a non-GAAP basis, which reflects adjustments to exclude stock compensation expenses. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company in today's earnings release and in the supplemental detail in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Let me begin with the review of the second quarter income statement. Please turn to slide seven. Revenue was a record $639 million, up 27% from the same quarter a year ago, and up 23% sequentially. The increase in revenues from last year was primarily due to our increase in Server Solutions, which was up 50.1% led by our growth in cloud datacenter of 86.3% and storage of 58.4% year-over-year. On a geographic basis, we had strong growth in the U.S., up 41.9%, as well as growth in parts of Europe and Asia. Our Services and Software revenue have grown by over 100%. The sequential increase in revenues was primarily due to our continued execution of our business model and seasonal strength. Our direct customer business was up 45%, while our distributor revenue was up 8%. Complete Servers was up 50.1%, while subsystems and accessory business was down 7.7%. Our cloud datacenter business grew 48.3% as we grow our existing relationships and establish new relationships. Turning to product mix. The proportion of revenues from server systems was 71% of total revenues, which was up from 60.1% in the same quarter a year ago and up from 68.6% last quarter. ASPs per servers was $4,400 per unit, which is up from $3,900 last year and from $4,100 last quarter. We shipped approximately 102,000 servers in the quarter and 1,093,000 subsystems and accessories. It's the first time we have gone over 100,000 servers units shipments in the quarter. We continue to maintain a diverse revenue base with over 700 customers. One customer did represent more than 10% of our quarterly revenues at 15%. Cloud datacenter revenues was 29.7%, and storage was 20.7% of quarterly revenues. 63.7% of our revenues came from the U.S., and 41.9% from our distributors and resellers. Slide nine. Non-GAAP gross profit was $106.6 million, up 25.9% from $84.7 million in the same quarter last year, and up 47.2% from $72.5 million sequentially. On percentage basis, gross margin was 16.7% for the quarter. Price changes from Abelcom resulted in no-basis-point change to the gross profit in the quarter, with total purchases representing approximately 13.4% of total cost of goods sold, compared to 13.7% a year ago, and 13.2% sequentially Gross margin of 16.7% is comparable to the prior year's gross margin of 16.8%. Our sales in Complete Server Solutions and strong vendor relationships were positive to margin. These were offset in part by higher cloud datacenter sales which typically have lower margins. Gross margin sequentially was higher primarily due to the strong vendor relationships and higher sales of Complete Server Solutions. Utilization for Taiwan was comparable at 51.2%. Operating expenses were $53.5 million, up from $38.6 million in the same quarter a year ago and up from $47.1 million sequentially. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses was 8.4%, which is up from 7.7% in the same quarter a year ago and down from 9% sequentially. Operating expenses were higher on an absolute dollar basis year-over-year, primarily in personnel expenses to support development of our new products such as our MicroBlade and Simply Double Storage Solution, as well as our software and support services to support the growth of our total solutions. Sequentially, operating expenses were higher due to higher personnel expenses to support the development of our products and growth of our business, and the difference in foreign exchange gain and loss of $2.4 million. The company head count increased by 120 sequentially to 2,521 total employees. Operating profit was $53.1 million, up 15.3% from $46.1 million a year ago and up by 109.9% from $25.3 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, operating margin was 8.3%, down from 9.1% a year ago and up from 4.9% sequentially. Net income was $38 million, up 13.4% from $33.5 million a year ago and up 130.4% from $16.5 million sequentially. Our non-GAAP fully-diluted EPS was $0.73 per share, up from $0.65 per share a year ago, and up from $0.32 per share sequentially. The number of fully-diluted shares used in the second quarter was 52,113,000. The tax rate in the second quarter on a non-GAAP basis was 28%, compared to 27% a year ago, and 34.2% sequentially. The rate was lower sequentially, primarily due to the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in December 2015. The R&D tax credit was made permanent. We expect the effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis to be approximately 32.2% for the March quarter. The company is working on our tax structure to leverage our overseas expansion, which may reduce our tax rate in the coming year. Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis, slide 12. Cash and cash equivalents in short- and long-term investments were $172.6 million, up $59 million from $113.6 million in the prior quarter; and up $86.7 million from $85.9 million in the same quarter last year. In the second quarter, free cash flow was $59 million, primarily due to net income of $34.7 million and an increase in accounts payable of $58.4 million, offset in part by increases in inventory of $27.2 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $17.8 million. We are working on extending our loan facilities to support the continued growth of the company, both domestically and abroad. Slide 13. Accounts receivable increased by $17.1 million sequentially to $314.2 million, due to higher revenues in a seasonally strong quarter. DSOs, days inventory outstanding was 44 days, a decrease of 11 days from 55 days in the prior quarter. Inventory increased by $77.2 million sequentially for up to $486.5 million, due to preparation of inventory ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday and preparation for our Broadwell Solutions. Days in inventories were 82 days, a decrease of 13 days from 95 days in the prior quarter. Accounts payable was $321.2 million, which was 50 days, a decrease of 8 days from 58 days in the prior quarter. Overall, cash conversion cycle days was 76 days, which is 15 days lower than our prior quarter. Now, for a few comments on our outlook. In the second quarter, we grew about 27% in a seasonally strong quarter in which we continue to extend our product lines and execute our business model. Year-to-date, we have exceeded our revenue goal objective of over 20% growth for the year. As we enter the third quarter, we continue our development for the Broadwell launch, but do not expect material contributions this quarter. In addition to seasonal softness of the March quarter for the industry, we are also cautious of the current macroeconomic environment. Therefore, the company currently expects net sales for the quarter ending March 31, 2016 in a range of $530 million to $580 million. Assuming this revenue range, the company expects non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.43 to $0.53 for the quarter. As a midpoint, this will represent our growth of 18% of revenue and 1% in EPS for the prior year. It is currently expected that the outlook will not be updated until the release of the company's next quarterly earnings announcement, notwithstanding subsequent development. However, the company may update the outlook or a portion thereof at any time. With that, let me turn it back to Charles for some closing remarks.
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: Thank you, Howard. 2016 is shaping up to be a year of robust growth for Super Micro. We see huge opportunities as the market shifts toward software-defined, big data, and cloud-based solutions where Super Micro had great track record of leveraging our solid engineering foundation to produce innovative products and services for those market. We are on target for meeting our fiscal 2016 revenue and growth rate projection of greater than 20%, and with that, I'm confident we will continue to outperform the market and grow multiple times faster than the rest on the industry, most short-term and long-term. Operator, at this time, we are ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. And we'll go first to Aaron Rakers with Stifel.
Joseph Quatrochi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. This is Joe Quatrochi on for Aaron. Just a couple of questions if I could. Maybe first start with what type of growth did you see in China? I noticed that you said the Taiwanese facility utilization was, I think, basically flat sequential basis. So maybe the growth in China and then how do we think about the Taiwanese facility utilization going forward?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: Yes. I mean, indeed, we had a very aggressive improvement in our sales and support force in Europe. And now, with global operation, we will support Europe partially from Asia. So, the Asia facility integration will improve. And at the same time, we also started to support some strategic cuts more in Asia, including China. So our utilization rate for Taiwan facility should start to grow gradually.
Joseph Quatrochi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then maybe as a follow-up, can we talk a little bit about the OpEx? I think sales and marketing as well as G&A were up quite a bit sequentially. I was hoping you could talk about the drivers there and how we think about that going forward?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. Joseph, one of the larger changes between the G&A incline will be the foreign ex that you saw that I mentioned on the call. It's about $2.4 million of delta between the quarters. In September, we had a $1.8 million of foreign exchange, and in the December quarter, we had a loss of about $600,000. So, that – you can see about a $2.4 million delta with regards to the expenses in that period.
Joseph Quatrochi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Mark Kelleher with D.A. Davidson.
Mark D. Kelleher - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Congratulations on a strong quarter. Could you just kind of lay out what you're expecting from the Broadwell transition? Are we expecting an upgrade cycle? And it sounded like you're expecting that to kind of come into play in the June quarter. What are you looking for there?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: Okay. Indeed, we have a very strong Broadwell product line. And it's pretty much all available now. And we already sent a sample to lots of customers. However, as Intel obviously announced it won't be available every date this quarter. That's why we do not expect a lot of revenue contribution to this quarter, but that will happen in June quarter for sure.
Mark D. Kelleher - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Matt Dhane with Tieton Capital Management.
Matthew Walter Dhane - Tieton Capital Management LLC: Great. Thank you. I was curious. Are you gaining traction like wins with some of the larger cloud customer that you heard, previously weren't able to penetrate? I heard you call out a couple of bigger wins and it sounds like that you're gaining traction there? Was I hearing correctly?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: Yes. Indeed. For our cloud based and big data driven company, we recently won favor of them and that high volume deployment is happening I believe is done now and much more will happen again June quarter.
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Just to reiterate we did grow about 86% year-over-year so we are gaining as I mentioned, I think, more customers and growing with our existing customers as well.
Matthew Walter Dhane - Tieton Capital Management LLC: Okay. Great. And the customer that you did finally penetrate what led to them finally to choosing to work with you? What was the final item that pushed them over and won them into your camp.
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: Indeed. Some of them have been using our platform before. And now they find that hey, our computer system is even much better. And at the time is brand new. So we won from both segment.
Matthew Walter Dhane - Tieton Capital Management LLC: And is there some of the other larger cloud players that haven't previously used you that are on the cusp from your perspective and maybe getting close to finally moving forward and using you in a meaningful way.
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: I think we have opportunities in a number of different customers, I think, in the cloud. And like I said, our applications and our solutions play very well. So I think there's great opportunities for us in a variety of different verticals of our servicing.
Matthew Walter Dhane - Tieton Capital Management LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Rich Kugele with Needham.
Kimberly C. Donovan - Needham & Co. LLC: Hi, this is actually Kim Donovan for Rich Kugele. Thanks for taking my questions. What phase of buildout are you in for the San Jose facility?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: We're in phase two. Kim, we completed phase one of a five phase program and now we're on phase two.
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: Phase one just starting (28:23). And that's an another reason why we are able to enable another couple of big customer. And phase two we just begun two months ago. We'll be done by end of this year.
Kimberly C. Donovan - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And can you speak to your confidence in hitting $3 billion in revenue in 2017?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: Should be pretty positive.
Kimberly C. Donovan - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group.
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC: Thank you. Very impressive on your free cash flow generation, looks like it was driven by a tightening of the cash conversion cycle that you talked about, despite the 500 basis point Q-on-Q increase (29:07) customer exposure. So can you talk a little bit about more – about what you did to accomplish this and are the changes sustainable? I.e. is this a new cash conversion cycle that we should be modeling going forward?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Nehal, this is Howard. I mean cash conversion cycle again is somewhat seasonally driven at times too we are obviously continuing to focus on our cash conversion cycle, but we are as we continue to remind folks a very high growth company, so again, it will vary from time to time.
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC: Okay. If you look at over the course of the year though on a year-over-year basis, the cash conversion cycle has been increasing, but I think this is a first time in a while that actually not increasing, I think, it's actually come down a bit here. So do you feel like on a year-over-year basis, it can be stable?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Certainly, on an annual basis. I think you'll see a little bit more stability in that. Part of that has to do with – also though the growth in our business. We're seeing great opportunities out there to actually invest as Charles mentioned here to invest in our facilities but I think we have great opportunity there and keep catching (30:29).
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to Alex Kurtz with Sterne Agee.
Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT: Hey, guys? How are you doing?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: Good Alex.
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Pretty Good.
Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT: Howard just want to dial-in on the OpEx here for the March quarter. I'm trying to understand is FX impact. I mean we should be modeling down sequentially on OpEx into March. Obviously, on the seasonal weakness in your revenue. But there's some other factor that would also compound the decline in OpEx from December to March.
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Well, actually there's two factors that we talked about. The FX, we took a loss of about $600,000 in the December quarter. It depends upon what the FX rate will be at the end of the quarter.
Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT: Great.
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Right now it looks positive, but it depends on that. The other thing, I'll remind you guys is again employment tax and those things get reset as of December 31. So they come back into play in the March quarter. So that will add a bit to the OpEx.
Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT: Okay. Should we be thinking about OpEx somewhere between what you did in September and what you did in December just looking at the midpoint of revenue?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: I think we haven't given guidance there. But at the end of the day, like I said, I think it's about – I take out the lease look at the foreign ex and you can model that whichever way you like it.
Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT: Right.
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Okay.
Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT: Okay. And then on the gross margin, I mean obviously very strong in December here because of the higher revenue, I expect obviously margin to come down on the lower revenue for March or is it something else going on with the mix where you could be above 16%?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: For the March quarter are you talking about.
Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT: Yeah. I'm just saying given the strength you had in December, right. Should we – is there a chance that it could be flat on margin sequentially or how are you thinking about that at least?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: I think as we look at the drivers for our margin, there's a couple of things I've mentioned on the call. One is the scale of our business growing, the scale of our business per se (32:47) queue us and the first in power that we came from that utilization as we've always talked is one of those other things too that as we utilized our facilities a bit more, we get benefits from that. Certainly, there's opportunities, but also March is usually a very seasonally weak quarter for the industry as I've modeled that. So, looking back at our history, you'll see some perturbations in our margins between quarters. I think if you look back in December last year comparatively to March, I think you'll see about 50 basis point swing between the two quarters.
Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT: Okay. All right. That's helpful. Thanks, guys.
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. And it appears at this time, we have no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Liang for any additional or closing comments.
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: Thank you for joined us today, and we look forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you, everyone. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude the Super Micro second quarter fiscal year 2016 conference call. We do appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you.

By now you should have received a copy of today's news release that was distributed at the close of regular trading, and is available on the company's website. As a reminder, during today's call, the company will refer to a presentation that is available to participants in the Investor Relations section of the company's website under the Events & Presentations tab. Before we start, I'll remind you that our remarks include forward-looking statements. There are a number of risk factors that could cause Super Micro's future results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2015, and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available from the Investor Relations page of Super Micro's website. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Most of today's presentation will refer to non-GAAP financial results and outlooks. For an explanation of our non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to slide three of this presentation or to our press release published earlier today. In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today's press release, and in the supplemental information attached to today's presentation. I'll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon, everyone. First, let me provide you with the highlights of our fiscal first quarter. First quarter revenue was $530.2 million. It is 7.6% lower quarter-over-quarter and 19.6% higher year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $23.4 million, or 21.9% lower quarter-over-quarter and 1% higher compared to last year. Super Micro's non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.45 per diluted share, compared to $0.57 last quarter, or $0.46 last year. As previously disclosed, first quarter revenue was lower than expected, due to seasonal effect, combined with weaker European and Asia business activity and some customer push-out. We usually expect a seasonal effect in the summer quarter, due to the summer holiday. Nonetheless, first quarter revenue was 19.6% higher year-over-year. That represent a strong start to this fiscal year. Geographically, North America revenue was up over 40% year-over-year. Europe was down by 2.1% year-over-year. In Asia, revenue was lower year-over-year by 15%, led by the decline in China of 40.3%. The rest of Asia was up 6.5% year-over-year, and up sequentially by 15.6%. Once again, with 19.6% growth in a seasonally weak quarter, we are off to a strong start for meeting our fiscal 2016 gross target, at over 20% growth rate. This is supplemented by the fact that we had achieved new high with our direct customer billings, which accounted for 55% of our total revenue to date. Server and Storage Systems account for 69.2% of total revenue, which is also high – a new high. This encouraging fact has shown that our customers are gravitating towards our higher-value completed system and total solution offerings, which does say (6:07) our growth strategy for 2016 remain continue product evolution to grow key business vertical, such as Cloud, Internet Datacenter, Storage, Embedded, IoT, HPC, and for sure, Enterprise. Cloud and Internet Datacenter were particularly strong, and account for 24.8% of total revenue, led by our (6:36), TCO, and Twin product lines. That should not be surprising, because each of these three product lines were uniquely optimized for Cloud hyperconverged applications. The (6:50) architecture provides system flexibility, expansion, and a two (6:55) I/O bandwidth and density, while the TCO provides cost-effective solutions to our customers. The Twin architectures delivered the best performance per watt, with greater computing and storage density and serviceability. The brand-new 1U TwinPro architecture with the Power Stick technology had taken a step further on optimizing the Twin architecture and addressing full system redundancy in a compact 1U form factor, optimized for today's big data and mission-critical applications, features that our competitor cannot offer; also optimized for the cloud market (7:40) and a favorite of hosting. Our MicroBlade offers advanced power-saving natural architecture, leads (7:51) the industry by dramatically increasing computing density to maximize performance per watt, per dollars, and per square foot, all while offering the best-in-class TCO. The upcoming 3U MicroBlade is an evolution of the original MicroBlade, reducing in form factor for unparalleled flexibility, easier deployment, and serviceability. The new MicroBlade is also a great choice for all flash storage applications. Storage Solution continued to evolve into a major element of our revenue mix and growth strategy. It was approximately 22% of total revenue, and grew 60.3% year-over-year. Our Storage Solutions are in strong demand due to the market quickly adopting software-defined storage trend. Our robust product lines are designed with excellent choice of performance, form factor, density, and of course, leading power efficiency. Representing our innovation, we offer leading NVMe fresh storage array solutions, providing customer a scalable high-IOPS storage infrastructure that delivers performance, reliability, cost effectiveness, as well as ease of management in an all-flash and hybrid storage solution. We also introduced a 4U 90-bay hyperscale storage gear box and 4U 60-bay high-density storage server featuring single and redundant controller options. With the industry's strongest product lines and leading architectures, we continue to extend our competitive advantages and further penetrate the new Storage market by delivering higher performance data workload of any scale. On the Embedded and IoT Solution front, we have optimized our compact form factor product portfolio to offer increased computing and graphical performance with greater energy efficiency. This product experienced great success in commercial, industrial, medical, and military applications. In combination with our new IoT Gateway, Super Micro offer total end-to-end infrastructure solutions for the most mission-critical data-dependent operations and applications. Our High Performance Computing continues to be a key growth area this fiscal year. Although HPC products were typically seasonal, our new products will serve as a growth driver for our potential customers. Our 1U 4 GPU/Xeon Phi systems, with its streamlined layout architecture, enable PCIe direct contact for (11:11) as well as eliminating cable repeater and GPU heat (11:16) for maximum air flow and cooling. With these great products, we should achieve an even stronger penetration in the HPC market. The Enterprise market is another fast-growing area for Super Micro. We invest to this market by developing total solution, including (11:38) and service, which we have discussed in previous quarter. The solution, mission-critical, and the uptime deployment had contributed to the 150% annual growth rate of our onsite service and management software business. We had expanded our Super Micro System Management, SSM, offering to reduce the cost and time for system deployment, update, and service. With the reliability of our industry standard Redfish Management API, we will provide our customer with greater interoperability, choice, and flexibility. Although our Enterprise market overall may maintain flat, we expect continued strong share growth in the Enterprise market with our superior product line and solution portfolio. In summary, Super Micro is growing in many different market verticals. We have products that offer choice, innovation, performance, savings, and are optimized for our customer applications. We expect to have a strong fiscal 2016 growing significantly faster than the rest of our industry, targeting over 20% growth annually. For more specifics on the first quarter, let me turn it over to Howard.
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Charles, and good afternoon everyone. I will focus my remarks on earnings, gross margin, operating expenses, and similar item on a non-GAAP basis, which reflects adjustments to exclude stock compensation expenses. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company in today's earnings release and the supplemental detail in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Let me begin with the review of the first quarter income statement. Please turn to slide seven. Revenue was $530.2 million, up 19.6% from the same quarter a year ago and down 7.6% sequentially. The increase in revenue from last year was primarily due to our increase in Server Solutions which result 43.5% led by our growth in Cloud/Internet datacenter of 116.7%, and Storage of 60.3% year-over-year. On a geographic basis we had strong growth in the U.S., up 42.8%, offset in part by weakness in parts of Asia and Europe. The sequential decrease in revenue was primarily due to seasonal weakness coupled with some geographical weakness in Asia and Europe. While our OEM and direct customer business was up 2.2% our distributor revenue was down 17.2%. Complete servers were up 3.7%, while subsystems and accessory business was down 25.7%. Our Cloud/Internet datacenter business grew 47.3% which benefited both our OEM direct customers and complete server numbers. Slide eight. Turning to product mix, the proportion of revenues from server systems was 69.2% of total revenues, which was up from 57.7%, in the same quarter a year ago, and up from 61.7% last quarter. ASPs per servers was $4200 per unit, which is up from $3600 per unit a year ago, and from $4,000 last quarter. We shipped approximately 87,000 servers in the quarter and 916,000 subsystems and accessories. We continue to maintain a diverse revenue base with over 700 customers. One customer did represent more than 10% of our quarterly revenues. Cloud/Internet Datacenter revenue was 24.8%, which was an increase of 15.5% from the prior quarter, and from 13.7% in the prior year. 65.4% of our revenues came from the U.S., and 45% from our distributors and resellers. Slide nine. Non-GAAP gross profit was $83.1 million, up 19.7% from $69.4 million in the same quarter last year and down 7.7% from $90 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, gross margin was 15.7% for this quarter. Price changes from Abelcom resulted in no-basis-point change to gross profit in the quarter with total purchases representing approximately 13.2% of the total cost of goods sold, compared to 14.5% a year ago and 11.9% sequentially. Gross margin was the same as the prior year. Higher sales and fleet/server solutions, the continued growth of X10 Haswell-based solutions, and stronger vendor relationships were positive to margins. This was also in part by higher Cloud/Internet Datacenter sales, which typically have lower margins. Gross margin sequentially was the same. Higher sales of Complete Server Solutions as well as the continued growth of X10 Haswell product were positive to margins. A seasonally weak quarter, declining component pricing, and lower utilization with the Taiwan facility at 51.3% had a negative effect on margin. Operating expenses were $47.1 million, up from $34.8 million in the same quarter a year ago and up from $45.3 sequentially. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses was 8.9%, which is up from 7.9% in the same quarter a year ago and up from 7.9% sequentially. Operating expenses were higher on an absolute dollar basis year-over-year, primarily in personnel expenses to support development of our Total Solution and the lack of $1.9 million R&D VAT tax credit from Taiwan, which occurred last year. Sequentially, operating expenses were higher due to higher personnel expenses of $4.1 million due to annual salary adjustments and $1.4 million of higher legal and accounting expenses primarily related to the investigation of marketing expenses; offset in part by higher foreign exchange gain of $1.8 million. The company head count increased by 116 sequentially to 2401 total employees to continue to support the development of our technologies and growth of our business. Operating profit was $35.9 million, up by 3.8% from $34.6 million a year ago, and down by 19.7% from $44.8 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, operating margin was 6.8%, down from 7.8% a year ago and 7.8% sequentially. Net income was $23.4 million, up 1% from $23.2 million a year ago and down 21.9% from $30 million sequentially. On a non-GAAP – fully diluted EPS was $0.45 per share, down from $0.46 per share a year ago, and down from $0.57 per share sequentially. The number of fully diluted shares used in the first quarter was 52,042,000. The tax rate in the first quarter on a non-GAAP basis was 34.4% compared to 32.7% a year ago, and 32.6% sequentially. The tax rate was higher sequentially due to the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit back in December of 2014. We expect the effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis to be approximately 34% for the December quarter. Should the R&D tax credit be reinstated in December 2015, like it was in 2014, the impact may be 7% lower in the December quarter. Company is working on our tax structure to leverage our overseas expansion, which may reduce our tax rate in the coming year. Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis, slide 12. Cash and cash equivalents in short-term investments were $113.6 million, up $15.5 million from $98.1 million in the prior quarter, and down $6.6 million from $20.2 million in the same quarter a year ago. In the first quarter, free cash flow was $12.6 million primarily due to the decrease in accounts receivable of $25.4 million, net income of $20.5 million, and an increase in income tax payable of $6.8 million; offset in part by a decrease in accounts payable of $37.7 million an increase in property, plant, and equipment of $7.7 million, mainly related to the (20:09) manufacturing facility and warehouse building which was completed in August 2015. Slide 13. Accounts receivable decreased by $25.4 million sequentially, to $297.1 million, due to lower revenues in the seasonally weak quarter. DSO was 54 days, an increase of 11 days from 43 days in the prior quarter. Inventory decreased by $2.1 million sequentially to $461.4 million. Days in inventory were 95, an increase of 12 days from 83 days in the prior quarter, as we had seasonal weakness in the current quarter, coupled with preparation of inventory for growth in the next quarter. Accounts payable was $263.2 million, which was 58 days, an increase of 6 days from 52 days in the prior quarter. Overall, cash conversion cycle days was 91, which is 17 days higher than the prior quarter. Now for a few comments on our outlook. In the first quarter, we grew about 20% in a seasonally weak quarter in which we went live with SAP in the U.S., continue to expand our product lines, and opened a new facility. As we enter the second quarter, we continue our work to roll out SAP in Asia and Europe to go live during the early part of the next calendar year. And we look to leverage the investments we have already made to drive our strong growth and profitability in a seasonally strong quarter for the industry. We have tempered our guidance for some of the weakness we saw at the end of last quarter; therefore, the company currently expects net sales for the quarter ending December 31, 2015 in the range of $580 million to $630 million. Assuming this revenue range, the company expects non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.54 to $0.64 per share for the quarter. At the midpoint, this would represent a growth of 20.3% of revenues and decline of 9.8% in EPS from the prior year. Looking forward beyond the quarter, we are targeting fiscal year 2016 revenues at a growth rate of over 20%. These targets reflect our strategy to take advantage of the opportunities which we have to take market share. It is currently expected that the outlook will not be updated until the release of the company's next quarterly earnings announcement. Notwithstanding subsequent developments, however, the company may update the outlook, or any portion thereof, at any time. With that, let me turn it back to Charles for some closing remarks.
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: Thank you, Howard. With the 19.6% revenue growth year-over-year, we are off to a strong start for fiscal 2016. We remain as the fastest-growing major company in the IT industry, growing over 20% annually, versus the flat or low single-digit in the rest of our industry. Our long-term growth strategy remains intact. With our robust products and service, we are well positioned in the key growth geo and markets, and we will move ahead with our strategy for greater success this year. Operator, at this time, we are ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. . And we'll go first to Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Thanks for taking my question. Howard, back to your expectation for revenue growth of more than 20% fiscal year 2016, how should we think about progression of gross and operating margin?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Well Mehdi, I think, like I said, a lot of the factors we talked about with regard to moving our gross margins higher, and our operating margins higher, is leveraging the growth in our revenues. So again, you see progression as we leverage on those revenues going forward. We have put out targets previously, and we're still – we have not changed those targets for our gross margins at being at 16% to 18%, and our operating margins at 7% to 9% within the next two years.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Great. And regarding China that was down this past quarter, it seems like the growth for some of the key segments in China could actually come in higher than other regions over the next several quarters. How do you plan on expanding your capacity going forward? You are expanding capacity in California, but is there any possibility or scenario where you would slow that down in favor of increasing capacity in Taiwan that would support the growth of some of the customers in China?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: Indeed, our growth in Japan and Korea is getting very strong. And also, we plan to support Europe from Asia directly, for key account (25:59). So the Taiwan facility the capacity should be continued if the (26:04) continue to improve.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Charles, would capacity – available capacity in Taiwan be good enough for China given the assumption that to participate in the growth in China you may have to have local presence especially when it comes to manufacturing?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Yes, that's basically true. So, we support China from Taiwan. That's much better than before. We support China from U.S.A., I mean two years ago. So now we support from Taiwan, and this is much better than that. And at the same time, our growth in Japan and Korea had been kind of in very good shape.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Yeah, thank you.
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Mehdi, just to add that we have additional lines there in Taiwan that we can always bring up facilities currently capable of holding additional lines there. We only have three lines up.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Got it, thanks.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Mark Kelleher with D. A. Davidson.
Mark D. Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Let's stay on the China topic. That was down pretty significantly year-over-year. What's the issue there? Is that a macro issue or is there some local competition there that's blocking the growth?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: I guess it's a combination, but it's also a seasonal impact. So we are improving our investment in China, especially sales and our service team, and similar to Korea and Japan.
Mark D. Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Are you seeing increased competition there from Lenovo?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: We see overall a local company was becoming the more aggressive recently. But still with a stronger product line, we have good confidence, continue to gain market share in China.
Mark D. Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: And are we still expecting some improvement in gross margin from better utilization in Taiwan manufacturing? Is that still possible?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Yes.
Mark D. Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: And we will list our next question from Aaron Rakers with Stifel.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, thanks. Thanks for taking the questions. I'm sorry to do this, but I want to stick on the China topic a little bit. When you look at the numbers, I think you actually had reported that the rest of Asia Pac was up 15% sequentially or 15.6% sequentially. A real quick math to me would still suggest that China was actually down also north of 40% on a sequential basis. So I'm just curious as you kind of roll forward your outlook given how significant China looks like it was historically to Asia Pac. What are you assuming for China out over the next quarter, couple of quarters? Was there some one-time deals that pushed out there, or – I'm just trying to gauge what's baked in to your expectation on the next couple of quarters?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, Aaron, I think we still have good partnerships in China. We still see that area to be a good growth area for us per se. So again, some of this is baked into it. As Charles also alluded to with regard to the rest of Asia, it has some very good potential out there in Japan and in Korea and other places, so there are great areas for us to continue to grow out there in the Asia area.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And can you talk a little bit as a follow-up to that, or maybe a little bit adjacent to that, but can you talk a little bit about the push-outs you saw at the end of the quarter, how material were they relative to your initial – let's say the midpoint of your initial guidance? Can you rank seasonality versus the push-outs in the quarter and what the contributions were from that relative to the reported results?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: Let me add a little bit. Basically we see some push-out in October, this month. Indeed, we already see some increase on October. So (30:24) some push-out from September. And also, it's a transition, that kind of (30:33) our transition a little bit. Not much, but in that last three months we already fixed most of our challenge. So now, I mean, in terms of (30:42) response to customer demand is get back to a normal, and I believe looking forward, we will continue to improve, because people are now much familiar with the new system now.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. I'll cede the floor. Thank you.
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: Thank you.
Operator: And we move to our next question from Alex Kurtz with Sterne CRT.
Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT: Hey, guys can you hear me okay?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: Yes.
Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT: Okay. Just to follow-up on Aaron's last question and Charles, your response, did you just say that you guys closed some business that pushed out from September and you closed in October? Did I hear that right?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: Yes. Basically, we saw some push out from September, and we see some increase on October. Yes, that's right.
Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT: But specifically, Charles, the deals, the bigger deals that you guys saw push out from September, those deals have closed in October?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, I think – Alex, like I said, seasonality was probably the main thing that we had driving the quarter per se, okay?
Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT: Okay.
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: So again push-outs weren't the main – the majority.
Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT: We know how to chase that. So just a question on the range here, Howard, I think last quarter you had – on the range, the guidance, you had a $60 million range last quarter, and it looks like this quarter it's a $50 million range. You just came at the lower end of guidance. There's obviously some seasonality you saw in September. So I guess my questions would be why not maintain a $60 million range here for December given that, who knows, maybe there's some seasonality that bleeds over into December? Or is it you just have a high level of confidence in the pipeline going into December than you did in September?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: I think we tempered our guidance given some of the seasonality and things that happened last quarter per se. And then obviously, we feel, like I said, a little more better with the strong seasonality that happens this quarter.
Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT: Okay. So you don't feel like you need to – because you came at the low end of the range for September, you don't feel like you need to increase your discount rate? Or maybe you already have in this December guide?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: That's why the range is smaller.
Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT: Okay. Fair enough. And then on the gross margin obviously you did very well with the Server, which are higher-margin, but the sequential decline in revenue probably hit margin on the other side. So as we think about December margin levels, I mean, how should we think about the mix between servers and subsystems? I imagine December's probably a good server quarter, fully configured systems. Is that the right way of thinking about it?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: I guess the margin concern, this quarter should be slightly stronger than last quarter, part of the reason because last quarter we faced some components price drop especially DRAM. That happened in last quarter, and this quarter we feel it should be at least slightly better.
Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT: Okay. And Howard just on the tax rate here, I think a lot of us were not modeling 34% for the rest of the year and into the out-year. I mean that's probably some disconnect between the street's number and what you guys have guided to for Q2 here. So the question is should we just assume 34% for the rest of the year until we are told otherwise, or – how should we think about that? Because that's obviously going to impact leverage on the bottom line.
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Of course. Alex, as I alluded to, like I said, part of the difference between, say, our prior years of about 30%-odd is because of the R&D tax credit, right?
Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT: Yeah.
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: And quite frankly, I've told folks basically that we don't know to handicap when the R&D tax credit – that R&D tax credit might be back, like I said. But if it happens this quarter, it could be up to about 7% change in our tax rate if it gets passed like it last year. But again we haven't built that in, and quite frankly I can't – I haven't built that into – going forward.
Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT: Okay. And just last question here, just so there's no surprises when March rolls around and you guys give the guidance for that, every year you've had some sequential decline in the March quarter just due to seasonality. Well, at least last year, you did; the year before, you did; because of some strong cloud business. But how should we – would you expect, based on what you know now, some seasonality in the March quarter?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: I think it is seasonal, Alex. It's still seasonal. We've still seen that over the years. Obviously, we had some projects and good products coming out there that will help us. In the past, it helped us go beyond what the seasonality had done.
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: Yeah. Also, another factor is (35:31) I mean as you people may know, India have by a – well, we're coming early next year. And we (35:40) strong Storage product line about last month. So all of those will help us grow our profitability and revenue for December quarter and the next coming years. Kind of like our (35:59), our 1U 4-GPU, and 2U NVMe. So that – we're (36:09).
Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee CRT: All right. Thank you guys.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group.
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC: Thanks. Have a few questions. First, what percent of revenue does China represent in fiscal year 2015?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: We haven't broken it out specifically. It's still the majority of the revenues. We have not broken it out separately, though.
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC: Majority of APAC, you mean, right?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah.
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC: Yeah, okay. All right. Okay, so subsystem year-over-year growth, it looks like that was down – I'm sorry, subsystem year-over-year unit growth was down 27% year-over-year. Is this all attributable to the issues you saw in China, or is there more to it than that?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: Yeah, kind of a portion affected by China, but also more customer like to buy our completed solution.
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC: Oh, I see. Okay.
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: (37:15)
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC: Right. Okay. And then finally, your DSOs did go up substantially Q-o-Q and year-over-year. Is that purely an effect of customer mix – you did have a very significant uptick in the Internet Datacenter? Or was there also the effect of the weakness at the end of the quarter that also drove that? And then, given that context, you alluded to greater confidence for the December quarter, but that doesn't mesh well with that rising DSO.
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: We saw a strong move in Storage solution. And when people buy our Storage Solution, a big portion of them move our completed solution. And Storage system usually have a higher ASP than services. That's another factor.
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC: Okay. I'll cede the floor. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Brian Alger with ROTH Capital Partners.
Brian Alger - ROTH Capital Partners LLC: Good afternoon, guys. I want to stick on Storage if we can. Obviously good year-on-year growth. I'm wondering if we could get an assessment in terms of how much of the total sales does Storage make up now? And can you maybe give us some clarity in terms of next-gen Storage, as opposed to JBOD type of storage?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, 22% is about the total percentage of revenues. Believe it was about 15% on the – let me get back to you on that, Brian. Just a second. Let me hold that for a second. We do see the growth in the areas, both in our traditional and in our next-gen Storage, going very well.
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: Yeah. But we started to see a new generation (39:12) Storage growing very strongly with our customer base. And that's why we have a big (39:17) product line. Again, this is (39:19-39:24) including converged hybrid solution – hyperconverged and some other solutions, anyway (39:32)
Brian Alger - ROTH Capital Partners LLC: Right. And just as a follow-up to that, obviously there's been a lot of disruption going on within the Storage market, whether it's consolidation with some of the leaders or competitors of yours combining. As you look forward beyond this near term and we look at the pricing mechanisms and the capacity that your various vendors have, how should we think about your Storage market and what it means to your gross margins? I recognize that, from a system standpoint, they're relatively high ASPs, but one would imagine that if you're throwing a whole bunch of rotational storage, it doesn't have the best margin profile.
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: We have been a very aggressive, and have a strong product for new generation software-defined storage. And we have a strong product line. Again, we just start to launch last month for a 90-bay 4U and 4U 60-bay and 2U 48-bay. So all of those will grow the value. So at the least, the net profit will grow. And as to the gross margin, I believe we'll be slightly improving as well.
Brian Alger - ROTH Capital Partners LLC: Great. Thanks, guys. I'll cede.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Rich Kugele from Needham Company.
Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good afternoon. Can you hear me all right?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: Yes, Rich.
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah we can.
Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Right. Okay. So, a few questions, just to round out what's been asked before. Can you just clarify – so you – Howard, you were saying that you were going to be doing an SAP deployment this quarter in both Asia and in Europe. Is that correct? Are you doing them both at the same time?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. We just completed our U.S. SAP rollout in July, in the first week of July. And so we're now following that up with our Asia and European.
Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. And what have you done to make sure that you don't have any of the hiccups you had in the U.S.?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Well, I think...
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: (41:53) Our people already done here (41:55). So now we are able to train our people in Asia and Europe much more efficiently. So I believe the deployment in Asia and Europe should be much more smooth.
Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, what is your target given some of the changes in your mix, the greater percentage of the (42:17) server systems, the greater percentage of Storage? What is the right way to view the balance sheet metrics nowadays? Because we do get a quite a bit of questions around this. What is your target cash cycle days and what do you think is necessary from an inventory perspective to have the proper parts on hand? Any update there?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, I think, Rich, we have told you folks that I think the mid-80s before cash conversion cycle days is still what we're holding to and targeting for ourselves is what we talked about.
Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay, (42:55)
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: In the inventory area – I'm sorry. And in the cash conservation cycle days, you've seen us in about the mid-70s or so. And it's propping up a bit, but again, if you look at some of the seasonality, always keeps trying to smooth itself up. In the AR side of it, as we penetrate more enterprise and lock some of these global 1,000 customers, I have talked to you guys about our DSOs on AR possibly (43:19) increasing there. So again, we'll see some uptick there. And then hopefully, we'll be managing our payables and our inventory a bit better to bring it down.
Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. Then, just lastly, Storage had grown so much. Is all that from previous wins or have you added any new customers in the quarter?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: Both. The old customers continued to grow, basically, and at the same time, we also gained more new customer. Again, I'll state here to make sure (43:50) Super Micro is actually the best of the storage server hardware company, so we are always welcome to work with old partner and new partner.
Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Excellent. Okay. Thank you.
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll move to our next question from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Just a couple of quick follow-ups. On Storage, can you provide the mix of legacy and next-gen Storage?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: Basically, the new generation Storage is growing faster for sure. As mentioned...
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: What would you put at the September quarter?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: For September, Howard, do you have a (44:33)
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Yes. For the September quarter, Mehdi, again roughly about $44 million of $113 million was next-gen, and about $69 million was traditional Storage.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. Great. And then my last follow-up. When I look at your revenue per head count and operating profit per head count, it seems like there has been a sequential and year-over-year decline especially as you expand your capacity in California. I'm going back to my – I'm sorry.
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: Two reasons. One is we are expanding our new facility aggressively. So we had to hire people to train people, especially with quality system conversion (45:21). At the same time, we are also growing stronger in System Solution. So we hire more software engineer, system engineer. And all those, from the day you hire to the day they contribute takes some quarters. So that's kind of good investment, but yes, for short-term, it shows some burden.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Sure. Actually I was going to ask you about your confidence in scaling the incremental cost added. It seems to me that China was down in the reported quarter, and most of your leverage with the key customers are also in China and in U.S. So what gives you the confidence that you're going to be able to bring the volume and be able to improve profitability? Since early this year, there has been some fluctuation, and early in the year we had the port factor, and now we had -- we've seen for the September quarter some push-out. And then looking into March, there is some seasonality. And I'm just trying to get a feel for whether fiscal year could be back-end loaded in terms of that 20%-plus growth rate for fiscal year, and if it's back-end loaded, what gives the confidence that the volume is going to come in?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: I guess a few factors. Number one, still, products. I mean that's why I mentioned since last month, we introduced some very advanced product and continue in next few months. Almost every month we have a new product available. And then Q1 (47:03) we have (47:05) available. That's the product side. And other than that, we are also growing very aggressively in the East Coast. As you may know, we just have an East Coast office open two weeks ago in New Jersey. And also, we are growing very aggressively in Midwest including Chicago area. And so is Europe. So we did also investment in territory, in product, and those for sure will be very positive to our business in the near future.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Got it. Thank you.
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Aaron Rakers with Stifel.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. I had a follow-up as well. So a couple of quick questions. So first of all, I was just curious of what, with the variables involved in the operating expense line – I think it was a $1.4 million impact from the marketing examination this last quarter – what are you assuming on the operating expense line this quarter, and how should we model that over the next couple of quarters?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: I think we went through our annual salary increase. So if you start it off as the baseline there, you take off some of the unusual expense, let's say for the investigation that we added into the marketing expense. So you take that off per se there, and then pare out some of the foreign exchange gain. I think you'll get to a baseline where we start at about $47 million this quarter. I think when you start down at the baseline, look from there going up a little bit, I think that's a fair baseline.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So $47 million this quarter is kind of the right number to be thinking about?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: In the September quarter, that's where we ended up, and so up from there a bit.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And just real quickly on – just curious. I know you had provided some color on the breakdown of the Storage categories. Can you help us understand how fast the grown has been in your new/emerging Storage categories relative to the traditional? And also would you mind talking a little bit or disclosing the growth rate or decline that you saw on the High Performance Computing vertical?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: For Storage, as we just shared, year-over-year we grew about 60%. So I believe form the next 12 quarters, next 12 months, our storage will continue to have a very growth. If another 50%, 60% or up, that won't surprise me. So that's with Storage.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And the HPC vertical?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: HPC, I believe, we have gradually smooth growth. Not as fast as Storage, but we are continuing to grow.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: What was the HPC growth this quarter?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: HPC roughly was about – this quarter, year-over-year was actually down a bit sequentially, about 11%.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, thank you.
Operator: It appears at this time we have no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Liang for any additional or closing remarks.
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: Thank you for joining us today and we look forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you everyone. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude the Super Micro first quarter fiscal year 2016 conference call. We do appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect. Thank you.

And now, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Hayes. Mr. Hayes, please go ahead, sir.
Perry G. Hayes - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Good afternoon, and thank you for attending Super Micro's conference call on financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015, which ended June 30, 2015. By now you should have received a copy of today's news release that was distributed at the close of regular trading, and is available on the company's website. As a reminder, during today's call, the company will refer to a presentation that is available to participants in the Investor Relations section of the company's website under the Events & Presentations tab. Please turn to slide two. Before we start, I'll remind you that our remarks include forward-looking statements. There are a number of risk factors that could cause Super Micro's future results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2014, and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available from the Investor Relations page of Super Micro's website. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Most of today's presentation will refer to non-GAAP financial results and outlooks. For an explanation of our non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to slide three of this presentation or to our press release published earlier today. In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today's press release, and in the supplemental information attached to today's presentation. I'll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to slide four. First, let me provide you with the highlights of our fiscal first quarter. We are pleased to announce that, we achieved a record quarter of growth as our revenue reached $573.6 million, it's 21.7% higher quarter-over-quarter; and 34% higher year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $30 million or 20.3% higher quarter-over-quarter, and 54.6% higher compared to last year. Super Micro's non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.57 per diluted share compared to $0.47 last quarter or $0.40 last year. Slide five, please. In my comments today, I would like to discuss our results last quarter, as well as our achievements during the past fiscal year, and then, I will share our outlook for fiscal year 2016. Last quarter, we achieved a record-high revenue, which was 34% higher than last year. This strong first quarter performance push our full year revenue to $1.99 billion, almost $2 billion, representing 35.7% growth over last year. Once again, our quarterly and yearly growth rates are multiple times the industry's rate, indicating that we continue to take much share, as we have planned. Even though, some industry watchers believe that server industry is mature with minimal differentiation between manufacturers, we know based on direct customer experience that is not the case with Super Micro. Our strong performance is the direct result of our unique business model that enable our partners to succeed with the most innovative application optimized server and storage solutions ahead of our competition. In addition to Super Micro's broadest product range and time to market advantages, our product continue to deliver clear performance and feature advantages, such as best performance in heterogeneous computing with the 1U 4 GPU server, highest drive capacity with a 3.5-inch drive in the 1U space. You've seen the FatTwin, 90 SAS3 drives in the 4U JBODs and highest power efficiency in Data Center Optimized Servers with our TCO products. These are just a few examples of Super Micro's differentiation. Now, I would like to mention some notable growth areas from last quarter. Our direct strategic partner account for 49.8% of total revenues. Our Internet data center and cloud products represents 15.5% of total revenues, and our complete system business account for 61.7% of total revenues. Geographically, last quarter revenue in North America was 62.2%, Europe was 19%, Asia was 14.8%, and other regions were 4% of total sales. On a year-over-year basis, regional results for North America and Europe were in line with overall growth, while Asia grew minimally. We believe our continuous investment in infrastructure will directly drive growth in Asia and all geographies. Storage continue its robust momentum as a strong product driver with 79% growth year-over-year. Our Complete Rack Solution business with 64% year-over-year growth was another solid indicator of Total Solutions growth. In addition, Super Micro's FatTwin products grew 102% year-over-year, and Ultra Dense MicroBlade family demonstrates one of our strongest product launch last year. Slide six, please. Let's fully dive into our products. I would like to mention again that, our industry unique application optimized Building Block Solutions allowed Super Micro to excel in many different vertical markets. We have over 800 customers, many are Fortune 1000 companies, who'd rely on our leading technology, and differentiation solution to surpass their competitor in their market segment. Last year, Super Micro launched many new exciting products. For example, we recently launched 1U 4 GPU/Xeon Phi solution, which is the best performing accelerated server on the market. Our streamlined layout architecture that enable PCI-E direct connect for low latency and eliminate cabling the drivers, and GPU pre-heat for most efficient air flow and cooling. Also recently, we launched a 90-Bay HyperScale Storage Enclosure, featuring top-load hot-swappable drive bay for 90 3.5 inch SAS3 or SSD in 4U. This 4U enclosure supports up to 720 terabyte of capacity, providing high density, high performance storage for OpenStack, surveillance, archiving, and many more use, where scale-up and scale-out deployment is required. Earlier in fiscal year 2015, we began production of our MicroBlade, and it became one of our strongest product launches. MicroBlade come in many configurations, including 112-Nodes Atom or 56-Node UP Xeon or 28-Node DP Xeon in the 6U platforms. This innovative architecture is a unified microserver with networking, storage, and demand management optimized for cloud computing, dedicated hosting with content delivery and social networking applications. Last, but not least, one of the most important products we launched in fiscal year 2015 is our Ultra architecture. It is designed to deliver unrivalled performance, flexibility, scalability, and the serviceability, and that can be optimized for a variety of applications. Ultra come in 1U and 2U configurations. They support a CPU up to 36 cores and 160-watt TPP, 1.5 terabyte of DDR4 memory in 24 DIMMs, 24 NVMe and aPCIe. Moreover, due to its versatility, the Ultra architecture also serves as basis for many of our new systems solutions, such as 1U 4 GPU and 1U 10 NVMe system. One of the biggest strategic areas of growth for Super Micro in 2015 was our software and service business. While we began to offer software and service in 2014, this year many more customers began utilizing our Total Solution packages. For example, Supermicro Server Manager or SSM is a powerful multiple-feature single console server manager that configures multiple machine in parallel, including how to open system software or firmware upgrade to exponentially simplify system deployment and maintenance. It also supports the upcoming graphics API, therefore enhance our interface IPMI tools. In addition to our software management tools, we also start to ramp our service suite of offering in 2015. Super Micro's service is designed to help customer improve up-time, reduce cost, and increase the productivity of their investment in Super Micro products. Our service plan offers solution, consultation and tiered on-site service from four-hour response to next business day. We are especially excited that, today thousands of customer service package (13:32) around the world. Although, the combined contribution of software and service only accounts for about 1% of our revenue in fiscal year 2015, I'm confident that it can easily triple in fiscal year 2016, providing a proportionally greater impact to profitability. In addition to our margin benefit, software and service enable us to win strategic business, especially with enterprise customers. Slide seven, please. We have also been working on improving our foundation for future growth by expanding our global logistics and capacity. Yesterday, we had the grand opening of our first new building at our Green Computing Park with 180,000 square feet of additional manufacturing space in San Jose. Also, we are in the process of finishing a new building in the Netherlands, which will double our system integration capacity there. Together, the total capacity increase will be more than 35% over existing facilities, which will allow us to continue our industry-leading growth, heading into our fiscal year 2016. To summarize, we continue to outpace industry growth in multiples by growing 34% year-over-year this quarter. We added significant new product lines to our already industry-leading array of application optimized solutions, allowing us to penetrate deeper into our customer market. We expand our order-wide capacity to enable future growth in all geography. And our new software and service offerings are significantly a factor to grow our market value, with them, we are ready to deliver even higher value products, deploy more Complete Solution, and achieve more aggressive growth going forward. For more specifics on the first quarter, let me turn it over to Howard.
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Charles, and good afternoon, everyone. I will focus my remarks on earnings, gross margins, operating expenses and similar items on a non-GAAP basis, which reflects adjustments to exclude stock compensation expenses. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company in today's earnings release, and in the supplemental detail on the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Let me begin with a review of the fourth quarter income statement. Please turn to slide seven. Revenue was $573.6 million, up 34% from the same quarter a year ago, and up 21.7% sequentially. The increase in revenue from last year was primarily due to our increase in Server Solutions, which was up 49.8%. On a geographical basis, we had strong growth in the U.S. of 42.3%; followed by Europe at 37.1%, while Asia was about flat. The sequential increase in revenue was primarily due to seasonally strong quarter. Both our distributor and subsystem and accessory business were strong at 32.6% and 29.9% growth over the prior quarter respectively. In addition, our storage business was particularly strong with 31.8% growth over the prior quarter, with the majority of this growth coming from our traditional storage business as we expanded our high-density storage solutions. Slide eight. Turning to product mix. The proportion of revenues from server systems was 61.7% of total revenues, which is up from 55.2%, the same quarter a year ago, and down from 64.1% last quarter. ASPs for servers was $400 [sic] $4,000 per unit, which is up from $3,300 last year, and from $3,900 last quarter. We shipped approximately 87,000 servers in the quarter and 1.317 million subsystems and accessories. We continue to maintain a diverse revenue base with about 800 customers. No customers represented more than 10% of our quarterly revenues. Cloud, Internet, data center revenue was 15.5%, which was a decrease from 20.7% in the prior quarter, and from 17.8% in the prior year. 62.2% of our revenues came from the U.S., and 50.2% from our distributors and resellers. Slide nine. Non-GAAP gross profit was $90 million, up 35.1% from $66.6 million in the same quarter last year; and up 16.8% from $77 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, gross margin was 15.7%, up from 15.6% a year ago and down from 16.3% sequentially. Price changes from Abelcom resulted in no basis point change to gross profit in the quarter with total purchases representing approximately 11.9% of total cost of goods sold, compared to 15.7% a year ago, and 14.7% sequentially. The year-over-year increase in gross margin resulted from higher sales in complete server solutions, which included products such as storage and FatTwin. In addition, we have seen a rise in our services and support business, which is about 1% of revenue. It is growing quickly, and have high margins. Sequentially, gross margins were down due to higher subsystem and accessory revenues, and traditional storage revenues in the quarter offset in part by an increase in our purchasing power, and higher utilization of the Taiwan facility at 68.1%. Slide 10 and 11. Operating expenses were $45.3 million, up from $37.2 million in the same quarter a year ago, and up from $42 million sequentially. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses were 7.9%, which is down from 8.7% in the same quarter a year ago, and up from 8.9% sequentially. Our operating expenses were higher on an absolute dollar basis year-over-year, primarily in R&D as we invested in personnel expenses to support development of our Total Solutions. Sequentially, operating expenses were higher due to higher prototype and testing fees of approximately $1.4 million, and higher marketing and promotion costs of $0.9 million to support the development and promotion of new products. The company head count increased by 141 sequentially to 2,285 total employees to support the expansion of the business, such as enterprise, software and services. Operating profit was $44.8 million, up by 52.1% from $29.4 million a year ago, and up from 27.8% from $35 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, operating margin was 7.8%, up from 6.9% a year ago, and the same 7.4% sequentially. We continue to focus on many market opportunities while we leverage the investments we have made in our infrastructure to continue to drive our operating margins and profits. Net income was $30 million, up 54.6% from $19.4 million a year ago, and up 20.3% from $24.9 million, sequentially. Our non-GAAP fully diluted EPS was $0.57 per share, up from $0.40 per share a year ago, and down from 47% – up from $0.47 per share sequentially. The number of fully diluted shares used in the fourth quarter was 52,609,000. The tax rate for the fourth quarter on a non-GAAP basis was 32.6% compared to 33.6% a year ago, and 28.3% sequentially. The higher rate sequentially was due to the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in December of 2014. We expect the effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis to be approximately 34% for the September quarter. Should the R&D tax credit be reinstated in December 2015, like it was in 2014, the impact may be 7% lower rate in the December quarter. This would make the annual non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal 2016 similar to fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, which was 30.1% and 30.6% respectively. The company continues to work on our tax planning as we continue to expand overseas. Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis. Slide 12. Cash and cash equivalents in short and long-term investments were $98.1 million, down $13.9 million from $112 million in the prior quarter, and down $1.5 million from $99.6 million in the same quarter last year. In the fourth quarter, free cash flow was a negative $64.2 million, primarily due to the increase in accounts receivable of $101.2 and $34.6 million increase in inventory, offset in part by the increase in accounts payable of $36.8 million described below, as well as an increase in short-term debt of $48.5 million. Slide 13. Accounts receivables increased by $101 million to $322.6 million due to the higher revenue sequentially. DSOs was 43 days, a decrease of 3 days from 46 days in the prior quarter. Inventory increased by $33.1 million to $463.5 million to support the growth of the business. Days in inventories were 83 days, a decrease of 13 days from 96 days in the prior quarter. Accounts payable was $299.8 million, which was 52 days, a decrease of 10 days from 62 days in the prior quarter. Overall, cash conversion cycle days was 74 days, which is 6 days lower than the prior quarter. Now, for a few comments on our outlook. During the first quarter, we continue our strong growth in a seasonally strong quarter. For the fiscal year 2015 revenue was $2 billion, and EPS was $2.15, which represented growth from the prior year of approximately 35.7% and 60.4% respectively. As we enter fiscal year 2016, we look to continue to take advantage of our broad breadth of solutions, which includes software and services to take advantage of the expanding market opportunities, which have opened up to us, as well as the leveraged investments we have made in our operations, such as our SAP implementation and new facilities to drive our strong growth and profitability in a seasonally weak quarter for the industry. Therefore, the company currently expects net sales for the quarter ending September 30, 2015, in a range of $520 million to $580 million. Assuming this revenue range, the company expects non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.49 to $0.59 for the quarter. At the midpoint, this will represent a growth of 24.1% and 17.4% in revenue and EPS, respectively, from the prior year. Looking forward beyond this quarter, we have updated our target for the coming two years to be 16% to 18% on gross margin; and 7% to 9% on operating margins. These targets reflect our strategy to take advantage of the opportunities we have to take market share, while still maintaining our discipline and controlling our operating costs. It is currently expected that the outlook will not be updated until the release of the company's next quarterly earnings announcement. Notwithstanding subsequent developments, however, the company may update the outlook or any portion thereof at any time. With that, let me turn it back to Charles for some closing remarks.
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: Thank you, Howard. For 22 years, we have been a customer-centric technology company, always listening to them and developing innovative products that our customers appreciate. Now, with our software and service package fully ready, we are able to create more complete Total Solutions, greater product value, and achieve higher level of customer satisfaction. We have more than doubled our revenue in the last three years, and by continuing our focus on our advanced product lines and customers, we expect to make another aggressive dip of growth in the coming years. Operator, at this time, we are ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. And we'll go first to Alex Kurtz with Sterne Agee.
Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee: Hey, thanks, guys. Can you hear me, okay?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: Yes. Yes, we can.
Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee: Hey, Charles. So, Howard, I just want to drill in a little bit on the margin. It sounds like this was largely due to the higher component mix. Would you expect that to reverse itself next quarter, and was there anything else in there that was a heavy weight on what drove the gross margin off a little bit this quarter?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: No, Alex. I think, as I said in this – subsystems and accessory business was higher this quarter. It grew quite frankly about 30% quarter-over-quarter sequentially. So again that, as you know, we talked about it, component and subsystem business is at a lower margin than our complete server solution business. We do expect that our complete service solution business will continue to grow.
Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee: Okay. And just two quick follow-up questions here, Howard, on the tax rate, you said 34% for Q1. What was the guidance for the year again? Was it back down to 30% for the year?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. We said it would – would be around – we said that the – if the R&D tax credit was put back in, like it was in 2015, then we would see similar, yeah, a reduction in our rate by about 7% in that December quarter. And then, if it did happen, that the rate overall for fiscal 2016 would be similar to fiscal 2015 or 2014, which is about 31%.
Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee: So we should effectively be modeling 31% for the year?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Again, it depends on the timing of the R&D tax credit.
Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee: No, I understand. And I'll just put this to Charles, and all three of you. You guys have talked about this $3 billion annual goal by fiscal 2017. It certainly seems like you're on that pace. Any reason you wouldn't be able, any change from that view?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: At least at that pace, if not faster.
Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee: Okay. Good to hear, Charles. Thank you, guys.
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: Thank you.
Operator: For next question, we'll go to Mark Kelleher with D. A. Davidson.
Mark D. Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Congratulations on a torrid top line growth rate pace there. That growth though, is putting some pressure on your balance sheet as your working capital struggles to keep up. Is there a possibility or an element of increasing your pricing to slow the top line down? How do you think about gross margin versus that torrid top line versus your working capital that has to support that?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Well, I think, Mark, as we talked about before, I think there's a wonderful opportunity for us to take market share right now, and we're going to continue to focus on that part of it. There's lots of opportunities for us to go out there and go get, as Charles talked about, our top line growth, and what have you. But again, we'll be looking at that, and then we're looking at the working capital needs of the company to properly support that.
Mark D. Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: All right. And just as my follow-up, the – can you just give us an update on where you think the Grantley Haswell cycle is? I know we ask you that every quarter, but we seem to be getting further along down that cycle, and maybe some thoughts further beyond to Broadwell coming up, how does that play out?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: In terms of new product status, we feel still in the ramp-up mode. And yes, the Broadwell is coming soon. So overall, I believe the product line advantage will continue to happen. And especially, once we announce the 1U 4 GPU, and kind of 90-Bay in 4U JBOD, that will be our strong product.
Mark D. Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: We'll go next to Aaron Rakers with Stifel.
Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. A couple of questions if I can, as well. So first of all I want to – I'd like to dive a little bit deeper in your enterprise traction. I know you talk about software and services being about 1% of total revenue. It looks like your direct business excluding the Internet, data center grew a pretty solid 52% year-over-year. I also believe you said that you had 800 cumulative customers. I think last quarter it was 700. So can you talk a little bit more about the success you're seeing in the enterprise segment, what enterprise represents as a percentage of total, inclusive of the software and services, and where you expect that to play out through the course of this year? What kind of contribution you're expecting for the full year from enterprise?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: Yeah. I mean, our software and service program although start from fiscal year 2014, but it really grow much quicker in 2015. We grew almost triple last year, and looking forward, looks like the growth rate will be continuing very fast, because it's finally a very mature, very strong product. And that's why we are able to approach more and more enterprise customer, and after two year's usage, they have been really happy with whatever total solution we provide. So we feel pretty positive in that area.
Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Any estimate of how – what kind of percentage that could look like as you exit fiscal 2016?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: Hopefully another triple this year, so hopefully 3% for example for software and service.
Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And can you talk a little bit – the second follow-up question is on the gross margin trajectory. What drives the differential between 16% versus the high-end of the band of 18%? And what you're assuming as far as the ramp of your utilization rate in the Taiwan facility?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, Aaron, this is similar to what we talked about in the past. I think the levers for us, for our gross margin are still there, continue to ramp the Taiwan utilization for us, continue to build the scale of our business. And so that includes our purchasing power, improve the mix of our total server solutions. Then as Charles mentioned, the services and support portion of our revenue, as that grows, that provides us with margin uplift there, too. So those three levers are available to us, and still we're trying to execute through those levers.
Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And do you still think you hit the 80% utilization rate in the Taiwan facility over the next quarter or two?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: We do believe so.
Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group.
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC: Thank you. Just want to revisit the balance sheet there, because that seems to be the crux of many bear arguments I've heard. And especially in this quarter, the accounts receivable did increase $100 million Q-over-Q, versus last year, it increased only $20 million Q-o-Q. Albeit Q-o-Q revenue growth was $100 million for this June quarter versus $50 million a year ago. But it still does not seem to compute, and I think there's some concern that you may have pulled forward some demand, or is looking to move inventory that may have been getting old. So can you just address that bear argument point blank?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: This is Howard, again. I don't believe that there is any pull-forward or revenue per se. It was a seasonally strong quarter. We have lot of new opportunities out there to take advantage of, and we're leveraging on those opportunities per se. How do I put it? The enterprise space is opening up to us. A lot of the market opportunities we talk about are opening up to us, and some of those customers do demand longer terms, I've talked about before with regards to that. So again our DSOs are affected by that.
Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you. And if I may ask a follow-up question with respect to enterprise model. For the service line, what's the pricing model of that? Do you target a percent of sales on that service there? And can you also comment on what you expect the operating margin profile for products being sold into these corporate data centers relative to your overall margin profile?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: Yeah, for software and service issue, probably the margin is much higher. However, overall our revenue only about 1% for fiscal year 2015, and for 2016, I hope we are up to 3% or even more. So that one will be long-term growing, very positive factor. But yes, the percentage still small, although faster growing.
Unknown Speaker: Okay. Thank you.
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: Thank you.
Operator: Go next to Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I want to go back to the mix, it seems like your server business was pretty good, but the top line upside was mostly driven by system and accessory. And if I were to compare your performance to the rest of the competitors this earnings season, it seems like you're gaining share. And I want you to help me understand what has enabled you to gain market share if it's indeed a share gaining story? And how should we think about the mix going forward? How should we think about the data center mix in the first half of fiscal year 2016? And I have a follow-up.
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: Yeah, I mean – very good question. Basically, we have much better product, especially for (36:56) application, we have specifically optimized product for them. So customer appreciate that. And also our enterprise customer, they need on-site service. They need software for system management. Before we were pretty weak in that area, but now become much stronger, and we'll be – continue to be stronger. So we are gaining enterprise segment kind of consistently now, and better product, especially application optimized.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: And then, how should we think about the mix into the first half of the fiscal year 2016, especially with the data center?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: Data center indeed, it really depends on our production capacity, kind of before our limitation, pretty much production capacity. So now, with our building (37:53) grand opening, yesterday, and another new building in Netherlands, we'll be ready to move in next month. So we have much more space, much more capacity for new data center business now. So if we like, we can grow that area much more aggressively than before.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. And then moving onto the storage. What the mix of next-gen storage this quarter, this past quarter, and how should we think about looking forward?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: For next-generation storage, our volume had been growing very consistently. I guess, year-over-year we grew about 80%...
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: 79%.
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: 79%.
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: In total.
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: In total. So in terms of next generation storage also, about that percentage, because we grew both for traditional storage and next-generation. I guess that percent is pretty close.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: So the next-gen storage was up almost...
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, guys. Maybe just to elaborate on your question. Actually for the Q4 versus Q4 of 2014 and 2015, actually next-gen grew about 94% year-over-year same quarter.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: And is it still accounting for half of your overall storage?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Roughly a little less than half for the fourth quarter.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Got it. Thanks so much.
Operator: We'll go next to Brian Alger with ROTH Capital Partners.
Brian Alger - ROTH Capital Partners LLC: Good afternoon, everyone, and again, congrats on what was a great quarter. I want to come back to Mehdi's question with regards to the strength in the accessories business. The systems business was great, in line or a little bit better than what we expected, but I was really surprised by the subsystems and accessories, can you maybe elaborate there in terms of what drove that growth, and where the demand came from?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. I think it goes in sync with what we talked about, the distributors are primarily the guys who buy the subsystem accessories business. You'll see a lockstep, kind of move with our distributor business, and our subsystems and accessories business. So distributor business was or channel business was very strong for us this quarter.
Brian Alger - ROTH Capital Partners LLC: And given the geographic mix, I'd presume that there was distributors here in the U.S. as opposed to say Europe or Asia?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah.
Brian Alger - ROTH Capital Partners LLC: Great. Great. And then as we look at the systems business, the one area that I haven't heard you really talk about – we've talked about servers and we've talked about storage. What about networking? How's the networking moving? I know it's relatively new there, but is that something that's continuing to grow for us?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: Yeah. Our networking solution is part of our Total Solution, and that has been growing consistently, although not as fast as our storage. But long-term, yes, that will be one of our focus as well.
Brian Alger - ROTH Capital Partners LLC: Great. Great. Again, guys, great quarter.
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: Thank you.
Operator: Next we'll go to Rich Kugele with Needham & Company.
Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good afternoon. A few questions. The – in terms of the issues that impacted you negatively last quarter from the port crisis, getting the chassis and Taiwan program that had been delayed, we assume – should we assume from the revenue that all those issues were resolved, and you were able to ship all your backlog?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Yes.
Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. And when you look at storage, how much was it as an overall percent of revenue?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: About 21%.
Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: I know you don't want to talk about fiscal 2016 right now, but just directionally, do you think that, it can continue to increase as a percent? Or would you anticipate that the systems side just broadly catches up, and maybe it will stay where it is?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: Yes. We continue introducing even better storage system. For example, 4U 90-Bay and lots of other (42:10) storage Total Solution. So I believe storage product line in terms of percentage will continue to grow.
Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. Then just lastly just to understand the timing of the capacity coming online, and the potential impact to gross margin. Should we assume that the first half of fiscal 2016 sees a dip as that capacity comes online? Or can you bring it on linearly as the revenue needs it?
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: We will control the margin kind of like we have a strong demand from our big data center, but only when we have extra capacity or in-house capacity, otherwise we are little bit selective for customer.
Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. Excellent. That's helpful. Thanks a lot.
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Operator: And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of our conference call. I would now like to turn the conference back to Mr. Liang for any closing remarks.
Charles Liang - Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board: Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you, everyone. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude the Super Micro fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015 conference call. We do appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you.

All of those documents are available from Investor Relations page or Super Micro’s website at www.supermicro.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Most of today's presentation will refer to non-GAAP financial results and outlooks. For an explanation of our non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to Slide three of this presentation or to our press release published earlier today. In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today's press release and in the supplemental information attached to today's presentation. I'll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon everyone. Please turn to Slide four. First, let me provide you with the highlights of our fiscal third quarter. We are pleased to announce that we had another strong quarter of growth as our revenue reached $471.2 million. It's 6.3% lower quarter-over-quarter and 26.1% higher year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $24.9 million or 25.6% lower quarter-over-quarter and 40.3% higher compared to last year. Super Micro's non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.47 per diluted share, compared to $0.65 last quarter or $0.37 last year. Please turn to Slide five. We are pleased that during this traditionally [sought much] quarter, Super Micro again achieved strong year-over-year growth of 26.1% and our growth potential remained on track as we now head into the June quarter. Growth this quarter was primarily led by a high systems solution demand from key segment of storage, data center and card HPC and Enterprise. Geographically, revenue in the North America was 58.1%, Europe was 18.7%, Asia was 15.9%, and other region was 7.3% of total sales. Our geographic revenue and percentage remains consistent from our previous quarters, but the lower overall revenue was a result of West Coast Harbor Strike and some projects minor postponement. Fortunately, these issues had been resolved and we have confidence that our strong growth position will carry into the June quarter. Last dive into our products, our service system contribute 64.1% of our total revenue which is another record high for our system business. Our record growth in OEM and direct accounts 53.9% of total revenue was also in line with our strong system demand. In particular the internet data center and cost segment had maintained their recent growth momentum and reached 20.7% of total revenue. The service system business growth indicate our transition into a total solution provider have been successful. As I have mentioned before, more and more customers make our computer system integrated with software and management utility offerings. In addition, our faster growing service business had increased the value proposition of our total solution. With our expanding on size and upcoming online services, customers need new and current are attracted to our service capability as we enabled them to achieve better term to market, higher quality, lower TCO than our traditional hardware business model. This is the result of the significant investment we had made recently in both software and service business unit as they [have] quickly. But most importantly our software as a service gave our customer a piece of mind that exceeds the cost of the investment.  As for our optimized hardware solutions, the transition to our X10 generation of products based on Intel Haswell DP processors is ramping organically as expected, growing 26% quarter-on-quarter. In particular the new Ultra server architecture and hot swappable NVMe technology among others, has strongly encouraged customer to move ahead, also our twin architecture including FatTwin and TwinPro Solutions grew 43% year-over-year. Our mature FatTwin product line had undergo further optimization and refinement to serve different verticals. We now have all [30] battery variation of FatTwin models many of which are being deployed in hyper-scale open environment because of their high performance, high density, higher efficiency and lower TCO. This successful product proved that our [billion box] business model is a perfect match to create application optimized solutions in the emerging technologies. We are continuing to optimize the twin architecture with new and exciting feature [commission. Storage continues to be a leading market vertical with Super Micro with 57% growth year-over-year and up 7% sequentially which indicate a great product momentum in this seasonally third quarter. On a combined base our storage solution was almost 20% of total revenue. As I have mentioned last quarter we are partnering with technology providers to create the next generation of hyper-converged solutions such as EVO RAIL and Virtual SAN. We are also collaborating with partners on the new hybrid storage solutions for example [now recently announced] Ethernet based kinetic open storage platform.  Moreover to speed up the strong growth momentum we have just released our planning for [indiscernible] storage in gradual that [suppose] up to 93.5 inch hard drive for a total of 720 kilobyte [indiscernible] gigabyte per second performance. This huge storage capacity is in close in easily traceable top loaded hot swappable architecture. It also feature [indiscernible] hot swappable expandable module with four [indiscernible] HD port to maximize throughput and [free] redundancy. This new for use storage solution is a perfect for [media streaming] [indiscernible] and archive storage applications. It is just the beginning of our new generation storage products from Super Micro and we are looking forward to bring this high performance optimal storage solution to our customers starting this quarter. On the competing side GPUs for Xeon Phi solutions for HPC and enterprise continue to grow consistently and grew by 67% year-over-year. We will deliver a brand new architecture with four GPU or Xeon Phi solutions in one unit this quarter. This in line bear our architecture enable our GPU be directly connected to a CPU PCI-E length without a driver or any cables achieving the best signal integrity and minimum dependency. Now optimized there is also advantageous in performance and power efficiency with its [non pre-heated] GPU Xeon Phi that minimizes cooling power consumption. This design defines Super Micro's new cooling computing commitment while reaching high level of performance to meet the phase and tomorrow’s supercomputing demands. To summarize we continue to outpace the industry growth by growing 26.1% year-over-year this quarter. We will stay on close and evolve Super Micro into a server storage total solution provider with our strong growth trend driven by technology innovation in our hardware we are expanding our average to new markets with our software products and service offering. With that said we are well positioned to finish the fiscal year 2015 on that very strong note.  For more specifics on that third quarter let me turn it over to Howard.
Howard Hideshima: Thank you Charles and good afternoon everyone. I will focus my remarks on earnings, gross margins, operating expenses and similar items on a non-GAAP basis, which reflects adjustments to exclude stock compensation expenses. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company in today’s earnings release and in the supplemental detail in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call.  Let me begin with a review of the second quarter income statement. Please turn to slide seven. Revenue was 471.2 million, up 26.1% from the same quarter a year ago and down 6.3% sequentially. The increase in revenue from last year was primarily due to our increase in server solutions.  On a geographical basis, we had strong growth in the U.S. of 34.4% followed by Europe at 8.7%. Although Asia was down 4.6%, we see great opportunities for growth in the June quarter. Other regions grew 24 million or 226.7% which includes Australia and Canada. The sequential decrease in revenue was primarily due to seasonal weak quarter compounded by the effects of the West Coast [indiscernible]. There are a number of projects which were delivered late in the quarter and not recognized as revenue.  Slide eight. Turning to product mix, the proportion of revenues from server systems was 64.1% of total revenues, which was up from 50.1% the same quarter a year ago and from 60.1% last quarter. ASP for servers was $3,900 per unit, which is up from $2,600 last year and the same as last quarter. We shipped approximately 77,000 servers in the quarter and 1,007,000 subsystems and accessories. We continue to maintain our diverse revenue base with over 700 customers. One customer did represent more than 10% of our quarterly revenues. Cloud Internet datacenter revenue was 20.7% which is an increase from 20.3% in the prior quarter and an increase from 15.9% in the prior year, 58.1% of our revenues came from the U.S. and 46.1% from our distribution and resellers. Slide 9, non-GAAP gross profit was $77 million, up 34% from 57.5 million in the same quarter last year and down 9% from 84.7 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, gross margin was 16.3%, up from 15.4% a year ago and down from 16.8% sequentially. Price changes from Ablecom resulted in a no basis point change to gross profit in the quarter with total purchases representing approximately 14.7% of total cost of goods sold, compared to 14.4% a year ago and 13.7% sequentially. The year-over-year increase in gross margins resulted from the ramp of new technology as well as from more complete server sales and increased scale of our business. Sequentially gross margins were down due to seasonal weakness in the quarter and lower utilization for the Taiwan facility. Slide 10 and 11, operating expenses were 42 million, up from 33.2 million in the same quarter a year ago and up from 38.6 million sequentially. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses was 8.9%, same as year-over-year and up from 7.7% sequentially. Operating expenses were higher on an absolute basis year-over-year primarily in R&D as we invest in personnel expenses to support development of our total solutions. Sequentially, operating expenses were higher due to about 1.5 million of payroll taxes as they are reassessed at the beginning of the year. In addition, we had a foreign exchange loss of 732,000 compared to a foreign exchange gain of 844,000 primarily from our Taiwan dollar based loans. Historically, foreign exchange was 637,000 gain year to date in fiscal year 2015 compared to 103,000 gain for the same period in fiscal 2014. The company's headcount increased by 153 sequentially to 2,144 total employees to support the expansion of the business such as enterprise software and services. Operating profit was 35 million, up by 44.2% from 24.3 million a year ago and down by 24% from 46.1 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, operating margin was 7.4%, up from 6.5% a year ago and down from 9.1% sequentially. We continue to focus on the many market opportunities we have while leveraging the investments we have made in our infrastructure to continue to deliver our operating margins and profits. Net income was 24.9 million or 5.3% of revenues, up 40.3% from 17.8 million a year ago and down 25.6% from 33.5 million sequentially. On a non-GAAP fully diluted basis EPS was $0.47 per share, up from $0.37 per share a year ago and down from $0.65 per share sequentially. The number of fully diluted shares used in the third quarter was 52,680,000. The tax rate in the third quarter with on a non-GAAP basis was 28.3% compared to 26.4% a year ago and 27% sequentially. The rate was higher sequentially due to the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in December 2014. We expect the tax rate on a non-GAAP basis to be approximately 32% for the June quarter. Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis, cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments were 112 million, up 26.1 million from 85.9 million in the prior quarter and up 7.6 million from 104.4 million in the same quarter last year. In the third quarter, free cash flow was a positive 4.1 million, primarily due to our net income of 23.1 million, a decrease in accounts receivable all set in part by an increase in inventory described below as well as building investments of 8.5 million to support the continued growth of our business. Slide 13, accounts receivable decreased by 37.2 million to 221.6 million due to less revenues sequentially. DSOs was 46 days, an increase of 5 days from 41 days in the prior quarter. Inventory decreased by 21.2 million to 430.4 million to support the growth of the business in a seasonally strong quarter as well as the effects of the [port strike]. Days in inventories were 96, an increase of 13 days from 83 days in the prior quarter. Accounts payable was 261.6 million, which was 62 days, an increase of six days from the 56 days in the prior quarter. Overall, cash conversion cycle days was 80 days, which is 12 days higher than the prior quarter. Now for a few comments on our outlook, during the third quarter, we continued our strong growth in a seasonally challenging quarter and more so by the [west coast port] strike. As we enter the fourth quarter, we look to take advantage of our broad breadth of solutions, which have expanded beyond hardware to include software as a service to drive our strong growth and profitability in the seasonally strong quarter for the industry. We will build upon our experiences during the past quarter to improve, to continue our delivery of product and services to our customers and partners. Therefore the Company currently expects net sales for the quarter ending June 30, 2015, in a range of 510 million to 560 million. Assuming this revenue range that the Company expects non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.53 to $0.62 for the quarter. At the mid-point this will represent a growth of 25% and 45% in revenue and EPS respectively from the prior year. This would make fiscal year 2015 revenue of about 2 billion and about $2.16 EPS which will represent growth from the prior year approximately 33% and 61% respectively.  This currently expected that the outlook will not be updated until the release of the company’s next quarterly earnings announcement. Notwithstanding subsequent developments however, the company may update the outlook, or any portion thereof, at any time. With that let me turn it back to Charles for some closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Howard. With more than 26% revenue and growth year-over-year Super Micro is again one of the fastest growing company in the IT industry if not the fastest. Despite the seasonally [softness] our long-term growth trend remains intact with our robust products and service as we’re looking forward to a strong finish this fiscal year. We are well positioned with [prepared foundation] rapidly expanding customer base and that the most leading edge product [indiscernible]  Operator at this time we are ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We’ll go first to Alex Kurtz with Sterne Agee.
Alex Kurtz : Thanks guys for taking a couple of questions here. First Howard it looks like the port of Oakland will shut down for four days that’s generally what I’m seeing here and if I just think about your daily revenue either internationally or domestically on a daily basis excluding weekends obviously it’s like $4 million to $7 million a day. So I mean could this have been $10 million to $15 million of revenue that got delayed out of the quarter or just kind of vaporized to a certain degree.
Howard Hideshima: Yes, Alex actually [port strike] was much longer than that but to get back to what direct effects we saw, we saw our pushed out revenues approximately about 5.5 million and that doesn’t count some of the other projects that we had also that were delayed because we didn’t have 'chassis' if you want to call t to fully complete our things. But the direct effect of this revenue that we did not recognize that we shift was about 5.5 million. 
Alex Kurtz : And how does that impact the June quarter if at all, I mean the next question will be well why won't you get that back in the June quarter so how would you --?
Howard Hideshima: [Multiple Speakers] come back in the June quarter
Alex Kurtz : So when you think about the June quarter guidance is there some kind of conservativism that you’re putting in around the [grandly] uptake or just general macro concerns, I think some of us were just expecting a little bit healthier guide on the June quarter. So just trying to understand if that has any kind of -- is anything else beyond this harbor strike that you’re seeing that’s impacting the macro outlook for the June quarter.
Howard Hideshima: Seasonally I think we’re just coming out of this seasonally weak quarter. We do see a lot of projects out, there a lot of opportunities for us to further capitalize upon and at the mid-point of the guidance [indiscernible] we got about we see it about 26% --25%. 
Alex Kurtz : Okay. And just last question for me, then I’ll pass it on. If you were to think about, you obviously got -- you shift a lot of systems this quarter and it would seem that that if you’re normalizing this quarter’s revenue for say December because of volume would you have eclipsed 17% gross margin if you were looking at this quarter’s mix [indiscernible] system the components if you did that mix back into December quarter.
Howard Hideshima: I think you’re going to see likely seasonally we guided the weak quarter and it usually has an impact into our margin per se as we get into a strong quarter you typically do see a pick-up in margins there. We have a lot of grid factors that are going on as we get the capacity utilization of Taiwan up, seasonally strong quarter, continuing growth of our business in the server side of it; those are all [play] factors that will help us grow our margins in our operating [point]. 
Alex Kurtz : All right. Thanks guys.
Operator: We’ll hear next from Rich Kugele with Needham & Company.
Rich Kugele : Thank you. Good afternoon gentlemen. Can you get into a little bit of color around the inventory, it increased again in the quarter, you talked about some of the port strike being related to that as well as growth in the business but that was two quarters in a row of increasing inventory, is there anything unusual going on with the composition of that inventory and then I have a follow up.
Charles Liang: Yes, for the March quarter [indiscernible] port strike so we have some half time of getting a chassis especially, but now all the programs have been pretty much fixed. So our inventory now grow into a very healthy position. So it will be very [half of our] June quarter.
Rich Kugele : You would expect the inventory to exit at a lower level from June?
Charles Liang: Yes, that June quarter will ensure I mean inventory the kind of enough so the business grow.
Rich Kugele : Okay. And then in terms of the sub system business was most of the push out in project on that side and can you just elaborate a little bit maybe about the end markets that are buying those sub systems?
Charles Liang: Yes, it's postponed because no one in our chassis basically, so customers still -- indeed we ship most of them in April and somewhere being maximized May.
Rich Kugele : Okay and then just lastly given the significant improvement on the storage side for multiple quarters now does it change your long-term views on what you think the operating margin can deliver or should we think of the storage business as being more comparable with the overall system side from margin [for us]?
Charles Liang: Storage product might continue to be much stronger right, especially this quarter we just introduced our [indiscernible] in a really high density hot swappable kind of storage solution and this -- again that's why that's the first beginning we have a much stronger storage product line will be available month after month.
Operator: We'll hear now from Mark Kelleher with D.A. Davidson.
Mark Kelleher: How about if we talk a little bit about the Grantley cycle, it's something we usually talk about on this call, how much of your server sales are total sales are now Grantley based? And how do see that cycle playing out over the next few quarters?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, Mark this is Howard. Again we saw a good growth in that side as we expected, it quarter-to-quarter went up about 26%, for us again and that's kind of is in line with what Intel was talking about with regards to their conversion of their processor output to about half over the last six months. So it's coming out nicely for us. We have a lot of new products; a lot of products were adopted new processor that Charles talked about a bit out there, so we see great potential in the ramp coming.
Mark Kelleher: So would you say that half of your sales are based on that right now in line with Intel?
Howard Hideshima: Not quite half again, not quite half.
Mark Kelleher: Can you just describe how you picture this cycle playing out; does this give you a surge for the next couple of quarters and then kind of plateau and pull in, how do you anticipate that effecting?
Charles Liang: At this next two coming quarters, we will continue to see the beneficial from the hardware and then Grantley side and platform. That is in June quarter, September quarter.
Operator: We'll move next to [Mette Hosinie with FIG].
Unidentified Analyst: Would it be possible to elaborate on the mix of the storage either as overall revenue or part of this up component?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, around 20% of our revenues now, a little bit above 20% of revenues, it's a mix of basically the -- if you want to call it the hyper-scale next gen type of storage applications as well as our traditional JBOD and had no type of storage, so we've got some very exciting products as Charles mentioned earlier on the other side of the box with regards to JBOD at those size as well as increasing our partnership base out there on the next gen and hyper converge markets.
Unidentified Analyst: Sure so to that extent and with some of your component vendors also talking about a strength in the near line looking in to the second half of calendar year, would there be any conflict of interest that would actually slow down or be viewed as a headwind as you try to expand the storage business line?
Charles Liang: Yes, there must always a competitive right, so Super Micro has advantage since 10 years ago since the day we was founded, our advantage always better product better architecture, term to market, better quality and now better total solution including system management software and home-site service and also customer online service.
Unidentified Analyst: Sure and then just one follow-up, how should we think about the ASP trend for both server and subcomponent looking into the June and September quarters?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, I think as we see density increasing and our ability to provide the best dense solutions out there in the market. Historically, you've seeing our ASP continue to grow quite frankly we're at 3,900 this quarter, prior year was 2,600 and if you want to go back a couple of years it was down 1,900 back in fiscal, so you've see continued trend, this increasing quite frankly because of the density of the box and solutions that we're offering, that we're pushing more performance per box into each one of the solutions that we're delivering. And then we add software and support services on to that, that again increases value add to that box.
Unidentified Analyst: Sure and can I ask one other follow-up question?
Charles Liang: Yes.
Unidentified Analyst: In the prepared remark you talked about the postponement of a project and I perceived that as completely independent of a port shutdown, would you be able to elaborate on what this project entails to and has this been back on track again?
Charles Liang: I've been -- I will obviously say pretty much 100% back on track, so the postponement [for March] for sure will increase our June revenue.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. I’m just curious why this project was delayed, was that due to customer changing --?
Charles Liang: Because no enough components especially chassis. Q - Unidentified Analyst Okay. So it was tied into the port shut down.
Charles Liang: Yes, we did ship some charging by air and that’s why it of course has more for March. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We’ll move on to Aaron Rakers of Stifel. 
Aaron Rakers : Yes, thanks for taking the questions. I want to follow up on that last question, just to clear the 5.5 million impact in the quarter is related to the port shut down, is there a separate impact specific to the project delay in to new size that impact. 
Charles Liang: Indeed the project delayed mainly because of the port strike and that’s why we had no way to deliver on time. So however those have been improved in April and coming May. And the total port strike 5.5 million indeed it also closed also other deal that we cannot ship in March quarter. However, most of them will be shipped in June quarter. Q - Aaron Rakers  So just to be clear, so the -- there is a bigger impact in just the 5.5 million or 5.5 million is the total impact for the quarter. 
Howard Hideshima: 5.5 Aaron is basically what we did ship but we couldn’t not recognize because of the [kept in] terms or what have you that were sent out in the but weren't able to recognize because of the delay caused in late deliveries there. The other part that Charles is alluding to is other projects that we have not fulfilled yet because of the product delay, components delays that is a larger number.
Aaron Rakers : That’s a larger number but you can’t quantify that number. 
Howard Hideshima: We haven’t quantified that, that’s correct. 
Aaron Rakers : Okay I just wanted to be clear. Real quickly couple of other questions, you guys when you look at the model in what you’ve outlined for this next quarter, it looks like you’re going to be at if not above the high end of what you previously talked about 6% to 8% operating margin range. Where do you stand on providing a longer term update to that, should we think about 8% plus as being the new target model or any kind of framework of how we should think about that longer term would be helpful?
Howard Hideshima: Aaron I think like I said as you look at the numbers I look at presenting some of that as far as reaching the $2 billion target if we hit the mid-point and then with our EPS growth would be at about $2.15 there. We will take a look at our model at the end of this quarter and then take a look at providing some guidance. 
Aaron Rakers : That’s helpful. And then final other two questions, why was G&A expense up in March sequentially, is there any kind of one-time nature to that or is that a new level to consider going forward?
Howard Hideshima: It’s primarily in the foreign ex I’d like to characterize that as I mentioned we took foreign ex loss this quarter of approximately 700,000 versus about $800,000 gain. So if you flip those two around again those two caused the majority of the change sequentially in our G&A expenses. Typically it’s been fairly stable over the course of the last few quarters that do not. If I had to measure it today we measure it on today’s rate that that would probably turn into about $3,000 gain. So again we’ll take a look at breaking it out separately and looking at other means to potentially hedge it what have you.
Aaron Rakers : Okay. And then the final real quick question is, how do you think about the long-term model from a cash conversion cycle basis? I know that’s been obviously impacted by some of the items that hit this quarter but longer term, how should we think about cash conversion cycle?
Howard Hideshima: Well I think today in my cash conversion should hopefully come down I think was impacted a bit by the inventory this time around, also I wanted to note the property itself we spent about 8.5 million during the quarter in property and we will continue to make some investments there but we do believe it’s going to be a positive. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we do have a follow up from Rich Kugele.
Rich Kugele : Yes, thank you. Just the Taiwan utilization rate in the quarter I don’t know if I missed that and then what is the timing for your new California facility to be up and running?
Charles Liang: Okay. I mean for Taiwan facility in the last quarter the reason why it was lower because we had a one big deal postponed ship into I believe this month April, as for USA facility yes, the utilities get in ready, the [indiscernible] ready to move in by July. So up there that would be beneficial to our operation.
Rich Kugele : Okay. And what was the utilization number exactly?
Howard Hideshima: 46%, Rich it was the utilization number. I want to also tie back on a question you had earlier potentially was the operating expenses about. We do see leverage out there I talked a bit with Aaron with regards to the effect of foreign-ex. We do see, continue to see leverage out of that. We are making investments in our software and support and those types of areas in sales people but we do continue to see and keep an eye on our operating expenses so we can get leverage there.
Rich Kugele : [indiscernible] your utilization fell that much down into 46% then you also were spending on things like airfreight you would think that next quarter on a much better revenue number perhaps for your margin and your OpEx would both be significantly better yes?
Howard Hideshima: Basically for sure.
Operator: And there appeared to be now further questions at this time. Mr. Liang, I'll turn this back to your close remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you for joining us today and we're looking forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you everyone. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the Super Micro third quarter fiscal year 2015 conference call. We appreciate your participation and you may now disconnect at this time. Thank you.

You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2014 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available from Investor Relations page or Super Micro's website at www.supermicro.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Most of today's presentation will refer to non-GAAP financial results and outlooks. For an explanation of our non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to slide three of this presentation or to our press release published earlier today. In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today's press release and in the supplemental information attached to today's presentation. I'll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon everyone. Please turn to slide four. First, let me provide you with the highlights of our fiscal second quarter. We are pleased to announce that we had another record quarter as our revenue have reached $503 million. It's 13.5% higher quarter-over-quarter and 41.2% higher year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $33.5 million, or 44.5% higher quarter-over-quarter and 110.9% higher compared to last year. Super Micro's non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.65 per diluted share, compared to $0.46 last quarter or $0.35 last year. Please turn to slide five. As we have always believed for Washington technology combined with robust operation foundation translates into a strong revenue and growth and increased profitability for Super Micro. Last quarter we achieved our fifth consecutive a record high in revenue. With that we’ll reach our goal of achieving $2 billion annual run rate and a continual improvement of our operation profit. Geographically, revenue in the North America was 57%, Europe was 18.2% and Asia was 15.6% of total sales. Our growth in USA continued to be the strongest worldwide. Last quarter, Europe grew in absolute revenue by lower as percentage. In Asia, we continued to see a great potential to grow as we increase our investment in local capacity and manpower. Last but not least, we saw increase in sales in countries such as Canada, Australia, Mexico and region of South America which boosted other region's revenue to 9.2%. Slide 6 please. For products, services have contributed 60.1% of our total revenue which is another record high for our system business. As I have mentioned before, more and more customer make our computer system integrated with software and management utilities offerings. Our computer system business ensures the best quality, one stop shop [TTM] [ph] advantages as well as on-site service for customer who need them, while our distribution and channel business also continue to grow in revenue. With that said, 50% of our business last quarter came from direct customers and OEMs of which 20.3% came from the Internet data center and card providers. Cloud solution demands were not very stronger last quarter. The previous quarter was the official launch of our X10 generation of products based on Intel, Haswell DP processors. We saw very good progress in adoption of this platform with 269% increase quarter-over-quarter in X10 product shipments. The new Ultra server architecture and hot swappable NVMe technology among others, has strongly encouraged customer to move ahead while we are still in the early stage of this technology transition. Now let's turn to market application optimize architecture and performance advantages are driving these significant growth and we see these trend to continue. On our key product line, storage continues to be a needed market vertical for Super Micro with 58% growth year-over-year. In addition to our tradition of storage offerings, we also work with leading technology partners to provide next generation hyper-converged storage solutions and high speed solutions. When we consider the broader storage market, the share of our storage revenue is in the range of 20% of our overall business. Storage indeed plays an important role of our total solution brand and we will continue to focus and invest in this growing segment. On the computing side, we addressed the increasing demand from cloud enterprise and data center industries with our optimized multi product line solutions, our twin architecture including FatTwin and TwinPro Solutions grew 75% year-over-year. We also saw approximately 50% year-over-year revenue increase with our MicroBlade, SuperBlade and MicroCloud products. All of these solutions, of our application optimization reached the maximum performance per watt and per dollars to each customer installation. Looking ahead, we are continuing to deepen our service, storage, technology spectrum by developing the most application optimized and exactly the most energy cost and service efficient platforms. Writing down the success of our storage business, we are developing a new super high-density 4U Rackmount solutions that will house up to 90.5 inch fast array or SATA [ph] hard driver risk with new inclusive features. We are also developing branding solution that can support even higher GPU or Xeon Phi density. And with our [no air] [ph] pre heated, no air pre heated means the system we will be able to achieve higher performance and systems stability with lower energy cost and PCO. This innovative solution will also support our future generations of GPU or Xeon Phi products even as power requirement increase. These two upcoming product line are just a few examples of many great technology now on the [horizon] [ph] from Super Micro. To summarize, we demonstrate industry leading growth by growing 41.2% year-over-year and reaching our milestone of 2 billion annual run rate to us. We will continue to leverage our advantages of leading technology, turn to market and product choice to provide exactly what customer want when they want it. To our customers, we are dedicated to be the one stop shop for basic service storage, total solutions on the market with [indiscernible] global service. To our shareholders, we are committed to deliver industry leading growth with improving profitability. For more specifics on the second quarter, let me turn it over to Howard.
Howard Hideshima: Thank you, Charles, and good afternoon everyone. I will focus my remarks on earnings, gross margins, operating expenses, and similar items, on a non-GAAP basis, which reflects adjustments to exclude stock compensation expenses. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company in today’s earnings release and in the supplemental detail in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Let me begin with a review of the second quarter income statement. Please turn to Slide 7. Revenue was a record $503 million, up 41.2% from the same quarter a year ago and 13.5% sequentially. The increase in revenue from last year was primarily due to our increase in our service solutions sales, as partners continue to look for application optimized solutions utilizing the latest technology. On a geographical basis, we had strong growth in the U.S. of 59.7% growth followed by Europe at 7.8%. Although Asia was down 4.4%, we see continued opportunities for growth. Our other region category which includes country such as Canada, Australia, Mexico and South America, grew 380.1% as we are seeing increasing opportunities there as well. The sequential increase in revenue was primarily due to seasonally strong quarter and to our strength and technology and broad product lines which allows us to see strong ramp in the Haswell products. Turning to products mix, the proportion of revenues from server systems was 60.1% of total revenues, which is up from 48.8% the same quarter a year ago and from 57.7% last quarter. ASP for servers was $3900 per unit, which is up from $2700 last year and up from $3600 last quarter. We shipped approximately 78,000 servers in the quarter and 1,115,000 subsystems and accessories. We continue to maintain a diverse customer base with over 700 customers and did represent more than 10% of our quarterly revenues. Cloud and Internet data center revenues was 20.3%, which was an increase from 13.7% in the prior quarter and an increase from 12.9% in the prior year. 57% of our revenues came from the U.S. and 50% from our distribution and resellers. Slide 9. Non-GAAP gross profit was $84.7 million, up 53% from $55.3 million in the same quarter last year and up 22% from $69.4 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, gross margin was 16.8%, up from 15.5% a year ago and from 15.7% sequentially. Price changes from Ablecom resulted in a no basis point change to the gross profit in the quarter with total purchases representing approximately 13.8% of total cost of goods sold, compared to 18.1% a year ago and 14.5% sequentially. The year-over-year increase in gross margins resulted from the ramp of new technology as well as from more complete server sales, increased scale of our business and higher utilization of our Taiwan facility. Sequentially gross margin was up through the ramp of the new technology, as well as increased scale of our business and more complete server solutions. Slide 10 and 11. Operating expenses were $38.6 million, up from $32.3 million in the same quarter a year ago and up from $34.8 million sequentially. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses was 7.7%, down from 9.1% year over year and from 7.9% sequentially. Operating expenses were higher on an absolute dollar basis primarily in R&D, as we invest in personnel expenses to support the development of our solutions especially in preparation for new technology launch over the past year. Sequentially, operating expenses were higher due to a $1.9 million of value-added tax refund from Taiwan, which we received during the first quarter of fiscal 2015 and higher compensation benefits and product development cost during the quarter as we continue to broaden our solution around the Haswell product launch. The company's headcount increased by 60 sequentially to 1,991 total employees. Operating profit was $46.1 million, up 100.4% from $23 million a year ago and by 33.1% from $34.6 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, operating margin was 9.1%, up from 6.4% a year ago and from 7.8% sequentially. We continue to focus on the many market opportunities in front of us while leveraging the investments we have made in our infrastructure to drive our operating margins and profits. Net income was $33.5 million or 6.7% of revenues, up 110.9% from $15.9 million a year ago and 44.5% from $23.2 million sequentially. On a non-GAAP fully diluted basis EPS was $0.65 per share, up from $0.35 per share a year ago and up from $0.46 per share sequentially. The number of fully diluted shares used in the second quarter was 51,645,000. The tax rate in the second quarter on a non-GAAP basis was 27% compared to 30.5% a year ago and 32.7% sequentially. The rate was lower sequentially due to the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in December 2014 which contributed about $0.05 to our EPS. We expect the effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis to be approximately 32.1% for the March quarter. This rate assumes no reinstatement of the R&D tax credit for calendar 2015. Turning to the balance sheet, on a sequential basis, Slide 12. Cash and cash equivalents, and short and long term investments were $85.9 million, down $34.3 million from $120.2 million in the prior quarter and down $6.7 million from $92.6 million in the same quarter last year. In the second quarter, free cash flow was a negative $44 million, primarily due to inventory and accounts receivable increases described below. Slide 13. Accounts receivable increased by $64.4 million to $258.8 million to support the growth and revenue. DSOs was 41 days, a decrease of 1 day from 42 days in the prior quarter. Inventory increased by $67.7 million to $409.2 million to support the transition to Haswell-based products. Days in inventories were 83 days, an increase of 2 days from 81 days in the prior quarter. Accounts payable was $283.8 million, which was 56 days, an increase of two days from 54 days in the prior quarter. Overall, cash conversion cycle days was 68 days, which is 1 day lower than the prior quarter. Now for a few comments on our outlook. During the second quarter, we continued our see our strong growth, leveraging the foundation we have built over the years and executing our strategy to provide optimized solutions to our customers. As we enter the third quarter, a new technology refresh cycle has started, with many new technologies being introduced. We look to take advantage of our engineering and our broad breadth of solutions to drive our strong growth and profitability. However, it is the seasonally weak quarter for the industry. Therefore the company currently expects net sales for the quarter ending March 31, 2015 in the range of $450 million to $500 million. Assuming this revenue range, the company expects non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.46 to $0.52 for the quarter. At the midpoint, this would represent a growth of 27% and 32% in revenue and EPS respectively, from the prior year. It is currently expected that the outlook will not be updated until the release of the company’s next quarterly earnings announcement. Notwithstanding subsequent developments however, the company may update the outlook, or any portion thereof, at any time. With that, let me turn it back to Charles for some closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Howard. The second quarter was another record high for Super Micro, with nearly growth of 41.2%. Even though this was one of our strongest quarter ever, we believe this is just the beginning of our long term growth as we continue to invest and to expand our foundation by growing professional stock and constructing advanced facility worldwide. On the strength of our technology transition, our optimized product line, and our overall market opportunity, we believe we will continue to grow at a multiple over the industry is known and our share in the competition. Operator, at this time, we are ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Aaron Rakers with Stifel.
Aaron Rakers: Congratulations on the impressive quarter. I guess the first question is just to kind of touch on the topline revenue growth trajectory. You have crossed through the $2 billion annualized mark. Just curious how you are thinking about the next $1 billion. Are we seeing acceleration and do we kind of see -- are you anticipating any kind of sustained, call it, 20%-plus growth rate here as we move forward? And then maybe I will just throw my follow-up right in right away. How do we also think about that in the context of the operating margin target going forward? I think in the past, you have talked about 6% to 8% and now you have crossed through that with a 9%-plus number here this quarter. And then I will get back in queue. Thank you.
Charles Liang: I believe our feel is, we are continuing to grow consistently especially the Haswell new transition just beginning. However, at Q1 again traditional Fed quarter not only try to conservative. However, for fiscal year 2015 I believe we hope we can achieve $2 billion strongly, - $2 billion for fiscal year. And as operation margin, I believe we will continue to grow. Howard, you may have more detail about it.
Howard Hideshima: And just back to your question again at the mid point of our guidance even for this quarter, we’re seeing about 27% growth from prior year. So again when you talk about that 20% that you threw out there, we were exceeding that with even our current guidance. With regard to the operating margin itself, we are continuing to look at way to leverage that obviously and take advantage of that and further improve our profits going forward.
Operator: We'll go next to Mark Kelleher with D.A. Davidson.
Mark Kelleher: Let me add my congratulations on a great quarter. Want to talk about the -- I guess we're moving down the income statement. Let's talk about the gross margins. That is a pretty significant step up sequentially. Can you talk about what elements were in there? I know you mentioned Grantley was in there. Maybe product mix. I know data centers was big in the quarter, but that carries lower gross margins. Can you just give us some puts and takes on the gross margin? And I would make the follow-up question, what percent of revenue in the quarter was Grantley servers? Thanks.
Charles Liang: Couple of factor to improve our margin, one is new products line. As we just mentioned, Haswell CPU from Intel is still brand new. And with Haswell product line, we introduced some new architectural like [archwad] [ph] architecture, architecture rack and MicroBlade, NVMe or all those new technology we just made them available last quarter. So all those we are continuing to grow. And our [indiscernible] in Taiwan facility and our facility in USA was all improving.
Howard Hideshima: And Mark I think I will just add to that, like I said, we have a number of factors that we talked about with regards to improving our growth margin this quarter we really hit upon a lot of those factors with regards on top of the new technology launched that Charles talked about, complete server solutions were very high at 60%, utilization at Taiwan, growth of our scale of our business, all of those contributed - not to mention services and support and software revenues. So a lot of things went well and in line in with what we were talking about as far as improving our margins going forward.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We’ll go next to Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group.
Nehal Chokshi: Thank you. Staying on the gross margin, can you give some directionality for the March quarter, given the strong performance in the December quarter?
Howard Hideshima: Generally, seasonally it's a weak quarter and in past we've seen some margin softness in those quarters. So again, we’ve taken that into account in our models with regards to the guidance that we provided. We do see some softness there. That could be offset by again strength in our technology, strength in growing our scale or whatever.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. Great. And then congratulations on absolutely stunning growth, especially on the systems. Relative to the midpoint guidance of $460 million, there was a $43 million beat. Could you talk about the drivers of the upside? Was that all on a systems level or was there some component? And then can you drill down within the systems level, perhaps between hyperscale storage system, storage OEMs, and the disruption of the server market from the IBM selling its x86 business?
Charles Liang: Yes. All the factors you mentioned pretty much all positive for our business. So we feel very optimistic to grow in the coming quarters especially the Haswell, again, like I just mentioned still new. And NVMe, that's a brand new technology, also much better performance and latency. So those product line will continue to grow our business for sure.
Nehal Chokshi: Within the quarter, of those four things that I talked about, which ones was the biggest contributor to the year-over-year growth that you are seeing on the systems level?
Howard Hideshima: It would be the, probably power transition. We saw very good ramp with regards to our Haswell-Grantley platforms during the quarter as Charles alluded to the 200 plus percent growth quarter-over-quarter. And that was very good to our positive improvement.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next to Rich Kugele with Needham & Company.
Rich Kugele: Good afternoon and congratulations again. I just wanted to ask a question about the inventory and then a follow-up with them. Is the inventory that you brought in raw components on the Grantley side? Were you concerned with availability? And then if you could just talk about when you expect the U.S. buildout of your local manufacturing and R&D to be completed and if you expect any type of material gross margin headwinds from that facility as it goes up?
Howard Hideshima: Rich let's go with the last question first. With regard to the local facility we talked about Xeon Phi, the green computing part that we talk about here. As I mentioned before, we expect to spend about 21 million over the next year to facilitate that up and get the first building completed there during the next year. Again, do we see some drag on it? We will be bringing it up as we need it per say here, so we won't see much drag with regards to that.
Operator: We’ll go next to Mark Kelleher with D.A. Davidson.
Mark Kelleher: Just as a follow-up question. You mentioned the Taiwan manufacturing utilization. Sometimes you give us that number. Can you tell us what that utilization rate is?
Charles Liang: Last quarter our utilization rate I believe was 57%. And looking forward, the utilization will continue to improve and I hope we can reach 80% not too far away.
Mark Kelleher: Okay. Great, thanks.
Operator: We’ll go next to Aaron Rakers with Stifel.
Aaron Rakers: Just to follow on that comment, the 57% utilization, just to be clear, that is a utilization rate on your current existing product line -- your current existing manufacturing lines. Is the 80% also based on that? I guess what I am trying to understand is when do you fully expect to see the benefits of that in your gross margin line?
Charles Liang: Yes 57% of that current and we believe to reach 80% hopefully in next quarter or two. And then we are looking for more space I mean after that.
Aaron Rakers: Okay. And then I think I had heard you mention that you did have a 10% customer in the quarter. Are you assuming that you continue to have a 10% customer in your current guidance or -- maybe any framework of what kind of customer that was, how do you expect that to progress as we go forward.
Charles Liang: We believe this customer will continue to grow and we really hope that and have a strong confidence. At the same time we hope to grow more customer. So Super Micro has been a diversified company in term of product and customer base.
Aaron Rakers: And was that in the Internet and cloud vertical?
Charles Liang: Yes it was.
Aaron Rakers: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Ethan Steinberg with SG Capital.
Ethan Steinberg: Just a couple pieces I wanted to make sure I heard correctly. Did you say $2 billion, roughly, for the year, is what you were hoping for the fiscal year?
Charles Liang: Yes, by end of June right.
Ethan Steinberg: Yes. Okay. And then so 16.8% gross margin was a great breakout quarter. If you look at the new technology transition driving it and the other factors you talked about, it seems like all those are moving in the right direction. We still got a lot of the transition taking place even this quarter. I guess, can you help us think about directionally? Does that mean there is a decent amount more room for gross margin to move up as we get through this year?
Charles Liang: I believe we will continue growing in term of operating margin but it won't be a big change. We've been relatively consistent to mostly growing I believe.
Ethan Steinberg: Okay. And I was actually thinking gross margin. Would you say the same answer?
Howard Hideshima: On the gross margin we are saying was, what we have is this great opportunity to drive growth in our business. So again, while we will look at the operating gross margins and preserve those as best we can, there are opportunities for us to take some market share and we do believe that that will translate to operating margin benefits as we’ve seen over this past 18 months as we put out this model in the past year.
Ethan Steinberg: Okay. But if Grantley goes up as a percentage quite a bit in the quarter you just guided for, wouldn't that have a pretty positive dynamic on the gross margin?
Charles Liang: Possible, but at the same time we are also thinking about our kind of Q1 can be flat quarter and also a surprise for memory hard drive [indiscernible] a nonfactor.
Ethan Steinberg: Okay. Thank you, guys.
Operator: And we'll go to a follow up from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group.
Nehal Chokshi: Looking at the balance sheet, Howard, could you run through the DSOs numbers again real quickly?
Howard Hideshima: Sure. DSOs on account receivable were 41 days. The DSOs on inventory were 83 days and the accounts payable DSO was 56 days.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. So on a quarter-over-quarter basis, I think you said it was flat for the DSOs on the accounts receivable. Is that right?
Howard Hideshima: Accounts receivable were actually one down one day from 41 to - 
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. Okay. Just trying to understand this, because it looks like the accounts receivable was up 33% quarter over quarter, yet the revenue overall was up 13% quarter over quarter. Presuming that my math is correct, is there a higher amount of days receivable for system level revenue relative to component revenue?
Howard Hideshima: Never broken that out Nehal but quite - it's basically on the average. So we are competing on the average. That may help you on the calculation.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Operator: And it appears we have no other questions at this time. I’d like to turn the call back over to Mr. Liang for any additional or closing comments.
Charles Liang: Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you, everyone. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude the Super Micro second quarter fiscal year 2015 conference call. We do appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you.

In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today's press release and in the supplemental information attached to today's presentation. I'll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon everyone. Please turn to slide four. First, let me provide you with the highlights of our fiscal first quarter. We are pleased that our first quarter revenue was $443.3 million. It’s 3.6% higher quarter over quarter, and 43.5% higher year over year. This result was another record high for Super Micro.  Non-GAAP net income was $23.2 million, or 19.5% higher quarter over quarter and 134.8% higher compared to last year. Super Micro’s non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.46 per diluted share, compared to $0.40 last quarter or $0.22 last year. Please turn to slide five. Last quarter, we achieved our fourth consecutive record high revenue, which was 43.5% higher than last year. Many growth factors contributed to these impressive achievements. First and foremost, our services contributed 57.7% of our total revenue, which is another record high for our system business. 44% of our business last quarter came from our building block solution, OEMs, and direct customers. [unintelligible] solution and storage [unintelligible] were significant barriers, while internet data center [unintelligible]. Moreover, we introduced our brand new X10 generation of products based on the latest Intel Haswell [DP] processors. We exercised our engineering expertise and turned it into a first to market product advantage from early delivery programs. The [unintelligible] revenue in North America was 54.9%. Asia was 19.9%, and Europe was 20.2% of total sales. Our growth in North America continued to be strong, where Asia grew slightly and Europe [rebounded] from last quarter. Notably we [unintelligible] the green computing park project in the heart of Silicon Valley last quarter. The expansion will provide additional production and operation capacity as we expect more aggressive growth from the domestic market in the near future. As I have mentioned before, systems solutions have grown to dominate our revenue because of our optimized design for unique customers in areas like storage, cloud, HPC, and high-density multiple node systems. Last quarter, our storage revenue grew 63% year over year, and 1% sequentially. GPU Xeon Phi solutions continued their momentum with 95% higher growth year over year and 52% higher sequentially. Multiple node systems such as MicroCloud grew 60% year over year and 71% sequentially. Our Twin solutions, including FatTwin, TwinPro and [Twinsquared] product lines grew 73% year over year and 23% sequentially. On these trends, we are pleased to see the performance per [watt] and computing density continue to [ship] the [unintelligible] as we anticipated. In addition, our service, software, and networking solution offers are growing consistently to help us win new total solution customers. Slide six [unintelligible]. Continuing our momentum from our X9 generation of products, we launched our [unintelligible] X10 Haswell [unintelligible] product line that this year Intel’s [IPF]. Along with the launch, we unveiled our industry leading brand new Haswell architecture, which delivers the highest performance per watt and most flexible I/O on the market today. These [unintelligible] service can support the latest [unintelligible] processors, up to 165 watt [TDP], I mean thermal design power, 1.5 terabytes of [CD] alpha memory intended for [dims], plus [unintelligible], which I will discuss later for increased storage bandwidth and energy efficiency, 96% plus [titanium] level power supplies. We removed our traditional I/O rigidity and bottlenecks by developing a set of new multiple function I/O modules that can accommodate full 10G [unintelligible], full 10G [SLP plus], full 40G Ethernet, multiple channel [FBR] [InfiniBand] options and beyond. Also included in this launch was our [unintelligible] Memory Express technology [unintelligible] NVMe. It’s the next [big leap] in storage performance and Super Micro is again the first to implement this latest technology and deliver it to the market. Our testing indicates that the NVMe system provides almost six times the bandwidth and approximately 7 times the latency improvement over standard SSDs. Moreover, we have the most extensive hot swappable NVMe product lines in the industry, and we are shipping to our customers today. As our technical expertise matured, we want to offer more value beyond just hardware systems. Many years of preparation and investment have gone into Super Micro’s cloud solution business. Our cloud solutions consist of complete racks of servers, switches, and storage, combined with software and service intended for both large scale public and small scale private clouds. These solutions are essentially plug and play with complete care by Super Micro, which represents our continuous effort to provide the customer with optimized high-value turnkey solutions with peace of mind. To summarize, we have begun fiscal 2015 with a very strong first quarter results, which carries our faster pace momentum toward an exciting new year. Our strong global foundation is based on years of innovative product leadership and expanding worldwide operations. We continue to see opportunity in the server and storage market by leveraging our unique [unintelligible] approach, and now delivering optimized, complete solutions, with service and software. We believe this new enhanced business capability will [unintelligible] our strong growth, momentum, and gain market share. For more specifics on our first quarter, let me turn it over to Howard. 
Howard Hideshima: Thank you, Charles, and good afternoon everyone. I will focus my remarks on earnings, gross margins, operating expenses, and similar items, on a non-GAAP basis, which reflects adjustments to exclude stock compensation expenses. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company in today’s earnings release and in the supplemental detail in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Let me begin with a review of the first quarter’s income statement. Please turn to slide eight. Revenue was a record $443.3 million, up 43.5% from the same quarter a year ago and up 3.6% sequentially. The increase in revenue from last year was primarily due to our increase in service solutions sales, particularly in our Twin solutions, which we pioneered over seven years ago. [unintelligible] GPU products continue their strong growth as well.  On a geographical basis, we had strong growth around the world with Asia again leading the way at 60.9% growth followed by the U.S. at 38.9% and Europe at 25.8%. The sequential increase in revenue in a seasonally weak quarter was primarily due to our strength in Europe and Asia. Our Twin products led the way, along with GPU and MicroCloud. Slide nine. Turning to product mix, the proportion of revenues from server systems was 57.7% of total revenues, which was up from 46.4% the same quarter a year ago and from 55.2% last quarter. ASP for servers was $3,600 per unit, which is up from $2,600 last year and up from $3,300 last quarter. We shipped approximately 71,000 servers in the first quarter and 1,254,000 subsystems and accessories.  We continue to maintain a diverse revenue base with over 700 customers and none of these customers representing more than 10% of our quarterly revenues. Cloud and internet data center revenue was 13.7%, which was a decrease from 17.8% in the prior quarter and an increase from 8.3% in the prior year. 54.9% of our revenues came from the U.S. and 56% from our distributors and resellers.  Slide 10. Non-GAAP gross profit was $69.4 million, up 47.6% from $47 million in the same quarter last year and up 4.2% from $66.6 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, gross margin was 15.7%, up from 15.2% a year ago and from 15.6% sequentially. Price changes from Ablecom resulted in a no basis point change to the gross profit in the quarter with total purchases representing approximately 14.5% of total cost of goods sold, compared to 17.3% a year ago and 15.7% sequentially. The year over year increase in gross margin resulted from increased complete server sales, strong vendor relationships, and increased utilization of our Taiwan facility, offset in part by higher cloud internet data center sales. Sequentially, gross margins was up due to more complete server solutions and lower cloud internet data center sales.  Slides 11 and 12. Operating expenses were $34.8 million, up from $32.4 million in the same quarter a year ago and down from $37.2 million sequentially. As a percentage of revenue, operating expense was 7.9%, down from 10.5% year over year and from 8.7% sequentially. Operating expenses were higher on an absolute dollar basis year over year, primarily in R&D, as we invest in personnel expenses to support the development of our solutions. Sequentially, operating expenses were lower due to a $1.9 million of value-added tax refund from Taiwan, which we received during the quarter. The company’s headcount increased by 62 sequentially to 1,931 total employees.  Operating profit was $34.6 million, up by 136.5% from $14.6 million a year ago and by 17.6% from $29.4 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, operating margin was 7.8%, up from 4.7% a year ago and from 6.9% sequentially. We continue to focus on the many market opportunities in front of us while leveraging the investments we have made in our infrastructure to drive our operating margins and profits. Net income was $23.2 million or 5.2% of revenues, up 134.8% from $9.9 million a year ago and 19.5% from $19.4 million sequentially. Our non-GAAP fully diluted EPS was $0.46 per share, up from $0.22 per share a year ago and up from $0.40 per share sequentially. The number of fully diluted shares used in the first quarter was 50,305,000.  The tax rate for the first quarter on a non-GAAP basis was 32.7% compared to 31.7% a year ago and 33.6% sequentially. The rate was lower sequentially due to an increase in profitability overseas, which had the effect of lowering our overall corporate tax rate.  We expect the effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis to be approximately 33.5% for the December quarter. This rate assumes no reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. Turning to the balance sheet, on a sequential basis, slide 13, cash, cash equivalents, and short and long term investments were $120.2 million, up $20.6 million from $99.6 million in the prior quarter and up $6.1 million from $114.2 million in the same quarter last year. In the first quarter, free cash flow was a positive $24.3 million, primarily due to the increase in accounts receivable, offset in part by increase in inventory to support the continuing growth of revenue. Slide 14. Accounts receivable decreased by $18.4 million to $194.4 million. DSOs was 42 days, which was the same in the prior quarter. Inventories increased by $25.7 million to $341.5 million to support the forecasted revenue increase and a transition to Grantley-based products. Days in inventory was 81, an increase of four days from 77 in the prior quarter. Accounts payable was $222.6 million, which was 54 days, an increase of one day from 53 days in the prior quarter. Overall, cash conversion cycle days was 69 days, which is three days higher than in the prior quarter. Now for a few comments on our outlook. During the first quarter, we continued our strong growth, leveraging the foundation we have built over the years and executing our strategy to provide optimized solutions to our customers. As we enter the second quarter a new technology refresh cycle has started, with many new technologies being introduced. We look to take advantage of our engineering and the broad breadth of solutions to drive our strong growth and profitability. Therefore, the company expectations net sales for the quarter ending December 31, 2014 in a range of $440 million to $480 million. Assuming this revenue range, the company expects non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.44 to $0.50 for the quarter. At the midpoint, this would represent a growth of 29% and 57% in revenue and EPS respectively, from the prior year. It’s currently expected that the outlook will not be updated until the release of the company’s next quarterly earnings announcement. Notwithstanding subsequent developments, however, the company may update the outlook, or any portion thereof, at any time. With that, let me turn it back to Charles for some closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Howard. The first quarter was another record high for Super Micro, with growth of 43.5% higher year over year. And that, again, outpaced more than multiple times the industry growth rate. Through our innovative product strategy, quality and service, we are in a unique position to take market share, grow revenue, and achieve strong operating income. With that, we are on track to reach our $2 billion run rate milestone very soon. Operator, at this time, we are ready for questions. 
Operator: [Operator instructions.] We’ll go first to Mark Kelleher with D.A. Davidson. 
Mark Kelleher - D.A. Davidson: Wanted to look at gross margins from a couple of angles. First of all, can you tell us what percent of revenue in the quarter or of server sales came from the Grantley launch? Is it still very small?
Howard Hideshima : Yes, it’s just ramping now. However, we’re seeing that the ramp is probably about over 50% better than what it was when the Sandy Bridge launch occurred during a similar period. 
Mark Kelleher - D.A. Davidson : And that’s carrying higher gross margins, right?
Howard Hideshima : Yes.
Mark Kelleher - D.A. Davidson : And your tilt toward servers is a benefit to gross margins, right?
Howard Hideshima : It depends on the mix of the servers. During the quarter, we had, again, our storage solutions were a higher mix of our products, and they were more complete systems with that. So again, they can be somewhat lower at times too. It depends on the mix [unintelligible]. 
Mark Kelleher - D.A. Davidson : With the internet data center revenue declining as a percentage of revenue in this quarter from last quarter, with Taiwan manufacturing increasing with the overall service percentage growing, and with Grantley into the mix, where can we get some more gross margin? I’m surprised gross margin didn’t boost up a little bit more. What’s the pullback on that? What’s the offset?
Howard Hideshima : One thing you’ve got to remember also, this is a seasonally weak quarter typically, and we’ve gone through and grew right beyond those seasonal trends that we’ve had in the past. It’s usually a very competitive time in the industry.  So again, that’s part of, what you want to call a put or take, a take from the margin side of it. You know, the internet data center is historically competitive for us, and that is a positive for it when it goes down, but then you’ve got the total server solutions mix and quite frankly, like I said, as we ship more complete server solutions, with regard to in the storage area, they can tend to drag our margin out a little bit because of higher content of hard disk drives and other types of components. 
Operator: We’ll go next to Aaron Rakers of Stifel.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel : Going back to the gross margin discussion, it looks like, on the past six quarters, I think your average growth in storage has been over 40% year over year. Can you help us understand maybe that mix effect to the gross margin? How meaningful is storage today as a percentage of revenue, and is there a point in time where you start breaking that revenue stream out to give more visibility to that mix dynamic?
Charles Liang : As you know, we ship more and more storage to special OEM accounts, and sometimes that cloud business is ramping up very well to us, including [unintelligible], and those are the sharing resource for private section or kind of some small public cloud. And the new technology [unintelligible] mentioned Haswell and together with our new architecture [unintelligible] rack. And coming soon, [unintelligible] Twin, that will contribute to higher profit margin.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel : And then as a follow up, your Asia Pacific revenue growth was very impressive. Obviously there’s been some changing dynamics in the competitive landscape with obviously Lenovo closing their transaction and then HP looking to leverage their partnership with Foxconn. Can you just remind us how meaningful China is with regard to your Asia Pacific growth and how you view the competitive landscape going forward relative to those two vendors? 
Charles Liang : Yeah, they have some impact for sure. However, our growth has been getting even in other countries like Japan, other countries in Asia. And the ramping of Haswell and [unintelligible] and total solution, that all help us move profit margin. 
Aaron Rakers - Stifel : The operating expense number was quite impressive, but I think I heard you say that there was a $1.9 million benefit from tax. I’m assuming that that’s in the G&A line. With that said, how do we think about operating expense? Is that true, that’s in that G&A line and that should be adjusted. And should we use that as kind of a run rate going forward, or do you expect opex to creep higher as we move out over the next several quarters?
Howard Hideshima : It’s actually in the R&D line, and it’s a $1.9 million credit that came back. It’s basically one single time item, so you would put that back, as you look forward, into our numbers.
Operator: We’ll go next to Rich Kugele with Needham & Company.
Rich Kugele - Needham & Company : Going back to Grantley, just wanted to get a little more feedback, specifically with regard to the availability or lack thereof, I guess, of competing solutions relative to your own in the marketplace.
Charles Liang : As you know, whenever there’s a new technology refresh, we have a good chance. This time, Haswell especially is a big chance to us. [unintelligible] is a new [BDR] for more challenging technology. We introduced NVMe, especially pretty much in our first hot-swappable NVMe solution provider. All those will help us. And also, our micro [unintelligible] other storage product available one by one. So all those help.
Rich Kugele - Needham & Company : And historically with these new processor launches, how long is I guess the gap between when the new processor is released and when that becomes a majority of your shipments?
Charles Liang : It depends. Basically from Intel, we should launch [unintelligible] in the first six months for a nice period we have growing business, both revenue and profitability. 
Operator: And next, we have Mike Staiger with Roth Capital Partners. 
Mike Staiger - Roth Capital Partners: Just wanted to get a couple of thoughts on linearity within the quarter, and if your success here moving forward, should we think linearity would change historically speaking?
Howard Hideshima : With regard to our linearity, it hasn’t really changed. We’ve said we’re pretty linear throughout our quarter, throughout our history, indicating around 30% to 40%, that kind of spread in our business. However, we still are a turns type of business.
Mike Staiger - Roth Capital Partners : And then just one follow up. You have a new partnership in this EVO: RAIL and it looks like you made a couple of announcements on that. Was there any contribution in the quarter from that particular program?
Charles Liang : As you know, we have a complete storage and cloud solution [unintelligible], and that for sure will create a positive impact to our business. And it’s happening now, and will be gradually growing. I would like to say it will take a few quarters or many quarters to ramp up.
Operator: Up next we have Nehal Chokshi with the Maxim Group. 
Nehal Chokshi - Maxim Group: The 79% year over year growth in systems, even when I take out the internet data center portion, which appears to account for all the direct increase, it looks like the systems grew 55% year over year. I believe this is all channel driven. Is this a correct interpretation of the data? If so, what is driving the strong traction in the channel? Is it all product driven, or is there some increasing brand awareness that you think is driving this as well.
Howard Hideshima : Quite frankly, usually our service solutions go through to our direct customers and our OEM solutions customers. Again, that’s where usually you see a lot of similarities to the percentages between our complete server solutions business and those other two. It goes less to the channel, although recently, again, you’ve seen those percentages go higher than our distributor reseller business, because the channel is now starting to begin to take our complete server solutions, because, quite frankly, these systems are getting more complicated to put together, and for quality reasons and reliability reasons, they’re looking for us to be putting the systems together. So I think it’s a little bit of the opposite.
Nehal Chokshi - Maxim Group : And then with data management starting to move back to internal application servers, such as with the EVO: RAIL or the new [unintelligible], is there an opportunity for Super Micro to develop some IP here, or will it be Super Micro’s strategy to be a partner of choice for the independent storage vendors who are seeking to move their data management stacks from external to internal to application server?
Charles Liang : Yeah, we are doing both. One is working with our close partners. The other one is trying to develop some of our own IP as well. 
Nehal Chokshi - Maxim Group : And then finally, could you talk about where’s the utilization on the Taiwan facility?
Howard Hideshima : About 50% now.
Charles Liang : Yeah, but it will consistently grow, basically.
Operator: And up next we have Aaron Rakers of Stifel.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel : First of all, you’ve talked about your $2 billion target the last couple of quarters now. Can you just remind us when you think you can attain that target?
Charles Liang : I believe it’s coming very soon. Maybe a quarter or a couple of quarters.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel :
. :
Howard Hideshima : Like I said, last time I [attributed] about 4.4% to the R&D tax credit coming back. So again, you’d be around 30 to just below that.
Operator: And it appears at this time we have no further questions. I’d like to the call back to Mr. Liang for any additional or closing comments.
Charles Liang : Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to talking with you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you, everyone. Have a great day.

Perry G. Hayes: Good afternoon, and thank you for attending Super Micro's Conference Call on Financial Results for the Fourth Quarter and Full Fiscal Year 2014, which ended June 30, 2014. By now, you should have received a copy of today's news release that was distributed at the close of regular trading and is available on the company's website. As a reminder, during today's call, the company will refer to a presentation that is available to participants in the Investor Relations section of the company's website under the Events & Presentations tab. Please turn to Slide 2. Before we start, I'll remind you that our remarks include forward-looking statements. There are a number of risk factors that could cause Super Micro's future results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2013 and our other SEC filings. All of these documents are available from the Investor Relations page of Super Micro's website at www.supermicro.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Most of today's presentation will refer to non-GAAP financial results and outlooks. For an explanation of our non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to Slide 3 of this presentation or to our press release published earlier today. In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today's press release and in the supplemental information attached to today's presentation. I'll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to Slide 4. First, let me provide you with the highlights of our fiscal fourth quarter. We are pleased that our fourth quarter revenue was $428.1 million. It's 14.5% higher quarter-over-quarter and 32.8% higher year-over-year. This result was a record high for Super Micro. Non-GAAP net income was $19.4 million or 9.2% higher quarter-over-quarter and 71.8% higher compared to last year. Super Micro's non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.40 per diluted share compared to $0.37 last quarter or $0.26 last year. Slide 5, please. In my comments today, I would like to discuss our results last quarter as well as our achievements during the past fiscal year. Last quarter, we achieved record high revenue, which was 32% -- 32.8% higher than last year. This strong fourth quarter performance helped to push our full year revenue to $1.47 billion, representing 26.2% growth over last year. This quarter also marks the third quarter in a row of record revenue, which demonstrates significant momentum in our growth trend. This strong upward momentum is the highest in the industry where our growth rate is multiple times that of the industry's. It also indicates that we continue to take market share. More than ever, our partners choose our platform system solution due to quality and performance optimization. Last quarter, our server system contributed 55.2% of our total revenue, which is a record high for system growth. Of that, 48.1% of our business last quarter came from OEMs and direct customers. Cloud and Internet Data Center account for 17.8% of sales, which is an increase of 150% over last year and approximately 28% higher than last quarter. Indeed, these results indicate that we have been able to win the opportunities in this competitive market with optimized products. Geographically, revenue in the North America was 58.6%, Asia was 19.6%, and Europe was 18.5% of total sales. Our growth in North America continued to be strong and very consistent due to our improved economical scale; DCO, our Data Center Optimized, product line; and sales folks on our key market segment in the U.S. We also see a strong growth trend in storage virtualization, cloud and Internet Data Center demands. Asia business improved from last quarter, mainly due to stronger growth in China, and our Taiwan facility is about 50% utilized and increasing. As for product, storage had been a consistent strong product line for all fiscal 2014. We have very strong storage product line, and we have many partners who have leading software -- storage software solutions that run in Super Micro's system products. Last quarter, our storage revenue grew 54% year-over-year and 27% sequentially, which accounts to about 10% of our total revenue this past year. GPU solutions were also strong and continue with 75% higher growth year-over-year and 13% higher sequentially. Our FatTwin product line had been the strongest with over 150% higher revenue than last year and 107% higher sequentially. Slide 6 please. 2014 had been a year of remarkable revenue growth, product innovation, foundation improvement and double capacity. It was a breakout year in revenue for Super Micro with annual growth of 26%, mainly due to strong products optimized for storage, HPC, virtualization, cloud data center. Our server premium [ph] product provide a best-of-feed solution that is optimized for fabrication, for power saving, for density and for cost. Super Micro grows faster than the industry because we are the only player in the industry that had the widest array of premium product to deliver the best, and exactly what the industry wants. Whether our product is in the Super Micro branded product or presented in the name of our partner, Super Micro is the leader in application optimization. In 2014, our product innovation and [indiscernible] were the most extensive in the world. We upgrade our Twin product line, which is our TwinPro architecture. This is the power industry's first SaaS 3.0 storage, NVMe-accelerated PCI-E SSD and titanium-level efficiency power supply in a data center-optimized platform. We continue to extend the application-optimized SKU for our FatTwin architecture. We extended our leadership for high-density micro server solutions by launching our 24-node 3U MicroCloud for data center Web hosting and cloud application. We also launched the industry's densest server, the MicroBlade, with the 112-node Atom or 28-node DPGU [ph] in the 6U form factor. Lastly, our GPU solutions is ranked the #1 in the Green500 supercomputer rankings for being the most powerful and the most power efficient. Our rapid growth in 2014 was also enabled by the improvement of our global foundation. Our Asia Science & Technology Park in Taiwan supports our Asia and European sales rep much quicker than before. On the domestic front, we have purchased a new 36-acre land with a 300,000 square-feet building within 5 minutes from our current campus. We are converting the existing building on that new purchase to logistics and system integration facilities, and they are about ready to deploy. This additional facility will enable us to speed up our business growth in North America. And in the next few years, we will develop this land into one of the biggest IT research and production facilities in the U.S. We call this new campus the Super Micro Green Computing Park. Page 7, please. Looking ahead, Intel will launch our new process technology, Haswell, in September. We have been working on our early shipping program with key customers for the past few months, and we are well prepared. Our X10, the industry's strongest server and storage product lines, they are fully optimized for the new processor. In fact, we have been successfully deploying thousands of these new X10 system to early adopter through Intel early shipping program. Mostly importantly, we were, again, the industry leader in term of product base innovation, which is our leading come-to-market advantage. They are the core strengths of Super Micro, and we expect to exploit this opportunity to its max. To further exploit this technology transition, we are also ready to deliver a new server architecture that we called the Ultra. The Ultra architecture that its name suggests is a server architecture that delivers the highest performance and the most flexibility than any other servers on the market today. We have removed the traditional I/O rigidity and bottlenecks by developing a set of new multifunction I/O modules. This allow us to have a much higher performance on barriers, networking and storage solutions. Moreover, the Ultra architecture features a unique design, which achieved much impressive PUE performance with the minimum cooling fans needed to operate the most high-performance system combination [ph]. Ultra architecture's competitive feature will set Super Micro apart from its competition when we -- when our new generation of server hit the market this quarter. As we get into fiscal 2015, we are more excited than ever before. We see a great opportunity to speed up our growth momentum and reach that $2 billion annual run rate this year. Our foundation continue to get stronger as we start to utilize our Green Computing Park space and Taiwan facility for higher operation capacity and efficiency. Together with our upcoming Haswell base that will launch with yet again the first-to-market advantage, we are certain our business will leap into the next level in the very near future. For more specifics on the first quarter, let me turn it over to Howard.
Howard Hideshima: Thank you, Charles, and good afternoon, everyone. I will focus my remarks on earnings, gross margin, operating expenses and similar items on a non-GAAP basis, which reflect adjustments to exclude stock compensation expenses. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company in today's earnings release and in the supplemental detail in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Let me begin with the review of the fourth quarter income statement. Please turn to Slide 8. Revenue was a record $428.1 million, up 32.8% from the same quarter a year ago and 14.5% sequentially. The increase in revenue from last year was primarily due to our increase in server solution sales, particularly in our cloud, Internet Data Center customers. Storage and FatTwin continue to benefit from the market's desire for more dense and power-efficient solutions. More importantly, as our solutions become more complex, the value of our engineering and the optimized solutions we can create from our building block approach is continuing to gain momentum. On a geographical basis, we had strong growth around the world with Asia leading the way. The sequential increase in revenue was primarily due to our strength in the U.S., in particular in the cloud, Internet Data Center customers. Asia continues to grow while Europe was down. The strength of our innovative and broad solutions, coupled with our strong engineering, continue to draw more customers looking for help in bringing the best solutions to fit their needs. Slide 9. Turning to product mix. The proportion of revenues from server systems was 55.2% of total revenues, which was up from 47.4% the same quarter a year ago and from 50.1% last quarter. ASPs for servers was $3,300 per unit, which is up from $2,400 last year and up from $2,600 last quarter. We shipped approximately 72,000 servers in the fourth quarter and 1,114,000 subsystems and accessories. We continue to maintain a diverse revenue base with over 700 customers and none of these customers representing more than 10% of our quarterly revenues. Cloud, Internet Data Center revenues was 17.8%, which was an increase from 15.9% in the prior quarter and from 9.5% in the prior year. The increase was primarily in the U.S. as we benefit from the expansion of the cloud and those looking for optimized solutions. 58.6% of our revenues came from the U.S. and 51.9% from our distributors and resellers. Slide 10. Non-GAAP gross profit was $66.6 million, up 43.9% from $46.3 million in the same quarter last year and up 15.8% from $57.5 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, gross margin was 15.6%, up from 14.4% a year ago and from 14 -- 15.4% sequentially. Price changes from Ablecom resulted in no basis points charged to gross profit in the quarter with total purchases representing 15.7% of total cost of goods sold compared to 17% a year ago and 14.4% sequentially. The year-over-year increase in gross margin resulted from strong vendor relationships, increased utilization of our Taiwan facility, offset in part by higher cloud, Internet Data Center sales. Sequentially, gross margins were up due to more complete server solutions and increased purchasing power, offset in part by higher cloud, Internet Data Center sales. Slide 11 and 12. Operating expenses were $37.2 million, up from $31.2 million in the same quarter a year ago and from $33.2 million sequentially. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses was 8.7%, down from 9.7% year-over-year and from 8.9% sequentially. Operating expenses were higher on an absolute dollar basis year-over-year, primarily in R&D as we invest in personnel expenses to support the broadening of our solutions. Sequentially, operating expenses were higher due to higher personnel expenses for additional R&D resources as well as product development expenses as we prepare for the transition to Grantley. The company's headcount increased by 148 sequentially to 1,869 total employees. Operating profit was $29.4 million, up by 94.5% from 15.5 -- $15.1 million a year ago and by 21.2% from $24.3 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, operating margin was 6.9%, up from 4.7% a year ago and from 6.5% sequentially. We continue to focus on leveraging the investments we have made in our infrastructure while still making strategic investment in our solution portfolio to drive our operating margins and profits. Net income was $19.4 million or 4.5% of revenue, up 71.8% from $11.3 million a year ago and 9.2% from $17.8 million sequentially. Our non-GAAP fully diluted EPS was $0.40 per share, up from $0.26 per share a year ago and up from $0.37 per share sequentially. The number of fully diluted shares used in the fourth quarter was 48,977,000. The tax rate in the fourth quarter was -- on a non-GAAP basis was 33.6% compared to 24.7% a year ago and 26.4% sequentially. The rate was higher than last quarter due to additional tax liabilities associated with R&D expenses in the current quarter as well as higher profits. We expect the effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis to be approximately 35.1% for the first quarter, which is up from 31.7% in the same quarter last year. The increase from last year reflects the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in June of 2013 and the release of tax liabilities in that quarter. The R&D tax credit has not been reinstated as of yet, which we have estimated to have caused about 2.2% reduction in our tax estimated current rate. In addition, if the tax credit is reinstated retroactively, like it has in the past, we will have about 1.2% reduction in our overall annual tax rate. This effectively reduces the tax rate on an annual basis to about 31.7%. Other items such as lapse of statute of limitations and an increase or decrease in profits have affected our tax rate as well in the past. Our non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal 2014 was 30.6%. The company continues to work on our tax planning as we expand overseas. Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis, Slide 13. Cash and cash equivalents and short- and long-term investment were $99.6 million, down $4.8 million from $104.4 million in the prior quarter and up $3.9 million from $95.7 million in the same quarter last year. In the fourth quarter, free cash flow was a negative $9.7 million, primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable and inventory to support continued growth of the revenue. Slide 14. Accounts receivable increased by $30.7 million to $212.7 million due to record revenues mentioned above. Sales DSOs was 42 days, an increase of 1 day from 41 days in the prior quarter. Inventory increased by $20.7 million to $315.8 million to support the forecasted revenue and the transition to Grantley-based products. Days in inventory was 77, a decrease of 6 days from 83 days in the prior quarter. Accounts payable was $219.4 million, which was 53 days, a decrease of 5 days from 58 days in the prior quarter. Overall cash conversion cycle days was 66 days, and which is the same as the prior quarter. Now for a few comments on our outlook. During the fourth quarter, we continued our growth, leveraging a foundation in product engineering and delivery we have built over the past few years to provide optimized solution to our customers. As we enter the first quarter, which is a seasonally weak quarter for the industry, we look to take advantage of our time to market by providing the broadest breadth of solutions as a new technology refresh cycle is about to start to continue to drive our growth and profitability. Therefore, the company currently expects to have sales for the quarter ending September 30, 2014, in a range of $395 million to $435 million. Assuming this revenue range, the company expects non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.36 to $0.42 for the quarter. At the midpoint, this would represent a growth of 34% and 77% in revenue and EPS, respectively, from the prior year. It is currently expected that the outlook will not be updated until the release of the company's next quarterly earnings announcement. Notwithstanding subsequent developments, however, the company may update the outlook or any portion thereof at any time. With that, let me turn it back to Charles for some closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Howard. Now fourth quarter was a record high for Super Micro, with growth at 26.2% higher year-over-year and that our pace is more than 4x the industry's growth rate. We start a new fiscal year with the strongest product line in our history and with our global foundation and operation ready for a big jump. I am fully confident that 2015 will be a breakthrough year for Super Micro. Operator, at this time, we are ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Aaron Rakers with Stifel.
Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: The first question, if I can, just talk a little bit about the Internet Data Center vertical. I know you guys talked about there not being any kind of 10% customers in total, but maybe you can address whether or not there's any kind of customer concentration dynamics to that vertical and kind of dovetailing that with the fact that I think last quarter, you talked about, in particular, 3 new large data center opportunities that you had won. Where do we stand in terms of the progression of those opportunities in terms of the results that you just reported?
Charles Liang: Yes. Thank you, Aaron. A very good question. Yes, most of our customers continue to buy more product from us, but at the same time, we're also growing our overall revenue. So I would like to say we will grow more large customer and at the same time grow -- each customer will grow.
Howard Hideshima: Adding to that, Aaron. Again, as I mentioned, we had no 10% customers. That vertical is going well for us per se. And like I said, we talk about the 3 data centers that we won a couple of quarters ago. Those are going well for us. So there are new relationships that are doing well for us.
Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then as a quick follow-up, when we look at the gross margin line, I think some investors ask, why do we not maybe see a little bit more leverage there give the strong systems mix? Can you talk about the puts and takes relative to the gross margin, be it the mix relative to systems versus the components business, and how much of an offset we should consider that Internet Data Center piece of that as that grows going forward in terms of maybe a downward pressure point on gross margin?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, Aaron, I think, like I said, while the mix of Internet Data Center business went up to 17.8% this quarter from last quarter, I think you'll see that our gross margins overall increased. I think we've been saying all along that it's important for us to be in that Internet Data Center vertical because, while it is competitive, it helps us increase our purchasing power. So that -- if you can take a look at an example, that will more than offset any of the downward pressure that we had during that quarter because it really reflects onto the rest of our business as far as that purchasing power.
Operator: And we'll go next to Mark Kelleher with D.A. Davidson.
Mark Kelleher - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: Just to follow up on Aaron's question, where do you think those gross margins can go? I mean, there were a number of levers that work in your favor in that quarter. We talked about the server mix up, but the ASPs were up. The Taiwan manufacturing was doing very well. So there's a number of things coming into play here. Where do you think the gross margins can trend over time?
Charles Liang: Yes, I believe they still have a lot of room for us to grow gross margin. For example, our Asia facility today, its utilization rate is only about 15%, and we see it will continue to grow strongly. And similarly, we're just purchasing a some would say [ph], more greenhills campus, 36-acre. We just started to use that new facility. So we already paid for the facility, and we just start to use that facility. Again, that utilization rate will continue to grow as well. So all of those will help us. By the way, the new Intel Grantley platform, as you know, we always have the time-to-market advantage. And we already shipped thousands of our systems to early deployment customer, and during this month -- next month, we will ship kind of pretty good volume on our early deployment product. So all of those will help us in the gross margin and revenue.
Mark Kelleher - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: I know, Howard, you, in the past, have given us kind of a range. Can we do 16%, 17%? 17%, 18%? 15%, 16%? Where would you peg it?
Howard Hideshima: We've kept the range the same, Mark. Right now, it's 16% to 18%. We think we have some great opportunities, and we'll keep that range. But also, we have some great opportunities to grow our business, as we talked about and Charles talked about.
Mark Kelleher - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: All right. Just kind of as a follow-up to that, your ASPs on those servers jumped pretty dramatically. What's going on there?
Charles Liang: We focus on really high-end, high-efficiency system. For those systems, indeed, each system customer had [ph] also memory and hard drive. And that may be one of the key factors. That's why our ASP grew a lot, especially virtualization. People need a huge memory and hard drive.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll go next to Rich Kugele with Needham & Company.
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Just 2 quick questions. First, with Grantley coming occasionally ahead of these processor rollouts, you do see a pause. Clearly, you guys have not seen a pause in the previous generation. Would you expect it to be a very back-end loaded quarter as a result of this launch? Or any updates on just linearity with the new product launch coming in September.
Charles Liang: Yes, the new product happened very smoothly this time so far, and we already -- that's why I mentioned we already have 1,000 now deployed already, and many more thousand is coming this month and next month. So we can see -- we do believe a smooth transition. And that transition will be strong, I believe, at this moment.
Richard Kugele - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Excellent, okay. And then lastly, on the Taiwan facility, obviously the utilization continues to improve, and that's good. But Howard, just to understand the leverage and the model, can you give us a sense on what the flow-through would be on a 60%-type utilization or a 75%-type utilization rate? And is that your goal? Do you have a goal exiting fiscal '15 or what that target utilization might be?
Howard Hideshima: We said in the past that we wanted to get to about 100% utilization in the next year. That's been said before on the 3 lines we have. Remember, we have capacity for 6 to 8 lines there. So again, we have room to grow, and we're looking at adding additional lines there. As far as sizing the benefit from that, again, labor costs and those types of things are about 1/3 less than what they are here. So it can be -- we call it as one of the biggest levers for us in helping our gross margins.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll go back to Aaron Rakers with Stifel.
Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: So one of the opportunities that I think has presented itself to Super Micro is the pending transaction of Lenovo acquiring the IBM assets on the x86 server side. So maybe you can just update us on where you stand, whether or not you've seen any benefit that you've seen on your business from that. And in particular, maybe you can just give us a quick update of where you stand relative to traction within the traditional enterprise space for Super Micro.
Charles Liang: Yes, it's a very good question. We start to see some customer come to us because they really want the best quality and on-site service kind of capability. And naturally, we are most positive for them. So we do see some change coming, and it looks like this trend will continue.
Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: And then final question for me. Some discussion around gross margin and leverage. Howard, I'd like to maybe understand how you think about free cash flow. What do you think the right free cash flow -- or maybe a better question, right working capital metrics would look like on a going-forward basis? Just any kind of framework of how you're thinking about those metrics will be helpful as it relates to that free cash flow story.
Howard Hideshima: Aaron, if I look back at this past year, I guess we were fairly good at managing our free cash flow. The only negative that we had, I think, we were about $16 million negative for the year or so on our free cash flow. And quite frankly, that was due to the purchase of the property that we had that we financed about half of it and we -- and then we purchased it out of our cash with the rest of it. So again, that wasn't bad given that we were able to support the growth of the business. And I think that's where our focus is going to be, not to -- to keep leveraging the business, and quite frankly, grow our business and then reinvest that working capital, the money that we'll be generating from our profits, back into the business to continue this growth. That's our focus.
Operator: And we'll go next to Mark Kelleher with D.A. Davidson.
Mark Kelleher - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: Yes. I just wanted to follow up on the Grantley launch. What percentage of revenue in the quarter was Ivy Bridge? Is Ivy Bridge still expanding as a percent of revenue?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, Mark. Actually, it grew for us about -- I think it was 17% quarter-over-quarter and is still expanding for us. It's still important for us going forward, and we still see some long life in that going forward for many quarters.
Mark Kelleher - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: Right. So my understanding is that the ramp-up of a new architecture kind of takes many quarters to happen, and we shouldn't be looking for some spike because of Grantley launching in the September quarter, is that accurate?
Howard Hideshima: No, that's accurate.
Operator: And it appears at this time, we have no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Liang for any additional or closing comments.
Charles Liang: Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you, everyone. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude the Super Micro Fourth Quarter and Full Fiscal Year 2014 Conference Call. We do appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you.

I’ll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Perry and good afternoon everyone. Please come to slide four. First let me provide you with the highlights of our fiscal quarter. We are pleased that our third quarter revenue was 373.8 million. It’s 4.9% higher quarter-over-quarter and 34.4% higher year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was 17.8 million or 11.8% higher quarter-over-quarter and 77.1% higher compared to last year. Super Micro’s non-GAAP earning per share was $0.37 per diluted share compared to $0.35 last quarter and $0.23 last year. Slide five please. Super Micro’s third quarter was the second straight quarter of record heights for revenue and earnings. We are especially pleased that we achieved this exceptional revenue growth during a seasonally weak quarter. We grew again in multiples for our industry expanded market share and continued to be believe that our industry’s system architecture and solution innovation as well as marketing. Geographically, the revenue in North America was 54.5%, Europe was 21.7% and Asia was 21% of total sales. Most of our revenue growth comes from North America last quarter and was the strongest region while Europe and Asia follow a seasonal trend. As we said last quarter, our strong foundation in product innovation and global operations prepare Super Micro to speed up sales momentum in 2014. Our services contributed 50.1% of our total revenue. It is the first time ever in Super Micro’s history that more than 50% of our sales come from computer systems. Computer server revenue mostly come from our OEM and direct customers which account for 48.1% and 15.9% from client and Internet data center. More and more of our customer understand that computer system and solutions from Super Micro bring more long value to their business. The systems have been optimized for performance, power efficiency and reliability, with our approved components, unique dedication and strict [inaudible] procedures for higher product quality and quicker [inaudible]. Now let me bring you up to-date on other several business progress. First, average product shipment increased 32% quarter-over-quarter as it continue to rent, it is still in rent cycle and we expect that this technology transition will continue through 2014. Second our Asia operation utilization rate is above 50% now is and is continuously growing. We hope to reach 100% capacity within 12 months, while we continuously speeding up our business growth in Asia. Moreover, we had just start to use our newly acquired computer parts in Silicon Valley a facility will provide immediate and additional operational resource to serve our faster growing domestic market. Slide six please. The results this quarter indicated that our products and services have continued to extend their leadership position. Let me provide you some more highlights on specific products and service. We have been providing some select customers with total solutions including hardware computer system, server management and applications software for few quarters. As a result, more customers now can depend on Super Micro to deliver end to end computer solutions higher bid about 20 [inaudible] for which applications and more. In addition, we just had recently launched service program to complement our total solutions. It will provide a full maintenance with four hour and our next business day on site service. Now a reputed growing service program is further strengthened with our [inaudible] and we have seen an excellent response from customer to this new business solutions by extending our business model to provide a total solution and service, many new doors of opportunity have opened for Super Micro and we expect them to drive a more direct business globally. Slide seven please. On our hardware side our Twin family grew strongly last quarter with FatTwin leading the way with over 20% growth year-over-year. Now FatTwin platform available in 150 models and 140 combinations is the most of higher multipurpose server architecture on the market optimized for high volume datacenter decrement. We also saw strong growth in our other three important including our recently launched Twin Pro series. The Twin Pro is our only solution on the market today that over 3.0 and storage options boosting our performance edge over competition. The Twin family makes up the largest supporter in our solutions which was up 50% year-over-year. On other system solutions storage and GPU/Xeon Phi Optimized has grown consistently with 32% and 42% year-over-year growth respectively. As we have provided a variety of storage in HPC solutions to many customers, we are also getting a lot of interest on our recently launched high density low power MicroBlade architecture. This supports our 112 nodes Atom or 28 node in 6U Form Factor it features up to four, 2.5 gigabit per second SPn[ph] sort of networking with 10 gigabit per second version coming soon. Now extremely power and closely efficient MicroBlade architecture with the highly dynamic SDN will play an important role in our revenue stream for our coming quarters. Looking ahead, we are consistently creating new and exciting products as we are one of the premier innovators in the market. With our new software products and service offerings we are getting much to provide optimized computer solutions to enterprise customers, product development and innovation of next generation server storage and networking products is well underway. We are also executing to launch a brand new system architecture that will further optimize system for to-date and cloud applications. Now is definitely an inspiring time for us and our customers as we stand at the age of technology. In summary, Super Micro had a second straight quarter of record revenue and earnings. As I have said before, our aggressive investment in global foundation and strong product development enables Super Micro to achieve much higher revenue, profitability and momentum in 2014. We are off to a great start for calendar 2014 and we are focused on reaching the 2 billion run rate target. For most specifics on the third quarter, let me turn it over to Howe.
Howard Hideshima: Thank you, Charles and good afternoon everyone. I’ll focus my remarks on earnings, gross margin, operating expenses and similar items on a non-GAAP basis which reflect adjustments to exclude stock compensation expenses. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company in today’s earnings release and the supplemental detail in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Let me begin with a review of the third quarter income statement. Please turn to slide eight. Revenue was a record 373.8 million, up 34.4% from the same quarter year ago and up 4.9% sequentially. The increase in revenue from last year was primarily due to our increase in service solutions sales particularly in the Internet data center customer. We are also benefiting from the technology transition to Ivy Bridge as well as new offerings of FatTwin storage and GPU Xeon 5 based solutions. On a geographical basis, we had strong growth around the world with Asia leading the way. The sequential increase in revenues was primarily due to strength in the U.S. in particular in the Internet data center customers. Asia and Europe were down on a seasonal basis. The strength of our innovative and broad solutions and the ranking of the technology refresh cycle, outweigh for us, what is traditionally a seasonally weak quarter for the industry. Slide nine, turning to product mix, the portion of revenue from server systems was 50.1% of total revenues which was up from 41.8% the same quarter year ago, and from 48.8% last quarter. ASP for servers was $2,600 per unit, which is up from $2,100 last year and down from $2,700 last quarter. We shipped approximately 72,000 servers in the third quarter and 1,116,000 subsystems and accessories. We continue to maintain a diverse revenue base with over 700 customers and none of these customers representing more than 10% of our quarterly revenue. Internet data center revenue was 15.9% which was an increase from 12.9% in the prior quarter and from 10.8% in the prior year. The increase was primarily in the U.S. as we benefit from the expansion of the cloud and those looking for optimized solutions. 54.5% of our revenues came from the U.S. and 51.9% from distributors and resellers. Slide 10. Non-GAAP gross profit was 57.5 million, up 47% from 39.1 million in the same quarter last year, and up 3.9% from 55.3 million sequentially. On percentage basis, gross margin was 15.4% up, from 14.1% a year ago and down from 15.5% sequentially. Price changes from Ablecom resulted in no basis point change to gross profit in the quarter with total purchases representing approximately 14.4% of total cost of goods sold, compared to 18.7% a year ago and 18.1% sequentially. The year-over-year increase in gross margin resulted from stronger vendor relationships, increased utilization from the Taiwan facility also impart, by higher Internet data center sales. Sequentially gross margins were down due to seasonally quarter for the industry and higher Internet data center sales, also impart by higher utilization of our facilities more complete server solutions and increase purchasing power. Slide 11 and 12. Operating expenses were 33.2 million up from 30.8 million from the same quarter year ago, and from 32.3 million sequentially. The percentage of revenues operating expenses was 8.9%, down from 11.1% year-over-year and from 9.1% sequentially. Operating expenses were higher on an absolute dollar basis year-over-year, primarily on R&D as we invest in personnel expenses to support development of our solutions. Sequentially operating expenses were higher due to trade show expenses associated with [inaudible] as well as higher personnel expenses due to additional R&D resources. The company’s headcount increased by 60 sequentially through 1,721 total employees. We continue to focus on leveraging investment has made in our infrastructure while still making strategic investments in our solutions portfolio. Operating profit was 24.3 million up 192.9% from 8.3 million a year ago and by 5.6% from 23 million sequentially. On percentage basis operating margin was 6.5% up from 3% a year ago and from 6.4% sequentially. Net income was 17.8 million or 4.8% of revenues, up 77.1% from 10 million a year ago and 11.8% from 15.9 million sequentially. Our non-GAAP fully diluted EPS was $0.37 per share, up from $0.23 per share a year ago and up from $0.35 per share sequentially. The number of fully diluted shares used in third quarter was 48,103,000 shares. The tax rate for the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis was 26.4% compared to negative 23.1% a year ago and 30.5% sequentially. The rate was lower than last quarter due to the release of tax liabilities in the current quarter. We expect the effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis to be approximately 31% for the fourth quarter which is up from 24.7% in the same quarter last year. The increase, reflect the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in June of 2013 and the release of tax liability last year. Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis slide 13, cash and cash equivalence for short and long term investments were 104.4 million, up 11.8 million from 92.6 million in the prior quarter, and up 7.7 million from 96.7 million in the same quarter last year. In the third quarter, free cash flow was a negative 8.7 million, primarily due to increased accounts receivables to support the growth of revenue. Slide 14. Accounts receivable increased by 20.9 million to 118 million due to record revenues mentioned above. DSOs was 41 days, an increase of three days from 38 days in the prior quarter. Inventory increased by 4.2 million to 295.1 million to support the increased and forecasted of revenues for a seasonally strong fourth quarter. Days and inventories was the same at 83 days, Accounts payable was 205.2 million which was comparable to prior quarter. Days payable outstanding increased by one day to 58 days. Overall cash conversion cycle days was 66 days, an increase of two days and 64 days in the prior quarter. Now for a few comments on our outlook. During this third quarter we grew at a seasonally weak quarter for the industry due to our optimized solutions and leveraging the foundation we have built over the past few years. As we enter the fourth quarter, which is seasonally the strong quarter for the industry, we continue to leverage a foundation that we have built to continue to drive our growth and profitability. Therefore, the company currently expects net sales for the quarter ending June 30, 2014 in a range of 370 million to 410 million. Assuming this revenue range, the company expects non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.35 to $0.41 for the quarter. It is currently expected that the outlook will not be updated until the release of the company’s next quarterly earnings announcement, notwithstanding subsequent developments however, the company may update the outlook at/or any portion thereof at any time. With that let me turn it back to Charles for some closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Howe. Again last quarter was another record high quarter of revenues and earnings for Super Micro and it is a strong start to calendar 2014. With our leadership in innovation and market [inaudible] global capability grows. I’m confident that calendar 2014 we have a significant year of revolution and growth for Super Micro. Operator, as at this time we are ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen our question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions]. I will go first to Aaron Rakers with Stifel.
Aaron Rakers: Yeah, thanks for taking the questions. Congratulations on another solid quarter. I guess the first question and I have a follow up is on the gross margin line. When I look at the 15.4% gross margin that you guys just reported, obviously you saw record high contribution from your total systems revenue which typically would help that gross margin lines. So I think could you guys give us some color on the various different puts and takes particularly the mix of Internet data center vertical? And how that impacts that weighted gross margin relative to the mix of the total system business increasing?
Charles Liang: Yeah thank you for the question. Yeah, indeed recently our operation in Asia is pretty ready and strong and that’s why we start to get into more aggressively in cloud and Internet data centers. So, basically we gain pretty much one in U.S. one new in Asia and another new in Europe. So those high scale data center and Internet business kind of good for our long term and short term is we kind of had to sacrifice our profit a little bit. But long term, we will get benefit from those economical scale.
Aaron Rakers: I guess just kind of follow up on that then, is there any kind of help that you can give us with regards to the differential between the gross margin of that Internet data center vertical as that seems to be obviously a growth driver here as we continue to move forward relative to I guess you call it the traditional enterprise business the non-Internet data center vertical?
Charles Liang: Indeed we are also growing very strongly in traditional enterprise market as officially now site service is fully available and our management is also available. So we are also growing aggressively in enterprise customer and that’s why our overall profit margin won’t be too bad I mean.
Aaron Rakers: Okay. I’ll get back in queue. Thank you.
Charles Liang: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We’ll go next to Mark Kelleher with D.A. Davidson.
Mark Kelleher: Thanks. Thanks for taking the question. Can you guys hear me?
Charles Liang: Yes, we can.
Operator: Yes.
Mark Kelleher: Okay. Just wanted to follow up on that question I’m going to ask sort of the same question in a different way. In the past you set some gross margin expectation should we look at some of the gross margin sort of plateau in here as the increase in data center continues to take more as a percentage of revenue? What are the longer term gross margin expectations right now?
Charles Liang: I guess the most important we try to mix it up it continues to grow strongly and with that we are selectively have some activity account with relatively lower margin and Howe may be you could add something.
Howard Hideshima: Yeah. Mark this is Howard. Also again we’re still holding to our targets. We are driving towards that and quite frankly, like I said, we always said that it wouldn’t happen in a linear fashion per se. And you have to remember that this is a seasonally weak quarter and if you look back historically, you’ll find that there is always margin pressure during the March quarter if you go back a couple of years.
Mark Kelleher: Okay. And as a follow up question how about an update on the Taiwan manufacturing? Where are we in utilization there and are you going to want to put another line there?
Howard Hideshima: We’re kind of pleased it’s still behind schedule we are pleased as Charles mentioned it’s over 50% of our utilization at this point. We’re looking to drive and keep on filling up that facility and utilize the benefits it’s providing to us.
Charles Liang: And we believe that within one year, our utilization in Taiwan facility should be almost 100% so that’s pretty positive side for us.
Mark Kelleher: Okay great. Congratulations again on the quarter.
Charles Liang: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We’ll go next to Glenn Hanus with Needham and Company.
Glenn Hanus: Good afternoon. So, on the revenue you did roughly 40 million of revenue upside in the quarter. Can you give us a little more color where did that upside come from? Obviously North America was strong Internet Data center did you may be have it sounds like you have couple of new large customers little more color on that. And then on the guide, I mean certainly good guidance but seasonally you might have stronger sequential growth into the June quarter. So was there some revenue perhaps that went into March did deal or two or something and then is little less in June can you give us some color around that?
Charles Liang: Yeah basically, so you know June traditionally our strong quarter and if I believe we’re the singular right? So except again that is why we say we start to be more aggressive in the Internet data center. However, we are also growing strongly in our enterprise accounts. So overall our optimizing should be consistently improving.
Glenn Hanus: All right. I’ll take it up offline. Thank you very much.
Charles Liang: Thank you.
Operator: And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of our conference call. I’d like to turn the conference back to Mr. Liang for closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you for joining us today and we’re looking forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you everyone. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does concludes the Super Micro third quarter fiscal 2014 conference call. We do appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time.

Charles Liang: Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to slide four. First, let me provide you with the highlights of the second fiscal quarter. We are pleased that our second quarter revenue was $356.4 million. It’s 15.3% higher quarter-over-quarter and 22.3% higher year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $15.9 million or 60.9% higher quarter-over-quarter and 103% higher compared to last year. Super Micro’s non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.35 per diluted share, compared to $0.22 last quarter and $0.18 last year. Slide five and six please. Super Micro’s second quarter was record high for revenue and earnings. We grew again in market products or industries gross rate. Our foundation in product innovation and global operation came together this quarter to produce these record results. Here is a fiscal breakdown of last quarter’s revenue, our server system contribute 48.8% of our total revenue. 46.6% of our business last quarter came from OEM and Direct customers, with the Internet Data Center accounting for 12.9% of sales, which increased 55.4% from last quarter. Our continued focus on offering completed systems and total solutions is again showing strong progress. More partners from both channel and Direct are moving toward taking completed system from Super Micro because of its higher product quality, greater time-to-market, optimized product performance and power efficiency and available global logistics support. Geographically, revenue in North America was 50.4% and Europe was 23.9% of total sales. Notably, Asia jumped to 23% of our total revenue, contribution which was up from 17.8% last quarter and 20.7% last year. As I have said before, Asia will become a large part of our revenue story, due to our readiness at Taiwan facility. We are able to scale and deliver high quality product for Asia and certain world-wide customer base. Europe revenue also was up approximately 27% comparing to a year ago. North America our largest and most consistent market was up significantly in absolute dollars from last quarter, while Asia has shown most strength in term of total revenue of percentage. In last quarter’s earnings, I mentioned several aspect of Super Micro’s effort to build a stronger foundation. Allow me to emphasize again the strength of our company including our product innovation and global production capacity. Super Micro is continuing to develop further products that have won the market praise because of their superior application optimization and pure performance, performance per watt, per dollars and per square foot. For example, during the quarter, we launched the TwinPro Architecture that supports by interchanging First SAS 3.0 storage, NVMe, accelerated PCI-E SSD performance and Titanium Level efficiency power supply in the data center optimized package. Other than the TwinPro, we are also preparing to launch the brand new ultra high density extreme low power Microblade architecture on this March which will support 112 Atom Nodes or 28 dual processor DM nodes in the 6U form factor. Now Microblade will feature integrated 2.5G or 10GE switch. Then we’ll enter to introduce the cable course and TCO for our customers and to extend our technology leadership that TwinPro and the MicroBlade are great beginning options to come in 2014. We also saw a strong growth for many product lines on a year-to-year basis. Our FatTwin, the key products of 2013, grew 128% -- 129% year-over-year. Our storage solution demonstrate strong growth last quarter by 49% year-over-year and 24% quarter-over-quarter. Our HPC Solutions including GPU and Xeon Phi grew 58% year-over-year and 35% sequentially. The Intel Ivy Bridge achievement and switch product are also ramping nicely and have been to create additional demand. All these products suggest that our application optimize solutions are in great demand by cloud service, data center, channel partner and large corporate accounts. As we extend our offerings to a software suite that remotely managed data center and on site service for mission-critical application customers, who need long [accountable] our support. I’m confident that this product will become best resources of our stated revenue stream in 2014. Parallel to our growth in product, our global operation foundation is getting much stronger as well. The growth in our Asia business this quarter can be shown sooner utilization of our Taiwan facility that had record high utilization and delivery volume. In addition, our rapid business growth has driven the need to utilize all available space we have at Taiwan and remote production capacity ‘09. As soon as our Taiwan capacity reached 60% at our existing site, we will begin our next phase of our Asia expansion plan. I strongly believe this preparation will happen this year as we reach for our $2 billion revenue target. In summary, Super Micro had a record quarter for revenue and earnings because of our investment we had met to ensure, we had room for our growth. We are in the strongest position than ever before. And we are realizing multiple times of industry growth rate as we’re faster approaching the $2 billion revenue growth. Now, we are extremely focused on executing our strength in technology and leveraging our global foundation. We believe calendar 2014 will be a very strong year for Super Micro. For more specifics on our first quarter, let me turn it over to Howard.
Howard Hideshima: Thank you Charles and good afternoon everyone. I will focus my remarks on earnings, gross margins, operating expenses and similar items on the non-GAAP basis which reflects adjustments to exclude stock compensation expenses. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company in today's earnings release and in the supplemental detail in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Let me begin with the review of the second quarter income statement. Please turn to Slide 11 -- 7. Revenue was a record $356.4 million, up 22.3% from the same quarter a year ago and 15.3% sequentially. The increase in revenue from last year was primarily due to our increase in server solution sales particularly in our innovative product such as Storage, FatTwin, GPU/Xeon Phi, Racks and Switches. This couple with our management software and support services has further opened opportunities in the market for us. On geographical basis, we had strong growth around the world with Asia leading the way. A sequential increase in revenue was primarily due to seasonal strength in the industry and continued strength in our innovative product above. In addition, Ivy Bridge which was launched on September 10 continue to ramp nicely, benefited by a broad product line. Turning to product mix, a portion of revenues from server systems was 48.8% of total revenues which was up from 43.3% for same quarter a year ago and from 46.4% last quarter. ASP for servers was $2700 per unit which is up from $2100 last year and up from $2600 last quarter. We shipped approximately 63,000 servers in the second quarter and 1,173,000 subsystems and accessories. We continue to maintain a diverse revenue base with over 600 customers and none of these customers are representing more than 10% of our quarterly revenues. Internet data center revenue was 12.9% which was an increase from 8.3% in the prior quarter and a decrease from 14.2% in the prior year. Furthermore 50.4% of our revenues came from the U.S. and 53.4% from our distributors and resellers. Slide nine and 10. Non-GAAP gross profit was $55.3 million, up 37.2% from $40.3 million in the same quarter last year, and up 17.7% from $47 million, sequentially. On a percentage basis, gross margin was 15.5%, up from 13.8% a year ago and up from 15.2% sequentially. Price changes from Ablecom resulted in no basis points change to gross profit in the quarter and total purchases representing approximately 18.1% of total cost of goods sold compared to 15.4% a year ago and 17.3% sequentially. The year-over-year increase in gross margin resulted from strong vendor relationships, lower provision for inventory reserves, given product transition last year and a favorable product mix. Sequentially, gross margins were up due to higher utilizations of our facilities, favorable product mix and more complete server solutions and an increase purchasing power due in part to increasing the scale of our business. Slide 11. Operating expenses were $32.3 million, up from $29.9 million in the same quarter a year ago and down from $32.1 million sequentially. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses was 9.1% down from 10.2% year-over-year and down from 10.5% sequentially. Operating expenses were higher on an absolute dollar basis year-over-year, primarily in R&D as we invested in personnel expenses to support the development of our products. Sequentially, operating expenses were lower due to less prototype material and testing fees with the rollout of our Ivy Bridge Based products in September. The company headcount increased by 51 sequentially to 1,661 total employees. We continue to focus on leveraging the investments we have made in our infrastructure while still making strategic investments in our product portfolio. Operating profit was $23 million, up by 118.6% from $10.5 million a year ago and by 57.1% from $14.6 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, operating margin was 6.4%, up from 3.6% a year ago and from 4.7% sequentially. The operating is at the lower end of our target model. Net income was $15.9 million or 4.5% of revenues, up 103% from $7.8 million a year ago, and 60.9% from $9.9 million sequentially. Our non-GAAP fully diluted EPS was $0.35 per share, up from $0.18 per share a year ago and from 22% per share sequentially. The number of fully diluted shares used in the second quarter was 46,022,000. The tax rate in the second quarter on a non-GAAP basis was 30.5% compared to 24.5% a year ago and 31.7% sequentially. The rate was lower than last quarter due to the release of tax liability. We expect the effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis to be approximately 31.8% for the third quarter, which is up from negative 23.1% in the same quarter last year. The increase reflects the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in March of 2013 and the release of tax liability last year. Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis, slide 12. Cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term investments were $92.6 million, down $21.6 million from $114.2 million in the prior quarter, and up $1.5 million from $91.1 million in the same quarter last year. In the second quarter, free cash flow was a negative $31.9 million, primarily due to purchases of 36-acres of property in San Jose, California for $30.2 million. Slide 13, accounts receivable increased by $27.1 million to $161.2 million due to record revenues mentioned above. DSOs was 38 days, a decrease of four days from 42 days in the prior quarter. Inventories increased by $36.6 million to $290.9 million to support the looming year all day shutdown in Asia. Days and inventories decreased by 6 days to 83 days. Account payable increased by $40.1 million to $205.8 million due to increased inventories mentioned above. Days payable outstanding increased by two days to 57 days. Overall, cash conversion cycle days was 64 days, a decrease of eight days from 72 days in the prior quarter. Now for a few comments on our outlook, during the second quarter, we saw a sequential -- seasonally strong quarter in which we continued to grow at multiples of the industry determine by the foundation of investments we have made in the past in our technology and infrastructure. As we enter the third quarter which is a seasonally weak quarter for the industry, we look to further take advantage of the foundation we have built to continue to drive our growth. Therefore, the company currently expects net sales for the quarter ending March 31, 2014 in a range of $320 million to $350 million. Assuming this revenue range, the company expects non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.24 to $0.30 for the quarter. It is currently expected that the outlook will not be updated until the release of the company’s next quarterly earnings announcement. Notwithstanding subsequent developments, however, the company may update the outlook or any portion thereof at anytime. With that let me turn it back to Charles for some closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Howard. Again, last quarter was a record quarter of revenue and earnings for Super Micro, providing that Super Micro is leading server, storage and competitive solution company and a strong competitor. We believe that we are well-positioned for a very strong calendar year 2014 and possibly reaching the $2 billion run rate very soon. Operator, at this time, we are ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) And we will first go to Mark Kelleher from D.A. Davidson.
Mark Kelleher - D.A. Davidson: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Congrats on a great quarter there, guys. Want to talk about Ivy Bridge contribution in the quarter. Can you quantify how strong that was in the quarter, can you quantify where we are in that product cycle and how that should rollout over the next couple quarters?
Charles Liang: Yeah. Ivy Bridge is still a pretty new product. Again, they are available for about one and half quarters and quarter-to-quarter, we grew about 70% for Ivy Bridge.
Mark Kelleher - D.A. Davidson: As far as -- yeah, of volumes.
Charles Liang: So kind of new products, so I believe we are continuing to grow.
Mark Kelleher - D.A. Davidson: Okay. And I will -- my follow-up question kind of unrelated, the competitive landscape, clearly you are growing faster than just about every other vendor out there. How do you think that landscape might change if IBM were to divest their x86 business as was no more today?
Charles Liang: Yeah. For sure, it’s an not an easier task and that’s why we have spend lots of efforts to build our foundation in terms of engineering capability, in terms of global operation cost and all of those investment were been heavily in the last three years, have been pretty ready. And that’s why we start to see the advantage to grow stronger than others.
Mark Kelleher - D.A. Davidson: Okay. Thanks.
Charles Liang: Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll now go to Aaron Rakers from Stifel Nicolaus. 
Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus: Yeah. Thank you for taking the question and then also congratulations on the quarter. I would like to talk a little bit about gross margin. Some of the levers that you still see in front of you, I guess starting with where you stand today on the Taiwan facility in terms of utilization where we expect that to be trending out over the next couple of quarters and then on top of that just remind us again if what other levers you have to kind of attaining your target model?
Howard Hideshima: Yeah, Aaron, this is Howard. With regards to utilization on Taiwan, that was still about 41% for the December quarter and growing. Obviously it’s a record for us, previous record for us was about 36%. So that’s one of the levers we talked about with investors all the way along as far as increasing the utilization for not only the Taiwan facility but obviously our operations worldwide. So that’s one of the important levers for our gross margins. We also hit a couple of other levers that we’ve talked about in the past. Product mix, as we drive towards more complete server solutions, it would be beneficial to our margins, growing our scale of business. Again that contributed during the quarter to improvement in margins and to a lesser extent we talked about software and support services. And I’m glad to see that they are starting to contribute a little, albeit little but just starting to contribute for us. So the levers that we’ve talked about in the past are -- it's quite gratifying to see some real numbers pulling behind.
Charles Liang: Yeah. They all factor in, but it is still about one-year old new product. They continue to grow strongly. And we just announced our TwinPro, which is another kind of performance per watt enhance Twin Architecture. And just ramping up now quickly and follow by our MicroBlade in next few months. So, I mean, new product, new architecture, outperform competition that [help us a lot].
Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. And then as a follow up, I'd like to maybe understand a little bit better your Asia-Pac growth in particular was obviously notably impressive this quarter, especially in the context of what IBM just reported tonight. Can you talk about your exposure in Asia-Pac and in particular your positioning, how meaningful China is in your positioning specifically within China?
Charles Liang: Yeah. I mean, Asia is relatively a new market for us, right. We started to focus on Asia aggressively about two to three years ago and now we have getting stronger foundation there, especially a production ready in Taiwan. So, I mean, we continue gaining good customer in both, China, Japan and Korea. So that's very solid trend to go I believe.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus: And how big is China of Asia-Pac, can you help us understand that?
Howard Hideshima: It's still roughly a majority of the Asia-Pac area.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. I'll get back in queue. Thank you.
Charles Liang: Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We'll now go to Glenn Hanus from Needham.
Glenn Hanus - Needham: Good afternoon. Liang, your Data Center business was up strongly. Can you talk about what the trend -- what was behind the trend there this quarter and maybe what to expect over the next few quarters?
Charles Liang: Yeah. I guess, the major reason because our capacity in logistic global have been getting very strong. So we are much more ready to approach those huge Data Center now. So I believe we are continuing growing in that territory quickly.
Glenn Hanus - Needham: So with some of the Data Center wins over in Asia or can you characterize maybe geographically where the growth really came from this quarter and was it sort of highly concentrated in a couple of large deals?
Howard Hideshima: Yeah. Glenn, this is Howard. With regards to where it was -- we saw some nice deals in Asia, that grow some of the percentage is in Asia up during the quarter. We also saw some continued growth in the U.S. which was nice to see also.
Charles Liang: And Europe as well.
Howard Hideshima: And Europe as well.
Charles Liang: Pleasantly, yeah.
Glenn Hanus - Needham: And what's your outlook for the next few quarters there?
Charles Liang: I guess we'll continue evenly growing, although, Asia will be a little faster.
Glenn Hanus - Needham: Okay. Thank you.
Charles Liang: Thank you.
Operator: And it appears there are no further questions at time. So I will turn the conference back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you for joining us today and we are looking forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you everyone. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. And that does conclude the Super Micro’s second quarter fiscal year 2014 conference call. We do appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you.

Perry Hayes: Good afternoon and thank you for attending Super Micro's conference call on financial results for the first quarter fiscal year 2014, which ended September 30, 2013. By now you should have received a copy of today's news release that was distributed at the close of regular trading and is available on the company's website.

In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today’s press release and in the supplemental information attached to today’s presentation. I'll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Charles Liang:  Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to slide four. First, let me provide you with the highlights of our first fiscal quarter. We are pleased that our first quarter revenue was $309 million in the traditionally weaker season. It’s 4.1% lower quarter-over-quarter and 14.2% higher year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $9.9 million or 12.6% lower quarter-over-quarter and 223.4% higher compared to last year. Super Micro’s non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.22 per diluted share compared to $0.26 in last quarter and $0.07 last year. Slide five and six please. We are pleased with last quarter’s revenue, which was 14.2% higher than last year. This is a strong performance for typically tougher quarter for IT spending. This quarter the growth is likely to be the strongest among our competition. Here is a [fiscal] breakdown of last quarter’s revenue, our server system contribute 46.4% of our total revenue. The 39.1% of our business last quarter came from OEMs and Direct customers with the Internet Data Center accounting for 8.3% of sales. These results indicated that more and more of our partners choose our completed servers services due to the higher quality and performance optimization. Geographically, revenue in North America was 56.7%, Europe was 23% and Asia was 17.8% of total sales. North America and Europe continues to be strong and consistent. Recently we acquired a new 36-acre San Jose campus to accommodate our future growth or the American market. We also saw a strong growth from a stable product mix on a year-to-year basis. Our FatTwin system was at 176%. Storage was up 24%. Blade was 28% higher. GPU and Xeon Phi solutions were 25% higher. MicroCloud grew 116% and continues to ramp strongly.  Finally, our switch product saw a good demand and was 66% higher. Super Micro always grew in the period of technology transition. This quarter the new Ivy Bridge processor launched in the middle of September and most of our products were ready to support the new processor at launch. Despite the base quarter launch, the product volume ramp nicely. The Ivy Bridge announced for TwinPro is another great display of our engineering strength and business sense. Our unique business model is (inaudible) in developing trajectory based product and to be first to market. Proving that point we had developed over 80 optimized server solutions for the Ivy Bridge processor ready at launch. Even now we are still ahead of competition with the most Ivy Bridge solutions available in the market. Our business model, they are not stopped by innovation along technology cycles. We continue to create brand new products that lead the industry. For example, our FatTwin architecture found the great success is to scale out datacenter applications, which is advantage in energy saving, performance, density, cost and easier maintenance. Super Micro (inaudible) developed the Twin architecture with higher performance, expandability and a greater efficiency. As a result the Twin product and something else new and exciting will be coming soon. Another example is our MicroCloud which is 3U multiple node solution for datacenter, web hosting and cloud applications. Starting with a node as a first, we recently had launched our 24 node solution and that’s the outfit in the 3U enclosure. Furthermore as competition has set up for low power, low cost, high density servers, Super Micro have developed a 6U, 112 node MicroBlade system (inaudible) low power deal and other processors. The system was recently on display at this year’s Intel Developers Forum or IDF. Super Micro also continues to launch new high density HPC solutions. They’re focused on GPU and Xeon Phi support from when you see some risk for GPU or Xeon Phi support to embrace solutions with 20 GPU or Xeon Phi support in 7U. Super Micro had the wide list of range of GPU and Xeon Phi server solutions in the market. The newest edition will support a GPU or Xeon Phi in the 4U system. That’s designed in a way with no components presented the fully redundant features on power including also improved systems activity and availability. On the software and service side, we had developed a software suite to have our customer manage their server costs and data centers remotely. We have also officially launched our on-site service program this quarter to satisfy mission critical customers, who need on talk, enable our support. These products are becoming high value sources, always steady popular speed. Now let me take a moment to address market conditions and how Super Micro is positioned to compete. We heard that our larger competitors talk about how tough the market is and we see that their revenue have been declining for many quarters, during this time, while our competitor struggles, Super Micro grows and continue grow strongly in spite of the industry competition and macroeconomic tailwind. Of course the IT market is tough, but Super Micro has continued to develop industry leading product. They have won the market share because of their superior pure performance, performance per watt, per dollars and square foot. This business model enabled us for success in this industry and we continue to take market share. We’re getting asked why we are successful when we are not the biggest. The answer is simple, our strong R&D, our strong global foundation now and our strong dedication as a team. We understand when you are not the biggest you have to complete smarter and harder to win. In fact our corporate culture embraced competition since the beginning of our company. And our employees dedicated themselves to become the best in the industry. Indeed we are united in that believe and we are on track to grow strongly. But for more specific on the first quarter let me turn it to over to Howard.
Howard Hideshima:  Thank you, Charles. And good afternoon everyone. I will focus my remarks on earnings, gross margin, operating expenses and similar items on a non-GAAP basis which reflects adjustments to exclude stock compensation expenses, reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company in today’s earnings release and in the supplemental detail in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Let me begin with a review of the first quarter’s income. Please turn to slide seven. Revenue was 309 million, up 14.2% from a same quarter a year ago and down 0.1% sequentially. The increase in revenue from last year was primarily due to our increase in server solution sales the growth for our new products such as FatTwin, Storage, MicroCloud, GPU, Xeon Phi, the switches and racks, highlight the importance of innovation and servicing the variety of needs which our customers demand. In addition we have continued to build our brand and image and expanded our product offering, not only in hardware but also in management software and support. This does further open opportunities in the markets for us. On a geographical basis U.S. and Europe grew 30% and 12.2% over last year respectively. Asia was down 15% due to competition from local suppliers. The sequential decrease in revenues from last quarter is primarily due to seasonal weakness around the world. Asia was particularly weak due to lower data center projects last quarter. We do see strength in our Xeon Phi, GPU and MicroCloud products which grew over 30% sequentially. In addition, Ivy Bridge was launched in mid September. With Ivy models available at the time of launch we continue to offer the broadest array of solution to our customers and it puts us in a great position to take advantage of this product type. Slide eight. Turning to product mix. The proportion of revenues for server systems was 46.4% of total revenues which result from 39.5% the same quarter a year ago and down from 47.4% last quarter. ASP for servers was $2,600 per unit which is up from $2,000 last year and up from $2,400 last quarter. We shipped approximately 55,000 servers in the first quarter and 1, 56,000 sub systems and accessories. Our server units were about the same as last year. The compute notes have increased from the prior year from customers who are driving our high density solutions. We continue to maintain a diverse revenue base with over 600 customers and now these customers representing more than 10% of our quarterly revenues. Internet data center revenue was 8.3% which was a decrease from 9.5% in the prior quarter and 8.8% in the prior year. Furthermore 56.7% of our revenues came from U.S. and 60.9% from our distributors and reseller.  Slide 9 and 10. Non-GAAP gross profit was $47 million, up 33% from $35.3 million in the same quarter last year, and up 2% from $46.3 million, sequentially. On a percentage basis, gross margin was 15.2%, up from 13% a year ago and up from 14.4%, sequentially. Price changes for Ablecom resulted in no basis points changed to gross profit in the quarter with total purchases representing approximately 17.3% of total cost of goods sold compared to 20.9% a year ago and 17% sequentially. The year-over-year increase in gross margin resulted from price changes in hard disk drive since the flood in October 2011. A lower provision for inventory reserves given product transition which occurred last year with the launch of Sandy Bridge as well as the favorable product mix in the current quarter when compared to the prior year.  Sequentially, gross margin was up due to favorable product mix and more complete server solutions and less internet datacenter revenue as well lower inventory reserves. Hard disk drive, pricing was stable and memory pricing did increase in between the quarters. However, neither had a material effect to the gross margin.  Slide 11. Operating expenses were $32.4 million, up from $30.7 million in the same quarter a year ago and up from $31.2 million sequentially. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses was 10.5% down from 11.3% year-over-year and up from 9.7% sequentially. Operating expenses was higher on an absolute dollar basis year-over-year, primarily in R&D at personnel expenses increase due to the annual salary increase and material expenses associated with the rollout of Ivy Bridge. Sequentially operating expenses were up due to higher personnel expenses associated with annual salary increases as well as prototype material and testing fees associated with the rollout of our Ivy Bridge 8 products. The company headcount increased by 15 sequentially to 1,610 total employees. We continue to focus on leveraging the investments we have made in our infrastructure while still making strategic investments in our product portfolio.   Operating profit was $14.6 million, up by $10 million from $4.6 million a year ago and down by $5.5 million from $15.1 million sequentially. On a percentage basis operating margin was 4.7% up from 1.7% a year ago and equal to 4.7% sequentially. Net income was $9.9 million or 3.2% of revenues, up from $6.8 million from $3.1 million a year ago, and down $1.4 million from $11.3 million sequentially.   Our non-GAAP fully diluted EPS was $0.22 per share, up from $0.07 per share a year ago and down from $0.26 per share sequentially. The number of fully diluted shares used in the first quarter was 44,984,000.   The tax rate in the first quarter on a non-GAAP basis was 31.7% compared to 31.3% a year ago and 24.7% sequentially. The rate was higher from last quarter due to the pending exploration of the R&D tax credit and lower tax benefits from Taiwan. We expect the effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis to be approximately 31% for the second quarter, which is up from 24.5% in the same quarter last year. The increase reflects the pending exploration of the R&D tax credit in December of 2013 and the release of tax liability last year. Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis, slide 12. Cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term investments were a $114.2 million, up $18.5 million from $95.7 million in the prior quarter and up $52.9 million from $61.3 in the same quarter last year. In the first quarter, free cash flow was a positive $16.4 million primarily due to decreases in accounts receivable from record revenues in the prior quarter. Slide 13, accounts receivable decreased by $15.2 million to $134.1 million with DSO was 42 days, an increase of four days from 38 days in the prior quarter. Inventory of $254.3 million was comparable to the prior quarter with days inventories increasing by five days to 89 days. The increase in inventory days was primarily due to lower cost of goods sold during the first quarter. Account payable decreased by $7.2 million to $165.7 million with the days payable outstanding increasing by four days to 59 days primarily due to decrease of cost of goods sold in the quarter as mentioned above. Overall cash conversion cycle days was 72 days, an increase of five days from 67 days in the prior quarter. Now for a few comments on the [ops], during the first quarter we saw a seasonally weak quarter, in which we continue to grow faster than the industry and take market share from our competitors. As we entered the second quarter, we have a full array of solutions to take advantage of the Ivy Bridge launch. In addition the same quarter is also a seasonally strong quarter for the industry. Therefore the company currently expect net sales for the quarter ending December 31, 2013 in the range of $320 million to $350 million. Assuming this revenue range, the company expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.25 to $0.31 for the quarter. It is currently expected that the outlook will not be updated until the release of the company’s next quarterly earnings announcement. Notwithstanding subsequent developments however, the company may update outlook or any portion thereof at anytime. With that let me turn it back to Charles for some closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Howard. Last quarter’s results indicated that Super Micro is off to a strong start for this fiscal year. Many of our popular product line performed strongly. Our leadership in innovative architecture and optimized total solutions are firmly in place. I am confident that we will continue our growth trends in the coming quarters and years. Operator at this time, we are ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) And we’ll go first to Aaron Rakers with Stifel.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus: Yeah thanks for taking the question. First, can you talk a little bit about the Ivy Bridge ramp, how we expect to see, how big of a contributor was that in the September quarter and how much of an impact do you expect in the December quarter? And on that same topic, historically we’ve seen in past cycles some benefit on a gross margin basis, what’s your assumption on gross margin as that product cycle materializes?
Charles Liang: Okay, I mean, I’d just say anytime there are economic transition, it’s a good window for Super Micro to grow. And Ivy Bridge basically will provide some opportunities as well. So because our [regional launch] was September around 15th, September 10th, right? So it’s kind of pretty much end of last quarter. So not much impact to last quarter, but we are having more impact to this quarter, I mean December quarter. And we have kind of strong product liability, I mean other than Ivy Bridge. So our December quarter and next coming quarters, I believe will be a strong way.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. And you mentioned obviously Asia-Pac down 15% year-over-year in this most recent quarter. You mentioned two items, obviously week over our datacenter spending and you also had mentioned competitive dynamics. Can you take those two items and talk a little bit about them, what are you seeing competitively relative to maybe the weakness in this quarter being attributable to just push outs in datacenter spending?
Howard Hideshima: Hey, Aaron, this is Howard. With regards to the comments on in Asia, yeah saw some weakness based on some of the yen issues that have happened over the last year. So again that caused us to be a little less competitive in the local geo other than that there are various competitions going on out there in Asia more so than across the rest of the world. We are positioning ourselves very well with --. So everybody again we are getting more competitive out there.
Charles Liang: And that’s why it’s very important we continue to a stronger aggressive debate, specifically our manpower in Asia.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, I’ll see you folks. Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). And it appears at this time, we have no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Liang for any additional or closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you for joining us today. And we look forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you everyone. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the Super Micro first quarter fiscal year 2014 conference call. We do appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you.

Charles Liang: Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon everyone. Please turn to slide four. First let me provide you with the highlights of our fourth fiscal quarter. We are pleased that our fourth quarter revenue was $322.3 million. It's 15.9% higher quarter-over-quarter and 16.8% higher year-over-year. This result was a record high for Super Micro. Non-GAAP net income was $11.3 million or 12.6% higher quarter-over-quarter and 39.2% higher compared to last year. Super Micro’s non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.26 per diluted share compared to $0.23 last quarter, or $0.18 last year. Slide five, please. In my comments today, I would like to discuss our results last quarter as well as our achievements during the past fiscal year, before providing some insights on our trend, or upcoming year. Last quarter, we achieved record high revenue which was 16.8% higher than last year. This strong first quarter performance helped to push our full year revenue to $1.16 billion representing 14.7% gross over last year. Although our gross occurred this year is a bit slower than past years, neighbor cities it was about three times higher than the industry average, this way our growth indicates that we continue to take much share consistently. Last quarter, our server systems contributed 47.4% of our total revenue, 43.3% of our business last quarter came from OEMs and direct customers. Moreover internet datacenter account for 9.5% of sales. This result indicated that more and more of our partner choose our complete server solutions due to the overall quality and performance optimization. Geographically, revenue in North America was 56.2%, Europe was 23% and Asia was 18.6% of total sales. Our growth in North America continue to be strong and very consistent as we broaden our space in key regions in U.S. and especially the east coast. Europe had been growing slowly and what’s good overall considering the economic activity over the past year. In China business is growing strongly, while the rest of Asia has stable growth. Last quarter we saw strong growth from several product lines on a year-to-year basis. Storage remains our auditing product in the category, which the gross was up to 46%, rate were very strong last quarter and were 179% higher, GPU and Xeon Phi solutions were also strong and continue to be a very key product line with gross over 30% higher. New product such as MicroCloud grew 100% and [indiscernible]. Finally, our switch product seen the demands and were139% higher. Our [indiscernible] server product also grew strongly last quarter led by our FatTwin products. Our twin solution were up 200% year-over-year, this new product is quickly ramping as many of our customers recognize that many applications can be based optimized on FatTwin solutions. Last quarter, we also launched the new house wear UP server board and server solution. Earlier seedings of our next generation heavy bridge DT and X10 UP is in progress as well. Our target is again being the first to market with product IX featuring these new processes. Slide six please, looking back over fiscal 2013, we have many product highlights, one of the most significant highlights was the launch of our FatTwin product IX, we launched FatTwin about nine months ago and today we have 15 SKUs and growing, each year our gross SKUs are optimized for that specific application such as web hosting, storage, HPC or even Hadoop. With the detail storage density, power efficiency, performance and cost. Now FatTwin IX had been learning quickly and in the first quarter it really broke out by growing 179% sequentially. Besides the FatTwin we have many other key products that performs well in their respective body coast, for storage the key products in the SC A47B which features how swap have ability of up to 72 3.5 inch hard drive in for you, the demand for high density storage have been very high and we will introduce yet even higher density storage. For HPC Super Macro continue to be a major player in accessories, computing, featuring of flow IX of system they optimize it for GPU, Xeon 5 product. For Cloud, our MicroCloud product IX enjoys a great success amongst customers with it 3U, a node, clear node and 24 node configurations. Higher node densities are cognizant with higher performance in the regency based on the new house wheel and Abington processes. AS for networking we also launched several new level two, three NGPT and SOP processing solution, they provide coast effective, low density, connectivity options. This past year we also launched our brand new Super Micro’s server, manage MUTT server, with many years of development and optimization, our server allows IT managers to remotely manage service across the globe with no impact to customer applications, it also integrates easily with existing in [indiscernible] cost effectively. Last year our server, there have been launch in good IPMI utilities, Super Taco five and Super Micro Power Manager, upgrade the manager and command manager. Although fiscal 2013 was a challenging year in term of IT spending, hard driver issue at the beginning of the year and continuing economic of weakness in Europe. Super Micro performed strongly and outgrew the industry in our competition with our great products. Also with our first full year of operation in our Taiwan facility and our efforts, our Asia region grew approximately 24% year-over-year driven by strong growth in China. These efforts enable us to take much share with all of our product line and build our foundation with strong product innovation and enhance infrastructure. Looking ahead to fiscal 2014 Super Micro as the foundation has never been stronger and our operation has never been greater. We believe, we can continue the momentum and grow at a pace that is several times faster than the industry. With hot wheel and the commission that we reach new product launch, as well as our much more efficient global operation today, Super Micro will again lead the industry with the advent of server and solutions, there the IT industry demands. For more specifics on the first quarter, let me turn it over to Howard.
Howard Hideshima: Thank you, Charles. Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. I will focus my remarks on earnings, gross margins, operating expenses and similar items on a non-GAAP basis which reflects adjustment to exclude stock compensation expenses. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company in today’s Earnings Release, and in the supplemental details in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Let me begin with the review of the fourth quarter income statement. Please turn to Slide Seven. Revenues with a record $322.3 million up 16.8% from the same quarter a year ago and up 15.9%, sequentially. The increase in revenues from last year was primarily due to our high-density energy-efficient storage products. We are confident that our rich platform of storage solutions we’ll be able to take full advantage of this segment’s growth. Also our FatTwin platform continues a strong ramp. It offers a high-density energy-efficient solution geared toward HPC cloud and hybrid market. A sequential increase in revenue from last quarter was primarily due to seasonal strength, especially incubated by the growth in our twin platform such as 2U Twin2 and FatTwin which have been optimized for the HPC Cloud and hybrid market, as well as our Blade products in the HPC market. We also saw a good launch in our UP Haswell based product late in the quarter. We saw strength in all GL with business ending strongly in the month of June and we continue to ramp our Taiwan facility. Slide Eight, Trends and produce mix. A proportion of revenues from services sums for 47.4% of total revenues, which was up from 44.2% the same quarter a year ago, and up from 41.8 % last quarter. ASPs servers was $2,400 per year which is up from $3,000 last year and up from $2,100 last quarter. We shipped approximately 64000 servers in the fourth quarter and 1,270,000 subsystems and accessories. The increase in server units from the prior year and last quarter resulted in part from an increase in shipments of Twin and Blade solution to HPC customers. On a cost and compute basis, we shipped more high density solution than the prior year. This is reflective of the increase in density which our customers as well as the rest of the industry are driving for. We continue to maintain a diverse revenue base with over 600 customers and all of these customers representing more than 10% of our quarterly revenues. Internet datacenter revenues was 9.5%, which was a decrease from 10.8% in the prior quarter. Furthermore, 56.2% of our revenues came from the U.S. and 56.7% from our distributors and retailers. Slide 9 and 10, non-GAAP gross profit was $46.3 million, up 8.5% from $42.6 million in the same quarter last year, and up 18.3% from $39.1 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, gross margin was 14.4%, down from 15.5% a year ago and up from 14.1%, sequentially. Price changes for Ablecom resulted in no basis points changed to gross profit in the quarter with total purchases representing approximately 17% of total cost of goods sold compared to 22.6% a year ago and 18.7%, sequentially. The year-over-year decrease in gross margin resulted from price changes in hard disk drive since the flood in October of 2011, offsetting part by favorable product mix in the current quarter when compared to the prior year. Sequentially, gross margins were up due to favorable product mix and more complete server solutions and less internet datacenter revenue. In general we have higher margins and complete server solution than the subsystem and accessories. Slide 11, Operating expenses were $31.2 million, up from $30.6 million in the same quarter a year ago and up from $30.8 million sequentially. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses was 9.7% down from 11.1% year-over-year and up from 11.1% sequentially. Operating expenses was higher on an absolute dollar basis year-over-year and sequentially. We saw year-over-year increases in absolute dollars primarily in R&D as we invested in headcount and materials to drive our innovation in our product portfolio and to increase performance, intensity and power efficiency. Sequentially, operating expenses was up due to higher prototype and material testing fees associated with the rollout of our next-gen Haswell base products. The company's headcount increased by 27 sequentially to 1,595 total employees. We continue to focus on leveraging the investment we have made in our infrastructure while still making strategic investments in our product portfolio. Operating profit was $15.1 million, or 4.7% of revenues up by $3.1 million from $12 million a year ago, and up by $6.8 million from $8.3 million sequentially. Net income was $11.3 million or 3.5% of revenues, up $3.2 million from $8.1 million a year ago, and up $1.3 million from $10 million, sequentially. Our non-GAAP fully diluted EPS was $0.26 per share, up from $0.18 per share a year ago and up from $0.23 per share, sequentially. The number of fully diluted shares used in the fourth quarter was 44,171,000. The tax rate in the fourth quarter on a non-GAAP basis was 24.7% compared to 31.6% a year ago and negative 23.1%, sequentially. The tax rate was lower than last year due to the retroactive reinstatements of the R&D tax credit in January. We expect the effective tax rates on a non-GAAP basis to be approximately 29% for the first quarter, which is down from 31.3% in the same quarter last year. Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis, slide 12. Cash and cash equivalent and short and long-term investments were $95.7 million, down one million from $96.7 million in the prior quarter, and up $11.9 million from $83.8 million in the same quarter last year. In the fourth quarter, free cash flow was a negative $0.6 million, primarily due to an increase in accounts receivables to support growth in our revenues. Slide 13, accounts receivable increased by $27 million to $149.3 million and DSO was 38 days, a decrease of one day from 39 days in the prior quarter. Inventories decreased by $3.2 million to $254.2 million with the days in inventory decreasing by 10 days to 84 days. The decrease in inventory was primarily due to record revenues during the fourth quarter. Accounts payable increased by $9.3 million to $172.9 million, with days payables outstanding decreasing by four days to 55 days, primarily due to decrease of inventories in the quarter, as mentioned above. Overall cash conversion cycle days were 67 days, a decrease of seven days from 74 days in the prior quarter. Now, for a few comments on our outlook. As indicated previously, during the fourth quarter we saw a seasonally strong quarter in which we continue to benefit from our energy-efficient and high-density solutions we have pioneered for many years. As we enter the first quarter, we continue to see this growing importance as well as leveraging new technology launches from our partners. However, the first quarter is seasonally a weak quarter for the industry. Therefore, the company currently expects net sales for the quarter ending September 30th, 2013, in the range of $295 million to $315 million. Assuming this revenue range, the company expects non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.17 to $0.23 for the quarter. It is currently expected that the outlook will not be updated until the release of the company's next quarterly earnings announcement. Notwithstanding subsequent developments however, the company may update the outlook or any portion thereof at anytime. With that, let me turn it back to Charles for some closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Howard. The first quarter was a record high [indiscernible] with a gross of 16.8% higher year-over-year and which again outpace the industry gross rate. With the new fiscal, we should have strongest product line in our history and our global operation ready for gross. We believe that with these stronger inventions, we will continue our gross trend in fiscal 2014. Operator, at this time we are ready for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We'll take our next question from Mark Kelleher with Dougherty & Company.
Mark Kelleher –Dougherty & Company : Great, thanks. Congratulations guys, great quarter. I wanted to look at the gross margins. You had a fairly strong server results for the quarter. Of course that carries the higher gross margins. You have got some better utilization going on in the Taiwan manufacturing. You renegotiated some hard disk drive pricing during the quarter. And yet, only had a couple maybe 20 basis points and improvement in gross market, I’m just wondering if you can kind of give the puts and takes on gross margins and remind us what your longer term goal is for gross margins?
Howard Hideshima: Hi Mark, this is Howard and thank you first for the comment. With regards to gross margins puts and takes, again, some of them was still to comparing from sequential basis, you saw basically have a high risk of some of the storage products which typically have a higher cut from the pass through component pieces that kind of weighs in on the overall type of server solutions type of margin. That was probably the biggest item in that particular point because as we indicated we had a pretty strong quarter with regard to our server products, our storage products. With regards to our guidance it is 16% to 18% in the next 9 to 15 months.
Mark Kelleher –Dougherty & Company : Okay. And, just as a follow up question, in terms of the product roadmap that you’re expecting this year as Intel rolls out some new products, can you maybe give us some hints on where your product roadmap is going to go over the next couple of quarters?
Charles Liang: Yes, we have a very strong new product IX already like last month we just launched hot wheel UP product IX and that was a really big product IX and as you may know Intel heavy bridge, we have the official launched released in basically next month. So, we have a complete product IX already for that as well as FatTwin continue to grow, and our MicroCloud also continues to grow rapidly. So, in demo product we are in strongest position in our history.
Mark Kelleher –Dougherty & Company : Okay, great. Thanks.
Charles Liang: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Aaron Rakers with Stifel.
Aaron Rakers – Stifel Nicolaus: Yeah, thank you for taking the questions, you know, first just a clarification or maybe a longer term module input, you’re guiding 29% gross margin for the September quarter, how do we think about the progression, I’m sorry, tax rate, how do we think about the progression of the tax rate beyond the September quarter?
Howard Hideshima: I think, Aaron, we don’t give the full guidance, but if you look back historically, I think you will probably see it within that range we’ve got the RD credit is probably going to expire the latter part of December, but again, we got the Taiwan facility also give me some benefits going forward too. So, first quarter 29% seems like a reasonable rate.
Aaron Rakers – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. And, what is the current utilization on the Asia facility?
Charles Liang: Indeed they have been improving steadily, last quarter I guess was about 25% and this quarter was about 35% and next quarter I believe will be even better.
Aaron Rakers – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. And then, also on the internet data center protocol, looks like you’ve declined about 20% the last two quarters on a year-over-year basis, can you talk a little bit about what’s happening in that vertical specifically, have you started to see a increase competition or is there a kind of, you know, inherence lumpiness that we should be thinking about, you know, that kind of snaps back over the next couple of quarters?
Charles Liang: It’s kind of product base, so sometime it’s higher, sometime it’s lower, but with our Asia operation ready now we have much better cost now, so we will be more aggressive in the segment in the near future.
Aaron Rakers – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. And then, final question for me is on the OEM cost, the direct business that looked – project really strong in the quarter, was that more driven by OEM versus direct, can you just talk about where exactly are you seeing it looks like there is about 22% sequentially, where are you seeing that relative strength on the sequential basis?
Charles Liang: Basically is both, and I would have to say the most influence is the product because we get type of FatTwin, our brand new architectural available at one time ago and that architectural perform the best in term of per watt and in terms of in density, in I/O performance. So because of that strong product line, that’s why we grow both in OEM and kind of direct, big corporate or datacenter.
Aaron Rakers – Stifel Nicolaus: Thank you.
Charles Liang: Thank you.
Operator: And we will go next to Glenn Hanus with Needham.
Glenn Hanus – Needham: Yeah, congrats from me as well. IT bridge timing, you mentioned next month, has that slipped a little bit nominally a couple of weeks or anything or is that pretty much timing the same as you thought it would be a few months back?
Charles Liang: It looks like we’re having same, keep it the same and this time, it looks like our services will be 100% ready. So, we are very optimistic of what we rent.
Glenn Hanus – Needham: Yeah, so real healthy ramp by guessing the December quarter?
Charles Liang: December quarter, I didn't see, most of them we have in December quarter.
Glenn Hanus – Needham: You want to spend a minute on operating expenses. Let’s see, came in at least according to model you came in million or so under what I was expecting, some in sales and marketing, some in G&A, you were a little bit more than I thought in R&D, can you talk about the puts and takes on OpEx this quarter. Did you make some conscious effort to reduce anything? And any color you can give us over the next couple of quarter on OpEx?
Howard Hideshima: Yeah, Glenn, with regards to some puts and takes, I think last quarter we were rolling out some of the hassle solutions as I mentioned there. So, we incurred some more margins, some more cash in material expenses as we are rolling out that product, but we are watching our overall operating expenses and trying to leverage it as best we can. I think we will have some annual increases that happen normally for us on timing basis with the salary increases , but that won't be huge and going forward, I think we are still going to put an eye on that and try to leverage our expenses.
Glenn Hanus – Needham: Did you comment on OpEx below what you might have thought of three months ago? Or is it just my model was expecting too much?
Howard Hideshima: I am not commenting, I don’t know if I can comment on your model, but I think it’s coming in where we’re thinking about with regards to basically, how do I put it, leveraging our expenses.
Glenn Hanus – Needham: So, that our current R&D level in the recent quarter included some one-time taxes of items as we go into December with the IV bridge launch, should we anticipate some incremental R&D there?
Charles Liang: Yes, basically like when we share in last few quarters, we grew indeed about 90 something percent in engineering industry. So pretty much yeah, that can become maybe strong and we do not play into higher, many more people in the near future.
Glenn Hanus – Needham: Okay, all right. Thank you very much.
Operator: (Operator instructions) We’ll go next to Ted Monroe with KCG.
Ted Monroe – KCG: Yes, thank you for taking my question. I was just wondering if you think today’s announcement by IBM and their new OpenPower consortium impacts your businesses at all or are you agnostic to an X86 architecture versus the momentum in maybe ARM-based servers or even this new IBM announcement, and what would be your main concern?
Charles Liang: We opened our eye for all the possibility, but basically we are very concentrated on our expertise, our strengths as well. So X86 for sure will continue to be our main focus. But yes, we opened our eyes for whatever new technology or product line that customer have a demand.
Ted Monroe – KCG: Okay. So would you then design some products around this new potential like IBM opportunity or even what’s going on with ARM line networks?
Charles Liang: Yeah, it is positive, but otherwise our event depends on what customer need.
Ted Monroe – KCG: Sure, okay. Thank you.
Operator: (Operator instructions) At this time we have no further questions, so I’d like to turn the call back over to your speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you for joining us today and we look forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you everyone. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the Super Micro Fourth Quarter and Full Fiscal Year 2013 Conference Call. We do appreciate your participation, you may now disconnect at this time. Thank you.

I'll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon everyone. Please turn to slide four. First let me provide you recent highlights of our third quarter. We are pleased that our third quarter revenue was $278 million. It's 4.6% lower quarter-over-quarter and 15.8% higher year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $10 million or 28.1% higher quarter-over-quarter and 13.8% higher compared to last year. Super Micro’s non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.23 per diluted share, compared to $0.18 last quarter, or $0.19 last year. Slide five, please. Geographically, revenue in North America was 56.6%. Europe was 32% and Asia was 19% of total sales. As expected, Asia was softer last quarter due to the Chinese Lunar New Year. 41.2% of our overall business came from OEMs and direct sales customers of which internet data center were 10.8% of sales. Our server systems contributed 41.8% of revenue and ASPs remained stable. Slide six and seven please. Now typical March quarter seasonality was evident in the lower to revenue. However, we have said the revenue for the quarter was up 15.8% from last year. We are confident with this constant growth during a time when global economy weakness continues to impact IT spending. Our revenue growth this quarter much outpaced our competitors and we continue to grow at a multiple or industry's average. Super Micro continues to take much share by providing the industry's most innovative products that feature the best performance per watt, per dollar, and per square foot. Competition in our industry continues to intense due to big changes taking place with Tier-1 competitors. In addition, the PC market continue to decline over the past year, which force competitors to data centers, cloud and enterprise market for growth and profitability. Also other oversea competitors entered the market with limited commodity product and lower priced product that is a target on specific segments. Now, without that, we winning, we only go to those companies that have optimized solutions for customers key requirements of technology leadership in power saving and performance, total cost of ownership and solid solutions and service. Super Micro wins because of our heavy investment in industry leading technology like storage, GPU, MicroCloud and FatTwin. In addition, we are uniquely positioned in the industry to include a value added solutions, which is not only in service on a global scale and at the same time provide cost driven solutions. Combining technology leadership and services enable us to provide three optimized solutions to our customers. For example, we experienced a very strong customer demand since our FatTwin launch about two quarters ago. Our heavy investment in the FatTwin architecture enabled us to provide the best product platform in terms of computing density, storage density and energy power savings. Moreover, now FatTwin product line continues to grow and provide optimized way to serve our customers storage, HPC and cloud computing requirement. We started with the high storage density model that can feed up to eight hot-swappable 3.5-inch hard drive in 1U. Class 4 node and 8 node for I/O models, they achieved 16% less power consumption compared to other high density solutions. We recently launched the HPC FatTwin that can accommodate up to 12 GPU for Xeon Phi cards in 4U. Hadoop optimize. FatTwin is also available recently. In summary, the FatTwin product line now offer over clear optimized variations for customer applications and all of them generating strong order growth. MicroCloud product line also showed greater growth this past quarter. It was introduced about a year ago and have been one of our strongest product launch ever. Our investment in our own MicroCloud has actually have provided the industry's leading scale out solution for cloud and web hosting applications. We also launched cloud infrastructure solution last year. Recently, we had increased density to fair amount and that 24 configuration will be a bit of. Our price for high density computing does not end there. We were later introduced 6U compact solution that can house over 100 Atom-based computing nodes, which during redundant switch making it high performance cloud data center solutions in the industry. With this industry, the leading innovation in technology, we are very confident that our MicroCloud product line is a gear for market share gain. Storage also continues to show us strong growth. In addition, we are continuing to raise tender our storage product line to include a wider range of Hadoop optimized solutions. For Big Data and other applications this is the SCA -47B for you in closure with a unique of engineering product. Customers can excess all 72, 3.5-inch hard drive in an external hot-swappable fashion on SC-A47B, which later improved the access of 3G or the high density storage and that data center environment. Now, SC-A47B is becoming one of our (Inaudible). GPU continues to grow strongly and achieve higher growth year-over-year. We upgrade our technology for latest graphic processor including NVIDIA's K1 and K2 GPU for greater computing and Intel Xeon Phi core processor. As I mentioned before, our new FatTwin GPU solution fit up to 12 GPUs or Intel Xeon Phi core processors in 4U, which is one would GPU solutions in our industry. Super Micro have patients for innovation and technology leadership in GPU allow it to gain GPU large share. That is much greater than our size in our industry. The 13 GPU solution will allow us to expand our leadership due to the energy saving and performance per dollar outpace of. In addition to our hardware solutions, Super Micro's Data Center Management, SDCM saw suite, including in-band and out-band BIOS firmware and software updates and the monitoring utilities have been serving several large corporate data centers. Again, this quarter, we continue to grow our ability to generate revenue stream. In summary, our third quarter performance, again demonstrate our ability to gain much share because of our industry leading technology and innovative solutions. We continue to view on our vision as a global enterprise with global production and logistics capability. We continue to invest in our technology and further develop our software and service capabilities. We face it as usual with confidence in our strong position in the industry and our unique approach of providing differentiated application optimizing solutions to monetize the requirement. For more specifics on the third quarter, let me turn it over to Howard.
Howard Hideshima: Thank you, Charles, and good afternoon, everyone. I will focus my remarks on earnings, gross margins, operating expenses and similar items on a non-GAAP basis which reflects adjustment to exclude stock compensation expenses. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company in today’s earnings release and in the supplemental detail in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Let me begin with the review of the third quarter income statement. Please turn to slide eight. Revenue was $278 million, up 15.8% from the same quarter a year ago and down 4.6%, sequentially. The increase in revenue from last year was primarily due to strong growth in our energy efficient high density products, which are growing in importance of cloud and Big Data application continue pushing that for solutions offering the best TCOs. With the new technology releases from our partner, such as Intel, AMD and NVIDIA, et cetera, Super Micro is strongly positioned to capitalize on it with our innovative application optimized platforms. The sequential decrease in revenue from last quarter was primarily due to seasonal weakness as well as concerns about the economy and we saw strength in the U.S. as revenue was comparable to the prior quarter. Europe was weaker due to economic concerns and Asia started out as expected, but when the pause caused by the Lunar New Year, we saw business come back later in the quarter than expected. We continue to see a good ramp in Sandy Bridge products with an increase of 7%, sequentially, representing about 65% to our Intel-based revenues. Slide nine. Turning to product mix, the portion of revenues from server systems was 41.8% of total revenues, which is down from 48.5%, the same quarter a year ago and down from 43.3% last quarter. ASP for servers was $2,100 per unit, which is up from $2,000 last year and the same as last quarter. We shipped approximately 54,000 servers in the third quarter and 1,111,000 subsystems and accessories. The decrease in server units from the prior year resulted in part from a decrease in our internet data center revenues. However on a compute cost basis, we shipped more high density solutions than in past years. This is reflective of the increase in density, which our customers as well as the rest of the industry are driving for. We continue to maintain a diverse revenue base with over 600 customers and none of these customers representing more than 10% of our revenues. Internet data center revenues was 10.8%, which was a decrease from 14.2% in the prior quarter. Furthermore, 56.6% of our revenues came from the U.S. and 58.8% from our distribution and retailers. Slide 10 and 11, non-GAAP gross profit was $39.1 million, down 4.4% from $40.9 million in the same quarter last year, and down 3% from $40.3 million, sequentially. On a percentage basis, gross margin was 14.1%, down from 17% a year ago and up from 13.8%, sequentially. Price changes for Ablecom resulted in two basis point favorable change to gross profit in the quarter with total purchases representing approximately 18.8% of total cost of goods sold compared to 20.1% a year ago and 15.4%, sequentially. The year-over-year decrease in gross margin resulted from price changes in hard disk drive as well as unfavorable product mix in the current quarter when compared to the prior year. October flood in Thailand had caused of also [pricing] and supply of hard disk drives over the past year. Sequentially, gross margins were up due to increase in margins of our server boards and chassis that customers take more for application optimized and more stable pricing of hard disk drive offset in part by a higher mix of subsystem and accessories. In general, we have higher margin in server solutions than in subsystems and accessories. Slide 12, operating expenses were $30.8 million, up from $28.7 million in the same quarter a year ago and up from $29.8 million sequentially. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses were 11.1% down from 11.9% year-over-year and up from 10.2% sequentially. Operating expenses was higher on an absolute dollar basis year over year and sequentially. We saw year-over-year increase in absolute dollars primarily in R&D as we invest in headcount to drive our innovation in our product portfolio with increased performance, intensity and power efficiency. Sequentially, operating expenses were up due to higher sales and marketing expenses related to an European tradeshow which recurred as well as other promotional marketing expected new product were low about $1,000. In addition, we book an accounts receivable reserve of about $621,000. The company headcount increased by 7, sequentially to 1,568 total employees. We continue to control our operating expenses while still making strategic investments in our product lines. Operating profit was $8.3 million, or 3% of revenues, down by $3.9 million or $12.2 million a year ago and down $2.2 million from $10.5 million, sequentially. Net income was $10 million or 3.6% of revenue, up $1.2 million from $8.8 million a year ago and up $2.2 million from $7.8 million, sequentially. Our non-GAAP fully-diluted EPS was $0.23 per share, up from $0.19 per share a year ago and up from $0.18 per share, sequentially. The number of fully diluted shares used in this second quarter was 44, 498,000. The tax rate in the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis was negative 23.1% compared to 26.6% a year ago and 24.5%, sequentially. The rate was lower due to the release of liability for taxes as a result of the resolution of a tax audit during the quarter, which contributed about $0.05 to our EPS, and the retroactive restatement of the R&D tax credit in January, which contributed another $0.05 to our EPS. We expect the effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis to be approximately 23% for the fourth quarter, which is down from 31.6% in the same quarter last year. Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis, cash and cash and short and long-term investments were $96.7 million, up $5.6 million from $91.1 million in the prior quarter and up $4.5 million from $92.2 million in the same quarter last year. In the third quarter, free cash flow was a positive $6.4 million, primarily due to an increase in accounts payable to support additional inventory for the coming quarter. Accounts receivable increased by $3.4 million to $122.3 million and DSOs was 39 days, an increase of two days from 37 days in the prior quarter. Inventories increased by $13.7 million to $257.3 million with the days in inventory increasing by 1 day to 94 days. The decrease in inventory was due primarily to the increase in forecasted revenues for the seasonally strong fourth quarter. Accounts payable increased by $14.2 million to $163.6 million, with the days payable outstanding increasing by six days to 59 days, primarily due to the increase in inventories late in the quarter as mentioned above. Overall cash conversion cycle days were 74 days, a decrease of three days from 77 days in the prior quarter. Now for a few comments on outlook, as indicated previously, during the third quarter we saw a seasonally weak quarter and some economic uncertainties. In midst of this, we grew 16% year-over-year to rise in energy efficiency and compute density, which we have pioneered for many years. As we enter the fourth quarter, we continue to see this growing and important and look to continuing the ramp of our energy and density optimized solutions in this quarter, which is typically a strong quarter for the industry. Therefore, the company currently expects net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2013, in the range of $295 million to $315 million. Assuming this revenue range, the company expects non-GAAP earnings per share per diluted share of approximately $0.17 to $0.22 for the quarter. With regard to our target model, over the next 12 to 18 months, we will target 16% to 18% gross margins and 6% to 8% operating margins. We continue to expect to see improvements in our gross margins from increasing utilization of our Taiwan facility, improvements in our product mix towards complete solutions and progress in purchasing power and to grow our business and the addition of services and software to our revenue base. It is currently expected that the outlook will not be updated until the release of the company's next quarterly earnings announcement. Notwithstanding subsequent development however, the company may update the outlook or any portion thereof at anytime. With that, let me turn it back to Charles for some closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Howard. We were successful this past quarter in growing large share, because we [consistently] application optimized server solutions. Awarded in technology and system architecture, plus now including system management all the way up and service are critical to our future growth. We were continuously focused on our increasing market share by leveraging our world-class products, innovation and brand recognition. Our growth strategy remains intact. Our people are committed to succeed and our opportunities remain as great as ever. Operator, at this time we are ready for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And, we'll go first to Aaron Rakers with Stifel Nicolaus.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus: Thanks for taking the questions. I was wondering if you could comment on the, looks like hard disk drive pricing has stayed relatively over the past two quarters, but I was wondering if you could comment on memory pricing. What you are seeing there? Then I have a follow-up.
Charles Liang: Yes. I mean, our hard drive prices getting stable for many quarters already and memory pricing keeping growing since above two to three months ago and we expect these prices are going grow. Because we have a very solid and strong relationship with our suppliers and so we've strong partnership, I believe our supply in the memory should be stable in the coming quarters.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. Great. Thanks. Then, I wanted to talk a little bit about your Enterprise Data Center segment, and looks like you saw a kind of a slowdown in that segment this quarter. Is that from maybe an increase in competition relative to HP's new shot announcement Qantas, they are looking to double their direct server business in 2013 and then you have some comments coming from others saying that, you know, IBM and Lenovo might check a deal for their [business]?
Charles Liang: Yes. It is. In this segment, we feel very optimistic for a couple of reasons. One is our factory. We introduced our product 45 months ago, and the product has been growing very stably and we do see a good demand on the coming quarter and other than that about 16 months ago, we introduced our MicroCloud solution, which is high density for cloud application or web hosting. That product I think grow very well in last 16 months and recently indeed we are planning to introduce another solution. As I just mentioned, it was 6U, so more than 100 Atom pace low power processor and that system I believe outperformed that competition, and so with our Asia facilities, now the utilization doing is growing, our facilities are getting mature, so we do believe we will continue to improve our cost and when that continue to happen, we will be more capable to compete in the high volume period and clarification. So, in this area, I do feel very optimistic.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Mark Kelleher from Dougherty & Company.
Mark Kelleher - Dougherty & Company: Thanks for taking the questions. Just as a follow-up to that question, IBM selling its accessories to Lenovo, would you consider that a increased competitive threat or decreased competitive threat?
Charles Liang: Both, I guess, that's why we invested in Asia two years ago to enhance our production capability and close competitive capability. So, now Asian operation is ready, so we are able to compete in Asian market and also with the facility there, we are able to compete low cost high volume server market in U.S.A. and Europe as well. So, I believe that change overall won't impact us too much. We need to have a strong pullback in kind of cost effective solution.
Mark Kelleher - Dougherty & Company: Okay. And, in terms of product cycles, you mentioned where you were with Sandy Bridge. Could you kind of walk through the year and kind of indicate where you think new product cycles might give you about it. I know Sandy Bridge comes out and more after that. Could you kind of walk us through product cycles this year?
Charles Liang: Yes. We like technology change. New technology always mean better performance for per watt, better performance per dollars. With Ivy Bridge becoming nascent in next few months, we do have a very good forecast and customer commitment from there and also order top three order coming very soon for much faster performance for high end application and also UP, uni-process Intel hardware product line we have around here within next few weeks and we did have really strong product available today. So, from those point of view, I could feel a new product line in [satellites].
Mark Kelleher - Dougherty & Company: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Alex Kurtz with Sterne Agee.
Amelia Harris - Sterne Agee:  Hi. This is Amelia on for Alex today. Thanks for taking the question. How far along would you say are you with Seagate on a contract for HDD pricing, and if so what does that timeframe look like?
Howard Hideshima: Hi. This is Howard. Yes. We've been in discussions obviously with our vendors all the way along and so we are hopeful that we will have things. They are looking to us and we are negotiating with them.
Charles Liang: Basically, we already have a certain reasonable and [aver] to say a very positive agreement and the relationship continue to improve basically.
Amelia Harris - Sterne Agee:  Thanks. This is a follow-up. Are you seeing ODMs at Qantas more active or less active in the market right now? How would you say they are on a competitive front?
Charles Liang: Those who see formation have a better cost and lower price from certain standard to for certain Big Data standard customer we do want to really expand our Asia facility kind of strongly in last two years, so our facility formation now it is pretty ready and however what customer really need? I mean most of the customer really need is a TCO, basically a TCO, so that mean not just a lower cost from that, but better quality, better optimization, including performance optimization and power saving optimization also including management all the way total solution. So, indeed the most of the market I mean the customers feel, now their TCO in total.
Amelia Harris - Sterne Agee:  Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Glenn Hanus from Needham.
Glenn Hanus - Needham: Hi, guys. Could we dive a little bit more into; so you have a new target for gross margin, you had talked about a 300-basis point improvement from abatement of the HDD and memory issue. Can you sort of bridge out from the 19 and now you are kind of talking of 17. If I take the middle of the range, what are the factors that are going into the reduced gross margin guidance and sort of the rank the factors that are contributing to that? Thank you.
Charles Liang: Yes. I guess the competition is getting stronger if I compare with three years ago, four years ago, so we already understand that. However, our product mix is getting stronger like the MicroCloud, and especially storage, GPU. Also, our purchasing, bargain power is getting stronger too together with our service value and operation with lower cost from Asia. And that's why in next 18 months, we believe 17% can be a reasonable number.
Glenn Hanus - Needham: And, the 300-basis point improvement. How should we think about that relative to what you've said in the past there?
Howard Hideshima: Glenn, this is Howard. Like I said, some of it come back and we are still working with our customers, our providers to get that back and so basically we pull that from the model, per se, in the form of basically just a negotiating with our vendors and put that as improving our purchasing power and our Taiwan facility.
Glenn Hanus - Needham: Okay. Can you give us any color here sort of sequentially in gross margins? You showed a little improvement this quarter. Would we see sort of a similar improvement next quarter or might we see a greater improvement and what are the factors that are kind of really driving your sequential gross margin improvement or like thereof right now?
Howard Hideshima: Yes. With regard to the June quarter, you'll find seasonally a strong quarter, so coming out of this March quarter, which is seasonally weak, you see a lot of competition happening for a smaller pie, so that maybe put some pressure on margins, or we did pretty well with that. Also, again, our product mix hurt us a bit this past quarter in March, and so as we go into the June quarter, hopefully we'll see that come back a little bit more towards our full service solution, so those positive. Yes?
Glenn Hanus - Needham: Okay. And then typically you have a pretty healthy uptick in OpEx in the June quarter. You have to in order to in order to get to your guidance there, so can you go through that?
Howard Hideshima: Generally, actually, we're being very prudent with our operating expenses going forward as far as we are making the strategic investments that we need to as Charles alluded to on new products and canalization, but we are going to be keeping a tight handle on it. We've invest a lot of over last year or two.
Glenn Hanus - Needham: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). It appears at this time, we have no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Liang for any additional or closing comments.
Charles Liang: Thank you for joining us today and we look forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you, everyone. Have a great day. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude Super Micro third quarter fiscal 2013 conference call. We do appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you.

Charles Liang: Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to slide four. First, let me provide you with the highlights of our second quarter. We are pleased that our second quarter revenue was $291.5 million, its 7.7% higher quarter-over-quarter and 16.6% higher year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $7.8 million or 156.5% higher quarter-over-quarter and 29.9% lower compared to last year. Super Micro’s non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.18 per diluted share, compared to $0.07 last quarter and $0.25 last year. Slide five please. Revenue for the quarter was up 16.6% from last year and was a record high for Super Micro. We are pleased with this growth in sales when overall IT spending continued to be a cautious. With this performance we continue to demonstrate our ability to take market share even during uncertain economical times. Last quarter’s margins improved quarter-over-quarter. However, we still see opportunity for further improvement. Although, our recent (inaudible) pricing change continued last quarter in hard disk drive. We saw the market for hard disk drive and memory modules stabilized for the most part. However, because we had record high storage revenue which contained lower margin mix with hard disk drives. Our storage margins were lower than average server margins. As it turned out the overall margin for our storage solution still improved quarter-over-quarter, with the component source and price stability in place, we expect our margin performance to further improve in future quarters. Geographically, revenue in North America was 537%, Europe was 23% and Asia was 20.7% of total sales. Asia remains our fastest growing region and our Taiwan facility continues to run steadily to meet our growth for the Asian market. Now Asia revenue gross was 34% over last year, mostly due to high quality products produced from our state-of-the-art equipment at our facility in Taiwan. We continued to instill confidence in our customers and focus on growing our share in dynamical region where different product strategies have been employed on a country-by-country basis. Last quarter, 45% of our business came from OEM and direct customers, of Which Internet Datacenter were 14.2% of sales. Our computer service systems contribute 43.3% of revenue, where we saw our strongest quarter-over-quarter growth among product lines such as FatTwin, MicroCloud Storage and GPU. We had experienced a strong customer demand since the FatTwin launch. Customers prefer our efficient power consumption, storage capacity and computer intensity over a competition. The inventory turnover rate for FatTwin have been the highest due to the popularity. On the year-over-year comparison, our storage product also shows strong growth due to the other ability of hard disk drive compared to last year. MicroCloud has grown strongly since its launch last year and had become one of the biggest product line in only one year. Also GPU Solution continues to show solid growth along with development of new technologies. Overall, our brand reputation for innovation is greatly helping us and continues our trend of taking much share. Let me show -- let me now update you with more details on our new and leading technologies. Slide six and seven please. Now, recently launch of FatTwin marks a big new milestone in our five-year history. It further improves system power savings up to 16% when compared with other similar platforms from major competitors, optimize for various applications with features such as 3.5 inch hard swappable hard drive per 1U or 3GPU or core processors per 1U. More recently the Hadoop optimized the FatTwin features up to 12HS 3.5 inch hard driver in one user base designed basically for Hadoop cloud applications. FatTwin’s high efficiency, high effective shared cooling subsystem and power supply architecture allows the FatTwin to operate at a higher ambient temperatures, free air cooling environment, up to 47 degrees C, providing huge energy cost to the saving and improved TCO, total cost of ownership. Our new MicroCloud server, 3U 12, hot pluggable nodes had been shipped in volume for customers. It’s a perfect solution for high density and power process sensitive Datacenter environment, along with our order generation, a, hot pluggable node versions that MicroCloud product family now supports the latest Intel and AMD processors. It had benefit many customers in cloud computing, web hosting and IP Datacenter segment. Our brand new storage A47B product line, one of our big data optimized solutions introduced highly innovative way to increase system storage capacity to support up to 72 external hard swappable 3.5-inch hard drive in 4U space. High efficiency with some design and optional battery backup power unit, the system specification is not just second to none but eject rate 20% higher in storage density compelled to competition. The product is currently in simple stage and we had received a very positive commitment from our customers. Our HPC optimized products provide extreme performance in competition and graphic intensive applications. That is the system offering optimized to support us, that is, NVIDIA Kepler K10 and K20 GPU and Intel Xeon-Phi co-processors. Our new high full speed product line featured in Turbo boost with optimal left hand, global packing capability is optimized for HFT, high frequency trading, high-performance EDA and high end gaming. BBP, battery backup power module supports brand new Datacenter power supply design concepts in more than Datacenter. It can be used to depress traditional, expensive and inefficient that UPS in a way of putting high efficiency UPS into its system enclosure. It’s in unconventional and yet highly efficient and closely effective way of protecting data and operation investment. Super Micro Datacenter Management, SDCM short way of course, including in-band and out-band BIOS firmware and software update and system monitoring utility serving several large corporate Datacenters. These software features and supportive abilities have been helping the sales of our hardware computer solutions to these direct accounts. They have also been supporting our channel partners to be more competitive by providing more computer system management solutions to their customers. Last product, complete rack solutions include high-performance, high-density servers, high-capacity storage, high-performance switch and our Datacenter management software, both designed and supplied by Super Micro. Recently, we expand our solutions by introducing the Hadoop SuperRack for cloud computing and the GPU SuperRack for HPC applications. They are actually cost effective, flexible to scale and among half is the choice for many enterprise customers. In summary, in second quarter, Super Micro achieved record revenue at top end of our expectations. With our strong foundation in place, we again demonstrate our ability to gain market share even during uncertain economical times. The challenge for Super Micro is to grow even stronger and faster this year and our people are excited of our opportunities. Our brand and reputation is built on having a product line that are basically in the world in performance per watt, per dollars and per square foot. With this strong product and our dedication to build the base, we are prepared to seize the opportunities for growth and profitability. For more specifics on the second quarter, let me turn it over to Howard.
Howard Hideshima: Thank you, Charles and good afternoon everyone. I will focus my remarks on earnings, gross margins, operating expenses and similar items on a non-GAAP basis which reflects the adjustments to exclude compensation expenses. Reconciliation of GAAP-to-non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company in today’s earnings release and in the supplemental detail in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Let me begin with the review of the second quarter income statement. Please turn to slide eight. Revenue was the record $291.5 million, up 17% from the same quarter a year ago and up 8% sequentially. The increase in revenue from last year was primarily due to strong growth in MicroCloud, Storage and GPU. The sequential increase in revenue from last quarter was primarily due to seasonal strength in the industry and a growth of some of our innovative product line, offset in part by concerns about our economy. On a percentage basis, MicroCloud and Storage were the fastest growing product lines from the prior quarter. MicroCloud has been a great product for the internet Datacenter with the density and power efficiency. Storage has been away from the stabilization of hard-disk drive pricing and availability. We continue to see good ramp in the Sandy Bridge products, with an increase of 64% sequentially. Slide nine, turning to product mix, the portion of revenues from server systems was 43.3% of total revenues, which is down from 44%, the same quarter a year ago and an increase from 39.5% last quarter. ASP for servers was $2,100 per unit, which is up from $1,800 last year and $3,000 last quarter. We shipped approximately 60,000 servers in the second quarter and 1,086,000 subsystems and accessories. The increase in the server unit is also in part from an increase in our internet Datacenter business. We continue to maintain a diverse revenue base with over 600 customers and none of these customers representing more than 10% of our quarterly revenues. Internet Datacenter revenue was 14.2%, which was an increase from 8.8% in the prior quarter. Further more, 53.7% of our revenues came from the U.S. and 55% from our distributors and resellers. During the quarter, we saw strength in the U.S., which offset some of the weakness in Asia while Europe remained about the same on a percentage basis. As we ramp our Taiwan facility and leverage its cost benefits, we are confident that we can continue to expand our presence in Asia. Slide 10 and 11, non-GAAP gross profit was $40.3 million, down 6% from $42.8 million in the same quarter last year and up 14% from $35.3 million sequentially. Our percentage basis gross margin was 15.8%, down from 17.1% a year ago and up from 13% sequentially. Price changes from Ablecom resulted in eight basis points favorable change to gross profit in the quarter. The total purchases representing approximately 15.4% of total cost of good sold compared to 18.5% a year ago and 20.9% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease in gross margin results from price changes in hard disk drives and memory in the current quarter compared to the prior year. December 2011 was right after the October floods in Thailand, which has caused volatility in pricing and supply of hard disk drives over the past year. Sequentially, gross margins were up almost entirely due to the more stable pricing of hard disk drive offset impart by higher mix of storage products. In general, all other product margins remained stable. Slide 12, operating expenses were $29.8 million, up from $26.6 million in the same quarter a year ago and down from $30.7 million sequentially. As the percentage of revenues, operating expense was 10.2% down from 10.6% year-over-year and 11.3% sequentially. Operating expenses were higher on an absolute dollar basis year-over-year and down sequentially. We saw a year-over-year increases in absolute dollars, primarily in R&D as we invest in headcounts to drive our innovation on product portfolio especially in preparation for Romley and FatTwin launches. Sequentially, operating expenses were down. Reductions in marketing and sales expenses associated with the write-off of marketing materials of about $590,000 in the prior quarter. General and administrative expenses were lower due to lower legal expenses and settlement of patent control case of about $700,000 in the prior quarter. The company’s headcount increased by 34 sequentially to 1,561 total employees. We continue to control our operating expense while still making strategic investments in our product lines. Operating profit was $10.5 million or 3.6% of revenues, down from $5.7 million or $16.2 million a year ago and up by $5.9 million from $4.6 million sequentially. Net income was $7.8 million or 2.7% of revenues, down from $3.3 million from $11.2 million a year ago and up $4.8 million from $3.1 million sequentially. Our non-GAAP fully diluted EPS was $0.18 per share, down from $0.25 per share a year ago and up from $0.07 per share sequentially. The number of fully diluted shares used in the first quarter was 43,666,000. The tax rate in the second quarter on a non-GAAP basis was 24.5% compared to 30.5% a year ago and 31.3% sequentially. The rate was lower due to the release of liability for Texas and contributed about $0.02 to our EPS. We expect the effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis to be approximately 6% for the March quarter, which is down from 26.6% in the same quarter last year. The decrease in tax rate is due to the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit which passed in January 2013. The effect was about 19% reduction to what we would expect our tax rate would be with R&D credits without catch-up for prior periods. Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis, slide 13. Cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term investments were $91.1 million, up from $29.8 -- $61.3 million in the prior quarter and down $15 million from a $106.1 in the same quarter last year. In the second quarter, free cash flow was a positive $30.3 million primarily due to reduction in inventory. Slide 14. Accounts receivable increased by $6.1 million to $118.9 million and DSOs was 37 days, which is the same as the prior quarter. Inventories decreased by $19.6 million, to $243.6 million with days in inventories decreasing by 12 days to 93 days. The decrease in inventory was primarily due to reductions of our component inventory such as memory, CPU and hard disk drive. We continue to strengthen our infrastructure in this area to improvement our management of our inventory as well as improve our vendor relationships. Accounts payable decreased by $9.4 million, increased by $9.4 million to $149.4 million, for the days payables outstanding deceasing by eight days to 53 days primarily due to the timing of payments to vendors. Overall cash conversion cycle days were 77 days, a decrease of 4 days from 81 days in the prior quarter. Now for a few comments on our outlook. As indicated previously, during the second quarter, we continue to see the ramp in our Sandy Bridge product as well as very good interest across our product lines. Hard disk drives have stabilized and we expect this to continue to improve. March is typically a seasonally weak quarter for the industry, however with the growth of our FatTwin storage and MicroCloud as well as our continued ramp of Sandy Bridge, we feel some strength to offset some of the seasonal weakness. Therefore the company currently expects net sales for the quarter ending March 31, 2013 in the range of $275 million to $395 million. Assuming this revenue range, the company expects non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.17 to $0.21 for the quarter. Excluding the tax benefit for the R&D credit mentioned above and using a 25% tax rate, the earnings per diluted share would be approximately $0.14 to $0.18. It is currently expected that the outlook will not be updated until the release of the company’s next quarterly earnings announcement, notwithstanding subsequent developments however, the company may update the outlook or any portion thereof at any time. With that, let me turn it back to Charles for some closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Howard. Super Micro is focused on increasing market share by leveraging our strong advantage of brand recognition for basically in cards product and innovation. Our growth story remains intact. Our people are committed to succeed and our opportunities remain as great as ever. Operator, at this time we are ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we’ll go first to Aaron Rakers of Stifel Nicolaus.
Aaron Rakers: Yeah. Thanks guys for taking the question. So, first, I want to make sure I heard you right, 6% tax rate in this March quarter. If you look at that over the trailing -- the apply trailing three quarters then that would be about 19%. What’s the tax rate are you assuming on the forward basis as we think about June and beyond that?
Howard Hideshima: Yeah. Aaron, this is Howard. As I mentioned, it’s not 19%, if we didn’t have the catch-up it would be about the 19% difference, so assumably we’ve about 25%...
Aaron Rakers: 25% of the rate, okay.
Howard Hideshima: …rate, yeah.
Aaron Rakers: And so underneath of that one, when we look at, assuming that you continued to maintain your OpEx discipline that you’ve been doing, are you assuming what looks to be like a 14.5% gross margin? And I think, if that’s true, how are we to think about, what’s been talked about as being a 350 basis points overhang from the hard disk drive and memory pricing, that seems to be lifting here, when you recapture or rather when you get backup into that 16% gross margin range?
Howard Hideshima: Yeah. Aaron, this is Howard. I’d like to say, we’re still working our way. We still believe that there is more to be had there as you back in time. Again, we’re not all the way there yet. We -- the majority of this quarter’s margin improvement was from the hard disk drive. We see that continue to stabilize and hopefully that will continue to improve. So an opportunity is there for us to increase. Along with that for this quarter, again this is a fairly soft quarter from a seasonal basis. So if you look back historically you’ll see that there has been pressure in our margins between December and March, so we’ve put in some of that into our forecast for this quarter.
Aaron Rakers: So taken that what you just said the 80 basis points sequential improvement is pretty much all hard disk drive related, was there no benefit that we saw from the mix shift between the segments?
Howard Hideshima: Well, I think you saw, the mix shift primarily come, as we mentioned, some of that was in storage, which typically has a high content of hard disk drives. In addition to that we are Internet Datacenter which is usually the most competitive area of the business was also up in the quarter.
Aaron Rakers: Okay. Final question and I’ll exit the floor, Taiwanese facility, what’s the utilization rate right now.
Charles Liang: Yeah. I mean, our Taiwan facility continue in improving mode. So we had much stronger sales team, supporting team there now and we see that improving trend is there. So it will be quarter-by-quarter getting better.
Operator: And next up from Dougherty & Company, Mark Kelleher.
Mark Kelleher: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just have a few numbers questions. The -- could you give out the storage as percent of revenue?
Howard Hideshima: No. We can’t Mark. It’s still less than 10% of our revenues.
Mark Kelleher: Okay. And of the server sales, sorry, there is something going on on the line…
Howard Hideshima: Okay.
Mark Kelleher: Yeah. I’m still here. Sandy Bridge as a percent of the server sales?
Howard Hideshima: As a percent of our overall sales we’re probably at about 27% overall.
Mark Kelleher: Okay.
Howard Hideshima: Overall revenue.
Mark Kelleher: Okay. Can you give that in server sales or is that too fine?
Howard Hideshima: We -- no, we haven’t broken it out separately. We gave out previously about what it would be in total.
Mark Kelleher: All right. And free cash flow in the quarter?
Howard Hideshima: Free cash flow in the quarter was 30…
Mark Kelleher: $30 million.
Howard Hideshima: … yeah, $30, I think it was $30.3 million.
Mark Kelleher: Okay. That’s all I got. Thanks.
Howard Hideshima: Yeah.
Operator: And moving on to Glenn Hanus of Needham
Glenn Hanus: Good afternoon, guys. Well, could you start kind of high level a little bit on the demand environment you feel you’re seeing now U.S., EMEA, APAC. You mentioned, APAC being a little soft this quarter. Can you give some more color around the demand environment you’re seeing for the March quarter and June?
Charles Liang: We still believe our Asia market, we are picking up stably, I mean, in March and June, because now our facility is there and our sales team, support team have been much stronger than before. So we have a pretty strong confidence there.
Glenn Hanus: How is the U.S. market looking?
Charles Liang: USA market I believe we are improving as well, especially we start to spend more in East Coast and kind of Texas, Chicago area. So we feel at this -- in those new territories we will have a stable again.
Glenn Hanus: And Europe?
Charles Liang: Europe kind of also consistently growing, we have facility there for system integration and supporting function since about two years ago now. So facility has been very mature and people have been well-trained. So I believe we’ll be continue stably growing in Europe as well.
Glenn Hanus: And then in terms of your overall financial model of getting to 19% gross margin, 9% operating margin a low end to the range, I think you’ve talked about -- around the end of the year you talked about a one year timeframe to get to that? How are you feeling now about? It’s sound like a pretty aggressive goal but how are you feeling about those numbers for, by the end of 2013?
Howard Hideshima: Yeah. Glenn, we still have lots of opportunities as we talked about before to do that. We’ve looked at basically increasing our scale, obviously stabilization of hard disk drives, Taiwan facility, increasing our content of software and services as part of it. However, we probably will look at with some of this maybe pushing out a quarter, so we’ve said before that’s been calendar end of year we may push out a quarter.
Glenn Hanus: Okay. Just moving on to the operating expenses a little bit, could you go through some, again, some of the, you mentioned a write-off in the lower legal expenses, could you just kind of go through the OpEx and it seem to come down quite a bit sequentially and then for the March quarter, how should we think about OpEx?
Howard Hideshima: Yeah. We had some unusual items, I think if you want to call those in the September period with regards to product promotions as we launched the FatTwin and Sandy Bridge and what have you, those didn’t reoccur in the December quarter. We’ll probably have a little bit more expenses with regards to [CBID] and some trade shows that we’ll have during the March quarter here. However, in general, we’ll still keep a tight handle on our op expenses, so we won’t see a large increase in there.
Charles Liang: Yeah. Especially last two and half years, we have almost, I believe growth 60% of our engineering headcount, so now people are watching and we try not to hire too many people in the coming quarters.
Glenn Hanus: Okay. And on the storage side, could you give a little more color like what vertical perhaps that you are seeing traction on the storage side and how your kind of positioning and differentiating on the storage side where you really getting some interaction? Thank you.
Charles Liang: Cloud and Cloud application and Big Data, especially recently we just announced our Big Data optimizing system the 4U storage with 72 hard drive, all had swappable silicon range supported, that kind of density for sure basically in the world and I would say at least 20% higher density than any competitor. So those strong products now which we have grow our market share in storage, including effecting 1U (inaudible) hard drive also not competition in the market. So we have a very strong confidence on storages.
Glenn Hanus: Thank you.
Charles Liang: Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll move next to Alex Kurtz of Sterne, Agee.
Alex Kurtz: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question guys. Just a couple of clarifications, Howard, just when you were talking Aaron, you said 6% non-GAAP for tax rate for this quarter -- for March quarter?
Howard Hideshima: That is correct.
Alex Kurtz: And then roughly 25% sort of go-forward type of framework around tax rate?
Howard Hideshima: Yeah. Take that for the fiscal year for sure, for this fiscal year, we’ll have to review next, but for this fiscal year its looks better that way with R&D credit we have stated.
Alex Kurtz: You see I think the out year to be higher than that or too hard to tell at this point?
Howard Hideshima: Look, it will be a little bit hard to tell at this point, again tax credits only be extended for two years, which means it’s only half of our fiscal year, so we still need to do more work in that area.
Alex Kurtz: Okay. In your presentation, Howard, I missed the number of components, can you reiterate that?
Howard Hideshima: Sure. $1,086,000 subsystems and accessories...
Alex Kurtz: $1 million, okay. Howard, could you just take us through the last year, about all the different, there is no lot of moving pieces on the gross margin, obviously and it will be helpful if you could just recant where the major headwinds have been and I -- and sort of maybe categorized them by weighing them on things -- certain things being bigger than others. I known, obviously, this quarter having the big Internet Datacentre was really -- was probably a headwind, but if you can sort of help us around the impact versus last year that would be great?
Howard Hideshima: Yeah. So, I mean, I guess, if you want to look back during the last year, I think the biggest think we can talk about and those people who understood is basically the hard disk drives and memory have been the largest impact to our gross margin over the past year. And this past quarter we did start seeing stabilization of that and that’s where we saw some of the recapturing of our -- of gross margin, probably low point in the last the September quarter. And as that continues to stabilize further as we go forward, I think we believe we’ll see additional benefits coming from there. With regards to the…
Alex Kurtz: Yeah.
Howard Hideshima: I’m sorry…
Alex Kurtz: No. Go ahead.
Howard Hideshima: The Internet Datacentre was higher, this period of time it was about 14.8% I think and that’s comparable to about 8% in the prior year. So, again, as you know that is probably the most competitive area in our midst just that we participated, so again, it puts a little pressure on our margins. And then historic -- go ahead.
Alex Kurtz: Yeah. So, just last for me, Howard, getting back to Glenn’s question about getting back to that 17% or 18%, is that still in the cards, is all of that just coming back from the hard disk drive and memory component issues, or there other things have to go right to get back to say 17% just as a bogey?
Charles Liang: Yeah. The question is that, I mean, like what we share, I think, many years ago. We had spend lots of effort in switch especially Datacenter optimizing switch and software -- management software, as well as customer service. So these are the three areas, I mean, we will have a much higher margin and we have been investing in this area for many years and we start to have some income from three areas, switch, software and service.
Alex Kurtz: So, were you saying, Charles, is that, you think product mix along with the HDD market coming back is going to help you get back to say 17% range?
Charles Liang: Yeah. Kind of switch, yeah, every switch vendor has much bigger margin, right. Management software for sure, we invest in this area for almost 12 years and now we start, we have some income from our management software. Service, customer service on side which also good margin business. And we also invest in this area for many years and now start to see some income.
Alex Kurtz: Thank you, guys.
Howard Hideshima: Yeah. Thank you.
Operator: (Operator instructions) And we’ll go to Jeff Andry of Wunderlich Securities.
Jeff Andry: Hey guys. This is Jeff in for Brian. Thanks for taking the questions. Can you talk about what kind of HDD and memory pricing assumptions, you’re baking in the guidance and then also you mentioned you continue to better manage inventory and improve relationship with suppliers. Can you talk a little bit about what steps you’ve take in that regard. Thank you?
Howard Hideshima: Yeah. Of course, over the past year, we’ve increased our personnel with regards to managing our components inventory and all -- basically in memory and hard disk drive and other parts of our business. So again we put more emphasis -- and more infrastructure there and that’s part of the investment that Charles has talked about in investing in our infrastructure to basically improve how we manage our inventory and also how we build relationships, straighten those relationship with our vendors and that’s hopefully going to pay dividends for us as we go forward. With regards to the other part -- can you repeat your other question please?
Jeff Andry: Yeah. I was just wondering what kind of HDD and memory pricing assumption you’re baking in your guidance, just kind of taken the midpoint of the guidance figures. It looks like about a 20 basis point sequential increase in profit margins. So I was wondering what kind of assumptions, you’re kind of baking into that guidance?
Charles Liang: I guess, when we continue to move more complete system, especially storage that into 20, 40 or even 70 to hard drive (inaudible). However, a good thing is, we start to add bed you like to management sort of way that service barrier, so those will help us on the positive side. So that is what, how they may postpone one quarter but now original we use model, financial model, it should be spread in.
Jeff Andry: Great.
Operator: There appear to be no further questions. I’d like to turn things back over to management for any closing or additional remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you for joining us today. And we look forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you everyone. Have a great day.
Operator: And again, that’s concludes your conference. Thank you all for joining.

Charles Liang: Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to slide 4. First let me provide you with the highlights of our first quarter. Our first quarter revenue was $270.7 million, which is 9.2% higher year-over-year and 1.9% lower quarter-over-quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $3.1 million or 62.4% lower quarter-over-quarter and 70.9% lower compared to last year. Super Micro's non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.07 per diluted share compared to $0.18 last quarter or $0.24 last year.
 Slide 5 please. We are pleased that the revenue for quarter was up 7.2% from last year and down only slightly from our record last quarter despite the challenges from a weaker global economy. The demand environment was slower as customer were more cautious about IT spending. While there are IT projects in the prelim stage customer are delaying purchasing decisions until they have better visibility into the direction of macro economy.
 Given this environment our performance in this quarter indicates that our fundamental business model of offering the most innovative application optimized server and storage solutions remains popular in the market. More importantly, it allow us to continue to grow market share.
 Last quarter the margin was mainly affected by the significant drop in components pricing of hard disk drive and memory. With the slow economy, economy and supply imbalance price fail so the market look to low excess inventory at a lower cost. Although, we delivered near record high quantity of hard drive and memory bundled with our systems solutions, they are the key factors that negatively impact our net profit.
 We are focusing manpower on improving management of both our inventory as well as the component supply to react better to market condition. Let's review our revenue distribution of our business first -- our last quarter. Our server systems contributed 39.5% while 45.3% of our business last quarter came from OEMs and direct customers of which Internet data center was 8.8% of sales.
 Geographically, revenue in North America was 49.8%, Europe was 23.4% and Asia was 23.9%, which was a record high and 65% growth from that same quarter last year. Our Asia facility have a healthy bump in productivity, reflecting the much higher sales in Asia last quarter.
 Whenever it is appropriate from a logistic and service perspective we will leverage as much resource as we can from our Asia facility. Given the global economic conditions, our Asia facility will become even more important in our goal to improve our operational efficiency and cost.
 Last quarter's Sandy Bridge sales represent 44% of our Intel based processors, up 84% from the previous quarters, although the ramp of Sandy Bridge based solutions is lower than we anticipated, due in large part to the holdup in the broader economy. Innovative product such as our GPU products, and MicroCloud moving at a greater pace. That means our customers continue to look for great technology to go with the new processors.
 We do expect that in longer term the market will respond in volume to the benefit of our new platform’s performance and energy savings and advantages. As I have mentioned briefly, our GPU solutions and MicroCloud are the top performers of last quarter, especially for GPU, Super Micro continue to have the most comprehensive GPU product line in the industry.
 Our recent update include a Kepler K10 GPU support. This single precision calculation optimized solutions are ideal for application in medical, seismic, oil and gas, military and media fields. The upcoming K20 and Xeon-Phi solutions will further extend our leadership in scientific and other HPC computing.
 Last but most importantly, our Fat Twin product line began formal production successfully at the very end of our September quarter and the demand has been growing strongly. Recently in the head-to-head industry standard benchmark test [indiscernible], our Fat Twin outperformed -- beating competitors’ twin systems in power saving by 16%. This level of power saving and performance will make the Fat Twin a strong choice among data centers, cloud infrastructure, HPC environment and Hadoop applications in the coming quarters and years.
 Let me now update you with more details on our new and leading technologies. Slide 6 and 7 please. The recently launched Fat Twin marks a big new milestone in our 5 years of twin architecture. It improves systems power savings up to 16% when compared with other similar platforms of major competitors. The 4U Fat Twin architecture is available in high-density supporting 8, 4 or 2 hot-pluggable system nodes combinations with a choice of memory capacity, hard disk drive type and basically up to 3 GPU per 1U, AC/DC or battery back-up power modules, front or rear I/O, networking options and more.
 Its high-efficiency highly effective shared cooling and power supply architecture allow Fat Twin to operate in high ambient temperatures and free air cooling environment up to 47 degrees C, providing huge energy savings and improved TCO, total cost of ownership.
 Our GPU optimized product line in 1U, 2U, 3U, 4U M-blade performance, provide extreme performance and 
 [Audio Gap] 
 EDA and oil and gas applications.
 Our BBP, battery back-up power module, support brand new data center power supply designs concepts. In modern data centers, it can be used to replace traditional expensive and inefficient UPS in a way of putting high efficiency UPS into each system enclosure. It is an unconventional and yet higher efficiency way of protecting data and investment.
 Super Micros data center management, software SDCM tools, included in-pen and out-pen BIOS from ware and software updates and monitoring futility have been serving several large operated data centers. This is software features and supported capability have helped the sales of our hardware, as the solutions to this direct accounts. They have also been supporting our channel partners to be more competitive by providing a complete system management all the way up to their customers.
 Finally, our complete rack solution include a high-performance, high-density server, high-capacity storage, high-performance reach and our data center managements all the way up, both designed and supplied by Super Micro. We recently extend our solutions by introducing the Hadoop SuperRack solution for cloud computing and the GPU SuperRack solution for HPC customers. They are actually cost effective for neck support to scale and among the happiest choice for many enterprise customers. We are expecting that continuing growth of our complete rack solution business.
 In summary, in the first quarter Super Micro achieved healthy sales and gain market share during a weak economic period. Although our margins suffered due to a steep decline in pricing for hard disk drive and memory last quarter, we are working to improve the situation with the strong focus on defining management of our components business in terms of inventory and cost. We feel that we can return to stronger profitability as our management of components improved and market stability is reached.
 For more specifics on the first quarter let me turn it over to Howard. 
Howard Hideshima: Thank you, Charles, and good afternoon, everyone. I will focus my remarks on earnings, gross margins, operating expenses and similar items on a non-GAAP basis which reflect adjustments to exclude stock-compensation expense. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company in today's earnings release and in the supplemental detail in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call.
 Let me begin with the review of the first quarter's income statement. Please turn to slide number 8. Revenue was $270.7 million up 9.2% from the same quarter a year ago and down 1.9% sequentially. The increase in revenues from last year was primarily due to subsystems and accessories as well as a ramp of the Sandy Bridge solutions.
 The sequential decrease in revenue from last quarter was primarily due to seasonal weakness in the industry, concerns about the economy and the transition to Sandy Bridge at the end of the quarter. On a percentage basis MicroCloud and GPU were the fastest growing product lines from the prior quarter. We also saw a good ramp in Sandy Bridge products with an increase of 84% sequentially of Intel based revenue.
 Turning to product mix, the proportion of revenues from server systems was 39.5% of total revenues, which was comparable to the same quarter a year ago and a decrease from 44.6% last quarter. ASPs for servers was $2,000 per unit which is up from $1,700 last year and the same as $2,000 last quarter. We shipped approximately 55,000 servers in the first quarter and 1,036,000 subsystems and accessories. The decrease in server units resulted in part from some of our data center customers’ delay in transitioning to Sandy Bridge solutions.
 We continue to maintain a diverse revenue base with over 600 customers and none of these customers representing more than 10% of our quarterly revenues. And our data center revenue was 8.8% which was a decrease from 15.2% in the prior quarter.
 Furthermore, 49.8% of our revenues came from the U.S. and 54.7% from our distributors and resellers. During the quarter we saw strength in Asia which was offset some weakness in the U.S. while Europe remained about the same on a percentage basis. As we ramp our Taiwan facility and leverage its cost benefits we are confident that we can continue to expand our presence in Asia.
 Slide 10 and 11. Non-GAAP gross profit was $35.3 million down 11.5% from $39.8 million in the same quarter last year and down 17.3% from $42.6 million sequentially. On a percentage basis gross margin was 13% down from 16.1% a year ago and from 15.5% sequentially. Price changes from Ablecom resulted in no change to gross profit in the quarter with total purchases representing approximately 20.9% of total cost of goods sold compared to 18% a year ago and 22.6% sequentially.
 The year-over-year decrease in gross margins resulted from price changes in hard disk drives and memory in the current quarter when compared to the prior year. September 2011 was right before the October flood in Thailand which cause of all tilting and [ph] pricing and supply of hard disk drives over the past year.
 Sequentially, gross margin was down almost entirely due to pricing of hard disk drives and memory. Over 2% of the margin decrease was attributable to hard disk drive and memory pricing. The suppliers reducing cost to acquire hard disk drives and memory which require the cost down of inventory as well as customers reducing their prices to sell their inventory when there is an oversupply of these components put pressure on margins.
 This month the hard disk drives and memory margins have stabilized and industry reports indicate that vendors are taking actions to stabilize pricing supply but it is early in the quarter and we are tempered our forecast. Our product, our other product margins during the quarter were stable or increased.
 Slide 12. Operating expenses were $30.7 million up from $24 million in the same quarter a year ago and comparable to $30.6 million sequentially. As a percentage of revenue, operating expense was 11.3% up from 9.7% a year ago and 11.1% sequentially. Operating expenses were higher on an absolute dollar basis, year-over-year.
 We saw a year-over-year increases in absolute dollars primarily in R&D as we invested in headcount to drive our innovation on product portfolio especially in preparation for Romley and Fat Twin launches. Sequentially, operating expenses were about the same; annual salary increases were offset by reductions in development expenses associated with the launch of Sandy Bridge and our Fat Twin last quarter.
 Marketing and sale expenses were higher due to write-offs of marketing materials of about $590,000. General and administrative expenses were lower due to lower audit and tax expenses associated with our fiscal yearend audit in the prior quarter.
 The company's headcount increased by 24 sequentially to 1,527 total employees. Operating profit was $4.6 million or 1.7% of revenues down from $11.3 million or 15.8% a year ago and down $7.4 million from $12 million sequentially. Net income was $3.1 million or 1.1% of revenues, down $7.4 million from $10.5 million a year ago and down $5.1 million from $8.1 million sequentially.
 Our non-GAAP fully diluted EPS was $0.07 per share, down from $0.24 a share a year ago and down from $0.18 per share sequentially. The number of fully diluted shares used in the first quarter was 44,638,000.
 The tax rate in the first quarter on a non-GAAP basis was 31.3% compared to 33.1% a year ago and 31.6% sequentially. We expect the effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis to be approximately 32% for the December quarter which is comparable to the 30.5% in the same quarter of last year.
 Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis, slide 13. Cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term investments were $61.3 million, down from $83.3 million in the prior quarter and from $96 million in the same quarter last year. In the first quarter, free cash flow was a negative $27.5 million. The net change in cash was negative $22.5 million for the quarter due to payment of accounts payable associated with the prior increase in inventory.
 Slide 14. Accounts receivable increased by $10.8 million to $112.8 million and DSOs was 37 days, an increase of 3 days from the prior quarter. Inventories decreased by $13.4 million, to $263.2 million with days in inventories increasing by 5 days to 105 days. The decrease in inventory was due in part to reduction of our HDD, hard disk drive inventory.
 Accounts payable decreased by $39.9 million, to $140.1 million, but the days payables outstanding deceasing by one day to 61 days primarily due to the timing of payments to vendors. Overall cash conversion cycle days were 81 days, an increase of 9 days from 72 days in the prior quarter.
 Now for a few comments on outlook. As indicated previously, during the first quarter, we continue to see the ramp in our Sandy Bridge product line as well as very good interest in our Fat Twin products. Asia continues to remain strong for us and we continue to ramp our Taiwan facility. In addition HDD and memories have stabilized a bit but there may be some pressure on our margin should this not continue to hold.
 December is typically a seasonally strong quarter for the industry, however we have tempered our guidance based on the slowness at the end of last quarter and the general weakness in the economy, therefore the company currently expects net sales for the quarter ending December 31, 2012 in a range of $270 million to $295 million. Assuming this revenue range, the company expects non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.12 to $0.16 for the quarter. It is currently expected that the outlook will not be updated until the release of the company's next quarterly earnings announcement, notwithstanding subsequent developments, however, the company may update the outlook or any portion thereof at any time.
 With that, let me turn it back to Charles for some closing remarks. 
Charles Liang: Thank you, Howard. As Super Micro is coming to continue its growth pace even during the economically slow period, our competitive position with the industry's best of product especially with Fat Twin architecture have never been better. Our Asia facility will continue to be utilized at a greater degree to serve our Asian and European customers while improving our competitiveness in pricing.
 We are also committed to increase our profitability through better and more comprehensive customers and technical service, its hardware solutions and components management.
 Operator, at this time we are ready for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Aaron Rakers with Stifel, Nicolaus. 
Aaron Rakers: Howard, I want to understand a little bit better the discussion on the hard disk drive impact as well as memory impact on the gross margin. Correct me, I think you said 2/3 of the gross margin delta in the quarter was attributable to this, is that correct and therefore equating to about 165 basis points or is your guidance assuming with the pricing stabilizing that, that comes back into the model, how are you thinking about gross margin in that context in this current quarter? 
Howard Hideshima: Aaron, yes. I said in the call that basically -- you saw the decrease in margin of about 2.5% between quarters from 15.5% to about 13%. I said about 2% of that or over 2% of that was attributable to the hard disk drives and memory but not 2/3 but 2%. 
Aaron Rakers: 2 percentage points? 
Howard Hideshima: Yes. 
Aaron Rakers: Okay. And your assumption that therefore you're implying that your gross margin this quarter given that that's stabilized now that you've been able to possibly readjust those pricing with your suppliers that you're assuming that we get back to a 15% level in the current quarter? 
Howard Hideshima: I have not -- I've said that our current month it looks stable right now. So it looks stable. However it's really early in the quarter. Aaron, so we’ve tempered our forecast with some of that. Because again if price decreases happen again and again, we're still susceptible to that in our inventories. If price is maintained stable, we're going to be okay and then if prices go up, we may see some benefits. So again it's very early in the quarter. We're seeing stability right now but again it's very early in the quarter. 
Aaron Rakers: Yes, I hate to come back to it but stable in your model -- would stable mean that, that gross margin impact last quarter comes back to you? 
Howard Hideshima: In a way, yes but again we've tempered it in our forecast. 
Aaron Rakers: Okay, and then the follow-up question, just remind us again your situation as far as the hard disk drive supply agreement, where does that stand? I think last quarter it was $223 million. Where does that stand currently? Maybe you can give us some color on how we should think about that in the context of pricing with those suppliers? 
Howard Hideshima: Yes, right now at the end of the quarter, it stands at about $180 million. And there's a 2-year agreement that runs through March 2014. 
Aaron Rakers: And that -- that has some pricing negotiation to it? 
Howard Hideshima: Yes, it does. 
Operator: And now we'll hear from Mark Kelleher with Dougherty & Company. 
Mark Kelleher: I'm just going to continue right on with that line of thought there. If we take the 2 points and put it back and let's say we didn't have the hard disk drive problem, we'd still be down about 200 basis points from last year. And we had Romley ramping up. We had a much better utilization of the Taiwan manufacturing facility. I would imagine those 2 things would be helping. So I'm just trying to figure out where the steady state gross margin number should be? I mean, are we now looking at 15%, 16% as the number? And can you still get back to the high-teens where you thought you could get maybe 6 months ago? 
Howard Hideshima: Let me take, Mark. So if we go back to prior to let's say all of those hard disk drive and memory stuff happening, probably about 3 quarters ago, you will see that we were probably about 16% to 17% as far as the gross margin is concerned. And so in the prior quarter -- in the June quarter, we said that of that 1.5% decline, majority of that was caused by the hard disk drive and memory and then this quarter I have said that over 2% basically has been caused by the hard disk drive and memory. So you will see a total of around approximately at least 3% caused by hard disk drives and memory over the last couple of quarters, right? As we work our way through the agreements and improve our vendor relationships and work it, we're hopeful that we can get that back so that -- again we can get back to that place where we started off about 6 months ago, 9 months ago, back to the 16% to 17%. And then you are right. We do have the other things that should be adding to our gross margins which is the Romley launch coming on board and us increasing our Taiwan facility utilization and then also obviously increasing our product mix with servers and software and support services. So those things are still working and they're going on. I think we just need to work our way through the hard disk drives and memory. 
Mark Kelleher: So there's really 3.5 points that could come back in a stable pricing environment plus the shift back to Romley, the products back to, not necessarily Romley, but the servers, shift back to servers should help that gross margin? 
Howard Hideshima: Yes, certainly that's the impact that we saw coming back from that steady -- let's say that state about 6 months ago. 
Mark Kelleher: Is there any thought of having to take a write-down to that inventory? 
Howard Hideshima: We've taken our lower costs to our markets to some extent during prior periods. Okay. So we have taken that as the market prices dropped or, and the cost is taken. So we have taken some of those write-downs already. 
Operator: Now we'll go to Sterne Agee's Alex Kurtz. 
Amelia Harris: This is Amelia in for Alex today. Basically given the volatility in your business model, wouldn't it make sense at this point to acquire some system level management software or virtualization software that can potentially, I don't know, buffer to your business model and save you from having to aggressively cut OpEx when you experience maybe a less than favorable quarter? 
Charles Liang: Yes, indeed we are aggressively improving our system management software, including a certain demand management, some virtualization and some storage related tool, so including switch, our high performance switch product line. So we are doing those products now. 
Amelia Harris: And when -- I’m sorry? 
Charles Liang: I'm not acquiring other company, yes. We still prefer growing organically with our own engineering capability. 
Amelia Harris: Okay. And when do you expect to maybe see an impact from that? 
Charles Liang: The impact have been gradually happening since about 2 quarters ago. So it won't happen kind of overnight by gradual improvement. For example, today we have more than a handful customers now particularly appreciate our software have. And this time we have growth consistently. 
Operator: And now we'll go to Michael Bertz with Kennedy Capital. 
Michael Bertz: Just to kind of go back to the gross margin question again, and Howard, maybe you can walk me through a little bit on this and how much the timing impact do you have particularly from hard drive and memory? And I think mainly from hard drive and in that sense, what is the difference between basically passing through the cost if you're selling in those component or something and just how much you guys are having to eat over these different quarters where pricing is moving around? And I mean I understand it's volatile but 350 bps is a significant amount, and it's like -- are you buying it in the previous quarter and having to remarket, and you talked about taking some write-downs just because your marketing it at lower cost for market. I mean, how much is that impacting? I am assuming most of it is coming in the sub-system business. Is that right, not in the systems business itself? 
Howard Hideshima: Well, it actually caused in both sides of it, Mike, to the extent that we incorporate the hard disk drives and the memory into our server systems. So any type of price changes and their impact the overall server margin also. So it is not just isolated in the components to sub-system business. 
Michael Bertz: So this is -– let’s go back to the timing question then, so what's the cycle time basically? I know I am obviously -- can tell what your days of inventory is, but what's the cycle times, when you actually buy it to when you actually turn it and put it in a system and sell it, I mean how quickly can that happen internally versus how quickly the price changes externally? 
Howard Hideshima: Well the price changes have been happening fairly quickly recently. I mean I think in this pricing quarter we actually saw again some strength and then at the end of the quarter we saw a pretty steep drop in the pricing happen per se. I think as some customers were basically trying to get rid of some of their inventory, we saw some pricing pressure at the end of the quarter. So again, it, the timing wise can happen fairly quickly, obviously quicker than when we can turn the inventory. 
Michael Bertz: So we’ll, then again -- it’s going on to beat a dead horse here, Howard, but how quickly can you turn the inventory through your systems, what -- again from the time you buy it to the time you ship it and book the 
 [Audio Gap] 
 less competitive maybe Dell or HP. Is that accurate? 
Charles Liang: Basically, yes. 
Michael Bertz: Okay. And so you think with the new products here into December we should be in better shape so how would you think then I guess geographically relatively would you assert that the U.S. would be now relatively stronger quarter-to-quarter versus say Europe, you're looking into December, would that be your expectation? 
Charles Liang: Because the USA market is more sensitive in technology. Whenever we introduce new architecture USA markets basically responds quicker, that's another factor. 
Michael Bertz: Okay, understood. And last question, Howard, you mentioned of almost $600,000 write-off in marketing materials and that was in this quarter? 
Howard Hideshima: That's correct. 
Michael Bertz: And that seems like a lot, what was that about? 
Howard Hideshima: It was more of, just some of our demo and demo type of equipment that we have out there in the field as we're familiaring the new products and what have you. 
Michael Bertz: Okay I'm sorry, I took that as to be like papers in this place, sorry. 
Operator: Moving on, we'll go to Brian Freed with Wunderlich Securities. 
Brian Freed: Just drilling down a little bit more on the hard disc drives. Can you talk a little bit about what specific steps you are able to take to alleviate the impact of future erratic prices, both on drives and memory? Are there any ways to one, access the long-term pricing contracts, or two, increase the frequency of the repricing? And then secondly, could you give us any additional color around the current utilization rate of your new manufacturing facility and how that transition is going? 
Charles Liang: Okay I mean for hard drive inventory question again. Usually we keep us 3 to 4 weeks inventory for hard drive and memory but again during the hard drive big shortage timeframe for safety, we'd raise the inventory level to 7 weeks so that kind of a clear -- a big trouble when price have a big drop and again basically we keep about 3, 4 week's inventory. As through the facility utilization, I mean Asia facility for sure is a big incremental to us and last quarter we have a 65% growth compared with one year ago, so that dramatically improved our utilization. And today I would like to say we have maybe 30% capacity use, so there has to be a 70% room to grow and we feel very positive for that capacity available. 
Brian Freed: And can you talk about what your targets are in terms of increasing that utilization of your capacity there? 
Charles Liang: Okay I mean again last year we grow about 65% in Asia and next year, I hope we can grow more than 65%. So even we've grown 65% in that utilization we have reached almost 65% to 70%, so that will be in much better position. 
Brian Freed: Okay and how material do you think that doubling of your utilization could be on your gross margin profile? 
Charles Liang: It all depends, if we grow in Asia as Asia margin had to be lower, but if we use those capacity for support customer in Europe then the margin will be slightly better. 
Brian Freed: Okay and then my last follow-up on the hard disc drive inventory, understanding it had gotten up to 7 weeks. Are you down to 3 to 4 weeks at this point in time or are you still somewhere between 3 and 7 weeks? 
Charles Liang: I guess about 4 weeks at this moment. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And now, we'll hear from Glenn Hanus with Needham. 
Glenn Hanus: On Asia, could you just talk a little bit more about the strength over there? Did you have some customer specific rollouts, that -- wins that you had or the general strength in the region? 
Charles Liang: Yes, I mean since 18 months ago we start to aggressively grow our sales and marketing teams, FAM&P teams, so and that's why we grow 65% last year, right. So this trend we are continue for sure, and because we already in enabled lots of pressure and [indiscernible] now those accounts start to buy product. 
Glenn Hanus: Can you comment on your operating expense plans now going forward? 
Howard Hideshima: Yes, Glenn. We're going to obviously continue to invest but we're watching it very closely as far as our operating expense. I think you’ll note that our operating expense were basically flat quarter to quarter, right. And so we'll continue to invest in our R&D but we'll be very prudent with our R&R investment going forward. 
Operator: And now we will take follow ups from Aaron Rakers from Stifel, Nicolaus. 
Aaron Rakers: A real quick one. The Internet Data Center vertical, just looking at the numbers, you were down about 43% sequentially by my math. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in that vertical and I think you alluded to deals pushing out, was that specific to that vertical, and if such, was there any large deals that possibly pushed out in the quarter? 
Charles Liang: Yes, I guess we still assume [indiscernible] is kind of coming back. 
Howard Hideshima: And Aaron, for ourselves, yes, we did push out. I mean there were some customers that, as you know, data centers are looking at the latest technologies, so they were evaluating the Sandy Bridge, and so they didn't quite finish their evaluation at the end but we still believe that they're going to be coming in so again it's the transition to the new technology. We're seeing that they like our new product, especially with the Sandy Bridge, and they just need to get through the testing process. 
Charles Liang: I would also say especially affecting new architecture. 
Operator: And now we'll go to Robert Maina with CRM LLC. 
Robert Maina: I just want to get a quick update on something that you said earlier in your presentation, Charles. You said that you were working to improve your inventory and manage the components supply chain better. Can you exactly tell us what processes you're putting in place to make sure that in the future, you do a better job at managing this? 
Charles Liang: Okay. Basically, in [indiscernible] is kind of almost never happened before a bigger price up and down in about 5 months’ time frame so from there we already enhanced our relationship with our hard drive and as well as memory company the relationship, so now we have a much better high level relationship and have some contracts signed. And we today, we've also have dedicated a position inside the company now to watch those market change and those vendors policy strategy change [indiscernible] in our company now. 
Robert Maina: Okay. So then if I could just ask a math question, if we get to the end of the quarter and see a similar price decline and ACD components like you sold this past quarter, does that mean gross margins go lower than the 13% or can you buffet that somehow with some of the new processes you've put in place? 
Charles Liang: Of course, I'm very happy to say that our hard drive and memory inventory already lowered to much more healthy level, we do have about -- $13 million? 
Howard Hideshima: $13 million overall. $10 million. 
Charles Liang: Over $10 million, just in hard drive and memory inventory. So that's for sure dramatically improve our position. And like Howard just said, we now have a dedicated position to watch those change periodically. So that should prevent from to minimize that risk. 
Robert Maina: Okay, but if I look at the inventory levels still at a fairly significant level relative to previous periods, how much maybe of the inventory is related to components hard drives and memory? 
Charles Liang: Like Howard just mentioned, hard drive. Indeed, that hard drive we already reduced to more than $10 million. 
Howard Hideshima: Right. 
Charles Liang: And overall inventory still high because we expect kind of good revenue this quarter for sure, especially with Fat Twin and our special workstation HFT optimizers solution. So we do need more inventory to prepare for the strong demand this quarter. 
Operator: And that does conclude the question-and-answer session of our conference call and I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Liang for any closing remarks. 
Charles Liang: Thank you for joining us today and we look forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you, everyone. Have a great day. 
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude the Super Micro first quarter fiscal year 2013 conference call. We do appreciate your participation, you may now disconnect. Thank you.

On August 28, we will attend the Midwest IDEAS conference in Chicago and on and on September 12, we will attend the ThinkEquity’s Annual Growth Conference in New York, where we will present and participate in one-on-one meetings. By now, you should have received a copy of today’s news release that was distributed at the close of regular trading and is available on company’s website. As a reminder, during today’s call, the company will refer to a presentation that is available to participants in the Investor Relations section of the company’s website under the events and presentation tab. Please turn to slide 2. Before we start, I will remind you that our remarks include forward-looking statements. There are a number of risk factors that could cause Super Micro’s future results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2011, and our other SEC filings. All those documents are available from the Investor Relations page of Super Micro’s website at www.supermicro.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Most of today’s presentation will refer to non-GAAP financial results and outlooks. For an explanation of our non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to slide 3 of this presentation or to our press release published earlier today. In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today’s press release and in the supplemental information attached to today’s presentation. I’ll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon everyone. Please turn to slide four. First let me provide you with the highlights of our first quarter. We’re pleased that our first quarter revenue was $275.9 million or 14.9% higher quarter-over-quarter and 6% higher year-over-year. This result is a record high for Super Micro. Non-GAAP net income was $8.1 million or 7.9% lower quarter-over-quarter and 37.5% lower compared to last year. Super Micro’s non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.18 per diluted share compared to $0.19 last quarter or $0.29 last year. Slide five please. Let me start with our results last quarter as well as our achievement and challenges in the last fiscal year. I will then provide some insights on our plans for upcoming year. Last quarter we achieved record high revenue that sum up to over $1 billion revenue for our fiscal year. We are especially pleased with the strong performance of our complete rack solutions which has grown rapidly over the last year at almost 300% growth quarter-over-quarter. This rack of solutions combined with our server systems contributed to 44.6% of our total revenue last quarter. Furthermore 46.6% of our business last quarter came from OEM and direct customers and especially internet data center which were 15.2% of sales. Geographically, our revenue in North America was 57.4% and stronger than last quarter while Europe was 22.4% and Asia was 17.5% slightly lower from last quarter. Despite the weak global economic conditions that had impacted the rate of our growth, our business have been able to grow overall. Our margins (inaudible) last quarter mainly due to the drop in hard driver price as well as some price drop also happened to our memory team component. However we believe that most of the impact to our margin occurred last quarter and the supply and demand conditions are in process of stabilizing. For the full fiscal year we are pleased with our top line performance especially our global operation from Beijing instrument, regardless of a challenging period of hard driver shortage, a later than expected technology transition and a weaker global economy. Last year we grew full-year revenue by 7.6% year-over-year which once again outgrew the rest of other IT market. It indicated that we continue to take much share because of our strong product line and our time to market advantage. Some key products other than rack solutions mentioned previously experienced good growth as well, highlighting growth in the storage solutions and Blade in particular. The storage solution business grew 25% year-over-year which was a good result considering the hard driver shortage. The SuperBlade products grew 30% year-over-year. We are also receiving great traction and quickly ramping up the MicroCloud Solutions this year as most of the customers are looking for great scalable cloud solutions for their business. On the business operations, we have opened our Asia Science and Technology Park in Taiwan in January this year and it had been growing steadily. Our Taiwan facility has now reached 300 employees in production, operations, engineering, sales and administration. With this level of staffing we are well positioned to both grow our business internationally and to fully support operations here in the United States. At this stage we’re overcoming the challenges that come with global operation and logistics which (inaudible) and underutilized capacity in the near term. However, we’re continuing to build our capability and expect to see contributions to our profitability from Taiwan in the near future. Last year, we grew our headcount about 19% with significant portion of that growth for Asia facility. Approximately half of our total headcount goes basically in our engineering as we further excel in hardware and developing software, maintaining our time to market advantage in the (inaudible) and the launch of our Sandy Bridge product lines as well as our in the (inaudible) of our as well as our (inaudible) innovation. The FatTwin require that we invest more in engineering resource last year. We're excited about our upcoming fiscal year 2013 with Sandy Bridge processor finally in production volume at the end of last year. We are still at the beginning of the upgrading cycle. Last quarter, we saw less than 10% of our total revenue on the Sandy Bridge base the DPX9 products. Currently all of our product lines have been updated and enhanced for the Sandy Bridge technology. As the server upgrade cycle ramps over the next several quarters, we are very well positioned with the best server solutions in the industry. I will now turn to slide six. In addition, we have recently introduced our Fat Twin Architecture; we fully expect them to be our important growth factor in the coming years. Now Fat Twin is a highly optimal for whole new Twin architecture that is optimized for data center, cloud infrastructure, Edge PC environment and storage (inaudible). The Fat Twin was the best for storage capacity with eight (inaudible) external separable hard driver for one new space, it also delivers the high performance per watt and highest performance per dollars because of our superior architecture design that's (inaudible) power requirement minimum power distribution (inaudible) high efficiency model of design (inaudible) digital power supply and easy our service and maintenance. It allows free air cooling wise supporting 130 watt CPU at a 47 degree C MPN environment and 135 watt CPU at a 35 degree C which is embedded in the industry. We believe that Fat Twin is a unique architecture in the industry that that had potential to be a game changing product line for Super Micro for many years to come. Our agenda Fat Twin let me now update you with more details on our new and beating technologies. Slide seven NA please. Super Micro's X9 Sandy Bridge solutions for different market segments feature the new generation high efficiency digital power supply that can be to 95% efficiency in typical applications, combined with our battery backup power module, exclusive to Super Micro Data centers can now eliminate the need for a traditional package UPS system, we are providing a mission critical availability. Optimized for capillary in media capillary GPU and upcoming Intel G5 our GPU optimize the product nine in 1U, 2U, 3U and 4U and prepaid firms provide extreme performance in SPC calculation, medical, forensic and work of intensive applications. Our optimized for professional users, our new work station product nine Maximus 35 and featured super quite power supply and high performance (inaudible). Specialties nine (inaudible) top system, couple (inaudible) an enterprise over packing capability. We are also continuing expand our offering of optimized 10G infiniband (inaudible) and FCOE solutions to our cloud and data center customers. Our switch products in medium provisions in performance and costs. Super Mario's data center management software tool SDCM, SSM, and (inaudible) firmware update MFU utilities will help us present a total solution to our customers. Our next slide have converted to flow users and that we had just begin to recognize revenue on sales of those software. We believe this is only the beginning of our ability to provide a both hardware and software solutions to our customers. Our complete (inaudible) solutions have been successfully deployed to many data centers interest. With our increasing engineering expertise and extensive testing that direct shipment of computer rack provided the customers instantaneously of how power own convenience and trouble free experience. We are expecting a faster gross of our complete solution. In summary, in fiscal year 2012, Super Micro again outgrew the industry during a challenging period. We are pleased that we had a reached a milestone of $1 billion company and we are also pleased to be prove for a 19 year, we had continued our chain of strong gross and profitability. As we ended fiscal 2013, we’re positioned better than ever to grow rapidly. With a strong global presence and a production capacity combined with our inter (inaudible) X9 platform, including server, networking, storage and complete rack solutions. We’re prepared not only to meet the customer demand from the IT upgrade cycle but also to gain more much share from competitors. For more specifics on the fourth quarter let me turn it over to Howard.
Howard Hideshima: Thank you, Charles and good afternoon everyone. I will focus my remarks on earnings, gross margin, operating expenses and similar items on a non-GAAP basis which reflects adjustment to exclude stock compensation expenses. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company in today’s earnings and in the supplemental detail in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Let me begin with a review of the fourth quarter income statement. Please turn to slide nine. Revenue was $275.9 million up 6% from same quarter a year ago and up 14.9% sequentially. The increase in revenue from last year was primarily due to the growth in our server solutions business from the continuing ramp of our full rack solutions and new product platform MicroCloud. The sequential increase in revenue from last quarter was primarily due to sub systems and accessory sales primarily of hard disk drives and memory as discussed previously and the ramp of our four rack solutions. On a percentage basis four rack solutions MicroCloud and storage were the fastest growing top lines from the prior quarter. Slide 10. Turning to product mix, the portion revenues from server systems was 44.6% which was an increase from 40.4% a year ago and a decrease from 48.5% last quarter. ASPs for servers were $2,000 per unit which is up from $1,800 per unit last year and the same at $2,000 last quarter. We shipped approximately 62,000 servers in the fourth quarter and 1,167,000 subsystems and accessories. We continue to maintain a diverse revenue base with over 600 customers with none of these customers representing more than 10% of our quarterly revenue and our data center revenue 15.2% which was a decrease from 15.7% in the prior quarter. Furthermore, 57.4% of our revenues came from the US and 53.4% from our distributors and resellers. Slide 11 and 12. Non-GAAP gross profit was $42.6 million up 5.4% from $40.5 million in the same quarter last year and up 4.2% from $40.9 million sequentially. On a percentage basis gross margin was 15.5% the same as 15.5% a year ago and down from 17% sequentially. Price changes from Ablecom resulted in no change to gross profit in the quarter and total purchases represented approximately 22.6% of total cost of goods sold compared to 14.9% a year ago and 20% sequentially. Our year-over-year gross margin was the same both quarters were impacted by challenging component pricing, last year for memory pricing due to the Japan and earthquake and tsunami and this year from hard disk drive, the memories due to the Thailand flood and product transition. As a result of these events the company has improved its relationship with its vendors and this should help the company in the future. Subsequently, sequentially gross margins decreased from last quarter primarily due to hard disk drives and memory price we mentioned above. Margins for other products were about the same as the prior quarter. Slide 13. Operating expenses were $30.6 million up from $22.7 million in the same quarter a year ago and up from $28.7 million sequentially. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses was 11.1% up from 8.7% last year and down from 11.9% sequentially. Operating expenses were higher on an absolute dollar basis, year-over-year and sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily in R&D as we invested in our portfolio for the Sandy Bridge as well as Fat Twin and other new product platforms. Sequentially, we saw an increase in operating expenses of about $1.9 million primarily due to sales and marketing expenses of about $1.2 million, associated with promotional expenses for new products and trade show expenses. In addition, G&A expenses increased by about $452,000 primarily due to foreign exchange losses on sales. The company's headcount increased by 50 primarily in operations and in R&D to 1,503 total employees. Operating profit was $12 million or 4.4% of revenue down by $5.7 million or 32.2% from the $17.7 million a year ago and down $0.2 million or 1.4% from $12.2 million sequentially. Net income was $8.1 million or 2.9% of revenue, down $4.9 million or 37.5% from $13 million a year ago and down $0.7 million or 7.9% from $8.8 million sequentially. Our non-GAAP fully diluted EPS was $0.18 per share, down $0.11 from $0.29 per share a year ago and down $0.01 from $0.19 per share sequentially. The number of fully diluted shares used in the fourth quarter was 45,548,000. The tax rate in the fourth quarter on a non-GAAP basis was 31.6% compared to 26% a year ago and 26.6% sequentially. The increase in the tax rate from the prior year was primarily due to timing of the R&D credit. We expect the effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis to be approximately 34% for the September quarter which is higher than the 33.1% in the same quarter last year since the R&D credit has not been reinstated yet this year. If the R&D credit is reinstated retroactively as has been done in the past then there will be a catch-up of the credit in the quarter this occurs. Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis on slide 14. Cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term investments were at $83.8 million, down $8.4 million from $92.2 million in the prior quarter and up $8.6 million from $75.2 million in the second quarter last year. In the fourth quarter, free cash flow was a negative $5.5 million. The negative cash flow is primarily due to increase in inventory. Slide 15. Accounts receivable increased by $1 million, or a $102 million and DSOs were 34 days, a decrease of one day from the prior quarter. Inventories increased by $47.7 million, to $276.6 million with days in inventory increasing by three days to a 100 days. The increase in inventory was due in part to preparing for the increase in demand following the Sandy Bridge launch and repricing hard disk drive inventory level. Accounts payable increased by $31.8 million, to a $174 million, with the days payables outstanding increasing by two days to 62 days primarily due to the increase in inventory as mentioned above. Overall cash conversion days were both 72 days for the fourth quarter and the prior quarter. The overall ratio as noted above were higher than historical due to the replenishing of hard disk drive inventory levels and the ramping of the Sandy Bridge product line. Now for a few comments on outlook. As indicated previously, during the fourth quarter, we continue to grow our Sandy Bridge solutions in which we have a time to market advantage. Our four rack solutions are ramping and we have launched our Fat Twin solution. We remain cautious about the global economic environment, but do see opportunities for growth around the world. Our Taiwan facility is still ramping and we continue to see operational efficiencies we can gain. So as we enter September quarter, which is a seasonally weak quarter for the industry, we expect to see continuing ramp of the Sandy Bridge product lines, higher volumes of our Fat Twin solution as well as improvement in our operations overseas. We enter fiscal year ‘13 in a strong position from a product and operating perspective to benefit from investments we have made over the past year. Therefore the company currently expects net sales for the quarter ending September 30, 2012 in a range of $270 million to $290 million. Assuming this revenue range the company expects non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.18 to $0.24 for the quarter. It is currently expected that the outlook will not be updated until the release of the company’s next quarterly earnings announcement notwithstanding subsequent developments, however, the company may update the outlook or any portion thereof at any time. With that, let me turn back to Charles for some closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Howard. While we are pleased that 2012 was another year of success and growth for Super Micro. We now look forward to a stronger fiscal 2013 with the Asia and EMEA facility ramping in production and the growth drive such as the new Fat Twin architecture, the industry’ industry's product nine of Sandy Bridge products, storage, GPU solutions, complete rack solutions, data center software and etcetera. We had never been better positioned to grow our business. In summary, we believe our competitive position and strong brands we’ll deliver good result in 2013 and we expect this result to provide better profitability. Operator at this time we are ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen our question and answer session will be conducted electronically. (Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Mark Kelleher with Dougherty & Company.
Mark Kelleher - Dougherty & Company: I was wondering if, I know you guys talked a lot about the pricing effect, the component pricing on gross margin, could you just talk a little bit more about the revenue shortfall to your initial guidance, was there, what came in a little unusual, is it just general economic weakness, was it Europe, was it a slower ramp in Sandy Bridge servers, can you just talk about that a little bit?
Charles Liang: Yeah, very good question. I guess the hard drive price drop and also (inaudible) to operate that can be a little conservative to gain some lower margin business and that's another reason. And also Sandy Bridge this time ramped up a little bit so that kind of lower our revenue in June quarter, however the September quarter should be much better.
Mark Kelleher - Dougherty & Company: So was Europe having any effect, how’s your exposure doing?
Howard Hideshima: Europe was okay. Mark it was down a bit, but obviously we’re still seeing a lot of opportunities over there.
Mark Kelleher - Dougherty & Company: And then just as a follow-up, the gross margin plan that you have. Can you just talk a little bit about where that should trend. I know you have given in the past some longer-term goals. Are you sticking to those goals?
Howard Hideshima: Yes we are. I mean the opportunities for the Taiwan facility and the other things that we’re doing still are out there. I think if I had to characterize this quarter, as Charles and I previously mentioned on the memory and hard disk drive, you see, that was the majority of the shortfall between lets say the March quarter margin and June margins.
Operator: And we will move next to Rajesh Ghai with ThinkEquity.
Rajesh Ghai - ThinkEquity: Howard, memory pricing has kind of reached the bottom it looks like and very likely to go up in the future; if one has to have a guess up. What steps are you taking to ensure that you know, this increase in memory pricing does not impact the gross margin going forward and you know, actually they have the advantage because it does happen in that direction?
Howard Hideshima: Yeah, in earlier kind of April-May timeframe, the expect that module price will grow and of which based at that time and that’s why we suffered EBITDA as well. But now I rather say that the time should be passed already. So the price for hard drive and module are now much more stable now, so I believe our (inaudible) will become more heavy.
Rajesh Ghai - ThinkEquity: If memory pricing goes up in the future, like it reflects to happen, can we expect gross margin stability or could that be again a headwind for you in the future?
Charles Liang: I guess once the price is more stable, then it is better for us, but again during the hard driver shortage timeframe, we spend a lot of effort to enhance that relationship with our partner. So indeed whole company is in much better position than before.
Rajesh Ghai - ThinkEquity: Okay. And can you comment on the competitive landscape and pricing in North America if that was any reason for the gross margin weakness. We are hearing reports of the Taiwanese contract manufacturers getting more active in North America may be selling directly to some of your customers. Can you provide some color on that?
Howard Hideshima: As I mentioned earlier, the gross margin move that you saw between the quarters was -- I guess majority of it was the hard disk memory pricing. Actually the pricing or the margins for our other products was fairly stable between the quarters. So we didn’t see that impact that you may be talking about.
Rajesh Ghai - ThinkEquity:
 :
Howard Hideshima: Well certainly the Nehalem refresh was coming off the eve of that economic time that we are going through back end 2009. This time around it’s not quite -- the economy is still a concern out there, but certainly not at the same level it was back in 2009. So again there is lots of good opportunities out there for us even though you had that economy kind of backdrop. It’s not as bad as it was back in 2009.
Rajesh Ghai - ThinkEquity: But no comparative concerns?
Howard Hideshima: Well I think back in 2009 I think there was a lot of shrinkage in the market at that point because of the tough economic conditions there that you saw a very competitive market. I don’t think you see that as much this time around.
Operator: We will move next to Glenn Hanus with Needham & Company.
Glenn Hanus - Needham & Company: So just to make sure I understood the answer to the first question there about the roughly $20 million in shortfall on the quarter, did you say that the Sandy Bridge rollout was a little slower generally than anticipated. Was that the reason, the primary reason for the revenue shortfall?
Howard Hideshima: That is one of the main reasons, other than the hard driver price drop and [dim] price that could give us more pleasure to gain those best margin deals.
Glen Hanus - Needham & Company: I am sorry what does the drive issue has to do with the revenue shortfall.
Charles Liang: I mean the driver price drop, our margin from hard driver for memory become much lower. That's why we are a bit reluctant to approaching those low margin market (inaudible).
Glen Hanus - Needham & Company: Okay. And just kind of geographically can you talk about Europe versus America versus Asia, the kind of that current demand environment what you saw in the quarter and the current demand environment by geography?
Charles Liang: You know in USA our kind of revenue share continue to be strong. In Europe we start to be very aggressive to grow sales and marketing team in last six months. So we did a higher minimal sales and marketing guidance in Europe. Same thing in Asia, so we believe mostly in Europe and Asia, our revenues should grow strongly in 2013.
Glen Hanus - Needham & Company: I didn't quite understand the comment. I thought I heard in the narrative on under utilized capacity, what was that?
Charles Liang: You know in Taiwan we have a big facility. The production capacity almost as big as our facility in USA. However, the shipping from Taiwan is very small. That’s why we do not will utilize the capacity in Taiwan. And that’s why income scale has stayed very weak in Taiwan. We need to impact higher volume.
Glenn Hanus - Needham & Company: And on the model goals of roughly 19% gross margin, 9% operating margin, I think you use to say, you know, the goal was like the second half of fiscal '13. Has that pushed out at all as your goal just given the economic challenges or do you think that’s still a realistic timeframe?
Charles Liang: I guess we had to push our may be too much but in quarter.
Glenn Hanus - Needham & Company: Okay, sorry were you going to comment Howard?
Howard Hideshima: Hello Glen, I think I mentioned earlier the levers are still there. I think we have to address the economic challenges but I think the levers are still there as we talked about before.
Glenn Hanus - Needham & Company: Okay, lastly from me. Operating expenses have been running a little higher than we had modeled recently. Can you talk about what happened to make you want like you wanted to ramp up some expenses more? It sounds like more on the sales and marketing side but across a little bit R&D and how we should think about that going forward?
Charles Liang: Let me stop. I mean I guess because challenge strong competition. That’s why we have spend a more effort in technology For FatTwin is become a very big strong product. We invested a lot on this premium architecture and that created a more expense ratio for June quarter. The other area is because we start to emphasis a lot in Europe and Asia that’s why we haven’t spend all more money in promotion especially Europe and Asia. .
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And we will move next to Aaron Rakers with Stifel Nicolaus.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, perfect. So a couple of questions if I can as well and I apologize if some of these were asked already but the Romley cycle or the Sandy Bridge cycle for you guys can you give us any color of where we are at in that cycle are we for you guys is 20% of your shipments on those new platforms, how we think about the progression and ultimately we want to go is how do we think about that in the context of what looks to be a relatively stable ASP trend on a sequential basis this last quarter?
Charles Liang: Yeah when new product available this year, we were better ASP and better margin, however this time kind of Sandy Bridge because of more technical challenge and also we tried to provide indeed we provide brand new architecture Fat Twin or those made the come to market a little bit better but the product however become much stronger and we expect those (inaudible) should be probably little strong in September quarter and December quarter.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. So I am clear so on a like-to-like basis Romley is neutral to the gross margin right now relative to the Nehalem platforms additive or I am just a little bit confused by that.
Howard Hideshima: Aaron this is Howard I think Charles mentioned earlier in his presentation so the revenues are still less than 10% of our overall revenues, so we are still at the very beginning of the ramp and it is additive to our gross margins.
Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus: And then the follow up question from me, I believe in your 10-Q you guys this quarter $276 million of hard disk drive purchase commitment that carried through, I think it was March of 2014, I guess I want to go back to the hard disk drive discussion understanding that and seeing what’s happening in the pricing environment, I guess is that to be a lingering overhang over the next couple of quarters given how that LTA if you will kind of plays itself out or is that something that you can or does that basically lift you over the coming quarters. Just trying to understand how that LTA kind of forced you model that $276 million number you guys disclosed?
Howard Hideshima: This is Howard. Like I said the LTA model again it doesn’t cover a 100% of our demand, so there is some buffer out there. For us we do take shipments every quarter based upon it and we do work on pricing with our vendors every quarter on it. So it’s adjusted every quarter with us, we do work with them and it is built in and I think it is a good thing for the long-term for us; I mean we have been growing things with it, but we do I think it is a good thing because as Charles mentioned we are building our relationships with these guys, increasing our importance, so it will support us as we grow our scale going forward.
Operator: And we will move next to Andrew Storm with Cortina.
Andrew Storm - Cortina: Just wanted to make sure I understood a couple of things. On the OpEx expenses you talked about, you said you are running higher promotions and then you also said you will spend more on R&D for the Fat Twin; is there any one time spending for R&D with the materials and that’s going come out next quarter or promotions or as we think about this new OpEx level as the base rate going forward?
Charles Liang: Yes for factoring in its pretty much one time.
Andrew Storm - Cortina: And so how much was that?
Charles Liang: I believe we already spend maybe $7 million to $8 million kind of extra money to build the strong product line. So in next few quarters we will continue to make the (inaudible) stronger, but relatively the investment will be much smaller.
Andrew Storm - Cortina: So it’s a couple of million R&D coming out next quarter?
Charles Liang: Next few quarters.
Andrew Storm - Cortina: Okay. And then also for promotions?
Charles Liang: Promotion I believe we already done a lot. So the next few quarters should be much less.
Andrew Storm - Cortina: Okay, so you said that on sales and marketing it was $1.2 million so that should come down some by let's say $0.5 million or closer to $1 million?
Howard Hideshima: We had a trade show out there so again it will come down from the trade show perspective; but we've got other things that will offset some of that like, salary increases at an annual basis. And if you look back, probably back last year, you will see a similar type of growth although maybe not as high in our op expenses due to the salary adjustments.
Andrew Storm - Cortina: And then on gross margins and going to Aaron’s point, should we start to see with the hard disks is this more of a one quarter issue or does the LTA make it that this is a kind of rolling initiative slowly gets better?
Charles Liang: I would have to say for hard drive impact and also the quarter should be March quarter and June quarter and then we are in better position now.
Andrew Storm - Cortina: I understand but since hard disk drive has gone down and you've entered into a long term purchasing agreement. You didn't fully answered me, you said that you guys work with your suppliers on pricing but should that pricing that you get come down in this quarter, to be more commensurate at the market, or will continue to be a drag?
Charles Liang: Yeah, indeed the price that we have agreed with our vendors is pretty flexible so we should be able to gather properly adjustment.
Andrew Storm - Cortina: Okay, so there shouldn’t be a gross margin surprise next quarter?
Charles Liang: Should be much better than (inaudible).
Andrew Storm - Cortina: And then just to make sure I understood, you said you basically walked away from some lower margin business because of the hard disk drive issue this quarter. Is that right?
Charles Liang: Yes, a little bit.
Andrew Storm - Cortina: Okay, and was there any large deals that might have slipped or switched out?
Howard Hideshima: Yeah, there is one deal that we’ve been working on that we had, we thought we were going to recognize this quarter that has slipped out.
Andrew Storm - Cortina: And last thing if I could ask is, with the rolling cycle, you are 10% now. So when does that really pick up, I mean is this something that we should be talking about for you guys three or six months out; I mean, when does it really start to dominate the financials?
Charles Liang: I believe that it have been within next six months for sure.
Operator: And at this time, we have no further questions in our queue. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Liang for any additional or closing comments.
Charles Liang: Thank you for joining us today and we look forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you everyone and have a great day.
Operator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude the Super Micro fourth quarter fiscal year 2012 conference call. We do appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you.

Perry Hayes: Good afternoon, and thank you for attending Super Micro’s conference call and financial results for the third quarter fiscal year 2012, which ended March 31, 2012. Before we begin, I’d like to advise you of upcoming investor conferences at which Super Micro will be participating. On May 24th, we will attend the SternAG Technology Conference in New York, where we will present and participate in one-on-one meetings. By now, you should have received a copy of today’s news release that was distributed at the close of regular trading and is available on the company’s website. As a reminder, during today’s call, the company will refer to a presentation that is available to participants in the Investor Relations section of the company’s website under the Events and Presentation tab. Please turn to slide two. Before we start, I’ll remind you that our remarks include forward-looking statements. There are a number of risk factors that could cause Super Micro’s future results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our form 10-K for Fiscal 2011, and our other SEC filings. All those documents are available from the investor relations page of Super Micro’s website at www.supermicro.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward looking statements. Most of today’s presentation will refer to non-GAAP financial results and outlooks. For an explanation of our non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to Slide 3 of this presentation or to our press release published earlier today. In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today’s press release and in the supplemental information attached with today’s presentation. I’ll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon everyone. Let me start by sharing the fact that we grew the Q3 revenue year over year by only 2.5% mainly because of our finance drop that cause quarter wide hard drive shortage which affected us badly while into the quarter. In addition, not long ago, we showed the New Sandy Bridge Xeon platform from coming just before the end of the quarter was there to achieve meaningful revenue lift in the last quarter. Some customers anticipate the technology transition and decide to postpone acquisition until the new product launch. With these issue result is behind us now, we are in a very good position for strong growth for next several quarters. Please come to slide four. Now let me provide you with the financial highlights of our third quarter. The third quarter revenue was $240.2 million, about 3.9% lower than last quarter and 2.5% higher year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $8.8 million or 21.1% around quarter-over-quarter and 28.1% compared to last year. Super Micro’s non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.19 per diluted share compared to $0.25 last quarter or $0.28 last year. From a geographic perspective, this quarter in United States account for 56.5% of revenue. Europe was 23% and Asia was 18.1%. Sequentially all our region were essentially flat from the prior quarter. On a year-over-year base, the US was 2.9% higher while Asia was slowed by 1.8%, Europe was basically flat with the year ago. Last of the OEM and direct accounts – and direct customer account for over 47.4% of revenue, and Internet data center was 15.7% of total revenue. Of that result all that strong OEM and direct business. System sales continue to be a strong and reached record high 48.5% over sales. We had many successful deals and our completed racks system solution which enabled customer to immediately provide their order at the reception. Customers are very satisfied with the plug and play experience and service at a record level offered by Super Micro. Therefore I expect this strong momentum of competency in business to continue. The coming June quarter performance is looking very positive simply because, first, we have no hard drives shortage problem now. Second, the Sandy Bridge Process both are in high volume production with strong customer demand. Three, we are more ready for a complete data center and Cloud solutions including fully installed and tested rack solution and software. Number four, more customers to take advantage of our new Asia integration and logistics facility. These are just to start and we will have more reasons for strong growth after that quarter passes. Now, let me come in a little more on tests about our situation than last quarter. The hard drives, was in shortage for almost the whole quarter due to the flood. Especially in the first two months compared to Tier 1 impact much more than this. We work very hard this quarter to strengthen our relationship with key hard driver manufacturers. And we were successful in these efforts. Long-term contract were drawn and that design was that our allocation over hard driver lastly improved by the end of the quarter. We see the situation is now getting back to a tightened, broadened conditions. And now, hard drivers shortage issue is basically (inaudible). The launch of Sandy Bridge Process which came essentially at the end of our March quarter. Demand contributed much to our Q3 revenue. After that result, you are unable to immediately offset our investment post. And our profitability was impacted. However, our early assembling program, with the most of our customers indicates that the men for those processes. In the future quarter, we have been very strong. In particular, at quarter end, we have one large to repair the Super Micro postponed to the Q4. Even now for this delay last quarter, our performance could have been much stronger. That is of our Sandy Bridge product launch is mainly due to our large investment in the R&D. In the past two years, we add 63% more engineers to our R&D group. We have made this investment in engineering because we know that transition to a new process perform is the most critical time to – critical time to maintain our time market advantage and driven strong in technology innovation. In that short-term, the investment made us on our engineering team in our current financial performance. However, in the future, both is the choice of application optimized product will where enable us to grow faster and to a new neighbors. Now, I would like to provide you with updates on our capacity expansion. Our – in 2000, our new line into Taiwan facilities remain on track and we now have three new lines already operational. As we have said previously, the Taiwan facility will improve the logistical foundation of Super Micro, which would lead to a lower production and logistic cost, and it will allow us to grow more quickly in Asia as well as in Europe. We plan that Taiwan facility will be fully ramped by later this calendar year and we will continue to serve key Asia and European customers during this place. As far as our current products, the Blade can grow strongly year-over-year and started to continue to grow steadily from that year. Rack solutions and GPU remain strong much interest in the sales results our MicroCloud has been very good and we believe that MicroCloud is shaping up to be a strong product line. Our R&D product, such as networking suite and airway service also continue to grow. Looking ahead, the technology transition to Sandy Bridge has now officially begun and will be the main drive for growth over the next several quarters. We expect a server to flash backup to create a stronger demand for increased performance and lower power consumption servers and storage products. Our new Fat Twin server storage product line is the most outstanding is improved, which mix is our server consumed that energy power via helping customer to realize that datacenter is much easier. In addition, that UPI, we have launched this quarter and the 22 nanometer design. We have provided even where their performance put on us. Therefore, we are excited about our technology transition and given our heavy investment in that. We are well-positioned with upgraded product line to provide a monthly use of the both of the choice of product. Let me now update you with multiple on our new and leading technologies, which is 30% mostly compared to our previous X8 generation. We will be provide demand (inaudible) and for given market segments. This system featured our new generation high-efficiency digital power supplies and that can reach 95% efficiency in typical applications and improve both lights and heavy loaded efficiency as well. We will also be pushing the foundry of good in computing by offering product that operate in high temperature, 47°C. These solutions, we will make them become easier. And have a customer achieving that PUE of 1.1 or even better. Later this quarter, we will introduce it as I mentioned. We had proposed today with a mission for competitive reasons. These twin based product line we will combine faster performance. Later performance per watt higher storage capacity and higher flexibility that will make, SMCI the most of the competitive product in that data center market. We are very excited about these new product line, which viewed on the twin innovation that we highly need several years ago. Our CPU optimize the product line in 1U, 2U, 4U and (inaudible) provide extreme performance in calculation where this intensity applications. And had been the most popular CPU service in the market. The new X9 innovation CPU that we changed have designed to support our upcoming new generation CPU’s. Higher capacity PCI-E fresh, our new workstation product nine featured a new workstation in with a high vicinity super quite power supply and hard performance the IO support. Our new specialized server and workstation product nine to support our ever risk processor optimize for HFT, a high frequency trading applications account user. We had just released our new high volume standalone switch product two weeks ago. We are also continuing to expand our offer rate of optimize 10G and (inaudible) solution to our crowd and better tender customers. Our switch product are in the leading position in performance and costs. Super Micro’s there are tender management so that (inaudible) with DCF and it has been where half present a total solution to our customers. Our tested site had converted to flow user and we had just begun to recognize the revenue on sale of this software. We believe this is only the beginning of our ability to provide the best hardware and software solutions to our customers. Our completed rack solution had been successfully deployed to many centers now with our increasing engineering expertise and extensive testing the direct shipment of completed rack provides the customer is tenuously the power own convenience and trouble-free experience. We are expecting a possible gross of our completed rack solution business. For most of the specifics on the second quarter let me turn it over to Howard.
Howard Hideshima: Thank you, Charles, and good afternoon everyone. I will focus my remarks on earnings, gross margin operating expenses and similar items on a non-GAAP basis which reflects adjustment to exclude stock compensation expenses. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company in today’s earnings release and in the supplemental detail in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Let me begin with the review of the third-quarter income statement. Please turn to slide eight. Revenue was $240.2 million up 2.5% from the same quarter a year ago and down 3.9% sequentially. The increase in revenue from last year was primarily due to continuing ramp of new product platforms as we have continued to expand during the past year especially in our (inaudible) product lines as well as ramp of our full rack solutions. The sequential decrease in revenue from last quarter was not only due to the seasonal weakness, our storage and hard disk drive and the Sandy Bridge transition. On a percentage basis, (inaudible) MicroClouds were the fastest growing product lines from the prior quarter. Slide nine. Turning to product mix. The proportion of revenues from server systems was 48.5%, which was an increase from 31.8% a year ago and from 44% last quarter. ASPs for the servers was $2000 per unit, which is up from $1400 last year and from $1800 last quarter. We shipped approximately 57,000 servers in the third quarter and 1,212,000 subsystems and accessories. We continue to maintain a diverse revenue base with over 500 customers with none of these customers representing more than 10% of our quarterly revenues. Internet data center revenue was 15.7%, which was an increase from 9.7% in the prior quarter. Furthermore, 56.5% of our revenues came from the U. S. and 52.6% from our distributors and resellers. Slide 10 and 11. Non-GAAP gross profit was $40.9 million, up (inaudible) from $38.1 million in the same quarter last year and down 4.4% from $42.8 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, gross margin was 17%, up from 16.2% a year ago and comparable to 17.1% sequentially. Price changes from Ablecom resulted in no change to gross profit in the quarter and total purchases represented approximately 20.1% of total cost of goods sold compared to 20.3% a year ago and 18.5% sequentially. The year-over-year increase in gross margin resulted from some increase in the sale of server solutions, which typically have higher margins. Sequentially, gross margins were comparable, the increase in revenues offset the higher margins from hard disk drive sales in the second quarter. Slide 12. Operating expenses were $28.7 million, up from $20.8 million in the same quarter a year ago and up from $26.6 million sequentially. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses was 11.9% up from 8.9% last year and 10.6% sequentially. Operating expenses were higher on an absolute dollar basis year-over-year and sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily in R&D as we continue to invest in our product portfolio especially in preparation for the Sandy Bridge launch, which occurred on March 6. Sequentially, we saw an increase in operating expenses of about $2.1 million primarily due to R&D expenses growing by about 900K related to salaries and benefits to support new technology launches such as Sat Twin and software solution and $300,000 less in our fees from our customers. In addition, general and administrative expenses grew by about $400,000 primarily due to an increase in legal expense surrounding a patent full case filed in the third quarter. The company’s head count increased by 58 sequentially to 1453 total employees, primarily in R&D. Operating profit was $12.2 million, or 5.1% of revenue, down by $5 million, or 29.3% from $17.2 million a year ago and down $1 million or 24.9% from $16.2 million sequentially. Net income was $8.8 million, or 3.7% of revenues, down $3.4 million, or 28.1% from $12.3 million a year ago and down $2.4 million, or 21.1% from $11.2 million sequentially. Our non-GAAP fully diluted EPS was $0.19 per share, down $0.09 from $0.28 per share a year ago, and $0.06 from $0.25 per share sequentially. The number of fully diluted shares used in the third quarter was $45.5 million. The tax rate for the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis was 26.6% compared to 28.3% a year ago, and 30.5% sequentially. The decrease in tax rate from prior year was primarily due to R&D credit true-up. We expect expected tax rate on a non-GAAP basis to be approximately 30% for the June quarter, which is higher than the 26% in the same quarter last year, since you we only have six months of R&D credit this fiscal year. Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis, slide 13. Cash and cash equivalents and long and short-term investments were $92.2 million, down $13.9 million from a $106.1 million in the prior quarter and up $18.7 million from $73.5 million in the same quarter last year. In the third quarter free cash flow was a negative of $21.3 million. Slide 14, accounts receivable increased by $20.9 million to a $101 million with days sales outstanding was 35 days, an increase of four days from the prior quarter. The company has actively reduced the discount it provides customers for TT shipments by about 75 basis points. Inventories increased by $35.6 million to $228.9 million with days in inventories increasing but 12 days to 97 days. The increase in inventory was due in part to preparing for the seasonally strong quarter. The increase in demand following the Sandy Bridge launch, replacing hard disk drive inventory levels, which were reduced due to the flood as well as products for appending shipment for a large product, which we did not ship in the third quarter, but is expected to ship this quarter. Accounts payable increased by $26.3 million to $142.2 million, with the days payable outstanding increasing by seven days to 60 days, primarily due to the increase in inventory as mentioned above. Overall cash convergence cycle were 72 days an increase in 98 for 63 days in the prior quarter. The overall ratio is noted above our similar to the trend, which we have coming into the March quarter, which you seasonally saw going into a seasonally strong June quarter. Some of this has been increased with the replenishment of hard disk drive, inventory levels and the ramping of the normally product line. And now for a few comments on our outlook. As indicated, previously during the third quarter we saw strength in our customer base and as started ramping Sandy Bridge solutions or we did have some delays caused by shortages and hard disk drives and transition of Sandy Bridge products. The situation has improved. As mentioned before we have entered into long-term supply agreements with our hard disk drive suppliers and continue to ramp our production of Sandy Bridge products. So as we entered the June quarter, which is seasonally a strong quarter for the industry we are ramping Sandy Bridge products and/or proved our supply agreements on a hard disk drive and continue to increase production in our Thailand facility. As we enter this technology refresh cycle we are strongly positioned from our product and operations perspective. Therefore the company currently expect net sales for this quarter ending June 30, 2012 in the range of $280 million to $310 million, which at the midpoint is about 23% increase sequentially and 13% increase from the prior year, assuming those revenue range the company expects long gap earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.27 to $0.32 for the quarter. It is effective that the outlook will not be update until the release of company’s next quarterly earnings announcements. Now withstanding subsequent development however the company may uptake the outlook for any portion there out at any time. With that let me turn back to Charle, for closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you Howard. In summary chip micro ahead spent that’s the many quarters prepare you for the upcoming servers cycle. Based on the Cindy bridge. Our investment in R&D new system architecture there are things sought that we are poor our global production and logistics facility positioned us for our next strong line b’day cycle. We had achievable micro from that beginning to foot to market to Maki advantage of technology transitions. Our engineering team has produced the strongest and above the to put online than in a competition. Later in the year 20trails where the year of technology transition to Sandy bridge and Supermicro is ready for challenge and opportunity. Operator at this time we ready for questions.
Operator: All right. Thank you Sir. Well ladies and gentlemen our question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. (Operator Instructions). I’ll take your first question from Mark Kelleher with Dougherty & Company.
Mark Kelleher – Dougherty & Company: Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. You mentioned that there were some customer order delays waiting for the new technology transition and you indicated there were some effects on the revenue from the hard disk drive storages. Can you kind of cite those which one had more of an effect?
Howard Hideshima: Hey, Mark. This is Howard. Yeah, we mentioned one customer that we had shipment that was delayed and so it was less than 10% customer per se. So again, we’re not disclosing too much for confidentiality reasons, but it was along that magnitude. The hard disk drives certainly did play also into the some of the delays and shipments that we did have and although not the magnitude of December period time March was more so.
Mark Kelleher – Dougherty & Company: All right. And on the gross margin side, the Taiwan opening, the manufacturing, did that have much of an effect either way in the quarter?
Howard Hideshima: It had some. Obviously, we’re not at full capacity there as of yet. So we have more expenses and we’re recovering our investments at SAT, but it is good for us.
Mark Kelleher – Dougherty & Company: But it did have much of an effect either way on gross margin?
Howard Hideshima: It did have some on a negative basis. Yeah.
Mark Kelleher – Dougherty & Company: Okay. And last question is on R&D. You did ramp that up a bit in the quarter. Is this – as a percentage of sales, this is a sustainable level that we should expect going forward?
Charles Liang: Indeed, R&D aggravated in last many quarters. We had grown engineering resource and that for sure have some impact to our financial reports. However, most products have been finished developing. So now we yet start to (inaudible) and our profitability. So R&D basically has much growth in terms of head count and investment now.
Mark Kelleher – Dougherty & Company: Okay. Great, thanks.
Operator: All right. Thank you very much. Now moving on, we’ll go to Aaron Rakers with Stifel Nicolaus.
Aaron Rakers – Stifel Nicolaus: Yeah, thanks for taking my question. On the guidance, let’s just use the midpoint as the basis of your guidance range. How are we thinking about the mix between systems and subsystems in the current quarter?
Charles Liang: Looks like the complete the system we are continuing to grow. Again, at Sandy Bridge, we like that system because average being pushed to maximum based on the performance per watt and that’s why companies previously is very beneficial to customer. So next to your customer, when they receive, it’s already optimized reliable system that we have.
Aaron Rakers – Stifel Nicolaus: Let me ask you different way maybe. When we look at the last five years, I thing you’ve grown that sequentially about 15%. However, last year you grew that business sequentially in the fiscal fourth quarter about 40%. I’m just still trying to gauge underneath of that and giving the implications for the gross margin. Are we to assume 40% plus sequential growth, or something more normal seasonality. I would assume with the wrong way cycling, you’re assuming something that’s much higher than typical seasonality.
Charles Liang: Yeah. Right now, If you take the midpoint of the guidance, I think you’ll see like, as I mentioned, we probably have about 23% increase in revenue sequentially.
Aaron Rakers – Stifel Nicolaus: And then, the server mix, it’s trouble eluded to. Again we’re hoping that that’s going to increase, as we go long. Obviously, Sandy Bridge is a tougher product to implement. And so, this is allowing our engineers really to show, and the integrated solution is the best thing for the customers from a quality perspective.
Charles Liang: Especially now, we have a much stronger (inaudible) supply contracts and also memory support, the major support from original manufacturer.
Aaron Rakers – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. So it sounds like you’re assuming not much of a change in your mix of the business?
Charles Liang: Yeah.
Aaron Rakers – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. Follow-up from me would be is that when we’ve seen – we’ve discussed in the past prior server cycles, obviously in the – kind of the depths or the downturn and you really didn’t get the uplift from a pricing power perspective. I think you made the comment that you’ve taken some discounting of the table. Your ASP’s continued to increase. Is it still fair for us to go back to the (inaudible) and use that as the benchmark for gross margin, potential upside or expansion as we think about the wrong way cycles over the coming quarters, or put more systemically 150, 200 basis points expansion of gross margin, is that a fair assumptions as we work through this wrongly cycle?
Howard Hideshima: I think so. And basically, we have our long-term model out there. We believe it’s achievable, that shows the 19 to 22 gross margin in the next year. So again, as we get into the cycle, as we fully utilize the Taiwan facility in the second half of this year, we see the ramp of the wrongly products or Sandy Bridge products. Those are all beneficial to us.
Charles Liang: And fair to be available.
Aaron Rakers – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. Final thing from me would be is on the Internet data center vertical. I think, last time it was just high, I think, there was a somewhat of a large customers within that, that drove that business. How are we thinking about the visibility and that now 16% of revenue and what looks to be somewhat lumpy over the last couple of quarters due slightly the percentage of our datacenter and COU applications we’re continuing as we grow because, again I will put those solution compete or a rack we see even than it has been very attractive to those customer now. Okay. Thanks, guys.
Charles Liang: Thank you.
Operator: All right. Thank you, we’re moving to we’ll take a question from Rajesh Ghai with ThinkEquity.
Rajesh Ghai – ThinkEquity: Thanks. I wanted to dig deeper into what Howard already mentioned about getting into long-term supply contracts with your hard disk drive suppliers. So if we look ahead with your guidance, are you confident that the entire guidance range you will not have any obvious straight supply constraints in your fiscal fourth quarter?
Charles Liang: Kind of before we – we now have four more constraints between in – March, early March, finally we have a strong, much stronger partnership that’s what’s why we signed a contract, so I was surprised to be much more stable, and hopefully also stronger support.
Rajesh Ghai – ThinkEquity: So, you should be able to deliver everything that you have in your guidance that is one-time, there is no hard disk that could prevent you from hitting any part of your guidance into high end of the guidance?
Charles Liang: Yes. It should be much better position now.
Rajesh Ghai – ThinkEquity: Okay. And as far as you know the facilities are concerned, Thailand and Netherlands facilities are concerned, you talked about the Thailand facility kind of reaching full capacity by the end of the calendar year ‘12, is that right?
Charles Liang: Yeah. Basically, in the meanwhile, because of the hard drive shortage in Asia and in Europe, that is also very soon.
Rajesh Ghai – ThinkEquity: How do you expect demand to ramp for you guys after the fiscal Q4 would normally be, do you think it’s going to be – with the end of the year, or do you think demand should continue the ramp beyond the fiscal Q4 or do you think that they might be regular seasonality that you typically see in fiscal Q1?
Charles Liang: I guess, the decision we’re continuing for many quarters.
Rajesh Ghai – ThinkEquity: Does the ramp for raw material continue to ramp through the manner low three quarters this calendar year?
Charles Liang: Yes, it is, hopefully.
Rajesh Ghai – ThinkEquity: Okay. Thank you, so much.
Charles Liang: Thank you.
Operator: All right. Thank you very much. Now we’ll go to Glenn Hanus with Needham.
Glenn Hanus – Needham: Thanks. Let’s go back to your business model operating model for a second. You commented on the gross margin side, you think over the next year basically, you can kind of get through your 19% or 20% target there. And then I think your operating model is like 9% to 10% or so, is there a timeframe you think you can get so that? And how do you view the sustainability now if you can of maintaining an operating model up in around 9% or as we get into the next cycle out there, will we go back to something significantly below that, how should we think about that?
Howard Hideshima: Yeah, Glenn. This is Howard. Like I said, one-year target is what we’ve set out there. We’re holding to that basically from now. With regards to the levers to pull I think we are in, as Charles mentioned earlier, we’re in much better position with a variety of different products, technologies, operation perspectives to go off and really get to that operating model that we’ve discussed before or with the next year. And I think after this cycle again, we’re very well positioned and keep on doing the formula that we had here about pulling out the best products, application optimized and then fine tuning our operating model.
Glenn Hanus – Needham: Okay. Can we talk about the high-performance computing sector a little bit? You breakdown the Internet data centers as – it’s usually 10 and now this quarter was 15%. Can you talk about what are your other largest verticals and specifically talk about the high-performance computing sector. Obviously Mellanox had some really strong numbers type to that sector and is that a good growth area for you guys, especially over the rest of this calendar year?
Charles Liang: Yeah, HPC for sure is an area we focus on a lot. Especially our management software is getting available, just staying, we just start to charge a couple of customer with a colorful array of products. So with a completed solution, not just how do we have it now, some management software and computer rack solution. And our switch, out of mine also spiral high in production so all growth is where our HPC market.
Glenn Hanus – Needham: How would you, maybe you could talk about what you’re view as like your top five verticals. I know you’re not going to give numbers or something. But you’re into that data center. With HPC being there may be commented on, what are your top five verticals really from an end-user market perspective and how are they doing?
Charles Liang: I can mention some, like the sales into HPC embedded, IPC in that storage.
Glenn Hanus – Needham: Okay, thank you.
Charles Liang: Thank you.
Operator: All right. Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And next moving on, we’ll go to Alex Kurtz with Sterne Agee.
Alex Kurtz – Sterne Agee: Yeah, thanks for taking the question, guys. So how are you? I just want to clarify one of Glenn’s question here. Did you say you’re going to hit 19% in the year? Did I hear that right or did I miss you that for gross margin?
Charles Liang: I guess it 15 months it’s some time next summer.
Alex Kurtz – Sterne Agee: Sometime in fiscal either end of fiscal and getting the fiscal ‘14 you will be hitting the low end of that gross margin range?
Charles Liang: That’s correct.
Alex Kurtz – Sterne Agee: Okay. So that implies pretty significant ramp from here and I guess that’s stems from the cycle that we are looking at here from Romley and then on top of that, again the Taiwanese build right and we should think about those being sort of equal contributors to that ?
Charles Liang: Yeah, if I think that third statement, Alex, again the Thailand facility we talked about the leverage we’re going to get out of that facility as we fill that one up coming into the end of the year and then further expanding that as the demand grows for us and as Charles mentioned, were ramp to beginning of this new technology refresh cycle with Sandy Bridge and we tried very good things there. All right, sorry, Sandy Bridge. So if I look back at the ASPs, Howard, on the component side this quarter it took a pretty big dip sequentially from 104 to like 100 or so if my math is right.
Alex Kurtz – Sterne Agee: You sort of take me through the pushes and the polls there on exactly why with that HDD related was as far as like that the drivers of that ASP decline on the – in the March quarter?
Howard Hideshima: Yeah, in the March quarter, I mean, we don’t see on the component side of it, it’s really don’t use that as much because and again it’s a mix of either cable or then you’ve got chip that kind of or the other things, so again it’s a real wide swing about what’s in that bucket, so we are really don’t have to track much on the ASPs on that side ?
Alex Kurtz – Sterne Agee: Okay. I guess from a modeling perspective does have an impact, but you also did see an increase sequentially on the server ASP and I guess that was without a full quarter you had some headwinds on HDD market and Sandy Bridge was really out there. So on a lower unit volume quarter-over-quarter, Howard, why was the ASP’s up a little bit?
Howard Hideshima: Yeah again selling more complete systems we had to – we did have some shortages with regards to our HDD so we try to push those and work toward our full service systems that with bare bones, so sell more fully populated system and that leads to higher ASP.
Alex Kurtz – Sterne Agee: Okay. It’s on a sequential basis.
Charles Liang: That’s correct. Okay.
Alex Kurtz – Sterne Agee: All right. Thanks guys.
Operator: All right. Thank you very much. We’ll now go back to a follow-up Aaron Rakers.
Aaron Rakers – Stifel Nicolaus: Yeah, thanks guys. One point of clarification, you guys have made a comment about hard disk drives having some negative impact on the gross margin. Would you be willing to talk about what the headwind it was, as far as that gross margin related to hard disk drives and do you expect that the lift as, you’ve got an (audio gap) availability becomes more adequate as we progress through the year.
Charles Liang: Yeah, for hard drive. Now we have a much more higher and also our boarding we are continuing to grow beginning. All knows we are a mega policy positive from a hard driver point of view.
Aaron Rakers – Stifel Nicolaus: But the hard disk drive did that situation is reflected in the 17% gross margin. There was a negative impact in your model because of that this quarter, correct?
Howard Hideshima: That’s correct. I mean, if you think back on the December quarter, we still had some inventory that we’re required at a lower cost right per hard disk drive. And as I stated in the December call, majority of our margin increase was due to a selling – basically gaining a high margin on those hard disk drives we already had an inventory. By the time December rolled around, we add up all that inventory coming into this quarter, we didn’t have that type of inventory and so we didn’t have that margin benefit from – our low-cost inventory.
Aaron Rakers – Stifel Nicolaus: And you weren’t able to pass all that the price increases through. Did you pass them?
Howard Hideshima: We are on the past increase, but more remember in December quarter, I had inventory that I required low cost before the flood happened (audio gap) and the prices increases happened, we had lower cost hard disk drives already in our inventory, right. But as I is sold those – I got higher margins on that during the December quarter. And you can look into the March quarter, I didn’t have that low-cost inventory to help my margins out this quarter.
Aaron Rakers – Stifel Nicolaus: And so, what I’m asking Howard’s started beating around the bush a little bit. What I’m asking is what was that headwind, on that gross margins in the March quarter?
Howard Hideshima: In the March quarter?
Aaron Rakers – Stifel Nicolaus: Yeah.
Howard Hideshima: Again, it was a majority so we had about – I think it was about hundred point basis move in the December quarter. I stated then that it was majority of that move in the December quarter. And so we didn’t have hardly at any of that this quarter.
Aaron Rakers – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay.
Howard Hideshima: Is that’s fair.
Aaron Rakers – Stifel Nicolaus: Yeah, that helped me a little bit. And then also, how are we modeling OpEx on a total basis going forward and then also how we modeling beyond the June quarter tax rate and then I’ll stop.
Charles Liang: Okay. With regards to the tax rate, let’s take that first because it’s little more unpredictable. I guess again, the R&D credit that it did expire in December, and historically they do they have historically re-initiated the R&D credit this year, I am losing a voting year you want to call that election year. So again lot more decreased visibility with regards to what’s going to happen. However, it does happen again there is a catch up in that quarter for the passage of the R&D credit. So we got it this present quarter, the June quarter here for 30% non-GAAP tax rate. And I think if you look back, we have been guiding around 30%, 31% over the past year.
Aaron Rakers – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. And then our OpEx at $28.7 million, I mean strive we continue to increase that in our model assumptions going forward?
Charles Liang: I think we’re going to continue invest although not at that rate that Charles mentioned already not at the rates because we’ve just gone through the launch of the Sandy Bridge Park prepared many of our parks for relief, and so we’re not going to go at the same rate that we had previously.
Aaron Rakers – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. I’ll take it off-line, thanks.
Charles Liang: Okay.
Operator: Thank you very much. (Operator Instructions). All right, great. At this time, we have no further questions I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Liang for any additional or closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Yeah, thank you for joining us today, and we’re looking forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you everyone, have a great day.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, that thus conclude the Super Micro third quarter fiscal year 2012 conference call. We do appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you.

And now, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Hayes.  Please go ahead, sir.
Perry Hayes: Good afternoon, and thank you for attending Super Micro’s conference call and financial results for the second quarter fiscal year 2012, which ended December 31, 2011. Before we begin, I’d like to advise you of upcoming investor conferences in which Super Micro will be participating.  On February 11th, we will attend the Stifel Nicolaus Technology and Telecom Conference in Dana Point, California where we will present and participate in one-on-one meetings. By now, you should have received a copy of today’s news release that was distributed at the close of regular trading and is available on the company’s website.  As a reminder, during today’s call, the company will refer to a presentation that is available to participants in the Investor Relations section of the company’s website under the Events and Presentation tab.

In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today’s press release and in the supplemental information attached to today’s presentation. I’ll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon everyone.  Please turn to Slide 4. First, let me provide you with the highlights of our second quarter.  The second quarter revenue was 249 million, or 0.8% higher than last quarter, and is 3.8% higher year over year. Non-GAAP income was 11.2 million, or 6.5% higher quarter over quarter and 16.3% lower compared to last year. [Inaudible] non-GAAP earning per share was $0.25 per share compared to $0.74 last quarter or $0.31 last year. Slide 5 please. The [inaudible] and [inaudible] order for our process was strong in the December quarter and at the same time, the December quarter was challenged mainly due to the flooding in Thailand.  That affected our [inaudible] supply chain.  As a result, we weren’t able to fulfill customer’s demand due to delay of hard drivers. Where we have some hard driver stock at a beginning of a quarter, our sales for hard driver orders aren’t able to fulfill our need and – when we reach the end of the quarter. In the beginning of the new quarter, I mean, the March quarter, the situation, however, had improved a little on recovering of hard driver supply.  But it is not expected that the hard driver supply will quickly be sent to a normal space in this quarter. Again, the demand for our product is even stronger as we enter this quarter and we had strong backlog of orders that would depend on hard drives.  We are working through this order as the hard driver quantity becomes more available in the near future. In the December quarter, we did a good job of receiving our exceeding our [inaudible] line, Sandy Bridge, [inaudible].  We had many high-volume customers and various interests in evaluation of our new Sandy Bridge space called [inaudible]. This quarter, we are continuing with this deployment to burden our earnings of our revenues to supply the new product sooner to the official launch [inaudible]. From that, the outcome [inaudible] this quarter, the United States accounts for 56.7% of revenue.  Europe was 23% and Asia was 18%.  Sequentially, the U.S. and Europe were each – Europe [inaudible] lower where Asia was 2.3% higher. On a year-over-year base, we are pleased to see the continued growth in our Asia business, which was 2.2% higher. Also, in spite of the headwinds with the Europe debt crisis, our Europe [inaudible] was 4.2% higher than last year. Last quarter, OME and Direct customers account for over 44.2% of revenue and Internet Data Center was 9.7% of total revenue.  As a result, a strong OEM and Direct business. System sale was also – continued to be a strong and account for over 44% of sales. I mentioned earlier about [inaudible] and sampling activity of our Sandy Bridge Solution from that quarter.  They are made possible by investing heavily in R&D to meet that technical challenge on the new [inaudible]. We had approximately 15% more engineers to our R&D group in the past two quarters as we have said before.  It seems very important to keep investing in our engineering staff in order to maintain our time to market advantage and maintain strong [inaudible] technology and innovation. Let me emphasize again, that TTM, time to market, and innovation are essential to our growth and possibility. While our new Sandy Bridge Solution [inaudible] for customer, out based the performance as a lower power consumption, sort of in the complexity of a new platform that requires strong engineering skills.  Sandy Bridge [inaudible] will provide a unique opportunity for Super Micro to demonstrate the power of it’s engineering advantage. I would like to provide you with an update on our capacity expansion.  Last quarter, we complete our Taiwan facility and again, [inaudible] production line and moving in some of our people.  On January 6th, we hosted a grand opening event that was attended by high-level government officials including a Vice President of Taiwan We expect to have a production [inaudible] of (29) during this quarter.  This is really a remarkable achievement in our effort to improve the logistical location of Super Micro, which will lead to lower production and logistics [inaudible]. In addition, it will allow us to grow more quickly in Asia as well as in Europe as [inaudible] to the company and to our customers. Regarding our current group of [inaudible].  Storage and blades grew stronger year over year.  Direct Solutions and GPU remains strong but a little bit weaker sequentially Our recently launched new products such as Networking Switch, MicroCloud and the 8-way server continue to grow steady. However, the story of 2012 in our industry will be a technology decision to Sandy Bridge.  Given the increased performance and best power consumption, the customer will be able to improve their PCO and ROI from IT investment by adopting Sandy Bridge. We expect that [inaudible] will be strong because it’s in three [inaudible].  [Inaudible] major technology solution. As I mentioned before, Super Micro has invested very heavily if R&D to be able to have the broadest array of Sandy Bridge choice to offer to the market.  Most of our current systems and storage architecture will undergo that Sandy Bridge to get a performance boost. In addition, we will have an exciting year architecture of creation that will be introduced at the end of this quarter, which will further optimize our Sandy Bridge product line. Let me now update you with more detail on our new and leading technologies.  Slide 7 and 8.  Our next X9 Sandy Bridge DP solution are in the simple stage now with targeted  this much for high-volume product release.  We will update our interest in [inaudible] and introduce new architecture such as WIO.  The next X9 performs such features such as additional memory, higher PCIE critical performance and bandwidth; a much better CPU overall performance while consumed best power.  Most of the new system, will also feature that new-generation high-efficient [inaudible] that can reach more than 94% efficiency in both light and heavy loaded. The other [inaudible] solutions that are being featured in our X9 service [inaudible] is the high-temperature operation capability.  This solution will make free-air cooling become easier and help the customer achieve a PUE of 1.1 or even better. Our [inaudible] Interlagos Solutions are in mass production now.  It is over 16 [inaudible] per CPU and the product is 1,600 [inaudible] memory seat, which had proven very popular amount IPC and other applications. Our GPT optimized product lines, 1U, 2U, 4U and they perform – and [inaudible] provider extreme performance in calculation of high-density applications and have been the most popular GPU server in the market while continuing the omentum of leading the market.  Our [inaudible] the recommended GPU include 3 one new 4U GPU and 2U/6GPU and are in high-volume production now. Our embedded server line featuring low power, low noise and [inaudible] optimized for special server applications and IPC applications.  This new product line brings us additional revenue from the new market segments. Also, our new workstation product line features a new workstation with a high efficiency super-quiet power supply and high –performance IO support.  Our new specialized workstation product line to support an ever-rest processer [inaudible] optimizes [inaudible] high frequency of certain applications. Our Cloud environment optimizer [inaudible] 1U, 10G switch have been in high-volume production.  Our 10G and (284) and (48) [inaudible] and SLP product and [inaudible] for [inaudible] and sent out.  We will be ready for production soon and [inaudible] in term of performance and cost. Our new MicroCloud [inaudible] is in high-volume production now.  The first of which is 3U in conjunction with a UP node.  Its high-density and high-efficiency design makes it an optimized solution for hosting and car applications in an extremely low-power consumption combination. Our computer rack solution has been a success for [inaudible].  With our increasing engineering and expertise and long hour [inaudible] quality control, the [inaudible] will compete a rack providing the customer of [inaudible] of power-on convenience in a trouble-free unit.  We are expecting faster growth of our computer rack solution unit in the near future. For more specific detail on that second quarter, let me turn it over to Howard Hideshima.  I will focus my remarks on earnings, growth margins, operating expenses and similar items on an non-GAAP basis, which reflects adjustments that include stock compensation and expenses. Reconciliation of GAAP to non GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company’s – in today’s earnings release and in the supplemental detail in the slide presentation accompanying the conference call. Let me begin with the review of the second quarter second quarters income.  Please turn to Slide 8. Revenue was $249.9 million, up 3.8% from the same quarter a year ago and up 0.8% sequentially.  The increase in revenue from last year was primarily due to Server Solutions, which incorporated out growing storage and blade product lines as well as the ramp of our full rack solutions. The sequential increase in revenue from last quarter was primarily due to the growth in our server solutions such as Blade and our new MicroCloud Solution, also in part by shortages in hard disk drives caused by the Thailand flood. Our percentage basis, Blade and MicroCloud were the fastest growing product lines from the prior quarter. Slide 9.  Turning to product mix, a portion of revenues from server systems was 44%, which was an increase from 40.5% a year ago and from 39.4% last quarter.  ESP for servers was $1,800 per unit which is up from $1,600 last year and up from $1,700 last quarter. We shipped approximately 62,000 servers in the second quarter and 998,000 subsystems and accessories.  We continue to maintain a diverse revenue base with over 500 customers, without any of these customers representing more than 10% of our quarterly revenue. Internet Data Center revenue was 5.7%, which was an increase of 9.2% in the prior quarter. Furthermore, 56.7% of our revenues came from the U.S. and 55.8% from our distributors and resellers. Slide 10 and 11.  Non-GAAP gross profit was 42.8 million, up 6.1% from 40.4 million in the same quarter of last year and up 7.5% from 39.8 million sequentially.  On a percentage basis, gross margin was 17.1% up from 16.8% a year ago and up from 16.1% sequentially. Price changes from
Howard Hideshima: Thank you, Charles.  Good afternoon everyone. I will focus my remarks on earnings, growth margins, operating expenses and similar items on an non-GAAP basis, which reflects adjustments that include stock compensation and expenses. Reconciliation of GAAP to non GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company’s – in today’s earnings release and in the supplemental detail in the slide presentation accompanying the conference call.

Slide 10 and 11.  Non-GAAP gross profit was 42.8 million, up 6.1% from 40.4 million in the same quarter of last year and up 7.5% from 39.8 million sequentially.  On a percentage basis, gross margin was 17.1% up from 16.8% a year ago and up from 16.1% sequentially. Price changes from (Able Com) resulted in no change to gross profit in the quarter with total purchases representing approximately 18.5% of total cost of goods sold compared to 23.1% a year ago and 18% sequentially. A year-over-year increase in gross margin resulted from increase in sales of Server Solutions, which typically have higher margins as well as a the higher margins due to our disk drive pricing.  Sequentially, gross margins were up due primarily to increases in prices of our disk drive cost caused by the Thailand flood as well as increase in percent of Service Solutions, which typically have higher margins. Slide 12.  Operating expenses were 26.6 million, up from 21.6 million in the same quarter a year ago and up from 24 million sequentially.  As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses was 10.6% up from 9% year over year and 9.7% sequentially.  Operating expenses was higher on an absolute dollar basis year over year and sequentially. A year-over-year increase was primarily due to R&D as we continued to invest in our product portfolio assessing preparation for the Sandy Bridge launch.  Sequentially, we saw an increase of operating expenses of about 2.6 million, primarily due to R&D expense growth by about 1.8 million related to [inaudible] benefits to support new technology launches. In addition, general and administrative expenses grew by about 600,000, primarily due to moving expenses. The company’s headcount increased by 57 sequentially to 1,395 total employees, primarily R&D. Operating profits was 16.2 million or 6.5% of revenue, down from 2.5 million or 13.5% from 18.8 million a year ago and up 0.4 million or 2.4% from 15.8 million sequentially. Our first building in Taiwan was completed on schedule at the end of December.  This expense will drive our ability to service our customers and improve our operational efficiencies around the world. Net income was 11.2 million or 4.5% of revenues, down 2.2 million or 16.3% from 13.3 million a year ago and up 0.7 million or 6.5% from 10.5 million sequentially. Our non-GAAP fully-diluted EPS was $0.25 per share, down $0.06 from $0.31 per share a year ago and up $0.01 from $0.24 per share sequentially.  The number of fully diluted shares used in this second quarter was 44, 625,000. The tax rate in the second quarter one an on-GAAP basis was 30.5% compared to 20.3% a year ago and 33.1% sequentially.  The increase in tax rate from the prior year was primarily due to the R&D credit expiring on December 31st, 2011.  The decrease in the current quarter from the prior quarter was due to an increase in investment in R&D. We expect the expected tax rate on a non-GAAP basis to be approximately 31.5% for the March quarter, which is higher than 28.3% in the same quarter last year. Turing to the balance sheet on a sequential basis, Slide 13.  Cash and cash equivalent and short and long-term investments were 106.1 million, up 10.1 million from 96 million in the prior quarter, and up 13.4 million for 92.7 million in the same quarter last year. In the second quarter, free cash flow was positive 4.4 million.  Slide 14. Accounts receivable decreased by 7.7 million to 8.1 million with DSOs was 31 days, a decrease of one day from the prior quarter.  Inventories increased by 4.4 million to 93.4 million with the days in inventory increasing by one day to 85 days.  The increase in inventory was due in part to prepare for the upcoming Sandy Bridge launch. Accounts payable decreased by 7.7 million to 115.9 million with the day sales increasing by one day to 53 days primarily due to the timing of payments to vendors. Overall, the cash from virgin cycle days were 63 days, a decrease of one day from 64 days in the prior quarter. Now for it’s few comments and outlook.  As indicated previously, during the second quarter, we felt strength in our broad product line.  We have continued our sampling and pre-sale activity for Sandy Bridge Solutions, which are very complicated but promise to deliver many benefits to our customers.  However, while our demand for our product was strong, we were unable to deliver due to the shortage of hard disk drives caused by the Thailand flood. So as we enter the March quarter, which is seasonally a week quarter for the industry, we have strong demand as evidenced by current backlog and we are continuing to work with our vendors and partners to minimize the impact to our hard disk drive supply.  The situation has improved since October 2011 when the flood occurred. In addition, we completed construction of our Taiwan facilities and had our grand opening on January 6th.  We will be starting to ramp the facility and putting inventory in place to support the final testing and capabilities. Therefore, the company currently expects net sales in the quarter ending March 31, 2012 in a range of 240 to 270 million.  Assuming this revenue range, the company expects non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.19 to $0.27 for the fourth quarter.  It is currently expected that the outlook will not be updated until the release of the company’s next quarterly earnings announcement, notwithstanding subsequent developments; however, the company may update the outlook or any portions thereof at any time. With that, let me turn it back to Charles for some closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Howard.  In summary, the strong demand from our customer [inaudible] to be closer to market and to demonstrate the power of our brand as technology innovators.  We [inaudible] and logistics are fully ready and we feel the upcoming Sandy Bridge [inaudible].  Our investment has almost come to fruition.  Calendar 2012 will be the year of technology to Sandy Bridge and Super Micro is ready for a challenge and the opportunity. Operator, at this time, we are ready for questions.
Operator: (Operator instructions).  And we’ll go first to Mark Kelleher with Dougherty and Company.
Mark Kelleher: Great, thanks for taking the questions.  I wanted to start with the hard disk drive shortage.  What are you doing with your suppliers to secure that supply?  I'm interested in what steps you’re looking at and maybe the tradeoff between buying a higher-priced inventory and passing that along.  And do you think – would that hard disc drive shortage in this quarter and the next quarter get in the way of the Romley launch?  Is that going to limit what you can do with that Romley launch?
Charles Liang: Thank you for the question.  Indeed, we saw a completed season about four years ago, so our hard drive relationship with Apia [inaudible] compare with our PO and competitors.  However, that relationship has been improving a gradually especially in the last couple months.  So we do feel our situation in [inaudible] hard drive is improved today.  It’s much better than December timeframe.  So we see that improvement, and we will continue to work on that.  So for [inaudible] launch, I believe we will be in safe position.
Operator: Anything additional, Mr. Kelleher?  I'm hearing no response.  (Operator instructions).  We’ll move next to Glenn Hanus with Needham and Company.
Glenn Hanus: Yes, good afternoon guys.  So you have guided a pretty wide range for revenues and EPS.  Should I assume that the primary reason for the wide range is the drive situation?  And should I assume that you would be towards the upper end of that range if drive supply works out well for you, that that’s more a reflection of the demand?
Charles Liang: Yes, the reason why we over the range is because of hard drive deal and not visible.  But again, that’s [inaudible].  Spaces today, we feel much better than December timeframe.
Glenn Hanus: So can you address the rest of my question?
Howard Hideshima: Glenn, like I said, I think what we would say is the demand is strong.  The backlog is strong, so clearly as Charles mentioned, we’re building our relationships to hard disk drives and we feel it’s better.  But again, the wider range is due to the hard disk drive.
Glenn Hanus: Do you have a sense of sort of a timeframe when you feel like it would more or less be maybe some impact this quarter?  How are you feeling about as you look out sort of towards the June quarter?
Charles Liang: As of this moment, we feel the hard drive condition will be slightly better than December quarter.  And again, because of the unknown factor, we are not just sure.  That’s why I give a nodule rate.
Glenn Hanus: Okay, I’ll hold it to one question and circle back.  Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions).  We’ll move next to Dan (Doliff) with Morgan Stanley.
Dan (Doliff): Just a quick question.  Can you please comment on server demand in the previous quarter?  And in the coming quarter, any trends that you’re seeing or anything that you could  shed some light on?  Thank you.
Charles Liang: December quarter indeed, we’ve seen a very strong demand, and that’s why we have big backorders.  But because of hard drive supply was not efficient.  That’s why we did not ship it that much.  However, March quarter, I mean this quarter because Sandy Bridge will be in full production.  So we see a strong demand there, and we believe for this quarter will be at least slightly better than our December quarter.
Dan Doliff: Thank you very much.
Operator: And we’ll move next to Matt Nahorski with Stifel Nicolaus.
Matt Nahorski: Hi, guys, a quick question for you around the internet data center verticals.  Could you talk about some of the trends that you’re seeing there as well as how that bakes into your guidance going forward?  I mean do you  continue to see kind of a lumpiness in the revenue stream there?  And just any comments around that would be helpful.  Thanks.
Howard Hideshima: Matt, this is Howard.  Yes, we do see lumpiness.  You know, it’s a project base system, so we do see lumpiness there.  However as indicated, the Sandy Bridge product is going to be a good product.  And so we’ve got a full line of Sandy Bridge products coming out that will take the benefits of that.  That should be very appealing to the data center as well as all the other HEC clients that we have.  So we see pretty good demand, strong demand in that area.
Operator: (Operator instructions).  We’ll take a follow up question from Glenn Hanus with Needham and Company.
Glenn Hanus: Hi, again.  So just shifting to operating expenses for a minute, it sounds like on the G&A line, you mentioned some moving expenses, so I assume that’s sort of non-recurring.  So would we expect lower G&A in the March and June quarters?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, Glenn, you’re exactly right.  We won’t incur some of those moving expense.  However, I do have some audits and tax fees that I will be paying, so you won’t see as much of a move as you saw in the previous quarter to quarter.
Glenn Hanus: Okay, but it will be lower sequentially in March?
Howard Hideshima: It will be slightly higher.
Glenn Hanus: Slightly higher, okay, and then on the R&D side, this 14ish level, should we think about that now that you’ve gotten over the hump on Romley?  That should be trending a little lower, or flattish, or how should we think about that over the next couple quarters?
Charles Liang: Yes, indeed we have higher indeed of 15% more engineering head count in the last two quarters.  That’s pretty much to meet the Sandy Bridge demand.  But now in the next two quarters, we have a pretty much our engineering manpower now, so we won’t increase that much in the near future.
Glenn Hanus: Okay, and then on the gross margin line, could you comment a little bit on how we should think about gross margins in the next couple quarters, puts and takes there?  It sounds like the drive situation actually benefitted you in the December quarter if I heard you right.  So could you talk about that?
Charles Liang: The next few quarters, yes, the hard drive quotient may be not that sexy, but Sandy Bridge put out a new product with good technology, which will help us a little bit.
Glenn Hanus: Okay, all right, thank you very much.
Operator: (Operator instructions).  We’ll take a follow-up question from Mark Kelleher with Dougherty and Company.
Mark Kelleher: Great, thanks.  I just wanted to follow up with Glenn’s question on gross margins.  Can you talk about the Taiwan facility, and how we should think about that coming online.  And what effect will that have in the March quarter and maybe further out how that should ramp up.
Charles Liang: The Taiwan operation was [inaudible] much lower than Bay Area, so eventually, we’ll be able to take that advantage.  However for March quarter, because it’s a new facility, so [inaudible].  So I will say that eventually, we’ll have it, but not immediately.
Mark Kelleher: Two quarters, June quarter help?
Charles Liang: June may have more.  September will have even more.
Mark Kelleher: Okay, thanks.
Operator: (Operator instructions).  It appears at this time, we have no further questions.  I’d like to turn the call back over to Mr. Liang for any additional and closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you for joining us today.  And we look forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter.  Thank you everyone.  Have a great day.

Peter Hayes: Good afternoon and thank you for attending Super Micro’s conference call on financial results for the FQ1 2012, which ended September 30th, 2011.  Before we begin I’d like to advise you of upcoming investor conferences in which Super Micro will be participating.  On November 9th we will attend the Wells Fargo Technology Conference in New York and on November 17th we will attend the Southwest Ideas Conference in Dallas where we will present and participate in one-on-one meetings. By now you should have received a copy of today’s news release that was distributed at the close of regular trading and is available on the company’s website.  As a reminder, during today’s call the company will refer to a presentation that is available to participants in the Investor Relations section of the company’s website under the Events & Presentations tab.  Please turn to Slide 2. Before we start I’ll remind you that our remarks include forward-looking statements.  There are a number of risk factors that could cause Super Micro’s future results to differ materially from our expectations.  You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10(k) for fiscal 2011 and our other SEC filings.  All of those documents are available from the Investor Relations page of Super Micro’s website  at www.supermicro.com.  We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Most of today’s presentation will refer to non-GAAP financial results and outlooks.  For an explanation of our non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to Slide 3 of this presentation or to our press release published earlier today.  In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today’s press release and in the supplemental information attached to today’s presentation. I’ll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon everyone.  Please turn to Slide 4.  First let me provide you with the highlights of our FQ1.  FQ1 revenue was $247.9 million or 4.8% lower than last quarter, and 19.6% higher year-over-year.  After-tax net income was $10.5 million or 19.3% lower quarter-over-quarter and 13.2% higher compared to last year.  Super Micro’s diluted earnings per share was $0.24 per diluted share compared to $0.29 last quarter or $0.22 last year. Slide 5, please.  With this FQ1 results we have demonstrated a strong start to our earnings fiscal year in the seasonally soft quarter.  We anticipated this softness in our August guidance and this quarter unfolded as expected by achieving approximately 20% revenue growth year-over-year.  In the past two quarters we have sold more than $0.5 billion of server and storage products, indicating good growth momentum, although in these past quarter there were lots of macroeconomic concerns in the United States and in Europe in addition to somewhat seasonal softness.  This impact was relatively minor to our business. From a geographic productive perspective, the United States accounted for 62.1% of revenue and Asia was 15.8%.  While both regions were lower quarter-over-quarter the European share rose to 18.8% last quarter as a strong September was offset by a generally slower summer period.  Last quarter OEM and Direct customers accounted for over 44% of revenue and both groups continued to grow steadily.  Internet Data Center reached 16.4% of total revenue in FQ1 as certain new products were deployed as the result of the higher OEM and Direct business.  System sales also continues to be strong and accounted for over 39% of sales. I will start with details regarding the progress of our new Generation X9 Sandy Bridge dual processor and H8 Interlagos solutions.  As most of our customers are eagerly anticipating them, we have been investing heavily on the final push of the development cycle with our consistently growing engineering team.  We will again be first to market with our phase of the product among competition. We overcame the technical challenge and had carefully tuned and test-engineered a subsystem and a completed solution to ensure them of optimized performance and features before full bore putting us in.  Last quarter we began entering into our presale activities through simple and qualifying servers for Sandy Bridge and Interlagos with our customers on specific projects.  We are anticipating the launch of Interlagos with great momentum next month.  For Sandy Bridge we will continue to increase our tempering and seeding programs and work with large datacenter customers for an early ship program during this quarter, and we expect they will generate additional revenue.  However, we anticipate a significant revenue growth from those new solutions to begin in early 2012. Let me briefly touch base on the Subsystems side of our business since they are essential to our complete system offering.  Regarding components’ pricing and availability, we continued to see a decline in memory pricing last quarter and we did a much better job managing inventory and timing of our projections to the impact of the Japanese earthquake and tsunami.  On the software side we recently have partnered with Microsoft to provide a Window OS as part of our complete system solution.  We are optimistic that this collaboration will bring additional value to our customers and revenue to us in the long term. I would now like to provide you with an update on our capacity expansion.  We have made significant progress at our Taiwan facilities.  Phase one is on track to be completed in the next couple of months and then we should begin outfitting the building and the setting of our first assembly line in December.  We expect to have production going out of [29] in Q1 of next year.  This is really a special achievement in our efforts to improve the logistical foundation of Super Micro.  Furthermore, the completion of phase one in the next few months will allow us to house more engineers as well as some more administrative activities in Taiwan.  When the facility is fully ready by the second half of 2012 it should provide a strong regional operation force to supply Asia and Europe at an attractive cost to the company. In addition to Taiwan we are nearly complete with the expansion of our production facility here in the United States, our San Jose campus.  This will add significant logistical capacity to our US operation and allow us to consolidate our warehouse.  To prepare for our capacity expansion we have continued to add headcount in the last several quarters.  For example, we have been adding production staff  in Taiwan, scheduled to be online later this year.  Additionally we have been adding on engineers in Taiwan because we intend to utilize the specialized local talent.  We also added  hardware engineers to help prepare for the upcoming launch of next generation (inaudible). Regarding our current solutions, storage and GPUs grew sequentially and year-over-year as demand continues to grow especially in oil & gas, university, medical and finance.  We began deploying rack solutions sales only recently and our rack sales were up strongly over last quarter.  Other relatively new products such as Switch, MicroCloudTM and the 8-way server are ramping quickly now.  Overall we are very excited to see the progress in the development of our product line to provide our customers with a total solution and our customers are responding with a steady, growing demand.  Now Slides 7 and 8, please. I would like to now update you with more detail on our new and leading technologies.  First, our new X9 Sandy Bridge dual processor solutions are in simple stage now with targeted Q1 2012 for high-volume production release.  We were up there, leading in industry performance such as Twin and introduce a new architecture such as 1 and 2U and [WIO].  The new X9 performs post additional memory connectivity, PCIE performance and the bandwidth. Second, the H8 Interlagos solutions in seeding with our official November release is an [04 up to 16 GPUs] CPU which have proven very popular among HP, PC and other applications.  Our GPU optimized product line in 1U, 2U, 4U and (inaudible) provide an extreme performance in calculation  in high-density applications and have been the most popular GPU server in the market.  While continuing the momentum of leading the market our new generation local GPUs are including 1U per GPU and 2U/6GPU support are in high-volume production now. Our embedded  server line featuring low power, low noise and small (inaudible) optimized for special server applications in enterprise and IPC applications.  This new product line brings us additional revenue from the new market segments, and our new workstation product line features a new workstation in conjunction with the high efficiency super-quiet power supply and high-performance IO support.  Our new specialized workstation product line will support the ever-rest processer optimized for high-frequency trading, a low spectrum for trading applications. Our Cloud environment optimizer – 1G, 10G, layer two or layer three, and layer three switch have been in high-volume production now.  Our 10G and 284 and 484 has [AOP plus] and 10G (inaudible) switch for play and for center on box.  We’ll be ready for volume production very soon, and the cost and performance should both be outstanding in the market. Our new generation MicroCloudTM is just in production.  The first version is in 3U and conjunction with 8 uniprocessor nodes.  Its high-density and high-efficiency design makes it an optimized solution for hosting and carrying applications in extremely low power consumption congregations.  Our long awaited datacenter management and power management software is in formal beta stages today and will be ready for normal release later this year.  This software will make it easier for our customers to manage their server and storage equipment. In summary, our FQ1 results have shown a strong start to the new fiscal year.  We have been successful in building our own foundation for a huge job with our strong product lines, our larger capacity expansion in Asia and our increase in engineering intelligence.  We are fully prepared for a strong growth with the launch of our new generation of products in the near future.  For more specifics on the FQ1, let me turn it over to Howard.
Howard Hideshima: Thank you, Charles, and good afternoon everyone.  I will focus my remarks on earnings, gross margin, operating expenses and similar items on a non-GAAP basis, which reflect adjustments to exclude stock compensation expenses.  Reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company and in today’s earnings release, and in the supplemental detail in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Let me begin with a review of the FQ1 income statement.  Please turn to Slide 8.  Revenue was $247.9 million, up 19.6% from the same quarter a year ago and down 4.8% sequentially.  The increase in revenue from last year was primarily due to server solutions which incorporated our growing Blade, GPU forged product lines, as well as the ramp up of our full rack solutions.  The sequential decrease in revenues from last quarter was primarily due to seasonal weakness in the industry.  On a percentage basis, whole rack solutions and switches were the fastest growing product lines from the prior quarter.  These products continue to gain traction as well as our new MicroCloudTM. Turning to product mix, the portion of revenue from server systems was 39.4%, which was an increase from 35.7% a year ago and a decrease from 40.4% last quarter.  ASPs for servers was $1700 per unit, which is up from $1500 per unit last year and down from $1800 last quarter.  We shipped approximately 57,000 servers in FQ1 and 973,000 subsystems and accessories.  We continue to maintain a diverse revenue base with over 500 customers with none of these customers representing more than 10% of our quarterly revenues.  Internet Data Center revenue was 16.4%, which was an increase from 16% in the prior quarter.  Furthermore, 62.1% of our revenues came from the US and 55.8% from our distributors and resellers. Slides 10 and 11.  Non-GAAP gross profit was $39.8 million, up 19.9% from $33.2 million in the same quarter last year, and down 1.5% from $40.5 million sequentially.  On a percentage basis, gross margin was 16.1%, up from 16% a year ago and from 15.5% sequentially.  Price changes from [Ablecomm] results in no change to gross margin, gross profit in the quarter with total purchases representing approximately 18% of total cost of goods sold compared to 20.9% a year ago and 14.9% sequentially. The year-over-year increase in gross margin resulted from an increase in sales of server solutions which typically have higher margins, offset in part by a decline in margins of subsystems and accessories.  Sequentially gross margins were up due primarily to the sale of less memory and hard disk drive components which we bought in response to the Japan earthquake, offset in part by higher inventory reserves. Slide 12.  Operating expenses were $24 million, up from $18.7 million in the same quarter a year ago, and up from $22.7 million sequentially.  As a percentage of revenue, operating expense was 9.7%, up from 9% year-over-year and 8.7% sequentially.  Operating expenses was higher on an absolute dollar basis year-over-year and sequentially.  We saw year-over-year increases in absolute dollars primarily in R&D as we continue to invest in headcount to drive our innovation and product portfolio, especially in preparation for Sandy Bridge and Interlagos releases.  Sequentially we saw an increase in operating expenses of about $1.3 million, primarily due to R&D expenses, growing about $592,000 related to annual salary increases and headcount increases to support new technology launches. In addition general & administrative expenses grew by $365,000 primarily due to professional fees associated with the company’s fiscal year-end audit. The company’s headcount increased by 66 sequentially to 1338 total employees.  Operating profit was $15.8 million, or 6.4% of revenues, up by $1.3 million or 8.8% from $14.6 million a year ago, and down $1.9 million or 10.6% from $17.7 million sequentially.  Our building expansion in Taiwan is scheduled to be completed at the end of this quarter.  This expansion will drive our ability to service our customers and prove our operational efficiency around the world. Net income was $10.5 million, or 4.2% of revenues, up $1.2 million or 13.2% from $9.3 million a year ago, and down $2.5 million or 19.3% from $13 million sequentially.  Our non-GAAP fully diluted EPS was $0.24 per share, up $0.02 from $0.22 per share a year ago and down $0.05 from $0.29 per share sequentially.  The number of fully diluted shares issued in FQ1 was 44,317,000. The tax rate in FQ1 on a non-GAAP basis was 33.1% compared to 35.8% a year ago and 26% sequentially.  The decrease in taxes from the prior year was primarily due to the R&D credit which was effective for this quarter but not in the same quarter last year.  The increase in current quarter from the prior quarter was due to pending expiration of the R&D credit and lower tax deductions from stock options.  We expect the effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis to be approximately 33% for the December quarter. Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis – Slide 13.  Cash, cash equivalents and short- and long-term investments were $96 million, up from $75.2 million in the prior quarter and up from $89.4 million in the same quarter last year.  In FQ1 free cash flow was a positive $17.1 million, the net change in cash was a positive $22.3 million for the quarter. Slide 14.  Accounts receivable increased by $2.8 million to $87.8 million and DSOs was 32 days, an increase of three days from the prior quarter.  Inventory decreased by $3.7 million to $189 million with the days in inventory increasing by one day to 84 days.  The decrease in inventory was due in part to selling off some of the inventory accumulated as a result of the Japan earthquake.  Accounts payable increased by $10.3 million to $123.6 million with the days payable outstanding increasing by one day to 52 days, primarily due to the timing of payments to vendors.  Overall cash conversion cycle days were 64, an increase of three days from 61 days  in the prior quarter. Now for a few comments on our outlook.  As indicated previously during FQ1 we saw strength in our broad product lines, especially in Blade and storage products.  We started to see ramping in our full-rack solutions and switch products which we started investing in during the past year.  In addition we have young sampling and pre-sales activity for Sandy Bridge and Interlagos solutions, so as we enter the December quarter which is sequentially a seasonally strong quarter for the industry, we have a host of new products and platforms available for our growing customer base. As noted earlier, we’re working with our vendors and partners to minimize the impact to our hard disk drive supply due to Thailand floods.  In addition, we are scheduled to complete construction of our Taiwan facility at the end of this quarter.  Therefore the company currently expects net sales for the quarter ending December 31st, 2011, in the range of $260 million to $280 million.  Assuming this revenue range, the company expects non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.27 to $0.33 for the quarter.  It is currently expected that this outlook will not be updated until the release of the company’s next quarterly earnings announcement notwithstanding subsequent developments.  However, the company may update the outlook or any portion thereof at any time. With that let me turn it back to Charles for some closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Howard.  Our results for FQ1 were strong when compared to the same quarter last year and we have made a good start to the new fiscal year.  We look forward to moving into our Taiwan facility this quarter and beginning production.  We are continuing to prepare our various product lines for the upcoming launch of Sandy Bridge.  We have a strong foundation and base from which to execute our strategy to grow our revenue and increase our profitability. Operator, at this time let’s open to questions.
Operator: Thank you, Sir.  (Operator Instructions.)  At this time I’ll go first to Mark Kelleher with Dougherty & Company.
Mark Kelleher: Great, thanks for taking the question.  Congratulations on a good quarter.  Howard, you mentioned the Thailand floods.  Can you elaborate a little bit more on how that might be affecting your Q4 and maybe how much hard disk drive inventory you have as a cushion?
Howard Hideshima: Yeah, Mark, this is Howard.  Thank you for the compliment.  With regards to the hard disk drive inventory situation and the Thailand floods, we do maintain safety stocks so right now we’re assessing it.  We’re looking through that and we’re working our way through our hard disk drive inventory to make sure we have enough for this quarter.
Mark Kelleher: So you’re still evaluating that?
Howard Hideshima: We’re still looking through it.  Right now it’s a developing situation but again we have maintained what I would call reserve inventories.
Charles Liang: It looks like a certain impact for sure, but because we have a very good safety inventory control hopefully that impact won’t be too big.
Mark Kelleher: Okay, and as a follow-up there was some higher priced D-RAM in inventory that you were working through.  Is that all gone now?
Charles Liang: Yeah, that situation indeed has been improving in the last two quarters.  So this quarter we have less concern in that area.
Mark Kelleher: Okay, thanks.
Operator: And we will move along to Aaron Rakers with Stifel Nicolaus.
Aaron Rakers: Yeah, thanks guys and my congratulations as well.  First question, I guess more of a clarification – you had referenced Internet Data Center vertical as being 16.4% of revenue.  I’m a little bit unclear.  I think your presentation kind of indicates that that was 16.4% of OEM plus Direct revenue, so can you clarify that for us?  And I think upon that clarification I think you had one significantly large customer last quarter come into that vertical – can you update us on are there any large customers skewing that because it looks like an extremely continually solid number.
Howard Hideshima: Hi Aaron, thanks for the compliment again.  Yeah, the 16.4% refers to total revenue, that’s a percentage of total revenue.
Aaron Rakers: And any thoughts or indications on is there a significant customer contribution in that?  Because I think you had one customer that was very large last quarter, correct?
Howard Hideshima: In the June quarter we had one customer that was 11% of total revenues and they were in the Internet Data Center area.  This quarter we had no customer in any vertical that was over 10% of our revenues, so you see us being more diversified quite frankly into a number of new growing customers.
Aaron Rakers: And then the other question is, I think I was surprised by the gross margin only 16.1%.  By my math it would seem to imply that you had a fairly solid increase in the actual server system gross margin.  Can you touch on what trends you’re seeing between the segments and how we should necessarily think about that over the next couple quarters?
Charles Liang: I guess the March and June quarters we both had some negative impact from higher cost of D-RAM price and however I’ve mentioned that that situation has been improved this quarter.
Aaron Rakers: So you say both systems and subsystems gross margin increased sequentially?
Charles Liang: For September and June quarter, yes, we saw it from a little bit of higher memory costs.
Aaron Rakers: Okay, thank you.
Operator: At this time we’ll move along to Rajesh Ghai with ThinkEquity.
Rajesh Ghai: Yes, thanks.  Congratulations from my side, too.  On the Romley ramp up, what’s the timing that you’re assuming at this point in time?  I noticed that your guidance for the December quarter is a little neutered compared to the historical growth rate.  Are you assuming some sort of a pause ahead of a big ramp in the first half of next year, calendar year?
Charles Liang: Okay.  Yeah, our December quarter growth, we tried to be more conservative for two reasons.  One is the Thailand flood.  We are closely inspecting and surveying the impacts, and the second is our Sandy Bridge going into very high-volume production in Q1.  So this quarter we will see some seeding but not really high volume.
Rajesh Ghai: And in case, you said you were evaluating the Thailand situation – I just want to make sure that right now it looks like you have significant hard drive capacity that’s going to be impaired.  Is it a possibility that it impacts your ability to produce product this quarter or do you think that you might just have an opportunity to address that situation?  And what kind of pricing impact are you modeling in your gross margin assumption for this quarter?
Charles Liang: Yeah, this quarter we have some safety inventory for sure but it is concerning about if the impact will become bigger; then we may have to pay a higher price to fulfill some demand especially by December.  That’s why we tried to be more conservative.
Rajesh Ghai: So what kind of price increase have you modeled in the gross margin assumption for next quarter?
Charles Liang: At the moment we have…  And I don’t know if people are talking differently but it can be 10% higher in some hard drive costs, and some other models may even be 20%.  But as of this moment still none, not quite solid.
Rajesh Ghai: Okay, and then one last clarification.  You said the Taiwan facilities will ramp – is that going to be in the March quarter of 2012 or is that going to be in the September quarter of 2012?  I just want to clarify that.
Howard Hideshima: Hi, Rajesh.  We’re on schedule as I think Charles mentioned also.  We’re on schedule for complete construction by the end of this quarter in the December timeframe so then we’ll begin to ramp right after that, and taking off (inaudible) of that and putting in lines and beginning to ramp that.
Rajesh Ghai: Great, thank you so much.
Operator: (Operator Instructions.)  Moving along we’ll go to Glenn Hanus with Needham.
Glenn Hanus: Hi, and congrats as well.  Let’s see, so gross margins this quarter, should we look for some sequential growth in gross margins in the December quarter and can you talk about the puts and takes on the gross margin this quarter?
Howard Hideshima: Yeah, Glenn, I think one of the main things that we talked about is the Japan inventory, that being behind us.  It was pretty good in the June quarter.  We saw less with that as we talked about in the September quarter so we think we’re beyond that per se.  Obviously as we have new products onboard and starting to sample and getting ready for the Romley and Interlagos, that’s always a good thing for us.  On the flipside of that, and I’ll say also that the memory pricing or UM pricing was pretty stable this quarter so that was also good for us.  We’ve talked about the hard disk drive situation – that can go plus or minus, let’s put it that way, depending on how it turns out at the end of the quarter.  And then on the negative side I guess…  Like I said, we’re on schedule to ramp the Taiwan facility, we look pretty good there but we’ll still be incurring some costs to ramp that, to get it ready for production capabilities in Q1.
Glenn Hanus: Okay.  Can you give us any color directionally on whether we can see some gross margin expansion this quarter or should we more think about that in March in conjunction with Romley?
Charles Liang: I guess the December quarter probably margins will be slightly better than before, but how much?  You have something more Howard?
Howard Hideshima: Yeah, again Charles is pointing to like I said the benefits from some of the sampling we’re doing with Interlagos and with Romley, also with some of the componentry that we do have in stock, the higher pricing we may be able to obtain on that and its positive effect on margins.  So there’s some positive things for us that we see right now in front of us.
Glenn Hanus: Okay.  On the operating expenses, you came in a little ahead of what I was modeling.  As you look out over the next few quarters do you think we can start to drive operating expenses back down below 9%?
Charles Liang: Yeah, in the past three or four quarters, we did increase a lot of manpower because we had to train our head people in production, in logistics, even in the quality control and offshore.  And that’s why our overhead grew quite a little bit, but so far most of the people are pretty much well trained so in the next few quarters I believe our headcount growth will be more under control.
Glenn Hanus: Okay, great.  And maybe at the macro level could you talk about what you’re seeing by geography?  You did pretty well – do you think it was more share gain on your part or the overall macro situation was not so bad?  Could you maybe talk about that by geography?
Charles Liang: Yeah, I mean as you know we did not focus that much on the USA East Coast before but we have depended a lot on (inaudible) to develop their market in the past few quarters.  So we did see some gain over there and in Europe we had to continue to grow our sales and marketing team, and we have a good feeling about it.  In Asia, yes, we had spent a lot of effort to develop the market there in the last twelve months and it looks like it’s getting mature to us.
Glenn Hanus: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And we do have a follow-up from Aaron Rakers with Stifel Nicolaus.
Aaron Rakers: Yeah, thanks.  In reference to one of your earlier comments, can you tell us how much expense overhang you’re currently deriving from the ramp of the Taiwan facility and how we should think about that after that facility comes online?
Howard Hideshima: Hi, Aaron.  Like I said right now there’s none on the construction part of it, the investment part, but that’s not come onboard yet.  They’re still building and those will be taken over a long period of time so the load from there won’t be that heavy even when it does come onboard.  And as Charles mentioned earlier we did ramp some headcount there; that’s already built into the number.  So it’s a matter of basically utilizing that excess capacity if you want to call it that, or excess manpower that we have – basically fully utilizing it.
Aaron Rakers: And then the final question from me is if you think about what you guys, you know, $270 million mid-point of your guidance, how are you thinking about that sequentially between the two segments?  If I look back you have historically a very strong December quarter; obviously Romley timing and everything else involved here, but I think on average you’ve done over 20% sequential growth in the Systems side.  How are you thinking about the mix of business given your guidance for this quarter?
Charles Liang: I guess you are right – the Romley, Sandy Bridge will both have impacts in Q1, not December.  That’s why we tried to be more conservative for the December quarter.  But yes, December is usually our strong quarter.
Aaron Rakers: So with that I mean are you assuming a fairly consistent mix of business that you saw this last quarter?
Howard Hideshima: Yeah, I think so, Aaron.  If you look through the percentages of the last couple of quarters we’ve felt pretty steady with regards to our servers versus subsystems mix, albeit we had some componentry that we had to get rid of in the June quarter.  But I think you’ll see us being fairly steady.
Aaron Rakers: Okay.
Operator: Moving along we’ll go to Alex Kurtz from Sterne Agee.
Amelia Harris: Hi, this is Amelia filling in for Alex today.  A quick question following up on the Internet Data Center question: how did you see the competitiveness in this vertical over the quarter in terms of the deals you saw?  Were they better or worse versus last quarter?  Did you see any large deals or specific pricing pressure around these deals?
Charles Liang: It looks like not a big change.  It’s been competing since a long time ago and that’s why we are continuing to grow our higher-value architecture, our software value and kind of lowering our operations cost by extending our opportunities to Asia.
Amelia Harris: Okay great, thank you.
Operator: And we do have a follow up from Glenn Hanus with Needham.
Glenn Hanus: Hi, yes, I think an important part of your value proposition over the years has been your first-to-market advantage and you tend to drive better margins during that time.  Just given that Romley, Sandy Bridge has slipped out a bit, has that impacted your first-to-market advantage at all and sort of given some of the competitors a chance to catch up to you?
Charles Liang: I believe we still have a very good chance in terms of TTM, time to market, because for a (inaudible) it’s a really wonderful, really high –performance but also very complicated.  There are lots of technical challenges; for example, how to make the system really power saving and really pushing the performance to maximum; how to really optimize the cooling function including kind of a rather free-air cooling.  So there is lots of technology there, so I don’t believe…  Sandy Bridge, we have a better opportunity than before.
Glenn Hanus: Great, thank you.
Operator: It appears at this time we have no further questions.  I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Liang for any additional or closing comments.
Charles Liang: Thank you for joining us today and we look forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter.  Thank you, everyone.  Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.  This does conclude the Super Micro FQ1 2012 conference call.  We do appreciate your participation, you may disconnect at this time.  Thank you.

Perry Hayes: Good afternoon and thank you for attending Super Micro’s conference call on financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2011, which ended June 30, 2011. Before we begin, I’d like to advise you of upcoming investor conferences in which Super Micro will be participating. On August 31, we will attend the Midwest IDEAS Conference in Chicago and on September 14, we will attend ThinkEquity’s Annual Growth Conference in New York, where we will present and participate in one-on-one meetings. By now, you should have received a copy of today’s news release that was distributed at the close of regular trading and it’s available on the company’s Web site. As a reminder, during today’s call, the company will refer to a presentation that is available to participants in the Investor Relations section of the company’s Web site under the Events and Presentations tab. Please turn to Slide #2. Before we start, I’ll remind you that our remarks include forward-looking statements. There are a number of risk factors that could cause Super Micro’s future results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2010, and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available from the Investor Relations page of Super Micro’s Web site at www.supermicro.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Most of today’s presentation will refer to non-GAAP financial results and outlooks. For an explanation of our non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to Slide #3 of this presentation, or to our press release published earlier today. In addition, our reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today’s press release and in the supplemental information attached to today’s presentation. I’ll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to Slide #4. First, let me provide you with the highlights of our fourth quarter. We are pleased that our fourth quarter revenue was $260 million or 11.1% higher quarter-over-quarter and 29.1% higher year-over-year. This result is a record high for Super Micro. Non-GAAP net income was $13 million or 5.9% higher quarter-over-quarter and 43.1% higher compared to last year. Super Micro’s non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.29 per diluted share, compared to $0.28 last quarter or $0.21 last year. Slide #5, please. In my comments today, I will have to discuss our results last quarter, whereas our achievements during the past fiscal year before providing some insight on our plans for the upcoming year. Last quarter was our best ever quarter for revenue, achieving a record high. In addition, we reached the significant quarterly run rate for $1 billion of annual revenue. The strong revenue came from faster growing sales of Storage, Blades, GPU and the complete Rack. We also saw a significant amount of complete system that make our total system products contributed over 40% of our revenue. Furthermore, 49% of our business last quarter come from OEMs and direct customers, especially internet data center, which were 16% of sales. We are pleased to see that our strategy of increasing sales of complete system together with a higher volume OEM and direct customers has been achieved. Last quarter’s margin primarily were affected by decision we made in the March quarter after the Japan earthquake to keep a higher stock of component inventory as a memory and hard drive in order to prevent supply disruption for our customers. Unfortunately, this quarter we saw a big decline in price for those components, and the while we have been able to reduce those components inventory. The lower margin affects our result. In fact, components of price continue to be weak even into this quarter, which defects the seasonal (inaudible) we saw in our industry. Total effect in our margin this quarter was the higher percentage of internet data center sales via our product in this market segment in strong demand and sales in high volume. This market is also highly accommodative and the margin can be a tighter. For the full fiscal year, we record our highest annual revenue ever and maintains our growth trend at EMEA 30%. Again, we outgrew the risk over the server market, which indicated that we continue to take a market share because of our strong product line, which we continue to improve last year. In particular, our year-over-year growth in Storage was 96%, for Blade it was 244%, and for GPU it was 72% growth. As you know this past year, we launched our Rack product line and we had seen excellent traction from our customers for these total solutions, which can be lowing to a data center and power up immediately. This right now can compete with our top order reg switch with 10-Gigabit Ethernet ability. In the near-term, our reg will be a shift with operating system loaded and combining our management software, which is now in field of testing with customers. Our strategies to continue to deliver more value-add in our system solutions. As we had discussed previously in the past fiscal year, we broke ground on our new Taiwan facility and pleased to report that the construction is on schedule and that we have made a significant progress. Strategically our Taiwan investment is important for several reasons. First, reduced production cost will enhance our margin. Second, reduced logistic cost to support Asia sales as well as the European sales. Third, our faster hand tool market, mainly as for Asia, but elsewhere due to the local helping of our Asia lenders. And fourth, reduced tax rate. So we have made a stronger move in fiscal year 2011 to invest in our future growth and a future profitability. We expect that we will move into the facility in data calendar year 2011 and begin production in the first half of 2012. The full benefit of our Taiwan investment will begin in fiscal year 2013. Last year, we continued to invest in our people growing our income by about 23%. That is the area we can grow occurred in sales and in R&D. We continue to grow income globally as we extend the reach of our sales force particularly in the Asia market. In addition, we grew sales to address new technology market. They are more suitable for application optimized solutions such as OEM and direct customers. For R&D, we invest for our future because now we have above this product line our history including Server, Storage, Blade, GPU, Rack, switch and management hardware. We are continuing to invest in our engineering talent in order to extend our technology leadership. As we look ahead to fiscal year 2012, we have been preparing for upcoming launch of impaired new processor core name Sandy Bridge. We have been investing in our technology to again be first go-to-market which the product maps and the season optimization than any of our competitors. We already have a significant number of favorable power supply in chassis design, testing and are ready for production. (inaudible) launch is expected to occur in Q4 this calendar year. We are ready with a certain pre-sale activities with key customers. We have also been working and developing two new product segments that will have a meaningful impact in fiscal year 2012 and beyond. First of all, we had built from the run up, our suite product line, that operate 1GbE2 and (inaudible) 10GbE (inaudible) and fiber channel over internet switch. This product line is now shipping in volume, and we have become an essential part of our complete rack and they are single solutions. Second, we have been continuously defining our server management software over the last few years. We started with Super Doctor, then IPMI and now we are nearing the launch of our SSM software, which is a Super Micro Server Management software. SSM is a software for management on power usage and server operations of small and largest scale into server deployment. SSM is part of our continuing strategy to strengthen our competitive position by providing small value to our customer with complete Super Micro solution. In summary, with our enhanced product line and now our switch and new season management software, we have improved that Super Micro brand is a complete solution-based company. As this put our know-how in volume production, we are confident that it will produce strong growth in 2012 and beyond. Slide #7 & 8, please. Also for 2012, we have some significant new developments and our new leading technology improved. First, our GPU optimize in product lines, 1U, 2U, 4U and Blade platform provide extreme performance in calculation-intensive applications, and have been the most of popular GPU servers in the market. While continuing the momentum of leading the market, our new generation document GPU server including 1U for GPU and 2U stick GPU to support already for volume production now. Our embedded 79, which are in low power, low noise and some of who have been optimized for a special server price and IPC, I mean Interchip PC applications. This new product line will bring us additional revenue from the new market segment. Our gateway system is a target at high end enterprise emission critical applications with the needs of huge memory capacity and tremendous computing power. The systems have been shift to some financial institute and university research desk. Our SuperRack simplify cable management and maximize air flow for complicated raw command configurations. It also allow easy access front and back optimize for our Twin and Double-Sided our storage architecture. Our cloud environment optimize 1G, 10GbE (inaudible) have been in high volume production. Our 10G, 24 power and 48 power SAP process and 10GbE switch for blade and standalone both, we have ability for production, and are in a leading position in performance and costs, as we enter 10G Ethernet (inaudible). Our new generation MicroCloud is just in production. The new position is (inaudible) with AA UP node. It’s a high density and high efficiency design make in optimize services for hosting and cloud applications in an extremely low power consumption configuration. Also, our remote with data center management and power management software is in formal better stage today. And we have been already for formal release later this year. This all the way makes it easier for our customer to manage their server and storage equivalents. In summary, fiscal year 2011 was a strong year of growth and profitability for Super Micro. We are truly a becoming global company with operation around the world. And we are very pleased to deploy for our 18th year that continue to our trend our strong growth in the profitability. For more specifics on the first quarter, let me turn it over to Howard.
Howard Hideshima: Thank you, Charles, and good afternoon, everyone. I’ll focus my remarks on earnings, gross margin, operating expenses and similar items on non-GAAP basis, which reflects adjustments to exclude stock compensation expense and include custom fees for prior periods. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company in today’s earnings release and in the supplemental detail in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Let me begin with a review of the fourth quarter income statement. Please turn to Slide #8. Revenue was a record $216.3 million, up 29.1% from the same quarter a year ago, and up 11.1% sequentially. The revenue for the fiscal year was a record $942.6 million, up 30.7% for the same 12-month period a year ago. The increase in revenue from last year was fairly widespread among our customer base and product lines. On a percentage basis Blade, Storage and GPUs were the fastest growing product lines which has been gaining traction for the last few quarters. The sequential increase in revenue from last quarter was primarily due to an increase in Internet data center sale. Our percentage basis storage and blade solutions were the fastest growing product line from the prior quarter. We continue to see traction in these products, which we invested in a few years ago and expect to see additional strong success from the new products such as the switch, software and for rack. Turning to product mix, proportion of revenues from server system was 40.4% of total revenue, which was an increase from 32.2% a year ago, and 31.8% last quarter. ASPs for servers was $1,800 per unit, which is up from $1,400 last year and last quarter. We shipped approximately 57,000 servers in the fourth quarter and 1,540,000 subsystems and accessories. While we continue to maintain a diverse revenue base with over 600 customers, this quarter we had one customer, which accounted for $0.11 of our quarterly revenues in the Internet data center vertical. The Internet data center revenue was 16%, which was an increase from 9.6% in the prior quarter. Furthermore, 63.2% of our revenues came from the US and 50.8% from our distributors and resellers. Slide #10 and 11, non-GAAP gross profit was $40.5 million, up 30.2% from $31.1 million in the same quarter last year, and up 6.3% from $38.1 million sequentially. On a percentage basis gross margin was 15.5%, up from 15.4%, a year ago and down from 16.2% sequentially. Price changes from Ablecom resulted in no change to gross profit in the quarter, with total purchases representing approximately 14.9% of total cost of goods sold, compared to14.7% a year ago and 20.3% sequentially. The year-over-year increase in gross margin resulted from an increase in sale of servers, which we have higher margin offset in part by decline in margins of subsystems and accessories. Sequentially, gross margins were down primarily due to the sale of additional memory and hard disc drives, which we bought in response to the Japanese earthquake and a higher percentage of internet data center revenues. The effect of the Japanese earthquake did not disrupt supply and we adjusted our inventories to reflect this. The Internet data center vertical is project-based and typically very competitive. Slide #12, operating expenses were $22.7 million, up from $18 million in the same quarter a year ago and an increase from $20.8 million sequentially. As a percentage of revenue operating expenses was 8.7% down from 8.9% year-over-year and sequentially. Operating expenses was higher on an absolute dollar basis year-over-year and sequentially. We saw year-over-year increases in absolute dollars, primarily in R&D as we continue invest in headcount to drive our innovation of our product portfolio. Sales and marketing also increased primarily due to the growth in headcount to support the growth and revenue and the marketing of new products. Sequentially, we saw an increase in operating expenses of about $1.9 million primarily due to sales and marketing expenses increased by 800,000 for headcount and trade show expenses support the growth of our products. In addition, R&D expenses grew about $800,000 related to less than our credit from our customers as well as engineering material write-offs associated with new product development. The company headcount increased by 61 sequentially to 1,272 total employees. We continue to control our operating expense to leverage our growth of the same time maximizing opportunities for investing in the future. Operating profit was $17.7 million, or 6.8% of revenues, up from $4.7 million or 35.7% from $13.1 million a year ago, and up 500,000 or 2.9% from $17.2 million sequentially. During the quarter we continue our building expansion in Asia, which is scheduled to be completed in late calendar Q4. The expansion of our capabilities will drive our built-in to service our customers and improve our operational efficiencies around the world. Until then we will be making investments in infrastructure, both facilities and headcounts in order to be able to effectively utilize new facility when it is complete. Net income was $13 million, or 5% of revenue, up $3.9 million or 43.1% from $9.1 million a year ago and up $0.7 million or 5.9% from $12.3 million sequentially. Net income for the fiscal year was $47.7 million, up 44.3% from $33.1 million for the same 12-month period, a year ago. Our non-GAAP fully diluted EPS was $0.29 per share, up $0.08 from $0.21 per share a year ago, and up $0.01 from $0.28 per share sequentially. The number of fully diluted shares used in the fourth quarter was 44,876,000. The increase in diluted shares was primarily due to the impact of options which were previously underwater offset in part by 414,000 shares which company retired by the company in exchange for payment of taxes due on the exercise of options. Our non-GAAP fully diluted EPS was $1.10 per share, up $0.32 or 41% from $0.78 per share for the same 12-month period a year-ago. The tax rate in the fourth quarter on a non-GAAP basis was 26%, compared to 30.2% a year-ago and 28.3% sequentially. The decrease in taxes was primarily due to the tax reduction created by the exercise and sale of expiring options during the quarter. We expect the effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis to be approximately 34% for the September quarter, which is comparable to the 35.8% in the same quarter last year. Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis, Slide #13, cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments were $75.2 million, up from $73.5 million in the prior quarter and down from $79.4 million at the end of fiscal 2010. In the fourth quarter, free cash flow was a positive $4.4 million, which reflect $7 million payment of taxes due on expiring options for individuals and exchange for the 414,000 shares of stock, which was retired by the company. The net change in cash was a positive $1.8 million for the quarter. Slide #14, accounts receivable increased by $5.2 million to $85 million, and DSOs was 29 days, a decrease of two days from the prior quarter. Inventories decreased by $12.9 million to $192.7 million with days in inventories decreasing by nine days to 83 days. The decrease in inventory was due impart to some selling-off of some of the inventory accumulated as a result of the Japan earthquake. Accounts payable decreased by $15.2 million to $113.3 million with the days payable outstanding decreasing by 13 days to 51 days primarily due to the decrease in inventory. Overall cash conversion days were 61 days, an increase of two days from 59 days in the prior quarter. Now, for a few comments on outlook, as indicated previously during the fourth quarter we saw strength in sales across our broad product line, especially in Blade and Storage. We continue to see traction in these products which we invested in a few years ago and expect to see additional success from strong new products, such as the Switch, Software and full Rack. Geographically, we saw strength in Asia and the US but some weakness in Europe. However, September is seasonally a weak quarter for the industry. In addition, we are preparing for new technology launches from our partner. Therefore, the company currently expects net sales for the quarter ending September 30, 2011 in the range of $240 million to $260 million. Assuming this revenue range the company expects non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.23 to $0.27 for the quarter. It is currently expected that outlook will not be updated until a release of company’s tax quarterly earnings announcement notwithstanding subsequent developments; however, the company may update the outlook or any portion thereof at any time. With that let me turn it back to Charles for some closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Thanks, Howard. Well, we are pleased that 2011 was another year of success and growth for Super Micro. We now look forward to a strong fiscal year 2012. Our product line had never been better than they are today. With strong offering in Storage, Blade, GPU, Twin family and our new MicroCloud, we are continuing to invest in product development to extend our technology leadership. With the new potential architecture of Sandy Bridge, will be launched in a few months, and with our switch product lines as well as our server management software solutions, we are well prepared to continue our strong growth. Finally, we will be moving into our new Taiwan facility in a few months, which will begin new chapter for Super Micro, both in Asia and global. Therefore, we begin fiscal 2012, we are well-positioned to execute our strategy to grow our revenue, opportunity and sales and to improve our profitability in the upcoming years. Operator, at this time we are ready for questions.
Operator: (Operator instructions) We’ll go first to Mark Kelleher with Dougherty & Company.
Mark Kelleher: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Is it possible to split out the effect of the gross margins between the inventory pricing and the data center product mix? Is that possible with the effect of each?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, the majority of that came out of the inventory.
Mark Kelleher: Okay. This is my follow-up question. As we look forward on the gross margins, how much of that inventory effective going to continue if we assume the prices are in components where they are? What’s the effect going to the next few quarters?
Howard Hideshima: They will more likely we did most of it during the quarter than last quarter, but there’s still some and they’ve been very dependent upon the pricing that comes.
Charles Liang: Some influence for September quarter, but not as much as last quarter hopefully.
Mark Kelleher: Okay, that’s good and thanks, bye.
Operator: And next we will go to Glenn Hanus with Needham & Co.
Glenn Hanus: Good afternoon. You gave a pretty fairly wide range on the revenue. Could you maybe discuss, if you were to be sort of in the lower half of the range, what would be the circumstances that would be, and then kind of the upper half of the range, what would be some of the assumptions underlying that outcome?
Charles Liang: Yes, Glenn, I mean that meanwhile we give out the wider range because there are some uncertainty of Sandy Bridge route because we didn’t know exactly how soon that product will be in high volume. So we try to be more conservative in offering a big range. So it was available earlier for sure our number where we paid over September.
Glenn Hanus: So just my follow-up then on the Sandy Bridge launch, are you thinking that it has versus what you are expecting a couple months ago has it slipped out, and can you sort of quantify the slip?
Charles Liang: At this moment, we heard us there Q4, but how did Q4 will be (inaudible) at this moment. But our product had been pretty ready though. So once the CPU chips are ready, we are ready to go.
Glenn Hanus: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And from Stifel Nicolaus we’ll go to Aaron Rakers.
Aaron Rakers: Yes, tanks, guys. Two questions I guess. I want to go back to the gross margin number, just so I’m clear, can you help me understand the sequential change in your systems gross margin, because I think you guys have made a comment that the incremental mix 16% coming from Internet data center clearly drove gross margin down. So I’m curious are you telling us that the systems gross margin was essentially flat sequentially, or was that down a couple hundred basis points? Any clarity there would be helpful?
Howard Hideshima: Yes. Aaron, this is Howard. With regard to the gross margin, yes, the several gross margin themselves generally higher than our overall subsystems and accessories. As I talked about the memory and hard disc drives again that, that kind of permit both the server margins and the accessories and subsystems, because obviously either sell it separately to some of our partners or you put it into the system, so that effect on both. The second point we brought up was basically the Internet data center. That’s a very competitive area of the market. I think if you go back historically there are times when we’ve had higher percentages of our sales in that vertical and that we have taken some margin hit because of that.
Aaron Rakers: And kind of keeping with that at 16% of revenue clearly, that’s on a significant growth trajectory, albeit lumpy in project-driven. How do we think about the contribution as we move forward and kind of thinking about that as well on a gross margin line? I mean do we expect to continue growth from here, what’s your assumption for this next quarter and looking forward as far as contribution?
Charles Liang: I believe it’s our interest to continue to grow. There are (inaudible) business. However, our Asian operation, kind of our Taiwan facility will be ready in next few months. Once that ready for sure that will lower our cost and we are obviously making that happen.
Aaron Rakers: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Next we’ll go to Rajesh Ghai with ThinkEquity.
Rajesh Ghai: Yes, thanks. On the Internet data centers, are you selling systems or is that subsystems and how much lower is the gross margin for work systems, subsystems or the Internet data centers?
Howard Hideshima: Yes. Rajesh, this is Howard. Again, Internet data centers are primarily our full servers. Okay, we use to put the boxes in for them and then ship them out to. With regard to servers versus subsystems and accessories, on an overall basis, we sense there it could be as much as a 5%-10% gross margin differential between the two categories.
Rajesh Ghai: Okay. And can you update us on the specific timing of the Taiwan facility coming on stream, and when it’ll be fully ramped and also if you could talk about the utilization rate of the Netherlands facility and when you expect that to be fully ramped? Thank you.
Charles Liang: Yes, we start our Netherlands facility about 18 months ago. However, European markets will be solved in another six months, so that kind of slower our utilization of our Netherlands facility. And also Asia, again Asia market is growing quickly but our Taiwan facility won’t be fully ready in about four to five months to go. So after that for sure, once our utilization becomes higher in both Europe and Asia the growth margin will improve.
Rajesh Ghai: Thank you.
Operator: From Sterne, Agee we’ll go to Alex Kurtz.
Emily: Good afternoon. This is Emily in for Alex today. Thanks for taking the question. In terms of your gross margin line outside of structural changes you are making to the supply chain to improve the margin, which new products are you seeing that will help drive margin outside the most in the next year or so?
Charles Liang: I guess, GPU we continue to have slide, and storage, we continue to have a storage part of that going quickly and switch is relatively a new product line and that product line which you have a much better margin.
Emily: Okay, great. And then I have my follow-up, could you give us some color on your expectations of OpEx growth quarter-over-quarter from June to September, are you seeing that is roughly flat or growing? Thank you.
Howard Hideshima: We can keep in good control of our OpEx expenses, we go to annual review cycle for employee base in September and we will see some expenses for payroll, but generally, we kept it fairly close to what our percentage of revenue has been in the past.
Emily: Okay, great, thank you.
Operator: It appears at this time there is no further questions. I’d like to turn the call back over to Mr. Liang for any additional or closing comments.
Charles Liang: Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you, everyone. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does concludes the Super Micro fourth quarter fiscal year 2011 conference call. We do appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect at this time.

In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today’s press release and in the supplemental information attached to today’s presentation. I’ll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon everyone. Please turn to slide four. First, let me provide you with highlights of our third quarter. We are pleased that our third quarter revenue was $234.3 million or 24% higher year-over-year and 2.7% lower quarter-over-quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $12.3 million or 37.2% higher year-over-year and 8.1% lower than last quarter. Super Micro’s non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.28 per diluted share compared to $0.21 last year and $0.31 last quarter. Slide five, please. Now, I would like to share with you some key points regarding our operating performance in the third quarter. We are pleased that we increased our revenue year-over-year by nearly 24% in the March quarter. The March quarter is seasonally our industry’s soft piece quarter, and our strong performance in this quarter indicates that the IT market remains robust and continues to have momentum for our remainder of this calendar year. In the March quarter, due to the delay of Intel new chip, new single processor reach product. We were impacted by the timing of some key products for complete system solutions, which was strong in the previous quarter. However, we were able to grow other sub systems provision to offset this softness. We expected this demand for system solutions to be bunk in the upcoming quarter due to the enhanced season performance. We also experienced a additional impact from earthquake in Japan on a limit number of components, which affected some availability and price. For those certain components, we had planned second source and had been working with the supply chain to ensure availability at a basic cost going forward. Also, to a minor extent, we see some reduced revenue from Japan, which impacts our retail during March, but should not be a major factor going forward.  Super Micro also had PG, it will appeal our new X9 generation dual processor and MP product lines including 9S server boards, chassis enclosure, thermal solutions and power supplies as well as a new direct architecture for leveraging Sandy Bridge processor technology. This next generation product lines will be fully optimized for a highly power efficient HPC, cloud, and [data center]. Let me go over some strong results from our key product lines in the March quarter. First, our storage sales grew by almost 50% over our previous year, especially the double-sided storage solutions advanced steadily now for several quarters and more than double from six months ago. Our storage platforms have been used in data centers and enterprise solutions and our partnership in storage continued to grow. Second, our blade solutions continues to grow this quarter after almost doubling in the previous quarter and are up over 280% from a year ago. This result showed a strong momentum in demand for our operate solutions. Our TwinBlade solution that was launched last quarter had been especially popular due to the superior HD power efficiency and our performance although in a competing breadth.  Third, our March quarter GPU product line had continued to grow from the strong December quarter. This result for March is 81% higher than it was a year ago, which shows that Super Micro technology leadership and innovation in GPU solution is generating demand. Our GPU optimizes product lines in 1U, 2U, 4U and now in blade, provided a high stability available for computational and graphic-intensive applications. The (inaudible) in the March quarter we see our oversea percentage of revenue continue to grow as a percentage of total revenue. North America revenue was approximately 53%, European revenue was approximately 23% and Asia was above 20%. Now Asia region grew strongly last quarter and is quickly becoming our fastest growing region. Although, our economic scale is [fierce] more in Asia, our operation in this region is huge. We are growing our partnership in China, Japan, Singapore, Korea and India. The China market have been a special focus area for us recently. And we are winning businesses with key customers that will allow us to grow quickly in China. As an update to our Taiwan investment, we have broken ground on our first phase of our new facility in Taiwan. We expect that this full surface will be complete by the end of this calendar year and will be ready for production by the first quarter of calendar 2012. Naturally, as we make these investments in our physical infrastructure, we are also building our operating (inaudible) based to support R&D, production, G&A and of course sales and marketing. While we will balance our growth in expense to match our sales growth as much as possible, these investments impact operation expense. The focus we’ve been given in Asia is showing results and investments we are making including our infrastructure in Taiwan will support this region for years to come. Let me now share with you something about our product line that are gearing up for upcoming quarters. Slide six and seven please, along with some new development our leading technology include first, our Twin Architecture for IU and 2U platforms continue our technology leadership momentum. The 2U Twin³ will set another highlight in computational (inaudible). Our award winning TwinBlade is in high volume production now featuring 20/28 DP nodes in a 7U Blade with 40 gigabit per second Infiniband or 10G Ethernet connectivity as option. Our GPU optimized product lines 1U, 2U and 4U and Blade platform provided extreme performance in calculation-intensive applications and have been the most popular GPU server in the market. While continuing the momentum of leading the market, our next generation low command GPU system including 1U for 4GPU support and 2U for 6GPU support product will be available in the coming May. Our embedded server line featured in low-power, low-noise and some of our [foot print optimizing] for special server appliance and IPC applications. This product line were printed as additional revenues from the new market segment.  Also our 8-way system is a target at high-end enterprise, mission critical applications, which is a need of huge memory capacity and a tremendous configuring power. The system have been shipped to some key financial institutes and university research (inaudible). Our SuperRack simplify cable management and maximize the air flow for complicated recommend configuration. It also allow easy access from and back optimize for our twin and double-sided architecture. Our 10G for blade (inaudible) in performance and pricing as we enter our 10G Ethernet market. Finally, our new generation MicroCloud is in prototyping stage now. It has even higher density and higher efficiency design, which is an optimized solution for Web hosting and cloud applications in an extremely low power consumption configuration. In summary, we are entering the final quarter of our fiscal year; we are confidant that we will have a strong finish. With our storage, blade, GPU, and complete rack solution that Super Micro brand awareness continues to grow in the IT market. We look forward to promoting these product line in the upcoming quarter and beyond.  For more specifics on our third quarter, let me turn it over to Howard.
Howard Hideshima: Thank you, Charles, and good afternoon everyone. I will focus my remarks on earnings, gross margin, operating expenses and similar items on a non-GAAP basis, which reflects adjustments to exclude stock compensation expense. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company in today’s earnings release and in the supplemental detail in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Let me begin with a review of the third quarter income statement. Please turn to slide eight. Revenue was $234.3 million, up 23.8% from the same quarter a year ago and down 2.7% sequentially. The increase in revenue from last year was due to the continuation of the server refresh cycle and the continuing ramping of our optimized products. The growth on a percentage basis was primarily in blades and GPU solutions. The sequential decrease in revenue was primarily due to seasonal weakness in the industry and a reduction in OEM and end customer orders from the December quarter. We expect some of the customers to increase orders during the seasonally strong June quarter. On a percentage basis, storage solutions was the highest increase from the prior quarter. Slide nine. Turning to product mix, the proportion of revenues from server systems was 31.8%, which was a decrease from 33.6% a year ago and 40.5% last quarter. ASP for servers was about $1400 per unit, which is down from about $1500, and $1600 per unit last year and last quarter respectively. The decrease in ASP during the quarter was primarily due to a decrease in volumes with some higher ASP projects from our OEM and end customers. We do expect some of these to return this quarter.  The increase in absolute dollars on our server products from a year ago was primarily due to the increase in shipments across our server product lines. The decrease in absolute dollars of server products sequentially was primarily due to a decrease in shipments of servers primarily to our OEM and end customers. We ship approximately 53,000 servers and 1,156,000 sub systems and accessories in the third quarter. The increase in subsystems and accessories was primarily related to customers purchasing additional inventory during the – due to the potential shortage which Japan earth quake produced during the current quarter similar to what we did during the quarter in building up our inventory to minimize risk of supply chain disruption.  We continue to maintain a diverse revenue base but none of our over 500 customers making up more than 10% of our net sales in the third quarter. Furthermore, 53.6% of our revenues came from the U.S. and 60.5% from our distribution and resellers. Internet data center revenues was 9.6%, which was higher than the prior quarter of 9.4%. Asia and Europe revenue continue to grow faster than the U.S. Slide 10 and 11. Non-GAAP gross profit was $38.1 million, up 29.6% from $29.4 million in the same quarter last year and down 5.7% from $40.4 million sequentially. On a percentage basis gross margin was 16.2% up from 15.5% a year ago and down from 16.8% sequentially. Price changes from Ablecom resulted in a positive two basis point change to the gross profit in the quarter with total purchases representing approximately 20.3% of total cost of goods sold compared to 19.9% a year ago and 23.1% sequentially.  The sequential decrease in gross margin primarily resulted from a higher percentage of subsystems and accessory revenues as noted earlier which typically sale for less margin and service solutions. This was caused by lower revenues from some of our OEM end customers who order our project basis. We do expect to see some improvement in this quarter.  In addition, we saw some increase in purchases from our partners in subsystems and accessories toward the end of the quarter due to the uncertainty with regards to the impact of the Japanese earthquake on supply. We also have got some additional inventory in some subsystems and accessories in order to minimize the effect of any delay in supply chain caused by the earthquake. Slide 12, operating expenses were $20.8 million up from $17.3 million in the same quarter a year ago and down from $21.6 million sequentially. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses was 8.9%, which is lower than 9.1% a year ago and 9% sequentially. Operating expenses was higher on an absolute dollar basis year-over-year primarily due to additional headcount in R&D and production as the company continues to investment into our product portfolio as well as expand it operations both domestically and overseas. Sequentially, we saw a decrease in operating expenses primarily related to higher NRE support from our customers for specific optimization to products as well as a reduction in overall bonuses. The optimizations are long aligned for power efficiency, density and cooling which the company is a leader. Headcount increased by 75 sequentially to 1,211 total employees. The increase was primarily in production and R&D. Operating profit was $17.2 million or 7.3% of revenue, up from $12.1 million or 6.4% of revenues a year ago and down from $18.8 million or 7.8% of revenues sequentially.  During the quarter we broke ground on the first phase of our building expansion in Taiwan, which is scheduled to be completed in late calendar Q4. The expansion of our capabilities will drive our ability to service our customers in that geography as well as help to improve our operational efficiencies around the world. Until then we will be continuing to make investments in infrastructures both facility and headcount to – in order to be able to effectively utilize this new facility when it is completed.  Net income was $12.3 million or 5.2% of revenues up from $8.9 million or 4.7% of revenues a year ago and down from $13.3 million or 5.5% of revenue sequentially. Our non-GAAP fully diluted EPS was $0.28 per share up $0.07 from $0.21 per share a year ago and down $0.03 from $0.31 sequentially.  The number of fully diluted shares used in the third quarter was 43,982,000. The increase in diluted shares from last year was primarily due to impact of options which were previously unrewarded.  The tax rate in the third quarter, on a non-GAAP basis, were 28.3% compared to 25.7% a year ago and 28.3% sequentially. The lower rate a year ago was due to additional R&D tax credits. We expect the effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis to be approximately 31% for the same quarter.  Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis, slide 13, cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term investments were $73.5 million, which is down from $92.7 million in the prior quarter. In the third quarter, free cash flow was a negative $34 million and a net change in cash was a negative $19.1 million. The primary difference between free and net change in cash was due to the purchase of $9 million of land during the quarter, which the company spec financed. The primary cause of the negative – net change in cash was due to the increase in inventory of $19.1 million during the quarter correlates for the increase in forecasted revenues and buffer against disruption of supply of some subsystems and accessories.  Slide 14, accounts receivable increased by $2 million to $79.8 million and DSOs was 31 days, an increase of two days from the prior quarter. Inventories increased by 18 million to 205.6 million with the days in inventories increasing by 14 days to 92 days. Accounts payable decreased by $15.5 million to $128.5 million with the day sales outstanding increasing by 5 days to 64 days primarily due to the increase in inventory. Overall cash conversion cycle was 59 days, an increase of 11 days from the 48 days in the prior quarter.  Now, for a few comments on outlook. As we indicated previously, during the third quarter, we saw seasonally soft quarter for the industry. However, our growth has continued from the prior year especially in Asia and Europe. We expect to see continued ramping of these regions as we add more capabilities there as well as strategically introduce more products based on the latest technologies.  The fourth quarter is typically a seasonally strong quarter and it’s starting stronger than it did prior quarters. Therefore the company currently expects net sales for the quarter ending June 30, 2011 in a range of $245 million to $260 million. Assuming this revenue range, the company expects non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.28 to $0.30 for the quarter. It is currently expected that the outlook will not be updated until the release of the company's next quarterly earnings announcement notwithstanding subsequent developments, however, the company may update the outlook or any portion thereof at any time. With that let me turn it back to Charles for some closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Howard. As we entered the first quarter of our fiscal year, we’re confident that we have a strong quarter to complete the best year in our history. With our strong product line in storage, CPU, and server we’re well positioned to take advantage over the current IT market trends. In addition, we’re growing in all our geography market and especially in Asia. And finally we’re well prepared for upcoming technology change with innovation that will generate a new demand for Super Micro product.  Operator, at this time we’re ready for questions.
Operator:  Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) And we’ll take our first question from Aaron Rakers with Stifel Nicolaus.
Aaron Rakers – Stifel Nicolaus:  Yeah, thanks guys. Couple – one question and one follow up, I guess. As far as the effects that you guys had cites in this last quarter, I think it was and the timing of some refreshes or some launches from some of your partners and then also the effect both from Japan component supply as well as Japan as a contribution to revenue. Can you help us bridge the effects there quantitatively, how meaningful those items were?
Charles Liang:  Okay, I mean, yes, (inaudible) CPU around today, although that did almost one month. So there is a shift based on the (inaudible). And as for Japan earthquake, yes, we have some component regarding that impact. However, we have (inaudible) resource and also preparing more safety inventory. So pretty much we had no concerns about Japan earthquake anymore but we say that we for sure have a higher inventory that’s trying make sure to no other impact.
Aaron Rakers – Stifel Nicolaus:  Okay. And a follow-up from me is on the gross margin line, it would appear that given what you guys are saying about the guidance going into the next quarter, we’re not to assume any kind of real meaningful change in the gross margin line. So first of all, if that’s true – is that true? And then secondly, how should we anticipate the trajectory of gross margin here as you look to continue to ramp your international facilities and importantly looking into 2012 with the Taiwan facility ramp?
Charles Liang:  Okay. Like, in last couple of quarters, we share with you our Taiwan investment, right, in facility, in R&D, logistic. That for sure we have created some expense for us in short-term. And however, since improving quarter-after-quarter and now the Asia business have been growing, but in the economies of scale in Asia is very small relatively. So I believe we may need another two to three quarter to get a better economies of scale for Asia.
Aaron Rakers – Stifel Nicolaus:  Thank you.
Operator:  And next we will hear from Mark Kelleher with Dougherty & Company.
Mark Kelleher – Dougherty & Company:  Great, thanks for taking the question. You mentioned that you have some strength in the GPU systems in the quarter, the ASPs on servers came down a bit sequentially. Can you talk about which products drives that ASP up and which drive it down and what were some other dynamics there? I would see some of the Blade servers might have pulled it down a bit.
Howard Hideshima:  Yeah, Mark, this is Howard. Like I say we had some projects that Charles alluded to a bit. We also have some customers from OEMs and end customers that delayed. So again we do expect some of those projects come back. I mean we are – the systems can vary from multiple thousands of dollars to less. So, the mix really just change for us from some of those customers.
Mark Kelleher – Dougherty & Company:  Okay and here is my follow-up question to you. I ask the inventory built it’s fairly substantial. Can you be more specific on what’s in there? Is that DRAM? What’s in there?
Charles Liang:  You are very familiar with these markets. Yes, I mean, there is a tremendous shortage from that Japan earthquake. We are keeping more memory, more hard drive and also more capacitor unless basically a high voltage capacitor to make sure we won’t have a shortage in Q2, I mean June quarter and even in September quarter.
Mark Kelleher – Dougherty & Company:  Okay, great. Thanks. 
Charles Liang:  Thank you. 
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Next we will hear from Rajesh Ghai with Thinkequity.
Rajesh Ghai – Thinkequity:  Yes, thanks and good afternoon. You mentioned that you expect your systems revenue as a percentage of total revenue to snap back next quarter. Can you just give me the factors that give you the confidence that it will snap back next quarter?
Charles Liang:  Okay. I mean again last quarter we have a couple of product line including our 2U storage product and there had been a six in last couple of weeks. So this quarter, I mean June quarter system shipments should be better than last quarter as to how many of it, Howard, do you have an idea?
Howard Hideshima:  Rajesh, we stated our long-term goals to be about 50-50 and will be working our way through there. But again as June is a seasonally strong quarter for us. So again last quarter it was a weak quarter, some of the projects that we usually have full service solutions into were not there, they are coming back this quarter.
Rajesh Ghai – Thinkequity:  Okay. And as the list of pricing, can you talk about the pricing dynamics that you see at this point of time both for your product as well for components specifically memory and hard disk drives? Thank you.
Charles Liang:  Not much, but again to prevent shortage may happen right. So, we keep a higher inventory level and therefore sure we pay a little higher, again not too much higher.
Rajesh Ghai – Thinkequity:  And in terms of pricing comparatively, compared to your competitors?
Charles Liang:  I believe our economical scale, still relatively are smaller than our main competitor and that’s why we have been consistently growing our share. And last year, we grew 43%, this year which we foresee a good year in much share growth as well, including our investment in Asia, not only try to grow our market share. So that long-term we would be stronger in purchase and buying power.  
Rajesh Ghai – Thinkequity:  Thank you.
Operator:  And next we’ll hear from Glenn Hanus with Needham & Company.
Glenn Hanus – Needham & Company:  Hi, guys. Let me just take another crack at the – can you give us a sense of the – I mean, data center spending is pretty strong, you came in at the low-end of the range, should we assume that absent the delays in Sandy Bridge that you might have been towards the upper end of your range based on demand or is that too positive?
Howard Hideshima:  No, I don’t think that’s too positive at all. I think some of the things that Charles reiterated here, and we reiterate it with regards to delays caused. Again, we’re talking, our range is about – we’re at 134, we’re at 135 to 145, I mean, take a look at that, that’s not far off. So some of these delays obviously would have put us right in there.
Glenn Hanus – Needham & Company:  And then the delays to date more impact the complete system solutions rather than the components, did the delay impact the mix in effect between solutions and components? Can you just help me understand that better?
Howard Hideshima:  Yeah, if you look at our mix again, you saw that our systems revenues as a percent of our overall business went down from the December quarter to the March quarter. So again, I would put the impact more on that side of the fence.
Glenn Hanus – Needham & Company:  Yeah. I understand that. What I’m asking is did the Intel delay create that change in mix?
Charles Liang:  No. Indeed the major reason our ASP dropped because some key (inaudible) and we believe we will be purchasing in June quarter again. So March quarter somehow, yes, have a minimal order. 
Glenn Hanus – Needham & Company:  Okay. Thanks.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) And we’ll take a follow-up question from Aaron Rakers with Stifel Nicolas.
Aaron Rakers – Stifel Nicolaus:  Yeah, can you guys – just a follow-up on the Sandy Bridge stuff, can you talk a little bit about how we should think about the [DRAM] transition as we look out over the next couple of quarters from a timing perspective and any thoughts of how we should think about that from a margin profile perspective?
Charles Liang:  Yeah, I mean, our Intel Sandy Bridge by virtue is a big product line and whenever there are big product launch from our partner Nexenta, we have good chance for Super Micro to grow, because we’re now in new product trend to market. So, basically Sandy Bridge would be in production by Q4, I mean December quarter, but we’re kind of aggressively preparing for a product. So, basically maybe what I’ll say June is our traditional strong quarter and then second half of this year with Sandy Bridge launch for sure will be a good quarter for us.
Aaron Rakers – Stifel Nicolaus:  And then another question on the storage side of the business, obviously you’ve been talking about that and that growing quite rapidly. Are we a quarter or two away before you start to actually breaking that out? And on that topic, have you seen any effect from some of recent consolidation things going on in the storage industry, in particular NetApp buying LSI, have you engaged in new customer opportunities as it relates to that?
Charles Liang:  We have a very broad customer base for storage product. So basically the acquisition activity a couple – a few company in last two quarters, basically I would say no impact to us.
Aaron Rakers – Stifel Nicolaus:  Okay. 
Charles Liang:  Our growth pretty much depends on our strong product line.
Aaron Rakers – Stifel Nicolaus:  Okay. Thank you. 
Operator:  And next we’ll have a follow-up question from Rajesh Ghai with Thinkequity.
Rajesh Ghai – Thinkequity:  Yes, thanks. So turning to your guidance, Howard, if I take the midpoint of your revenue and your midpoint of the EPS and back out operating margin, it comes to almost flat with last quarter. Can you kind of spread out the operating margin – operating expenses and gross margin assumptions for next quarter? If I understand, systems doesn’t – in your mix is going to go up and how does that kind of – how do you get to a flat operating margin with higher gross margin potentially?
Howard Hideshima:  I believe, again, June quarter should be stronger to us, that’s tradition, all right. However, because of the earthquake in Japan, we still try to be conservative in case any shortage may happen. Otherwise, June quarter should be stronger than March quarter to us for sure.
Rajesh Ghai – Thinkequity:  Okay. And on the Netherlands facility, you mentioned Europe was strong. I’m just wondering what the utilization rate is at this point of time for your Netherlands facility? Is it 50% or more and have you seen any impact on – positive impact on gross margin as a result of the elimination of freight cost to Europe? 
Howard Hideshima:  Yeah, they’re both, Netherlands and Taiwan facility still under economies of scale and that’s why our Q1, we got some impact and the good thing is those utilization will consistently improve quarter-over-quarter.
Rajesh Ghai – Thinkequity:  And the Taiwan facility should be ramping by the end of June this year, is that the right information that I have?
Howard Hideshima:  Taiwan, it is – also need to be more patient because our investment in Taiwan is very huge and long-term. I would rather say (inaudible) will be completed by December quarter and then next year we would see a better economies of scale for sure.
Rajesh Ghai – Thinkequity:  Okay. And when does Intel start its Sandy Ridge DP allocation, is it September quarter or could it be – it’s in the September quarter, but is it going to be end of September or is it going to be earlier in that quarter?
Charles Liang:  I believe the high volume will be Q4.
Rajesh Ghai – Thinkequity:  Q4, okay. Thank you so much.
Charles Liang:  Thank you.
Operator:  And we’ll take our next follow-up question from Glenn Hanus with Needham & Company.
Glenn Hanus – Needham & Company:  As you look at your Internet data center business, would you foresee that (inaudible) this 9% range for couple of quarters, would you – as we look out into next fiscal year, would you foresee that growing into double-digits?
Howard Hideshima:  I believe we will be consistently growing (inaudible).
Glenn Hanus – Needham & Company:  I’m sorry. I just – I didn’t understand.
Howard Hideshima:  I guess will be double-digit very soon.  
Glenn Hanus – Needham & Company:  Okay, okay. Howard, back on operating expenses, I mean, I had modeled up this quarter sequentially in OpEx, it looks like you came in under in all my categories, did – was that just a function of revenues or was – is there something that changed during the quarter in your operating expense expansion?
Howard Hideshima:  Again, two areas. One is we spend a lot of AFO and resource in developing Sandy Bridge for the big launch that will happen in Q4. And secondly, our growing expense in Asia to make sure our foundation in Asia is strong enough.
Glenn Hanus – Needham & Company:  Okay, thank you.
Operator:  And it appears at this time, we have no further questions. I’d like to turn the call back over to Mr. Liang for any additional or closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you for joining us today and we’re looking forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you everyone. Have a great day.
Operator:  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude the Super Micro third quarter fiscal year 2011 conference call. We do appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect at this time. Thank you.

I’ll now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Charles Liang: Thank you Perry and good afternoon everyone. Please turn to slide four. First let me provide you with the highlights of our fourth quarter. We are pleased with our first quarter revenue was $270 million or 2.7 percent higher quarter over quarter and 39.5 percent higher year over year. This result is another record high for Super Micro. Net income was $9.3 million or 2.1 percent higher quarter over quarter and 59 percent higher compared to last year. Super Micro non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.22 per diluted share compared to $0.51 last quarter or $0.15 last year. Slide five please. Now I would like to share with you some key points regarding our operating performance in the first quarter. The first quarter of fiscal year 2011 represents our sixth straight quarter of increasing revenues and our fifth straight quarter of record high revenues. We continue to grow because of our strong products that have been optimized to (inaudible) CPU and other technologies. There were launches during the last year and our products are the industry leading performance based on performance per watt and performance per dollars, performance per square foot, and the lowest total cost of ownership. The Super Micro value proposition continues to win customers. We are pleased with this quarter’s performance in spite of summer seasonality effects on the industry. We finished September with good momentum in the last weeks which indicates that we should see a seasonally strong end to the calendar year. From a geography perspective our revenue in the U.S. was consistent, but our revenue both in Europe and in Asia grew strongly during the quarter. Demand for Super Micro products continues to grow in this region, particularly in Asia where we continue to engage new customers with (inaudible) partition in data centers, power computing and other vertical enterprise. This strong Asia demand included China, Japan, India and others, and we are focused on winning more key relationships there. Another key highlight of our global success was we increased the position of our European and Asia system operations. Data (inaudible) contributed to our better profit margin in the quarter as we have increased a number of models and production capacity. Although the overall (inaudible) are still low due to the fact that they are (in infancy). We are pleased with the progress we are making. On the systems side, we shipped more systems this quarter which contributed to 36 percent of our total revenue. We had strong system product (nine) particularly in system based on our twin architecture. We had a very strong quarter in shipment of our twin family of system which included twin (dock man) and our twin (ray) offerings. Many of the systems shipped were higher performance configurations that leads to higher average selling price, which help us to achieve stronger margins for the quarter. In fact, our operating performance for the quarter improved over recent quarters and we think we are headed in the right direction to improve profitability. As we have stated in the past, Super Micro is a faster growing company. Our strategy to grow our business by continuing to take time to market advantage of share in the IP infrastructure market. Through our technology innovation, we have also established our position in other markets such as embedded, industrial PC work station, switching and storage. We will achieve that growth by continuing to be first to market with the boldest array of competing products that leverage the (inaudible) technology. We will also continue to invest in our (inaudible) pursuit of opportunity in new markets by optimizing our product management for them. In order to pursue growth, we are investing in the following three areas. First, we continue to grow in R&D and maintain our strong technological leadership and innovation. Second, we invest in our people, particularly in sales, FAE, and (inaudible) to target (inaudible) markets and to promote Super Micro in specific geographies. Third, we continue to view the capacity for system innovation, technical service and logistical support in all regions and in particular, Asia. As a growing company, with our track record, we see enormous market opportunity that can be better served by our products. Slide six and seven please. (Inaudible) developments, R&D technologies include first, our newly optimized twin server architecture across 1U and 2U platforms, continue our leadership and momentum for new generation products such as 2U twin cubed. Our award winning TwinBlade is now in high volume production featuring 20/28 DP nodes in the 7U frame enclosure with 40G Infiniband or our new 10G Ethernet connectivity as options. Additionally, our (inaudible) GPU Blade is coming soon. Our GPU optimizer product nine in 1U, 2U and 4U platforms, provide extreme performance in calculation intensive applications. We will further optimize the computing density by offering full GPU in 1U solutions soon. Atom server nine features low power, no noise and small form factor, optimized for embedded server application. Also our 8way systems will be a target at the high end of price which (inaudible) applications which means huge memory capacity and tremendous computing power. Our double sided storage (inaudible) hard drive density with (inaudible) from the front and backside. Our caballing and (AFR) optimize super rack is ideal for high density and complicated cabling (inaudible). Also, 10U switch for standalone (inaudible) are in production now and FCoE fiber channel main switch solution is coming soon. We look forward to promoting these product lines in the coming quarter and beyond. For more specifics on the fourth quarter, let me turn it over to Howard.
Howard Hidashima: Thank you Charles, and good afternoon everyone. I’ll focus my remarks on earnings, gross margin, operating expenses and similar items on a non-GAAP basis, which reflects adjustments to exclude stock compensation and provisions for litigation expense. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company in today’s earnings release and in the supplemental detail in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Let me begin with a review of the first quarter’s income statement. Please turn to slide eight. Revenue was $207.2 million, up 39.5 percent from the same quarter a year ago and up 2.7 percent sequentially. The increase in revenues from last year was fairly wide spread among our customer base, which we believe was primarily due to a continuing improvement in the global economy and the server refresh cycle. The sequential increase in revenue during a seasonally weak quarter for the industry was primarily due to the continued emphasis being put on obtaining effective and efficient solutions such as our 2U Twin and Twin Square servers and storage solutions as the server refresh cycle continues. Slide nine. Turning to product mix, a portion of our revenues from server systems was 35.7 percent which was an increase from 34.5 percent a year ago, and 32.2 percent last quarter. ASP’s for servers was about $1,500 per unit which is up from $1,400 per unit last year and last quarter. The increase in absolute dollars of server products from a year ago was primarily due to the increase in shipments of Twin and GPU servers. The increase in absolute dollars of server products sequentially was primarily due to the increase in shipments of Twin and Twin Squared servers and storage servers. We shipped approximately 50,000 servers and 950,000 sub-systems and accessories in the first quarter. We continue to maintain our diverse revenue base with none of our over 400 customers making up more than 10 percent of our net sales in the first quarter. Furthermore, 58.7 percent of our revenues came from the U.S. and 60.2 percent from our distributors and retailers. Internet data center revenue was 7.6 percent which was an increase from the prior quarter of 6.9 percent. Asia and Europe revenues grew faster than the U.S. as we continue to expand our operations overseas, we expect to grow our percentage of overseas revenues due to the better service we can provide locally to our customers as well as by reducing the logistical expenses to us and to our customers such a freight charges. Slide ten and 11. Non-GAAP gross profit was $33.2 million, up 34.8 percent from $24.7 million in the same quarter last year and up 6.9 percent from $31.1 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, gross margin was 16 percent, down from 16.6 percent a year ago and up from 15.4 percent sequentially. Price changes from (Able Comm) resulted in a positive .01 basis point change to the gross profit in the quarter with total purchases representing approximately 20.9 percent of total cost of goods sold compared to 22 percent a year ago and 14.7 percent sequentially. The year over year decrease in gross margins resulted from the increasing costs associated with our overseas expansion and an increase in shipping costs associated with higher peak season rates. The sequential increase in gross margin primarily results from a higher percentage of sales complete server solution I’ve noted earlier, offset in part by higher shipping costs during the period. As we bring up our overseas facilities we should see reductions in our expenses and the time to deliver products to our customers. Slide twelve. Operating expenses were $18.7 million, up from $15.6 million in the same quarter a year ago and from $18 million sequentially. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses was nine percent, down from 10.5 percent year over year and up from 8.9 percent sequentially. Operating expenses was higher on an absolute dollar basis year over year primarily due to additional headcount, primarily in R&D and production as the company continues its investment into its product portfolio as well as its expansion overseas. Sequentially we saw an increase primarily in sales and marketing expense due to an increase in marketing development funds to promote new products and from head count addition to prepare the company for additional growth. Head count increased by 44 sequentially to 1,080 total employees. Operating profit was $14.6 million or seven percent of revenue, up from $9.1 million or 6.1 percent a year ago, and up from $13.1 million or 6.5 percent sequentially. The improvement in our operating margins from last quarter and last year has begun while growing our revenue base, expanding our product line and increasing our geographical capabilities. We do expect to continue to make these investments and continue our progress towards the long term success of the company. Net income was $9.3 million or 4.5 percent of revenues, up from $5.9 million or 3.9 percent of our revenues a year ago and up from $9.1 million or 4.5 percent of revenues sequentially. Our non-GAAP fully diluted EPS was $0.022 per share up $0.07 from $0.15 per share a year ago and up from $0.21 per share sequentially. The number of fully diluted shares used in the first quarter was 42,716,000. The increase in diluted shares from last year was primarily due to the impact of options which were previously under water. The tax rate in the first quarter on a non-GAAP basis was 35.8 percent compared to 35.1 percent a year ago and 30.2 percent sequentially. The R&D credit expired on January 1, 2010. Should the credit be reinstated retroactively, then the company would adjust in the quarter the credit is reinstated. We do expect the tax rate on a non-GAAP basis to be approximately 35 percent for the December quarter. Turning to the balance sheet, on a sequential basis, slide 13. Cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments were $89.4 million which is up from $79.4 million in the prior quarter. In the first quarter free cash flow as a positive $9.7 million and a net change in cash was a positive $10.9 million. The cash balance reflects the land purchase of approximately $6.1 million during the quarter. Excluding this land purchase, the company’s cash and cash equivalents and long term investments would have been $95.5 million. Slide 14. Accounts receivable decreased by $1.2 million to $71.8 million and DSO’s was 32 days, an increase of one day from the prior quarter. Inventories increased by $15.9 million to $151.5 million with days in inventory increasing by one day to 76 days. The increase in inventory was due in part to preparing for a seasonally strong December quarter as well as to support the growth of our overseas operation. Accounts payable increased by $17.7 million to $113.1 million with the days payable outstanding increasing by one day to 55 days, primarily due to the increasing inventory. Overall, cash conversion cycles were 53 days, an increase of one day or 52 days in the prior quarter. Now for a few comments on our outlook. As indicated previously, during the first quarter we saw continued growth in our business, especially in Asia and Europe, and the ramping of sales from our technology introduction such as Twin, Storage and GPU. We expect to see continued ramping of these products as well as the ramping of our facility in the Netherlands and Taiwan. Both these factories should continue to improve our profitability. In addition, December is seasonally a strong quarter for the industry. Therefore, the company currently expects net sales for the quarter ending December 31, 2010 in a range of $220 million to $230 million. Assuming this revenue range, the company expects non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.23 to $0.27 for the quarter. It is currently expected that the outlook will not be updated until the release of the company’s next quarterly earnings announcement notwithstanding subsequent developments. However, the company may update the outlook or any portion thereof, at any time. With that, let me turn it back to Charles for some closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you Howard. We believe that the second quarter is shaping up to be a strong quarter of growth. We are well positioned with our innovative products (inaudible) to pursue this growing market community. We are also well positioned with our regional system integration operation to boost our presence in different geographies. We will stay focused on our strategy of growth balanced with investment and profitability. Operator, at this time we are ready for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And we’ll go first to Noah Huth with ThinkEquity.
Noah Huth: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I’m speaking on behalf of Rajesh Ghai today. My question relates to gross margin. Last quarter you had margins of about 15.5 percent and you stated in there that there was some component shortages which led to system sales coming in below your expectation and you said that had a negative effect of about 100 basis points on your gross margin. Now system sales have returned to much higher levels and we’ve only seen about a 50 basis point increase in gross margin. Is there anything else that’s been affecting that because I noticed in Q2 of 2009 with a similar product breakout, you reached 16.7 percent in gross margins.
Charles Liang: Thank you for the question. Last quarter, September quarter we continue to have some component shortage, although the shortage overall has been improved. On memory side, memory team, (inaudible) so indeed we saw a drop in price for memory and that’s why (inaudible) have been growing last quarter, but still we grow only 50 points. But looking forward, in the coming quarters, situation should be better.
Noah Huth: Okay. I guess what I what I’m saying is that we’ve seen a significant increase here in your system sales, but there hasn’t been that sort of corresponding increase in gross margin.
Charles Liang: In September quarter we experienced memory team price drop and we have some inventory. That’s why we saw (inaudible).
Noah Huth: Okay. And then also relating to system sales, how much of the demand in the September quarter, how much of that was sort of overflow from the previous quarter and how much of that was new demand.
Howard Hidashima: A portion of that was some overflow from previous as Charles mentioned. We did have some component shortages. That did help a little bit, but again, as you mentioned, it has improved for us this quarter with regards to shortages, short components. So again, it wasn’t a huge dollar amount. Let’s put it that way.
Operator: And the next question comes from Alex Kurtz from Merriman Capital.
Alex Kurtz: Hi this is Diane for Alex today. Just going back to the component available, do you see any changes that were noticeable on availability this quarter and also was it consistent throughout the quarter or just right at the end. Any color you can give us around that would be great.
Charles Liang: Overall component shortage have been improving especially memory. Now a little bit of oversupply, so as you may know, main memory price dropped a lot. I’d rather say more than 20 percent in last two months. So other than (inaudible) components we still experience some shortage although that situation has been improving. And (inaudible) situation will be much better condition after December or January I believe.
Alex Kurtz: And just moving on quickly to your more geographic outlook, you obviously had broad based strength in both Asia and Europe. Were there any verticals that were extremely strong or did you see any that outperformed others generally either EMIA, Asia or the U.S.?
Charles Liang: Yes. I mean we see our 2U Twin Square especially with GPU (inaudible) have been growing very well and that’s particularly for in the (OREO and gas) and kind of some scientific calculation, some simulation and storage. Storage is another area we saw very good growth in last quarter.
Alex Kurtz: All right. Thank you so much. I appreciate it.
Charles Liang: Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll take the next question from Glenn Hanus from Needham.
Glenn Hanus: Good afternoon guys. Nice report. Let’s just go back to the gross margin for a minute. So as we look sequentially here and even beyond year end and into the March quarter, could you give us a sense of just which factors kind of come into play most and if you can give us any kind of sense of how much gross margin improvement we should look for.
Charles Liang: Our product for CPU in Europe and Asia will be continuing improving and we are growing capacity on both side, so that will continue to improve for next quarters I believe and as to the impact ...
Howard Hidashima: Yes, Glenn, we had some investments in our overseas operation. If you take a look last year, probably a lot of the decrease in our gross margin comparatively speaking to last year you could point toward investments that we’re making in the BD and Asia facilities. I think you’ll see probably about a .4 to .5 percent change.
Glenn Hanus: Okay. So this quarter you know, gross margins you’ll get some. Maybe you could rank the different factors that should improve your gross margins this quarter, this European and Asia factor, is that most significant and then there’s the server mix and parts issues. Can you kind of go through the factors that should improve margins this quarter and sort of maybe rank them and what’s most impactful?
Howard Hidashima: I think you’ll see, as Charles mentioned some componentry shortages, the shortages with regard to componentry, things improving. That’s obviously high on the list. Utilizing our production capabilities overseas that I mentioned has two benefits for us. Not only do we get to generate revenues from the investments we’ve already made there, but also as I mentioned, our shipping expenses were fairly high this quarter due to the peak season rates. So we do see that hopefully improving for us this quarter and going beyond. I think if I was going to rank, those would be the three I would rank on the plus side.
Glenn Hanus: Okay. And if there’s some offsetting factors that come into play this quarter, on the minus side.
Howard Hidashima: Yes, I think if you take a look you can flip around some of the overseas expansion that we’re doing, if the revenue or capacity isn’t taken up as we expect that could be you know, potentially neutral as compared to this quarter or potentially less of a gain. Let’s put it that way.
Charles Liang: At this moment, it’s looking quite positive for both Europe and Asia.
Glenn Hanus: Okay. Thanks. I’ll stick to the one question.
Operator: We’ll take a follow up from Noah Huth.
Noah Huth: I just had one quick follow up on clarifying a few things. You mentioned the factors affecting your margins were shipping costs and memory prices. Are these component and shipping charges not passed directly to customers as they change when they go up and down?
Howard Hidashima: Yes, freight in is not – again, there are some things that we can pass on a portion of it. We found that in the September quarter there was a peak season and some additional charges seasonally was higher than normal, so we are able to pass it all 100 percent.
Noah Huth: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: It appears at this time we have no further questions. I’d like to turn the call back over to Mr. Liang for any additional or closing comments.
Charles Liang: Thank you for joining us today and we do look forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you everyone. Have a great day.

In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today’s press release and in the supplemental information attached to today’s presentation. Now I’ll turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Perry and good afternoon everyone. Please turn to slide 4. First, let me provide you with the highlights of our fourth quarter. We are pleased that our fourth quarter revenue was $202 million or 6.5% higher quarter-over-quarter, and 63% higher year-over-year. This result is another record high for Super Micro. Non-GAAP net income was $9.11 million or 1.6% higher quarter-over-quarter and 141% higher compared to last year. Super Micro’s non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.21 per diluted share compared to $0.21 last quarter or $0.10 last year. Slide 5 please. Now I would like to share with your our achievements during the past fiscal year. Fiscal year 2010 was a remarkable year of growth for Super Micro. And this quarter represents our fifth straight quarter of increase in revenues and our first straight quarter of record high revenue. We have achieved this growth because we are hopeful that best of product line in our history that have been optimized to the new processor technologies that were launched during the past year. In addition, we are benefit by customers who took advantage of our newer technologies to improve their return on investments by investing in Super Micro technology which offers the best of performance, best of performance per watt, performance per dollar, performance per square foot and the lowest total cost of ownership. We expect these trends to continue. This past year we had continuously invested in the growth of Super Micro in terms of expansion of our operation most at the headquarter and overseas. We have begun further integration operations in our Netherlands facility and in Taiwan in support of our OEM and local customers. With that we have increased our server integration facility and capacity during 2010 by 50%. And we are planning to increase more this year when the demand increase. In fiscal year 2010, Super Micro entered server industry in technology and architectural innovation. We continue to grow our strong product line. We launched our award winning TwinBlade, our resource optimized servers, our doubled-sided storage server up to 45 3.5 inch hard drive in 4U. Our cabling and air flow optimizer SuperRack, our new generation Twin servers, our new GPU servers and our storage prepaid product line. In addition we continued to have it above these server for recent launch of (inaudible) Intel with Xeon processor as whereas full 8/12-core AMD Magny-Cours G34 processor. In the last quarter one of the engineering focuses was on the high end 8-way system design. We had effectively expanded our server fitting board for scale up (ph) and high end server solutions. This fitting board (ph) which included basic amount of CPU and memory module of 5U optimized chassis and redundant efficiency 2200 watt power supplies can also be used for other similar large and multi flex (ph) systems as (inaudible). The current 8-way system in development we’re capable of supporting 8 Nehalem-EX processors, two terabyte of memory and 11 PCI Express expansion slots. It’s ideal for higher better ability for (inaudible) or back end mission critical applications. Our innovative technology leadership together with our footstep to mark advantage again have us to win market share in fiscal year 2010. We continue to outpace our competitors by growing annual revenue by 43% last year over our 2009. We have won exciting new business with major OEMs HPC customers including university, national and international regulatory, datacenter and many high value added verticals. Our customer base is consistently growing and we are winning both in domestic and international markets and in key verticals. Those were our strategic goal for Super Micro because it allows us to withstand to customer demand on a global scale achieving our revenue goal allow us to further improve our operational efficiency especially in Europe and Asia. Growth also allows Super Micro to gain economic scale for better components cost from vendor allowing us to become more close to competitive and others have higher profit margin. Especially to vendor pricing and allocation, in 2010, our growth in revenue in board processing (ph) positioned us to become sourced for components to an increasing number of our channel customers. This represents an additional source of revenue that is lower margin in the (inaudible) by allow us to further penetrate these customers and over the more comprehensive service such as system integration, performance optimization and product quality warranty and service in the long run. During last quarter we were able to meet customers demand but due to certain components shortage and allocation, our margins were impacted, however the vendor relationship and economic scale improvement were help us to improve our cost and cost of margin in the near and long-term future. This past year we continued to invest in our foundation in both R&D and operational facilities both at the home and at overseas. During the past year, Super Micro increased the headcount by 20%, with half of the increase in R&D while most of our competitor kept in (inaudible). Super Micro is still young and quick growing company which means we have a different manpower requirement than older and bigger companies. Although in the headcount we had some impact on our profit margin performance. It is good, however very good strategy to have us continue our pace and trend of growth in the future. Nevertheless while we grow our headcount, we are achieving higher grade of productivity per employee as evidenced by our revenue per employee increase of roughly 27% in the first quarter compared to first quarter a year ago. In 2010, we invest in our production capability overseas to better service our customer in their local market. In support of local OEMs and major customers, we started our server integration operation in our Netherlands facility. As our further (ph) with oversea production later in the year we start our Taiwan facility to support our growing Asian business. With that we had increased our companywide total server integration capacity during 2010 by roughly 50% and we are planning to increase more in the coming year when needs. (Inaudible) new operations is necessary for our future growth which will come from region of the beside US market. We have been carefully managing the investments and in these new operations by monitoring the headcount and the balancing resource to meet revenue expectation. As these operations ramp to higher board capacity we would certainly see higher capacity utilization and close to other substance leading to a stronger margin performance. In addition, the oversea expansion would benefit us for by lowering our supply chain cost and the providing us access to lower tax rate. Slide six and seven please. During our past four quarters Super Micro had an awful product line that continues to have the mostly innovative technology in server industry along with some new development. Our leading technology includes first, our update Twin server architecture across 1U and 2U platforms which continue our leadership momentum for new generation. Our award winning TwinBlade featured in 20 DP nodes support in 7U enclosure with 40 gigabyte per second Infiniband or 10 Giga Ethernet connectivity as option. Our GPU Optimized product line in 1U and 4U platforms that provide extreme performance in calculation-intensive application. Also our new 1U and 2U enterprise optimizer rack mount product line optimizer for enterprise authorization base application featured in the (inaudible) the Intel and AMD the news processor and 10GE onboard. Our ATOM server 9 featured in low power, low noise and small form factor optimizes for embedded and server appliance applications. Our innovative double-sided storage provides a higher density. Again 45 piece 7.5 inch hard drive in for you with the ability of high (inaudible) from outside. One of our new generation 4 way systems is based on Intel Boxboro-EX chipset and new Nehalem-EX MP CPUs which provides a much higher memory and I/O bandwidth than the previous generation. Our 8-way system where we target as high end enterprise mission critical application with the need of huge memory capacity and a tremendous computing power. Super SBB Storage Bridge Bay, which use our Twin design concept that can incorporate or Bridge SATA and SAS and fiber channel storage solutions. Also our cabling and air flow optimized SuperRack is ideal for high density and complicated cabling rack mount configuration. Our 10GE switch for (inaudible) are in the leading position for our industry where we enter the 10GE Ethernet era. Last our MicroCloud product line optimizer for power application in an extremely low power consumption combination. As we close fiscal 2010, we are very pleased to report that while we continue to invest n R&D in new products and our people and the new operation in Europe and Taiwan, we again continue our 17 year trend of increasing our post of results. For more specific on our fourth quarter, let me turn it over to Howard.
Howard Hideshima: Thank you Charles and good afternoon to everyone. I will focus my remarks on earnings, gross margins, operating expenses and similar items on a non-GAAP basis which reflects adjustments to exclude stock compensation expenses. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company in today’s earnings release and in the supplemental details in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Let me begin with a review of the fourth quarter income statement. Please turn to slide eight. Revenue was a record $201.7 million, up 63.4% from the same quarter a year ago and up 6.5% sequentially. The revenue for the fiscal year was a record $721.4 million up 42.7% from the same 12 months periods a year ago. The increase in revenues from last year was fairly widespread among our customer base, which we believe was primarily due to recovery in the global economy. The sequential increase in revenues from last quarter was primarily due to increased sales of our subsystems and accessories such as server boards, memory and chassis. Slide 9. Turning to product mix, the portion of revenues from server systems was 32.2% of total revenues, which was a decrease from 36.7% a year ago and 33.6% last quarter. ASPs for servers was about $1,400 per unit, which is the same as last year and down from $1,500 per unit last quarter. We shipped approximately 47,000 servers in the fourth quarter and 956,000 subsystems and accessories. We continue to maintain a diverse revenue base with none of our over 450 customers making up more than 10% of our net sales in the fourth quarter. Furthermore, 60.9% of our revenues came from the US and 61.6% from our distributors and resellers. Internet datacenter revenue was 6.9%, which was a decrease of 1.6% from the prior quarter. Slide 10 and 11. Non-GAAP gross profit was $31.1million, up 50.7% from $20.6 million in the same quarter of last year, and up 5.8% from $29.4 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, gross margin was 15.4%, down from 16.7% a year ago, and comparable to the 15.5% sequentially. Price changes from Ablecom resulted in a positive one basis point change to gross profit in the quarter, with total purchases representing 14.7% of total cost of goods sold compared to 19%a year ago and 19.9% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease in gross margin resulted from an increase in sales associated with accessories due to increased sales to distributors, resellers and system integrators who previously bought their own accessories and are now approach to see more of the total solution from us in assembling themselves. Sequentially gross margins were comparable to primary effect on gross margin in the quarter resulted from higher margin on our server solution as result of the transition to newer products, continued offset in part by reductions in the percentage of revenues coming from server solutions as well as inventory variances associated with the decrease in cost of some of the parts which we purchased as well as on a overall reduction in our inventory which occurred in the quarter, and tracing the inventory caused delays and delivery of products such as server solution. This is reflected in the lower percentage of server solution sales on a sequential basis. Our standard margins did in fact go up for the quarter, which were offset by the factors mentioned above. Customers continue to come to us to get the leading application optimized server solutions. Slide 12. Operating expenses were $18 million up from $15.2 million in the same quarter a year ago and an increase from $17.3 million sequentially. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses was 8.9%, down from 12.3% year-over-year and down from 9.1% sequentially. Operating expenses was higher on an absolute dollar basis year-over-year and sequentially. We saw year-over-year increases in absolute dollars primarily in R&D as we continue to invest in its headcount to drive our innovation and product portfolio. Sales and marketing also increased primarily due to the growth in headcount to support the growth in revenue and marketing of new products. Overall our productivity for the company increased. Revenue per head increased from about $600,000 per head to $760,000 per head for the year. Sequentially, we saw an increase in operating expenses of about $700,000 primarily R&D expenses of about $600,000 related the salaries and benefits associated headcount increases. The company’s headcount increased by 53 sequentially in Q1 36,000 total employees compared to 74 we added in Q3. Overall, we have maintained good control of our operating expenses, while at the same time maximizing our opportunities for investing in our future. While others chose to reduce their headcounts, we chose to increase ours by 20% last fiscal year to invest in our future and build strength. Had we chosen a similar path like our competitors we would have made more today but at the expense of our future. Operating profit was $13.1 million or 6.5% of revenue, up by $7.7 million or 141.6% from $5.4 million a year ago, and up $1 million or 8.2% from $12.1 million sequentially. Net income was $9.1 million or 4.5% revenue up $5.3 million or 140.7% from $3.8 million a year ago and up $0.1 million or 1.6% from $8.9 million sequentially. Net income for the fiscal year was $33.1 million, up 55.5% from $21.3 million for the same 12 month period a year ago. Our non-GAAP fully diluted EPS was $0.21 per share, up $0.11 from $0.10 per share a year ago and the same as the $0.21 per share sequentially. The number of fully diluted shares used in the fourth quarter was 43,683,000. The increase in diluted shares was primarily due to the impact of options, which were previously under warrant and the effect of ours use previously granted. Our non-GAAP fully diluted EPS was $0.78 per share or $0.24 – up $0.24 or 44.3% from $0.54 per share for the same 12 month period a year ago. The tax rate for the fourth quarter on a non-GAAP basis was 30.2% compared to 28% a year ago and 25.7% sequentially. We expect the effect of tax rate on the non-GAAP basis to be approximately 33% for the September quarter. Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis, slide 13. Cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term investments were $79.4 million, up $6.2 million from $73.2 million in the prior quarter and down $5.6 million from $85 million at the end of fiscal 2009. In the fourth quarter, free cash flow was a negative $13.4 million which reflected a purchase of buildings for $18.5 million in June, the net change in cash was a positive $5.9 million for the quarter. Slide 14. Accounts receivables increased by $9.1 million to $73 million and DSOs was 31 days, an increase of 2 days from the prior quarter. Inventories decreased by $8.8 million to $135.6 million, with the days in inventories decreasing by 5 days to 75 days. The decrease in inventory was due impart to some delays in receiving parts at the end of the quarter which delayed some shipment of servers. Accounts payable decreased by $8.1 million to $95.4 million, and the days sales outstanding decreasing by 8 days to 54 days primarily due to increase in inventories mentioned above. Our cash conversion cycle days were at 52 days, an increase of five days from 47 days in the prior quarter. Now, for a few comments on our outlook. As indicated previously, during the fourth quarter, we saw continued improvement in the economy and the ramping of sales from the latest technology introduction, we expect to see continued ramping of these products as well as the ramping of our facilities in Netherlands (ph) and Taiwan. Both these factors should improve our possibility, although September is seasonally a flat quarter for the industry therefore the company currently expects net sales for the quarter ending September 30, 2010 in a range of $200 million to $210 million. Assuming this revenue range, the company expects non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.21 to $0.25 for the quarter. It is currently expected that the outlook will not be updated until the release of the company’s next quarterly earnings announcement, notwithstanding subsequent developments however, the company may update the outlook or any portion thereof at any time. With that, let me turn it back to Charles for some closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Howard. While we are pleased that 2010 was a remarkable year of success in growth (inaudible) we now look forward to a strong fiscal 2011 with our established operation in Netherlands and Taiwan, we would take advantage of lower cost of supply chain and logistics cost to improve our margin. Also as these operation ramp to grow capacity we will improve our productivity and thus improve our profitability. Overall past year we had also invest in product development for several key partners (ph) and in the coming year we expect to see a strong payoff from ramping business from those products. With our award winning TwinBlade now launched in fiscal 2011, we also expect to see a consistent growth in our Blade server. Also in 2011 we expect that our high end product line for enterprise and mission critical application customers. We are providing the revenue and net margin upside from new markets. Therefore as we begin fiscal year 2011 we are positioned to execute on our strategy to grow our revenue operation and scale and to improve our portability in the upcoming years. Operator, at this time we are ready for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And we’ll go first to Alex Kurtz with Merriman & Company.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman & Company: Yes, thanks for taking the question. Howard, I think it would be helpful to sort of quantify the impact from the components business that you talked about, the past through business that lower margin. Can you give us a sense of percent of revenue quarter-over-quarter and how that trended from the last quarter to the June quarter?
Howard Hideshima: Sure Alex, with regards to our subsystem accessory business, you’ll see that, last quarter we were basically down a bit as I mentioned on the call, our revenues from server systems went to 32.2%, that would make then the accessories and subsystem business being the balance of that which would be about 67.8%.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman & Company: What I meant Howard was, last quarter there were some pass through business in memory and discs and that you guys called out to specifically, and it sounds like that business was, had increased as a percent of the mix. Inside the component mix, can you talk about that specifically the sort of the pass through business and how that trended quarter-over-quarter?
Howard Hideshima: Actually we talked the greatest increase as I noted in the call, I ordered them in kind of the impact. We saw our server boards business actually increase within the accessories business quarter-over-quarter more so than any other of the components there that made up that mix. So memory last quarter was – memory and hard disc drives for last quarter are more of that passthrough business we talked about this quarter we see a more demand for our server boards, still some memory there and chassis actually.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman & Company: So was it the, and this is flat follow-up question here, was it the lack of additional servers that you’re hoping to ship that really impact the gross margin at the end of the day?
Howard Hideshima: Yes I think that’s a fair question as Charles alluded to, we had some shortages that delayed our delivery of some products again that affected our mix with regards to server solutions we could have shipped at the end.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman & Company: Okay so there were some capacity in servers that you were looking to ship at the end of the quarter but you didn’t have the specific components to do it and I wish you had called those components out and then should make up the revenue you sold more the sub components.
Howard Hideshima: I’m not sure about making up the revenue but I do believe that we shipped less of the servers that we could have had we had more parts.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman & Company: And would you care to quantify how many additional servers you guys passed up on at this point?
Howard Hideshima: No I think the percentage is there, you see we’re down a point, 1.4% quarter-over-quarter as a percentage of our revenue for servers.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman & Company: Right.
Howard Hideshima: Right and so if you look at that last quarter we were down about 2.5% and you saw an impact to our March I think this quarter you saw our margins basically flat between quarters even though we did have a reduction in our server business, right.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman & Company: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Michael Bertz with Kennedy Capital.
Michael Bertz – Kennedy Capital: Hi guys, I guess it kinds of fall into Alex’s chain of thought there and I am going to ask you to try and quantify there, because I mean I do, I get the same questions he does about just how this is balancing out, it looks to me like so if you argue 1.5% or so quarter-to-quarter down on points that’s about $2 million worth of server business, is that enough to make up the bulk of the difference in terms we got obviously yes sure flat essentially quarter-to-quarter in terms of gross margin, but we’ve talked – and you guys talked last quarter about that improving some and so is this the major contributor to that or are the server board does that business simply that much lower of margin that everything else?
Charles Liang: Indeed one of the key reason is what because the memory and hard drive most of it big shortage in June quarter and that’s why we had to rush supplier and that’s why we pay higher cost for memory and hard drive in June quarter and that I guess one of the major reason why our overall gross margin was not that good.
Michael Bertz – Kennedy Capital: Okay well Charles forgive me for going on just a little bit, hard drives didn’t seemed to be a problem, unless there were some specific or you can help us understand what’s specific in the memory I believe maybe a little bit shortage for specific parts for servers but hard drives guys didn’t see we’d have bigger deal, I mean can you – and I understand having the (inaudible) I’m just trying to get some sense if you can put some numbers around so what we’re talking about here, I think one of us is that something rude to understand about your story with the gross margins?
Charles Liang: Indeed at Super Micro we did some shortages with hard drive as well, both hard drive and memory last quarter. It looks like this quarter is improving but yet last quarter we need to pay a little higher cost than March quarter or even December quarter.
Michael Bertz – Kennedy Capital: Okay well just again just to sort of everyone’s attention to this issue, Howard let me ask you to financial guide to sort of put some numbers around that I mean, if you sort of rank the impact little bit but can you give us some dips of impact, something in terms of how much that might have been for those different components?
Howard Hideshima: Yes like for example, let’s try it this way. Last quarter we saw about 1.2% decrease in our margins. We had a similar type of decrease in our percentages of server solution. I’m talking back to Q2.
Michael Bertz – Kennedy Capital: Sure, all right.
Howard Hideshima: And we saw that about 1.2% decrease in our margins and this quarter one of the main factors I would target back in the Q3 was basically that the server percentage, percentage of our content of our business had decreased right. This quarter we saw a similar type of server decrease maybe not as much but you’ve seen our margins be flat, right. So again I mean to help quantify that, we did see increases in our standard gross margins but they were offset by some of the inventory constraints that Charles has mentioned here and the price variance that you see.
Michael Bertz – Kennedy Capital: Okay so…
Howard Hideshima: They fall about a 100 basis points like say two quarters ago based upon server mix changing, right.
Michael Bertz – Kennedy Capital: Okay.
Howard Hideshima: Before we basically saw a similar decrease in our server percentage of revenues but you didn’t see that 100 point decrease.
Michael Bertz – Kennedy Capital: All right, so are you in the year conduced about 100 change percent increase to standard margin then?
Howard Hideshima: It’s fair to say.
Michael Bertz – Kennedy Capital: Okay, I will get back in the queue, but I probably have a couple here for you?
Howard Hideshima: Okay.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And we’ll go next to Glenn Hanus with Needham & Company.
Glenn Hanus – Needham & Company: Okay, following up on the gross margin question. Can you give us the puts and takes on the margin if you look forward this quarter?
Charles Liang: This quarter indeed we see memory supply – at indeed much better than last quarter in terms of memory supply. So actually this quarter we won’t have a memory shortage problem anymore. Hard drives where we also get a partnership improved. So hard drive demand and supply should be much improves this quarter as well. As to other components should be greater improving.
Glenn Hanus – Needham & Company: Okay and do you think perhaps your servers – you’ve been a couple of quarters in a row of your complete server systems declining on a percentage basis, do you think we can start to see that trend go back in the direction that you’ve talked about as an overall strategic direction for the company?
Charles Liang: Yes, I do believe that server percentage went back to our recovery consistently.
Glenn Hanus – Needham & Company: And can you just talk about the underpinning factors that’s going to move it now consistently more in that direction?
Charles Liang: In June quarter we really suffered a lot for shortage, right. And that’s why we spend more April with vendor and looks that relatively been dramatically improved. Also order of our memory supply is improving.
Glenn Hanus – Needham & Company: Okay and how is pricing – competitive pricing versus the major guys been a factor here one way or the other this quarter and what you anticipate in the September quarter now?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, pricing Glenn is always been tough all the way around, I mean the competition is still out there. The same competitors are still out there, we’re all going after the same business. We’re still approaching it the same way.
Glenn Hanus – Needham & Company: Okay, maybe lastly with the Nehalem-EX is when should that really get going and do you see that as somewhat of a help for you in the margin?
Charles Liang: Since late of June, we started shipping Nehalem-Ex and this trend which continue, right. And those are AMD G34 (inaudible) processor well, the new G34 which was launched two months ago.
Glenn Hanus – Needham & Company: Okay, thank you.
Howard Hideshima: Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Dinesh Moorjani from Gleacher & Company.
Dinesh Moorjani – Gleacher & Company: Great, thank you. Just maybe moving away a little bit from the gross margin side. Could you talk about how your international ramp is going specifically, where you are in your new customer ramps and you’re looking to add another line to your facility in Europe. Also could you update us on your expansion in Taiwan and if you’re seeing any new opportunities in either geography now that you have a physical presence in these regions?
Charles Liang: Yes indeed, we just invested in Netherlands and Taiwan for a logistic and system integration. And however as you know in early quarters, right, I mean in the first few quarter the capacity won’t be fully occupied. That’s why the productivity was not a good year, however situation would be improving. Today we have say OEM and key system integrator in Europe and in Asia who demand our local production. So those two areas we are continue consistently improving I believe.
Dinesh Moorjani – Gleacher & Company: Okay, yes in terms of the large new OEM that you’re ramping, you’ve talked about the customer potentially getting to a 10% customer, if the rest of your business doesn’t grow. What kind of timeframe are you thinking in terms of hitting that milestone?
Charles Liang: Howard, could you answer that?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, as we said it’s been over, we’ve been looking at the second half of the year is when we are start ramping or again the ramp has been a little slower than we expected but I think the potential is there still for as Charles alluded to and by building those facilities overseas we have number of new other customers coming to us to help utilize and fill that. So it will get better for us as we get going.
Dinesh Moorjani – Gleacher & Company: Great, thanks.
Operator: And from Kennedy Capital we’ll take a follow-up question from Michael Bertz.
Michael Bertz – Kennedy Capital: Thanks guys, and I’m going to go back to the margin for a second. So Howard as you look at the standard margins to go up and maybe that sort of range is fair to think about, I’m guessing it’s not going to be consistent across the different parts of the revenue contribution. So can you give me a little bit flavor plus or minus into the go more into systems and less in components or how would you think about that?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, I think it’s better in the system side for us obviously, it could be better alluding to the fact that Charles, we do have our own capacity that’s still not being utilized so again in that area the margins from that part of the business is still burdened by some overheard that we’re not utilizing yet, okay, but the margins with the technology transition have improved in that area.
Michael Bertz – Kennedy Capital: Okay and that actually leads to something else so if I think about the server side and sort of where I would estimate margins are currently running versus maybe where they were running a year ago or even 18 months ago, would you characterize that as still being like you said burdened by additional capacity and you’re not quite absorbing so you’re sort of structurally but you’re running less than at historical years and could we see a return to that level?
Howard Hideshima: I think it’s fair to say that yes we started the facility investment overseas probably about nine months ago now and we’ve put the investments in, we’ve been ramping that up and quite frankly it’s not being utilized yet so do we expect to see higher utilization and therefore better productivity, better efficiency part of those facilities and obviously better margins.
Michael Bertz – Kennedy Capital: Okay, I mean it kind of comes back to the sort of the bigger picture question about this because you’ve not want to say a change in sort of the run rate level to where margins are more mid teens than where they had been in the high teens, I certainly understand gross profit dollars at the end of the day being very important as the business is growing but it looks like incrementally margins haven’t been on a positive trends here and I think we’re all asking these questions because we’re trying to understand how that’s going to change. So this will be one way in terms of better utilization of the stuff you’ve invested in overseas particularly for the systems business as that can come out back to a bigger percentage of revenue but we’re all trying to put the pieces together and let us and say okay we can see a path of getting towards maybe those higher teens margins. Can you help us with that a little bit?
Howard Hideshima: Sure I think one of the things that was a little different for this quarter again our inventories went down by about $8 million during the quarter and as you know that there are some inventory variances that come through during that period of time that I alluded to in the call. So again some of those things offset the positive margins from the standard side and brought it down back to basically flat.
Michael Bertz – Kennedy Capital: Okay well Howard, I guess that was time in June, I am talking about looking forward here just sort of the pass on what components let’s say for (inaudible) running mid 15 % but your target is to get the 18% where are each 100 bits going to come from, is there going to be 100 bits from facilities a 100 bits from standard margin improvement, 100 bits from greater mix contribution from the system side, I mean how do we get there this is what I am asking?
Charles Liang: We do have few factors that will improve our gross margin and this net profit. One is economical scale, right. We continue to grow our business sides and that to kinds of help us in term of price negotiation and product allocation with shortage and second is our investment in Netherlands and Taiwan and the new facilities there pretty much under capacity, right, capacity under usage. So that will continue to improve for sure and then headcount kind of increase. Not to remind that we increase our 20% headcount compared with our competitor that pretty much give threat (ph) so that kind of increase kind of big portion of our cost and looking forward we already have a very strong team here so in coming year, at least we pretty much won’t hire than high percentage of headcount again.
Michael Bertz – Kennedy Capital: Okay, thanks guys.
Operator: And we’ll take another follow-up question from Alex Kurtz with Merriman & Company.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman & Company: Thanks I’ll take a breather on gross margin and mix it up for a second Howard. What was Europe quarter-over-quarter for you guys?
Howard Hideshima: Europe, the revenues from Europe actually up on a percentage basis, they were 21.4% in Q3 and 21.7% in Q4.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman & Company: Okay, so from a geo perspective do you guys see any great variances across your major markets?
Howard Hideshima: No I think as we talk about when we were on the road earlier people would ask whether we were seeing a lot of effect from the Europe stuff and the countries that we’re operating in are not in the those Mediterranean areas as much, so we didn’t see as much effect as exhibited by these numbers.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman & Company: Okay and just to clarify back to gross margin, just to clarify on some Michael’s questions, if you think about the (inaudible) adoption that you saw in the quarter, were there any delays in inventory from Intel around their product to help push out more service in the quarter?
Charles Liang: From Intel product point of view we did not see any shortage for sure but memory, hard drive we see a improving and AMD G34 now for sure we (inaudible).
Alex Kurtz – Merriman & Company: So those were the major components. So I think Howard in the past what we’ve always talked about has been new processors lead to better margins right.
Howard Hideshima: Right.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman & Company: It would have been the storyline. So just as a follow-up, did you see the server margin – and I guess can you quantify again what the server margins sort of grew us sequentially. So can we understand that there were some improvements in that fundamental piece of your business?
Howard Hideshima: I think as I talk – mentioned it earlier there was about a 100 bits space improvement in our standard margins across the board.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman & Company: Okay.
Howard Hideshima: And so again those were offset by some of the inventory variances I talked about. Now I added inventory that went down for the quarter which is a little bit unusual for us in a growth type of ramp. So again expectations are that we will be growing our revenues, growing our revenues and growing our inventories to support that growth.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman & Company: And just the last question, I know that increasing your capacity in Europe has always been a big cornerstone for you guys when you talk to investors about structurally improving your long-term gross margin, I think even this upcoming fiscal year, I think there was an expectation that that was going to help, is that because of the transportation cost right, that you were going to see gains from.
Howard Hideshima: Yes.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman & Company: Where are we on that, is that sort of off the table at this point?
Howard Hideshima: Yes Alex as we mentioned we’re not as far along as we thought we would be in that process, I think it’s from basically working with our customers, getting to know that business and then growing that business, we have – as I said earlier we have high expectations for that business still going forward.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman & Company: So you do not expect to sort of reap those benefits then from the increased capacity in Europe?
Howard Hideshima: I do, it’s just going to ramping.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman & Company: Okay.
Howard Hideshima: It’s just behind with the schedule of the customer.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman & Company: Okay, all right. Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll go next to John Lopez (ph) with Saratog Capital (ph).
John Lopez – Saratog Capital: Hi thanks I was just curious on the guidance, you guys characterized the industry is being sort of flat sequentially I think is fair but just we don’t have long time serious you guys but you’ve been down once sequentially which is 2008. So and obviously last year there was nothing seasonal about your quarter. So I’m just curious what makes this quarter feel more seasonal can you just discuss why the seasonality is more of a factor for you now perhaps and it’s been in your recent past?
Charles Liang: I get there is combination of overall market, IT industry kind of trend in our own historical experience. So this September quarter looks like a shortage problem where we improve in new product we have (inaudible) ramp up however kind of from our history September yearly did not grow that much.
Howard Hideshima: Yes, it hasn’t grown as much and again Europe is off basically for the holidays again from the first month. So again that usually is indicative of how we’ve guided before and to just bring back on the guidance again we’re at 200 to 210 well that’s only down maybe a percent at a low end, we’re up 4% on the high end, so.
John Lopez – Saratog Capital: Okay, it’s very helpful. Thanks.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And we’ll take a follow-up from Glenn Hanus with Needham & Company.
Glenn Hanus – Needham & Company: Could you comment on your long, you’ve commented in the past of getting back to 30% revenue growth. How are you feeling about that target and what sort of timeframe should we think about for that?
Charles Liang: Last year we achieved 43%.
Howard Hideshima: Yes.
Charles Liang: Right? So last year.
Glenn Hanus – Needham & Company: Whether I mean that was an easy compare so.
Charles Liang: So I mean looking forward I hope that we can catch that (inaudible) 30% year range. But that’s about our goal we are looking for.
Howard Hideshima: Yes Glenn I think if you take the soft compare out for ‘09 even if you go back and sort out ‘09 and put ‘08 in there, we did $540 million, we’re still up plus 30 plus percent so we’ve got seven years of CAGR at 30 plus percent excluding ‘09.
Glenn Hanus – Needham & Company: How about on the operating expense side, could you help me out a little bit with the puts and takes there, the rep of the R&D was up quite a bit this quarter, should we think about that as coming down perhaps here in September and then in the sales and marketing actually it was down this quarter sequentially despite revenue being up and how should we think about that in September?
Charles Liang: Yes for R&D headcount, I just mentioned in last year we increased about 10% headcount in R&D. So we already increased a lot of people and the major reason we increased so much last year because we supported some key accounts. We in kind of enable a strong product line for them but that product line had been very strong so looking forward we won’t hire that high percentage of R&D headcount again. So we still hire some but it won’t be as aggressive as last year basically (ph).
Glenn Hanus – Needham & Company: Okay and then on the sales and marketing?
Charles Liang: Sales and marketing we were continue to grow kind of certain level (ph).
Glenn Hanus – Needham & Company: And why was it down this quarter sequentially?
Charles Liang: This quarter.
Howard Hideshima: Glenn, we were down a couple of 100,000 this quarter primarily because trade shows last quarter, Glenn.
Glenn Hanus – Needham & Company: Sure, okay. All right, thank you.
Operator: And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of our conference call. I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. Liang for any closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you everyone. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude the Super Micro fourth quarter fiscal year 2010 conference call. We do appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect at this time. Thank you.

In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today's press release and in the supplemental information attached to today's presentation. I will now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon everyone. Please turn to slide 4. First, let me provide you with the highlights of the second quarter. We are pleased that our second quarter revenue was $182 million or 22.5% higher quarter-over-quarter, and 41.5% higher year-over-year. This result is a record high for Super Micro. Non-GAAP net income was $9.2 million or 58.4% higher quarter-over-quarter, and 37.2% higher compared to last year. Super Micro's non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.22 per diluted share compared to $0.15 last quarter or $0.17 last year. Slide 5 please. Last quarter was our strongest on record. Not only was our revenue a record high for our quarter, but we also achieved a second consecutive quarter of greater than 20% growth, making the beginning of fiscal 2010 our fastest start over. We grew in all product categories, especially in Nehalem-based served products, storage, Blades and GPUs. We also grew in all geographies, which demonstrates the increased focus we have in European and Asian business. Our growth is a result, are the strongest, (inaudible) have at Super Micro. With such a strong product, we have been asked to competitively bid by more and more companies and be in larger and larger opportunities. Super Micro continues to benefit from our offering that our customer value in this economy, especially on maximizing performance per watt and per dollar. Clearly, the December quarter provides evidence of the French cycle, that is underway. Due to the recession, companies extended their use for life of their IT system longer than new year, with system architecture and process technologies that provide the companies with higher performance and lower energy costs. The total cost of ownership is reduced to rise that our OI has tremendously improved. As an example, in recent Super Micro win, our client want an HPC cluster to access maximum energy efficiency and the computing density. We provide the client with our full-way solution containing 240 processor cores in a 7U blade enclosure, combined with our own QDR 40 gigabit per second Infiniband switch. This solution enabled the time to save 25% in energy and coding costs, with traditional document [ph] server. Because of our challenging new economic reality and the savings IT department must generate, we expect that this IT cycle will continue throughout 2010, and expect that Super Micro is a value proposition will allow us to continue our strong growth. During the quarter, we saw momentum continue to build for our products, such as our Nehalem processor based solutions, our Twin family of products including our Twin² and TwinBlade. Storage which was especially strong in this quarter, and GPU solutions which continue to grow strongly. While the first half of this fiscal year was very strong, we traditionally have an even stronger second half of fiscal year. With our growing branding strength, important OEM wins, new product launch, and the growing revenue opportunity in Europe and Asia, we have a strong position to expand in the coming quarters, in particular as we have a strong – okay, important OEM win, in particular as we have previously discussed. We are putting that integration capacity in Europe, which will serve new OEM clients as we have provided standout service for our customer base in Europe, we would reach significant capacity by the mid of this year in Europe. In the upcoming quarters, we will begin delivery of some important new products that will fully extend our leadership and innovation in the server technology. These product lines are TwinBlade, we extend our Twin architecture to our SuperBlade, and we are able to double the density providing 20 DP nodes support in a 7U blade enclosure, with 40 gigabit per second Infiniband, or 10 giga Ethernet connectivity options. Our new generation 1U and 2U enterprise optimized rack mount product line, therefore optimized for enterprise virtualization application, including 18 DIMM 94% higher efficiency redundant power supply, more I/O capability, GPU capability and 100% cooling redundancy. And our optimized rack solution for datacenter which provide a (inaudible) user-friendly cabling, and strong and real, size of module expansion. Our new generation 4-way MP systems, one was our new generation 4-way systems were based on Intel Boxboro chipset and new Nehalem EX MP CPUs, which provides a much higher memory and I/O bandwidth than the previous generation 4-way systems. And then the new process of technologies, as you may know, Intel Westmere system architecture will launch in middle of March. And AMD G34, a core named Magne-cours, and dual core architecture, also to launch in the end of March. And our storage product line expansion, Super SBB storage-free space, which use our Twin design concept that can incorporate or bridge the SATA and SAS storage solutions. And our new innovation, double-sided storage product, this support up to 45 3.5-inch hot-swappable hard drive for 4U enclosure, instead of 24 hard drive supported from competition. In summary, we continue to expand the Super Micro brand as a technology leader. Our pipeline of technology innovations and our rapid product development capability make us feel very confident that we are in the technology leading position and that we are on a strong growth trend. With that, let me hand it over to our CFO, Howard Hideshima for our financial details.
Howard Hideshima: Thank you, Charles, and good afternoon everyone. I will refocus my remarks on earnings, gross margins, operating expenses and similar items on a non-GAAP basis which reflect the adjustments to exclude stock compensation expenses. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company in today's earnings release and in the supplemental details in this slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Let me begin with a review of the second quarter income statement. Please turn to slide eight. Revenue was a record $182 million, up 41.5% from the same quarter a year ago and up 22.5% sequentially. The increase in revenue from last year was fairly widespread among our customer base, which we believe was primarily attributable to the continuing improvement in the global economy and new products which were introduced since then. The sequential increase in revenue from last quarter was primarily due to increases in our storage UIO and Nehalem-based products. Slide 9. Turning to product mix, the portion of revenues from server systems was 36% of total revenues, which was a decrease from 41% a year ago and an increase from 34.5% last quarter. ASPs for servers was about $1,400 per unit, which is up from $1,300 per unit last year and comparable to the $1,400 last quarter. The increase in absolute dollars of server products from a year ago and sequentially was primarily due to increased shipments of servers to OEM and end customers. We shipped approximately 48,000 servers in the second quarter and 803,000 sub systems and accessories. We continue to maintain a diverse revenue base with none of our over 400 customers making up more than 10% of our net sales in the second quarter. Furthermore, 57.6% of our revenues came from the US, and 68.5% from our distributors and resellers. Internet data center revenue was 6.9%, which was a decrease from the prior quarter of 7.3%. Slide 10 and 11. Non-GAAP gross profit was $30.5 million, up 25.7% from $24.2 million in the same quarter of last year, and up 23.6% from $24.7 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, gross margin was 16.7%, down from 18.9% a year ago, and up from 16.6% sequentially. Price changes from Ablecom resulted in no change to the gross profit in the quarter, with total purchases representing approximately 26.5% of total cost of goods sold compared to 22.8% a year ago and 22% sequentially. The increase sequentially was primarily due to higher levels of inventory for future demand. The sequential increase in gross margin of 0.1% was primarily resulted from a higher percentage of sales in complete server solutions as noted above and a low percentage of sales of sub systems and accessories and Internet datacenter sales. Operating expenses were $16.4 million, up from $15.6 million in the same quarter a year ago, and up from $15.6 million sequentially. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses was 9%, down from 12.2% a year ago, and down from 10.5% sequentially. Operating expenses was up on an absolute dollar basis year-over-year primarily due to additional personnel expenses related to increased headcount in R&D and sales and marketing, offset in part by higher NRE and customer-funded projects in R&D. Sequentially, we saw an increase primarily in sales and marketing expense due to higher commissions and bonuses to sales personnel as well as higher co-op market fund due to increased level of revenue. R&D expenses were about the same due to higher NRE and customer-funded projects, offset by personnel expenses related to increase in headcount and bonuses during the quarter. During the quarter, we had about 1 million of additional customer-funded projects, which reduced the overall R&D expense by this amount. We do expect to have this, this quarter, but at a lower rate. Headcount increased by 24 sequentially to 909 total employees. Overall, we have maintained good control of our operating expenses, while at the same time maximizing our opportunities by investing in our future. Operating profit was $14.1 million or 7.7% of revenue, up $5.5 million or 63.5% from $8.6 million or 6.7% of revenues a year ago, and up $5 million or 55.1% from $9.1 million or 6.1% of revenues sequentially. The increase in operating profit shows our ability to grow our topline while still maintaining control of our expenses. Net income was $9.2 million of revenues, up from $2.5 million or 37.2% from $6.7 million a year ago and up $3.4 million or 58.4% from $5.8 million sequentially. Our non-GAAP fully diluted EPS was $0.22 per share, up $0.05 from $0.17 per share a year ago and up $0.07 from $0.15 per share sequentially. The number of fully diluted shares used in the second quarter was 40,531,000. The increase in diluted shares was primarily due to the impact of options, which were previously underwater. The tax rate in the second quarter on a non-GAAP basis was 34.1% compared to 20.8% a year ago and 35.1% sequentially. The increase from last year’s tax rate was due to the R&D credit being reinstated retroactively during the second quarter of fiscal 2009. The R&D tax credit expired on January 1st, 2010. Should the credit be reinstated retroactively, then the company would adjust in the quarter the credit is reinstated. We expect the effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis to be approximately 35% for the March quarter. We are actively working on our international tax strategy in conjunction with our plan to expand oversees as mentioned by Charles above, which we hope to lower our effective corporate tax rate in the next few years. Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis, slide 13. Cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term investments were $88.9 million, which is up from $85.2 million in the prior quarter. In the second quarter, free cash flow was a positive $900,000 [ph], and the net change in cash was a positive $8.7 million. The cash balance reflects the redemption at par of $5.3 million of auction rate securities. Total auction rate securities held by the company is approximately $6.6 million at the end of December. The company has no debt. For the six months period, free cash flow was a positive $9.9 million, and the net change in cash was a positive $12 million. Slide 14. Accounts receivables increased by $4.8 million to $54.9 million and the DSO was 27 days, a decrease of 3 days from the prior quarter. Inventories increased by 34.2 million to 134.3 million, with the days in inventories at 71 days, which is the same as prior quarter. Accounts payable increased by $26.3 million to $112.6 million, with the days payables outstanding increasing by one day to 60 days. Overall, our cash conversion cycle days were at 38 days, a decrease of four days from 42 days in the prior quarter. Each of these balance sheet items points to managing our working capital well during a time of revenue growth, economic and product transition, as well as positioning the company for future growth. Now, for a few comments on our outlook. As indicated previously, during the second quarter, we saw continuing improvement in the economy, but more importantly, our customers and partners continue to see the benefits that our solutions can provide them. We see this trend extending and further expanding into other markets and verticals and new customers. However, the third quarter is typically a seasonally weaker quarter for the industry, we assume there will be new product introductions at the latter part of the third quarter from Intel and AMD, which could temper demand in the quarter. We have tempered our forecast. Our margins, we will continue to invest in our customer base in order to continue to build our economies of scale, while at the same time leveraging our operating expenses. Therefore, the company currently expects net sales for the quarter ending March 31st, 2010 of $175 million to $185 million. Assuming this revenue range, the company expects non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.18 to $0.21 for the quarter. It is currently expected that the outlook will not be updated until the release of the company's next quarterly earnings announcement. Notwithstanding subsequent developments, however, the company may update the outlook or any portion thereof at any time. With that, let me turn it back to Charles for some closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Howard. The first half beginning to our fiscal 2010 have been very strong, which is record results for Super Micro. Having our strong product line and growing brand name recognition, we are well positioned to continue this record pace into the second half of this year. I will now turn the call back to Perry.
Perry Hayes: Operator, at this time, we are ready for questions.
Operator: (Operator instructions) We will go first to Doug Reid with Thomas Weisel Partners.
Vivek Manipadam – Thomas Weisel Partners: Hi, this is Vivek Manipadam in for Doug Reid. It would be great to get your thoughts on what you felt the pricing environment was in the current quarter, and whether you felt there was a lot of pressure to reduce prices in order to win business?
Charles Liang: Yes, we fear the competition continue very strong, and (inaudible) However because we have a very strong new product line, new architecture, GPU, Twin². So, I believe we can maintain the best margin we believe it has been for us. And again, yes, we try to be aggressive in price to grow our market share.
Vivek Manipadam – Thomas Weisel Partners: Speaking of the margin, would you all be able to provide some guidance regarding what you expect margins to be in the March quarter?
Charles Liang: March, again, also new product lines still new and still popular. So, I don’t feel we will have a challenge here. So, it should be growing mostly.
Vivek Manipadam – Thomas Weisel Partners: Okay, great. And just one follow-up, would you all share your opinion on how you have seen component prices react in the December quarter?
Charles Liang: Yes, there are a lot of shortages, because our recovery of our economy. So, we are facing some shortages, but not big of an issue, because we used to keep a very good safety inventory.
Vivek Manipadam – Thomas Weisel Partners: Okay, and when you say shortages, could you specify which particular component?
Charles Liang: You know, it’s close to the product line, memory, hard drive, even capacitor, FET, but again because we keep good safety inventory, so the impact to us should be reasonable, accessible.
Vivek Manipadam – Thomas Weisel Partners: Okay, great. Thank you so much.
Charles Liang: Yes, thank you.
Operator: We will move on to Alex Kurtz with Merriman & Company.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman & Company: Hi guys, can you hear me okay?
Charles Liang: Yes.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman & Company: Congratulations on a great quarter. Howard, can you just talk a bit about, you know, the strength in the servers quarter-over-quarter, what verticals, what product lines really stood out for you guys?
Howard Hideshima: I think, Alex, as Charles mentioned earlier, storage area was pretty strong for us this quarter as well as GPUs. You know, we continue to gain traction there. Obviously our Nehalem line is very strong also.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman & Company: And are you starting to see the, the GPUs starting to kick in on ASPs yet, is that starting to help the overall ASP as well as margin?
Howard Hideshima: I think so, Alex. You know, we just introduced that probably about a quarter or so ago. So, it’s just at the very beginning of its ramp up for us, but we have seen very good traction in it.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman & Company: Okay. And if you could just revisit for us what you think your long-term growth profile is for the company, and behind that, just remind us what the target operating model is, and sort of what the timing of that could be? Do you see that as something that you could accomplish exciting fiscal 2011? Just some updated color on that behind these strong results today. Thank you.
Charles Liang: Yes. For March quarter, because both Intel and AMD have a new CPU kind of Westmere and G34, both will be launched by March, end of March indeed. So, we believe we would have to be conservative for March quarter, but you know, with so many new technologies, second half of this fiscal year should be a greater year to us.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman & Company: But Charles, do you think you guys can get back to those 30% kind of growth rates again over the next couple of years?
Charles Liang: At this moment, we feel very confident.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman & Company: And Howard, just on the target operating model and sort of the timing around that?
Howard Hideshima: Right. As we said before, Alex, the target operating model, you know, has basically an operating margin about 9 to 12, gross margins about 19 to 20 [ph], and we set it about one to three years out. We still feel confident.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman & Company: Okay, so no comment on timing. Okay, thank you guys.
Operator: And we will move on to Glenn Hanus with Needham & Company.
Glenn Hanus – Needham & Company: Good afternoon. Just a follow-up in clarifying the gross margin. You feel like gross margins going forward can be flat to slightly up, and I don’t want to put words in your mouth, and then just sort of a puts and takes on the next quarter on the gross margin?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, Glenn, this is Howard. Yes, you are right. As Charles mentioned, we feel that, you know, the gross margin to be very stable. I think the puts and takes of it will be as we ramp up some of the European and overseas expansion, we will get some benefits from that as we bring that facility up, reducing our logistical costs and our shipping costs. Obviously new product introductions typically help us. And then on the other side of that would be growing our market share, still important to us basically growing our economies of scale.
Glenn Hanus – Needham & Company: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: (Operator instructions) And it appears at this time, we have no further questions. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Liang for any additional or closing comments.
Charles Liang: Yes. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you everyone. Have a great day. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude the Super Micro second quarter fiscal year 2010 conference call. We do appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect at this time. Thank you.

In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non GAAP results is contained in today's press release and in the supplemental information attached to today's presentation. And now I will turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon everyone. Please turn to slide four. First, let me provide you with the highlights of the first quarter. We are pleased that our first quarter revenue was 148.5 million or 20.3% higher quarter over quarter, and 3.1% higher year-over-year. The result indicated that again we again outpaced the industry and that we continue to gain market share. Non-GAAP net income was 5.8 million or 54.5% higher quarter over quarter, and 30% over than last year. Super Micro's non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.15 per diluted share compared to $0.10 last quarter or $0.21 last year. Please turn to slide five. Last quarter was a strong quarter of growth for Super Micro and it was the second quarter in a row for strong growth. We believe that we have established our upward trend and we will extend this growth in the coming quarters. Super Micro is very well positioned for future growth because we have developed the strongest product line in our history. Many more customers (inaudible) Super Micro's application optimized solutions to help them realize their goals of maximizing performance per watt and per dollar. Respectively the goal we set for ourselves is to continue to outpace the industry and to take more market share. Last quarter, we saw a favorable product line contributed to our strong revenue growth. First, we clearly saw an improvement in the adoption rate of the Nehalem processor based solutions. Because we have been first to market with (inaudible) Nehalem product line in the industry, we saw a positive impact to our revenue from Nehalem by offering more selections, value and quality. We expect further gain from Nehalem based solutions for our next several quarters. Second, our 2U Twin2, the market leading architecture introduced two quarters ago continued to see strong growth and customer's preference, refinements such as full hot pluggable capability and cable free design have made this product one of our most popular ones. Third, the new GPU optimized system architecture we have created is the fastest server in the industry with market multiple teraflops of performance in 1U or 4U chassis. That has performed well in vertical markets such as education, government (inaudible). Fourth, this quarter we also launched AMD's Istanbul 6 core solutions; once again Super Micro was first to market with this product line in the industry. Additionally, this quarter, we benefited from stronger demand from IT managers as the economic climate improved. Together with our market leading product line, we were well positioned to favor our Super Micro brand into the recovery economy and take advantage over new technology spending. In summary our revenue growth is the evidence of our ability to outperform in competitive environment and to gain market share. Super Micro's strength of providing customers with technology leading products that have improved performance and reduced total cost of ownership is allowing us to build our brand and grow our business. As you may already know, our potential to grow our business is not limited to our largest geographic market, the like United States. We are certain that we also have a strong opportunity to grow in Europe. In order to grow our European business, we have made investment over the past years to increase the size of our logistics center and established our new integration facility in (inaudible). Now we are taking the next step to extend our business model to Europe. In the up coming quarters, we will start to ramp our completed server solution production in the next run for our European customers. Our European integration capacity will allow us to grow our European business by meeting customer's requirements faster. Moreover it will also allow us to reduce logistics expense by rerouting our supply line to Europe. The Europe expansion is a very important move for us to achieve the faster growing demand of our customers during a time of economical recovery and beyond. Please turn to slide six. In the coming quarters, other than 2U Twin2 and GPU product line that will continue to grow in volume. We will launch some other new products that will further extend our leadership and innovation in server technology. This product (inaudible) based on our twin architecture will double the density of our SuperBlade. In the 7U space, we will be able to support 20 and 28 DP nodes with 40 gigabyte per second Infiniband or 10 giga Ethernet connectivity option. This high density, high-efficiency yet lower in cost solution will be most suitable for HPC and data center applications. Second, our new generation 1U and 2U enterprise optimized rack mount product line, we further optimized for enterprise virtualization application, 18 DIMM 94% higher efficiency redundant power supply, more I/O capability, GPU supported and hundred percent cooling redundancy. Also our new generation four way MP systems, one of the new generation four way systems where we based on Intel Boxboro chipset and new Nehalem EX MP CPUs (inaudible) which provide a much higher memory and I/O bandwidth than the previous generation. And then, our Super SBB storage (inaudible) using our twin design concept, we're developing a full functional and superset of inter twist [ph] SBB solutions which can incorporate or bridge SATA and SAS storage solutions. In summary, we have out of the brand that Super Micro has developed as a technology leader. Our twin technology natural design allows us to develop products for various applications quickly to meet our customers' demands. All those ongoing technology innovation and reputed product government capability makes us feel very comfortable we are in the technology leading position in the industry and are on a strong growth trend for many years to come. With that, let me hand it over to our CFO, Howard Hideshima for our financial details.
Howard Hideshima: Thank you, Charles, and good afternoon everyone. I will focus my remarks on earnings, gross margins, operating expenses and similar items on a non-GAAP basis with reflect the adjustments to exclude stock compensation expense and a provision for litigation loss expenses. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company in today's earnings release and supplemental detail in this slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Let me begin with a review of the first quarter's income statement. Please turn to slide eight. Revenue was 148.5 million, up 3.1% from the same quarter a year ago and up 20.3% sequentially. The increase in revenue from last year was fairly widespread among our customer base which we believe was primarily attributable to continuing improvement in the global economy which we have seen since March of this year. The sequential increase in revenue from last quarter was primarily due to an increased attention being put on obtaining cost-effective solutions as the economy recovers and higher purchases of new products such as our Intel and AMD-based solutions continue. Please turn start to slide nine. Turning to product mix, the proportionate revenue from server systems was 34.5% of total revenue which was a decrease from 38.7% a year ago and 36.7% last quarter. ASPs for servers was about $1400 per unit which is up from about 1300 dollars per unit last year and comparable to the $1400 per unit last quarter. The decrease in absolute dollars of server products from a year ago was primarily due to a decrease in shipments of OEM servers. The increase in absolute dollars of server product sequentially was primarily due to an increase in shipments of our series 6000 servers. We continue to maintain a diverse revenue base within [ph] of over 400 customers making up more than 10% of our net sales in the first quarter. Furthermore, 63% of our revenues came from the US, and 68.1% from our distributors and resellers. Internet data center revenues was 7.3% which was an increase from the prior quarter of 5.8%. Slide 10 and 11. Non-GAAP gross profit was 24.7 million down 11.9% from 28 million in the same quarter of last year and up 19.6% from 20.6 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, gross margin was 16.6% down from 19.4% a year ago, and from comparable to 16.7% sequentially. Price changes from Ablecom resulted in a positive 0.2 basis points change to gross profit in the quarter with total purchases representing approximately 22% of total cost of goods sold compared to 27.3% a year ago and 19% sequentially. The sequential decrease in gross margin primarily resulted from a lower percentage of sales in complete server solutions as noted above and an increase in sales to the Internet data center offset in part by transition to higher margin products incorporating new processors from Intel and AMD. Slide 12. Operating expenses were 15.6 million, up from 14.9 million in the same quarter a year ago, and from 15.2 million sequentially. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses was 10.5%, up from 10.4% a year ago, and down from 12.3% sequentially. Operating expenses was higher on an absolute dollar basis year-over-year primarily due to lower entry and customer funded projects in R&D. In G&A, expenses for the current quarter included 257,000 of low pre-payment penalties and write off of loans due to our repayment of 10 million in bank loans which represents all of our loans. Sequentially, we saw an increase primarily in sales and marketing expenses due to an increase in marketing development fund and advertising expenses to promote new products of the company and from headcount additions to prepare the company for future growth R&D expenses were lower due to higher NRE and customer funding projects. G&A expense for the quarter included 257,000 of loan penalties and fees mentioned above for paying off all of our debt. Headcount increased by 20 sequentially to 885 total employees primarily in operations and sales and marketing. Overall, we have maintained good control of our operating expenses, while at the same time maximizing are opportunities by investing in our future. Operating profit was 9.1 million or 6.1% of revenue down 3.9 million or 30.5% from 13 million a year ago and up 3.7 million or 67.8% sequentially. Net income was 5.8 million or 3.9% of revenue down from 2.5 million or 30% from 8.3 million a year ago and up 2 million or 54.5% from 3.8 million sequentially. Our non-GAAP fully diluted EPS was $0.15 per share, down six cents from $0.21 per share a year ago and up $0.05 from $0.10 per share sequentially. The number of fully diluted shares used in the first quarter was 40,140,358. The increase in diluted shares was primarily due to the impact of options which were previously underwater. The tax rate in the first quarter on a non-GAAP basis was 35.1% compared to 36.1% a year ago and 28% sequentially. As we increased incomes after than we increased our R&D expenses, the percent of R&D credit become smaller and hence our tax rate increases. The R&D tax credit is set to expire on January 1, 2010. Should the credit be reinstated retroactively, the company would adjust in the quarter the credit is reinstated. We expect the effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis to be approximately 35% for the December quarter. Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis, slide 13, cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term investments were 85.2 million which is about the same as the 85 million in the prior quarter. In the first quarter, free cash flow was positive 9 million, and the net change in cash was a positive 3.3 million. The cash balances reflect the repayment of 10.2 million of ban loans and the associated pre payment penalties during the quarter. Excluding this repayment of debt, the company's cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term investments would have been about 95.4 million. The company has no loans. Slide 14. Accounts receivables increased by 4.4 million to 50.1 million and DSOs was 30 days a decrease of 3 days from the prior quarter. Inventories increased by 10.1 million to 100.1 million with the days in inventories decreasing by six days to 71 days. The company manages inventory well as we met the increasing demand from a recovering economy and the recent transition to new products such as Nehalem and Istanbul based solutions as well as GPU and 2U Twin2 servers. Accounts payable increased by 12.8 million to 86.3 million with the days payables outstanding decreasing by one day to 59 days. Our overall cash conversion cycle days were at 42 days, a decrease of eight days from 50 days in the prior quarter. Each of these balance sheet items points to our managing our working capital well during a time of revenue growth, economic and product transition, as well as positioning the company for future growth. Now, for a few comments on outlook. As indicated previously, during the first quarter, we've saw continuing improvement in the economy and are transitioning to our strong new product innovations based on the latest technology introduction. Customers and partners continue to see the benefit that our solutions can provide them by either lowering their overall total cost of ownership or by lowering their investment from rolling out new solutions by utilizing our products. We see this trend extending and further expanding to other market verticals and new customers. Therefore, the company currently expects net sales for the quarter ending December 31, 2009 of 155 million to 165 million. Assuming this revenue range, the company expects non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.15 to $0.18 for the quarter. It is currently expected that the outlook will not be updated until the release of the company's next quarterly earnings announcement. Notwithstanding subsequent developments, the company may update the outlook or any portion thereof at any time. With that, let me turn it back to Charles for some closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Howard. Our first quarter results was a good beginning to start this fiscal year. We see lots of room in the market for true application optimized server solutions and we will continue to be focused and aggressive in pursuing this opportunity. We're proud of the brand that Super Micro has developed as a server technology leader with our leading architectural designs for systems and blades. And we're confident that our focus on application optimized solutions will keep us on a strong growth trend. I will now turn the call back to Perry.
Perry Hayes: Operator, at this time, we are ready for questions.
Operator: (Operator instructions) We will go first to Michael Bertz with Kennedy Capital.
Michael Bertz – Kennedy Capital: Good afternoon gentlemen. Thanks for taking the question. Nice quarter. Just wanted to ask a couple of things across the balance sheet, Howard, so obviously inventories didn't increase as much as revenues, it is great, how should we think about that (inaudible) you think you can keep that as the business continues to pickup?
Howard Hideshima: I think you will historically see us maintain pretty consistent days. We will have spike ups during times of product transition. But we will try to keep it in the historical limits.
Michael Bertz – Kennedy Capital: Can you refresh me where that is Howard?
Howard Hideshima: Sure. You will seeing our DSOs or inventory this quarter was 71 days, previous quarter was about 77 days, prior to that was about 85, about a year ago was about 74.
Michael Bertz – Kennedy Capital: Okay, all right. And similarly obviously the account receivable basically in the same bucket sort of rising at the same level as inventories, about 10% quarter to quarter, it actually looks fairly linear given the revenue coming up quite so much, again same question, your ability to keep that and improve cash flow going forward?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, I believe so. Again, we are seeing improved linearity in our quarters and so again the inability to maintain our DSOs over the span of 30 days.
Michael Bertz – Kennedy Capital: Okay. And so any difference you'd see with the holidays for that?
Howard Hideshima: Typically, if you look back seasonally, you will see that Decembers are fairly strong quarters for the company barring the economic upheaval we just went through. If you go back farther back you will see that December is usually a stronger quarter for the industry and for ourselves.
Michael Bertz – Kennedy Capital: Okay and then moving on to again looking I know Charles you talked about investments in Europe, can you give us some favor on sort of what kind of investments you are making there, what kind of CapEx that might entail, how we might see that layering in over the next several quarters, not necessarily, can you tell me what you think about revenue too if you want but just in terms of what kinds of investments you are going to be making?
Charles Liang: Okay. Indeed because (inaudible) not much investments from cash point of view or money point of view. However that will dramatically improve our time-to-market you know over a product from (inaudible) to European market and time to market will improve. Second also very important is reduce shipping charge. Before we build most of the server here, completed the server here in (inaudible) and after that we shipped to customers in Europe by air, so that could courier (inaudible) so indeed stuff next month, about next week, next week we will start (inaudible) so that will reduce our shipping costs. And with those extensions for sure, we already improved our FAE, field application help in Europe, as well as growing our sales team significantly, so we see good growth in Europe in coming quarters and years.
Michael Bertz – Kennedy Capital: Okay, that's great. And then just any implications for margin impact, I mean Europe is not exactly a low cost manufacturing area pushing there [ph] to states?
Charles Liang: Because we will save persistent shipping by air almost $80 barrels, so $80 saving by air, and for sure that includes the (inaudible) maybe slightly higher (inaudible) we can still save lots of money.
Michael Bertz – Kennedy Capital: Great. And last question then, Howard, since we look forward in terms of gross margin, any thoughts about mix there and what the impact to margin that might be?
Howard Hideshima: I think as Charles alluded to, we will see some hopefully some positive impact as we expand our European logistics to better service clients and customers over there. Additionally because that again you know we're keeping a tight eye on our expenses overall to make sure that we are making the right investments for the future while still balance our expenses currently.
Michael Bertz – Kennedy Capital: Okay great. Thanks guys.
Howard Hideshima: Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Doug Reid with Thomas Weisel Partners.
Doug Reid – Thomas Weisel Partners: Thanks so much. Great quarter. Wanted to get a little closer to the gross margin trends heading into the December quarter, though. Howard, just in reviewing those factors that led to the sequential decline in gross margin, could you talk a little bit about which of those factors are likely to continue on as a headwind for gross margin going into December and then what kind of profile you might think would make sense of gross margin going into calendar 2010?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, Doug, I think you know we talked about on the conference call, we had two things. We have upward push from our new product introductions, I think you'll see that as we introduced new products based on the latest technology. Apart from that, you'll see some headwinds from us as we just tried to take market share, grow our market share more aggressively going forward. And as you saw on the results of the revenue line on the top. So I think you should see us looking at the pattern going forward.
Doug Reid – Thomas Weisel Partners: Okay, and could you give a little more color on where you are seeing strength around the 2U Twin2 by segment and how concentrated the business you're seeing there is?
Charles Liang: Indeed the 2U Twin2 as you know new product to us since the last two quarters ago and product volume has continued to grow and we believed 2U Twin2 because it is much better performance per watt and performance per dollar even so demand indeed we see continuous growth. Other than that, you know, our GPU, GPU is another architecture, brand new architecture we just created about six weeks ago – indeed no more than that, abut four or five months ago, so now the (inaudible) are growing very strongly. So, all those providers pay their margins in kind of greater room to grow in volume this year.
Doug Reid – Thomas Weisel Partners: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: (Operator instructions) We will not go next to Glenn Hanus with Needham.
Glenn Hanus – Needham: Okay, good afternoon. Great revenue performance and guidance in December, maybe you could just talk a little more specifically about how much of this do you think is kind of the economy versus you know some of the new product releases and company specific things?
Charles Liang: Basically I believe both are important. The economy overall is continuously recovering although slowly but kind of consistently. However, that area the factor that (inaudible) by our sales is the technology, so we introduced 2U Twin2 two quarters ago, GPU about five months ago, and then we will have taken TwinBlade in production very soon together with Nehalem new announced AMD six core, PCI Express II (inaudible) and that is why we believe December quarter should be a strong quarter.
Glenn Hanus – Needham: How about on operating expenses, Howard, how should we think about sort of sequential growth here and operating expenses? Are you investing a little bit more on the sales side given the stronger outlook?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, I think that's a fair assumption, Glenn. So you saw this past quarter we gave the sales and marketing expenses did go up sequentially, so again we are investing in our sales and marketing people as well as the overseas expansion to improve our revenue growth.
Glenn Hanus – Needham: And back on the gross margins again, it sounds like when you net out the factors, you are looking for some gross margin expansion into the December quarter?
Howard Hideshima: We haven't given the gross margin guidance but again like you say generally if you leverage it we are able to leverage the revenue growth that we have here, then usually you will have some leverage in the gross margin.
Glenn Hanus – Needham: And the server solutions number going down, is that factor going to kind of reverse itself over the next few quarters or…
Charles Liang: Again in always has been done in the December quarter basically we have a good feeling they come back especially the European integration facility with next week. We already have some pipeline production in the last few weeks look like average being going on smoothly, so traditionally in Europe helping us to grow.
Glenn Hanus – Needham: Okay. So sounds like you will be selling more server solutions and that will help you some the internet service provider stuff that is kind of lumpy, little unpredictable, but you mentioned headwinds in order to go share so you know are you pricing a little bit more aggressively or have you seen a little bit more aggressive pricing in the marketplace and how should we think about that as a factor over the next couple of quarters?
Charles Liang: We continue to gain more market share in high-end – higher end market, that is the kind of 2U Twin2 kind of like GPU indeed pretty much high end high value system, so we could gain more margin from those product lines.
Glenn Hanus – Needham: Okay, thank you.
Operator: We will go next to Nihal Satchi [ph] with Technology Insights Research.
Nihal Satchi – Technology Insights Research: Hi guys, nice quarter. Just wanted to follow-up on some of Glenn's questioning here, with systems coming up on a QoverQ basis more than components I believe that you guys are indicating, correct?
Howard Hideshima: Yes.
Nihal Satchi – Technology Insights Research: Okay. So but the guidance in place at the EBIT margins are going to stay more or less consistent, and so are you guys going to be reinvesting in your OpEx at a faster rate than you expect your sales growth?
Howard Hideshima: I think – Nihal, this is Howard. Like I said, yes, you do see that but again I think we will temper our investments with what opportunities are out there and on the top line we will take a look at our revenue and make strategic decisions there also. But back to your question on op expenses, we will watch that and we will temper it according to the opportunities that exist.
Nihal Satchi – Technology Insights Research: Okay. So it sounds like there's a lot of moving parts in order to optimize basically possibility in the near-term and long-term basically as you look at market share opportunities as well as investing in sales?
Howard Hideshima: That is correct.
Nihal Satchi – Technology Insights Research: Okay, thank you.
Operator: We will go next to Alex Kurtz with Merriman Curhan Ford.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman Curhan Ford: Yes, thanks guys. And thanks for taking the question and great quarter. So Howard just a follow up on that question, I mean if you look at September of your last fiscal year, you did $144 million in revenue and you did about 9% operating margin and here we are talking about the December quarter, the midpoint of about say $160 million in revenue and you guidance sort of implying maybe flat operating margin, so I guess if – what – where is the discrepancy again in that because if we – you obviously hit much higher operating margin targets about four, five quarters ago, it's just been OpEx creep over the last year that leads us to a point where you can't do 8% or 9% this quarter?
Howard Hideshima: I think Alex certainly like you said it is a combination as Nihal indicated, there is combination of factors that are happening. You know one the OpEx is somewhat higher than it was last year. Sequentially we have kept it fairly consistent and we plan to keep an eye on it and keep it fairly consistent, make the right investments, I guess that's the way to put it while still at the same time allowing us to grow our top line and our opportunities.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman Curhan Ford: Okay, all right. And then Howard on the unit count, can you just give us the unit by server, by servers and components? Do you have that?
Howard Hideshima: Let me get back to that one, Alex. Just a second.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman Curhan Ford: Okay. Then Charles, I just have a quick question for you. As we head into calendar 2010, how would you sort of see demand from a server refresh perspective based on Istanbul and Nehalem versus a bounce back in spending, which of those two items do you see sort of leading the way for you guys?
Charles Liang: Indeed we feel basically very positive real, the economy looks like continue, will continue recover slowly, but although slowly, very consistently, but mostly important because our kind of outstanding architecture right, I mentioned a couple of times 2U Twin2 has been a very popular architecture people like to have and GPU again the quantity ramping up very strongly. So with Nehalem and with (inaudible) also coming very soon. AMD's Istanbul, PCI Express Gen II just a bit above a quarter ago and quantities still in quickly ramping up. Plus however 40 giga Infiniband we just make our 40 G DDR Infiniband switch available about a one month ago all those factors will grow our business though.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman Curhan Ford: Okay. And Howard just I don't know if you have those unit numbers yet, but just as a last question here, you want to take a stab at what revenue levels you have to get back to then to hit that the low end of your long-term operating model?
Howard Hideshima: I think we are still at as I indicated before there are long term operating models are probably one to three years out, so if you extend our growth on there, I think during the past five years prior to the economic upheaval, we were growing at about 34%, 32% cliff on a CAGR basis, and so again as we extend out one to three years, get out of this economic recession that we have been in, and as Charles mentioned, get back on more the trajectory were on previously.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman Curhan Ford: Okay, thank you guys.
Howard Hideshima: Alex, just as a follow-up, 37,000 server units.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman Curhan Ford: Okay. And the server components?
Howard Hideshima: Sub systems and accessories are sitting at about 655,000.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman Curhan Ford: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: (Operator instructions) And it appears, at this time, we have no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Liang for any additional or closing comments.
Charles Liang: Thank you for joining us today and we are looking forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you everyone. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude the Super Micro first quarter fiscal year 2010 conference call. We do appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time.

I will now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Perry, and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to slide four. First, let me provide you with the highlights of the fourth quarter. We are pleased that our fourth quarter results rebounded nicely from the previous quarter with an increase in revenue of 12.7%. The results indicated that we outpaced the industry during the economical slow recovery and that we're gaining market share. This attributes to our strong engineering foundation and continued aggressive investment in R&D during the downturn. We are well positioned for future growth. Super Micro's revenue in the first quarter was 123.5 million or 17.1% lower than last year. Non-GAAP net income was 3.8 million or 53.2% lower compared to last year. Super Micro's non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.10 per diluted share compared to $0.06 in the last quarter or $0.21 last year. Slide five please. Now, I would like to share with you our achievements during the past fiscal year and especially last quarter. Fiscal 2009 was a challenging year due to the global economic downturn that impacted IT spending worldwide. Still Super Micro managed strong investment in its product mix and launched some major new product innovation. These new developments along with our fit in this model that focused on truly application optimized server solutions allowed us to gain market share during this difficult time. Last year we had developed our strongest product line areas and had been well producing for our technology transition to new generation products based on the new Intel Nehalem and AMD six core processes technologies, especially most of those products (inaudible) production ram up during last quarter. As a result, Super Micro finished this year with a rebound in the first quarter sales that was 0.7% higher than our other quarters this year. And we expect this pressure will continue for quite a while. More importantly throughout this very difficult year, Super Micro gained much share. The difficult economic met our product's performance (inaudible) and proved to be more attractive to our existing as well as new customers. In this economical situation, the value proposition of our (inaudible) significantly lowered our total cost of ownership and opened up new and great opportunities for Super Micro. Our customer base is growing and we are bidding and winning in more new vertical markets than before. As we cross fiscal 2009, we are also very pleased to report that where we invest in R&D operations during this difficult economical period. Super Micro continuous its 16 year trend of profitable results because of its focus on faster to market, efficient operation and containing costs. During this past year, after the economical downturn, start IT spending, many IT vendors decided to cut R&D and other costs as well as lay off workers. Super Micro on the other hand made an important decision to continue to invest and focus on R&D in order to enhance our product lines and to better position the company for future growth. It was our belief that the leaders of tomorrow will be those who keep on advancing their technology by investing in innovation and product development for the future. Super Micro's strong foundation is based on its advanced server technology and solid engineering work. Over the years, we have become a leader in our industry. For example, we had the foresight to introduce the power efficient green server and storage technology, the UIO servers, the twin system architecture, and most recently the networking dual and quad GPU system architecture – I mean GPU represents graphical processing units. Most of the time, our competitors need a few miles or years to follow and matching our products available in the market. Please turn to slide six. In fiscal 2009, our investment in R&D have furthered our technology advantages. The new 2U Twin2 server architecture features full DP computing nodes with 93% high-efficiency Gold Level power supply designed in a 2U form factor. This breakthrough product line has averaged the heights of performance per watt at over 375 gigaflops per KW, which yields up to 25% net power savings over the industry regular 1U servers. Even more impressive, the 4 DP nodes are (inaudible) and cable 3 for ease of maintenance and optimized cooling system. Most recently, we had launched a family of GPU optimized system again, graphical processing unit, designed to meet the requirements of high-performance computing demand. The new architecture feature multiple by 16 (inaudible) PCI Express Gen 2 connectivity to each GPU (inaudible) optimize cooling and Gold Level power efficiency as well as system structural enhancement. The system was truly the fastest server in today's industry with multiple teraflops of performance in the 1U or 4U chassis. In a recent announcement, one of our customers used this solution and made in the June 2009 top 500, a list of most powerful supercomputer in the world. The solution is also the most energy efficient concept in the commodity system space on a (inaudible). During the quarter, our engineering team introduced the (inaudible) server product line in the industry, starting with the launch of Nehalem processors. When Nehalem was launched on March 31 of this year, we showcased our first to market (inaudible) product line in the industry with roughly with about 80 SKU of server board, more than 30 chassis models, and have more than 30 super servers at launch. We continue to develop and broaden Nehalem product line since it is a strong growth driving force for Super Micro. Also during the quarter, we had focused and launched a series of a SM Bus embedded products and a set of high density SAS storage platforms. There SM solution optimized for value server appliances or embedded industrial PC applications. With their extremely low power requirements and nearly silent noise level, the high density storage SAS solution will save customers up to tens of thousands of dollars per rack in electricity costs during their (inaudible) by utilizing Super Micro's green technology and (inaudible). (inaudible) Super Micro delivers 93% Gold Level power supply with PM Bus standalone, most of our new super server high-end systems including its latest SuperBlade server. Super Micro also provides flexible system customization with its universal IO, UIO interface, that allow customer to choose from a host of IO cards, including soft tools, 10 giga (inaudible). For the most value and best remote moment management, Super Micro offers IPMI 2.0 (inaudible) support most of our new platforms as well as (inaudible) and high-performance through the (inaudible) or more options. As we look ahead to the new fiscal year, we will continue to thoroughly utilize our (inaudible) model advantage of strong engineering and technology leadership, strong customer partnership and strong vertical market focus to continue winning much share for Super Micro. With that in mind let me share with you some of our new product offerings that we will launch in the next few quarters. Please turn to slide seven. Super Micro Twin Blade based on our twin architecture, we doubled the density of our SuperBlade in a 7U space, we are now able to provide 28 DP nodes or 56 CPU sockets support with Infiniband or 10G connectivity option. This high density and high (inaudible) solution will be more suitable for today's HPC data center applications. Second, our new generation 4 way MP system, one of the new generation four way system, where we based on Intel Boxboro chipset and the new Nehalem EXMP [ph] GPU with two PI link which provide a much higher memory and IO bandwidth than the previous generation four way system. And then our networking products, we have been quite successful in developing switch for our brand and adapted for our servers. We see increasing demand from our customers for standalone switch. We have introduced two models of gigabit switch and are continuing to develop more products like the Infiniband (inaudible) and 10 G (inaudible) and those products where we have (inaudible). And also our Super SPP, storage (inaudible) using our twin design concept, we are developing (inaudible) of standby SPP solutions, which can incorporate or bridge SATA and SAS or fiber channel storage solutions. With that, let me hand it over to our CFO, Howard Hideshima, for our financial details. Howard?
Howard Hideshima: Thank you, Charles, and good afternoon, everyone. I will focus my remarks on earnings, gross margins, operating expenses and similar items on a non-GAAP basis, which reflect the adjustments to exclude stock compensation. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company's in today's earnings release and in the supplemental detail in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Let me begin with a review of the fourth quarter income statement, please turn to slide eight. Revenue was 123.5 million, down 17.1% from the same quarter a year ago and up 12.7% sequentially. Revenue for the fiscal year was down 6.5% for the same 12 month period a year ago. The decrease in revenue from last year was fairly widespread among our customer base, which we believe was primarily attributable to the global economic downturn. The sequential increase in revenue from last quarter was primarily due to the continuation of the improvement we have seen in the economy, which started in March of this year. The ramping of new products such as our Nehalem based solutions and an increase in the component sales such as CPU hard disk drives and memory. Slide nine. Turning to product mix, the proportion of revenue from server systems was 37% of total revenue which was a decrease from 39% a year ago and (inaudible) ASPs for servers was $1400 per unit which is up from about $1300 per unit last year and $1100 per unit last quarter. The increase in server products was primarily due to an increase in shipments of Series 6000 servers. We continue to maintain a diverse revenue base with none of our over 450 customers making up more than 10% of our net sales in the fourth quarter. Furthermore, 65.6% of our revenue came from the US and 65.3% from our distributors and retailers. Internet data center revenue was 5.8%, which was a decrease from the prior quarter of 12.1%. Slide 10 and 11. Non-GAAP gross profit was 20.6 million, down 27.9% from 28.6 million in the same quarter last year and up 25.1% from 16.5 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, gross margin was 16.7% down from 19.2% a year ago and up from 15% sequentially. Price changes (inaudible) resulted in a positive two basis points change to gross profit in the quarter with total purchases representing approximately 19% of total cost of good sold compared to 18.6% a year ago and 18.1% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease in gross margin results from lower margin, the cost of product line due to competitive pressures as we grew market share during the economic downturn combined with a mature product line that was transitioning to the new Intel Nehalem CPU, which was launched on March 30. The sequential increase in gross margin primarily resulted from higher margin as we ramped up sales of Nehalem based solutions. Slide 12. Operating expenses were 15.2 million down from 16.7 million in the same quarter a year ago and an increase from 14.6 million sequentially. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses was 12.3%, up from 11.2% year-over-year and down from 13.4% sequentially. Operating expenses was lower on an absolute dollar basis year-over-year and higher sequentially. We saw year-over-year decreases in absolute dollars spending in sales and marketing due primarily to the 819,000 of lower co-op marketing funds due to lower revenue levels. Sequentially, we saw an increase, primarily in G&A expense due to an increase of 216,000 in accounting and tax fees associated with our year-end audit and SOX compliance, which is expensed as incurred. Headcount increased by four sequentially to 865 total employees. Overall we maintained good control of our operating expenses while at the same time maximizing our opportunities for investing in our future. Operating profit was 5.4 million or 4.4% of revenue down 6.5 million or 54.6% from 11.9 million a year ago and up 3.6 million or 192.6% sequentially. Net income was 3.8 million or 3.1% of revenue down 4.3 million or 53.2% from 8.1 million a year ago and up 1.3 million or 54.7% from 2.4 million sequentially. Our non-GAAP fully diluted EPS was $0.10 per share, down $0.11 from $0.21 per share a year ago and up $0.04 per share from $0.06 per share sequentially. The number of fully diluted shares used in the fourth quarter was 39,467,254. The increase in diluted shares was primarily due to the impact of options, which were repeatedly (inaudible). The tax rate in the fourth quarter on a non-GAAP basis was 28% compared to 32.1% a year ago and negative 44.3% sequentially. The tax rate was primarily affected by the reinstatement of the Federal Reserve research and development tax credit and adjustment to reduce the higher levels of tax reserves than is currently warranted. We expect the effective tax rate, on a non-GAAP basis to be approximately 32% for the September quarter. Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis, slide 15, cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term investments were 85 million, up 7.6 million from 77.4 million in the prior quarter. In the fourth quarter, free cash flow was positive 7.6 million, and a net change in cash was 7.6 million. For the 12 month period, free cash flow was a positive 18.2 million and the net change in cash was a positive 18.8 million. Subsequent to June 30, on March 24 and August 4, the company paid off 10 million of the mortgage loans, which will eliminate the interest expense for the remainder of the year from these loans and leave the company with no debt. The company has reported approximately 257,000 in G&A expenses during the present quarter for pre-payment and write off of the loan fees. Slide 14. Accounts receivable increased by 2.9 million to 45.7 million and the DSO was 33 days, a decrease of two days from the prior quarter. Inventories increased by 7.1 million to 90 million with the days in inventory decreasing by 8 days to 77 days. The company manages inventories well that we supported new products such as Nehalem and (inaudible) based solutions as well as GPU and 2U Twin2 servers. Accounts payable increased by 13 million to 73.5 million with the days payable outstanding increasing by two days to 60 days. Overall cash conversion cycle days were 50 days, a decrease of eight days from 58 days in the prior quarter. Now, for a few comments on our outlook. As indicated previously, during the fourth quarter, we saw continuing improvements in the economy and the ramping of sales of our strong new products, innovations based on the latest technology introductions. Therefore, the company currently expects net sales for the quarter ending September 30, 2009 in the range of 128 million to 138 million. Assuming this revenue range, the company expects non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.11 to $0.40 for the quarter. This is currently expected to be the outlook and will not be updated until the release of the company's next quarterly earnings announcement. Notwithstanding subsequent developments however, the company may update the outlook or any portion thereof at any time. With that, let me turn back to Charles.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Howard. In summary, with our strong Nehalem product line continued in (inaudible) and with our most innovative 2U Twin2 and GPU solution starting their (inaudible) as well as with our other upcoming product launches, we're confident that new year will fully demonstrate our technology leadership and will contribute a strong growth to our shareholders. Now let me turn the call back to Perry.
Perry Hayes: Operator, at this time, we are ready for questions.
Operator: (Operator instructions) And we will go first to Doug Reid with Thomas Weisel Partners.
Doug Reid – Thomas Weisel Partners: Thanks. Congratulations on a nice quarter. I just wanted to get a sense on gross margin within components, so I know that you don't break out exclusively gross margin therein, but could you give some color behind just gross margin trends then for those two areas?
Charles Liang: Yes. Basically with new product launch like Nehalem and like our 2U Twin2 with GPU you know new product always provide us better margin. And Howard, (inaudible).
Howard Hideshima: Yes, Doug. As we talked about before between servers and components sales, there can be as much as a 5% to 10% differential depending upon the application you know as far as what types of offering we are putting together and how complex that box may be. But all product lines basically were very strong for us and gross margin increased.
Doug Reid – Thomas Weisel Partners: Okay, great. And then just quickly on the data center sales, kind of fairly steep drop-off but wondering if you could provide some visibility into what you're seeing now and your expectations of the September quarter from that segment?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, Doug. This is Howard again. You know like I said, we have always said it is kind of project by project based, so you will see fluctuations in that. I think previously (inaudible) you will see 7%, it was 12% prior quarter and about 6%, 5.8% this quarter. So you will see project by project basis and we believe we have great technology and that will be appealing.
Doug Reid – Thomas Weisel Partners: Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator: (Operator instructions) And we will go next to Glenn Hanus with Needham & Company.
Glenn Hanus – Needham & Company: Good afternoon guys and congrats on your quarter. Maybe if we settle back to gross margins for the second, could you talk a little more about the puts and takes driving gross margin and the trend going forward here, what was the extent of price – competitive price pressures in the quarter and you know that was probably offsetting gains you were seeing from new products. So could you talk more thoroughly about the puts and takes on gross margin this quarter and what we should think about it in our models going forward?
Charles Liang: Basically our business has been very consistent and very stable. However, as you know, since many years ago – I mean whenever we add new product, new innovation, we have a better quarter, a couple of quarter continue basically, and this time Nehalem which we announced by the end of March, so indeed Nehalem product line (inaudible) quickly ramping up (inaudible) I think including September quarter, especially 2U Twin2 which provided a lot of new features and that will generate best ASP and better as well. And GPU, GPU is a brand new architecture. We just create and introduced to the market in preparation of our (inaudible) so that product line is ramping up quickly. And again for a new product, pretty much no strong competitor in the market today, so we would see better margin from those product line in the next – in at least the next few months or few quarters.
Glenn Hanus – Needham & Company: You want to add to that, Howard, or to what extent is Nehalem – you're probably not going to give me an exact number, how much of your product does Nehalem represent, it just started, is kind of in the early innings or has it –we are expecting it to be most of your volume based within a few quarters. Can you talk about how quickly that has ramped because I assumed that is impacting the gross margin trend?
Howard Hideshima: It is Glenn. Great question. Again that is the way to characterize it, we are in early innings, we just launched on March 30 right, so we're just started to ramping up on those things. I think it is a positive (inaudible) some ASP effect, we have seen the increase in our ASPs going from about 1100 last quarter in the third quarter to about 1400 in this current fourth quarter that we just finished, so it is contributing there, but it is just ramping.
Glenn Hanus – Needham & Company: And how about the competitive pricing pressures, how would you characterize that, about the same as last quarter, more severe, less severe, how is that?
Charles Liang: We see slightly improving (inaudible).
Glenn Hanus – Needham & Company: Okay, thank you.
Operator: (Operator instructions) We'll go next to Alex Kurtz with Merriman Curhan Ford.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman Curhan Ford: Just to follow-up on Glen's question there, so you are seeing an easing in price pressure? Or an increase in pricing pressure?
Howard Hideshima: Hi, Alex, this is Howard.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman Curhan Ford: Hi, Howard.
Howard Hideshima: I think generally Alex we are feeling pretty good about the economy as far as the start of and March started getting stronger for us, so I guess it is a mixed bag. If you call pricing pressure, the economy recovering, we are feeling better with that momentum starting to build in the March period, continuing to do that fourth quarter.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman Curhan Ford: Just to clarify, so are Dell and HP applying more pressure than they have in the past because they are – well, first of all, congratulations on the quarter, but as a follow-up to Glenn's question, so are you seeing pricing pressure or not?
Charles Liang: Basically you know I mean we have a product architecture BDM [ph] advantage so especially 2U Twin2 and we provide even hot pluggable capability (inaudible). So we should have a better kind of competition position in the coming quarters.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman Curhan Ford: Okay. And Howard, you know can you just give us the unit counts on the servers and the components?
Howard Hideshima: Yes. Alex, let me get back to you, just a second with that.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman Curhan Ford: All right.
Howard Hideshima: Okay.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman Curhan Ford: And as you pull that up, you know I know that Nehalem is providing a lot of momentum going into the September quarter but I'm just going to ask you now as you look at the midpoint of your guidance, obviously it is up sequentially Q1 is typically a down sequential quarter for you guys so can you give us the rational and sort of thinking about giving an up quarter guide, still on a pretty choppy tape, and so what gives that conference in your pipeline to do that?
Charles Liang: Yes, I mean in history basically September quarter usually (inaudible) compared with June. But this year we are very active, we see a different signal. So again primarily because of new products, especially (inaudible) Nehalem is another big contributing force.
Howard Hideshima: And dovetailing back to your question, server units were 33,000.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman Curhan Ford: Okay. Tell me about components?
Howard Hideshima: More than 523.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman Curhan Ford: 523. So, Howard, do you want to add to that, any comments about the pipeline and sort of what you're seeing from your managers out in the channel and sort of the sense about demand for Nehalem going into September?
Howard Hideshima: I think it is characterized by the economy itself or maybe just a feeling that everything is getting a little bit, at least in our business over here, and I feel better about as we enter the quarter.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman Curhan Ford: Okay. And last question for this round, Howard, you hit 9% on non-GAAP operating margin back in September of last year. That was at obviously at a higher run rate, but you know can we extrapolate that maybe by the end of fiscal 2010, maybe we can get back to those levels if sort of the demand picture sort of remains intact if not improved from what you're seeing right now?
Howard Hideshima: Well, Alex, I guess the best way to put it is that we are still just giving the quarterly forecast, we still see strength. You know we have seen our guidance go up to you know 128 to 138 for this quarter, which is an improvement in our trends, and so we are hopeful. We're continuing to watch our expenses and implement programs to make sure we keep an eye on that operating expense and then we will keep driving with the new products that Charles mentioned, keep driving our revenue and hopefully our gross margin.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman Curhan Ford: Okay, thanks a lot guys, and congratulations on a really good quarter, guys.
Howard Hideshima: Thank you.
Operator: We will go next to Nihal Satchi [ph] with Technology Insights Research [ph].
Nihal Satchi – Technology Insights Research: Hi guys. Good job on a nice quarter there. Could you talk a little bit about why component – what caused components to be up about 20% Q to Q compared to systems up 5% Q to Q and then following up with where you see those two segment performing for the next quarter?
Howard Hideshima: Hi Nihal, how are you doing? With regard to components, I think it is more driven by our customers again. They are utilizing our new solutions, our latest technologies, and they're asking us to provide a little bit more of the full solutions in there, although we may not be putting it together in our own box, we are shipping it to them, components that basically fall back to work with our solutions, so that is where the trend is I think as an overall.
Nihal Satchi – Technology Insights Research: Okay. So going along that lines, it sounds like that will continue to be the case, yet you saw 170 basis points of GM improvement so on the lower margin product line, so it seems like the new products are doing very well in terms of price, would that be an appropriate way of characterizing that?
Howard Hideshima: Absolutely, Nihal. I mean I think the ASP increments that you saw there about 1400 – from 1100 to 1400 is indicative of that.
Nihal Satchi – Technology Insights Research: Okay. And could you just say, we think the customer components, was there any particular segment for the component customers that were especially strong or geographies that are especially strong that you could talk about?
Charles Liang: Basically we see a very – even the (inaudible) business and most of the categories are better than the other, but because we have a broad product base, so relatively (inaudible).
Nihal Satchi – Technology Insights Research: And then last question, so do you have any thoughts on what your addressable market grew on a sequential basis, any guidance you can provide would be helpful?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, Nihal. We – I think the addressable market is actually increasing for us. I mean Charles mentioned a little bit about the embedded markets, that presents great opportunities for us into the future, right? That is above and beyond the x86 market for us and we're making great traction there. And then the other markets that we service, especially with the new products that we are launching like the GPU and other things are opening up other market verticals for us like oil and gas or film or industry and those types of markets are opening up to us.
Nihal Satchi – Technology Insights Research: Okay, thanks guys.
Operator: And we will now take a follow-up from Glenn Hanus with Needham & Company.
Glenn Hanus – Needham & Company: Did I understand you to say that globally there were no particular strengths or weaknesses from a territory standpoint, globally was fairly balanced in your view or how – maybe if you could just talk kind of about your international business by region versus domestic in terms of the kind of the demand trends you are seeing?
Charles Liang: Nihal (inaudible) we see Europe, Europe (inaudible) weakest, and Asia is a little bit surprising, Asia is strong, right, maybe because of China right, so other than that (inaudible).
Howard Hideshima: Yes, it has been pretty even, Glenn. I mean like you say, you will see a little bit of increase in our US geographies, I said about 64% of our revenue came out of the US as compared to about 60% last quarter.
Glenn Hanus – Needham & Company: Okay. How about operating expenses, Howard, you had a little blip up there in G&A on the – I forgot exactly what it was, but…
Howard Hideshima: The audit and tax fee?
Glenn Hanus – Needham & Company: Yes, right, the audit, so OpEx in September, will that be flat to slightly down?
Howard Hideshima: Well (inaudible) where let us say the audit and tax and software, so that basically will – we don't incur as much in the present quarter because we are doing our year end stuff then in the fourth quarter. However I want to make note that again we do have about 256,000 of loan fees and those things that will be – are recorded in the G&A line. It is an offset basically there.
Glenn Hanus – Needham & Company: Okay.
Howard Hideshima: Okay.
Glenn Hanus – Needham & Company: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And it appears at this time that we have no further questions. So, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Liang for any additional or closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Okay, thank you for joining us today and we look forward to talking to you again at the end of each quarter. Thank you everyone, have a great day.
Howard Hideshima: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the Super Micro Inc. fourth quarter and fiscal year 2009 conference call. We do appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you.

Most of today’s presentation will refer to non-GAAP financial results and outlook. For an explanation of our non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to slide 3 of this presentation or to our press release published earlier today. And now, I’d like to turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Perry and good afternoon everyone. Please turn to slide 4. Super Micro’s revenue in the third quarter was $109.5 million or 19.0% over last year. Non-GAAP net income was $2.4 million or 59.2% over – compared to last year. Super Micro’s non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.06 diluted share compared to $0.15 last year. The third quarter was seriously influenced by the global economic recession during which IT spending declined sharply. In addition, the quarter was marked as the preparation of Intel’s Nehalem CPU launch. For that reason, IT managers have been waiting for the new technology before ending their budget and this had an impact throughout the whole quarter. While it is difficult during this recession to accurately forecast when a bottom may be reached, however, we believe that because of the technology transition that is underway and because of our strong new product line that worst should be behind us. I would like to share with you a number of innovative architecture and new product lines, which will place Super Micro in a strong position for the coming quarters. First, the new Intel Nehalem (inaudible) launch. Please turn to slide 5. As we have said previously, Super Micro has been leading ahead for a Nehalem solution, which occurred on March 30. This is one of the most significant introduction of CPU technology, impacting server hardware that we have not seen in the past two-and-a-half years. We are excited about our new technology and we expect the advantage of Nehalem in terms of memory and I/O performance, power efficiency, and processing speed will be strong compelling reasons for IT managers to adopt our Nehalem solution. As we have said in the past, Super Micro has been made available with the broadest product line in the industry for the Nehalem launch. At the time of the launch we had approximately 80 SKU of motherboard products, 30 plus chassis models, and more than 32 plus server SKU available. Having this quantity of building block available at the launch allows us to showcase our special uniqueness in the industry. No other company can offer a number of application optimized server solution as can Super Micro. We already have over hundred of application optimized solutions ready and the number is growing. By optimized application solutions we mean that we can offer customization, for example more I/O and storage memory, great memory capacity, higher efficiency, or extremely power-saving design in a cost-optimized fashion. These application optimized solutions are developed to address all server markets including datacenters, enterprise, scientific and engineering, medical and high-performance computing. Our past experience with technology transition of Intel’s CPU demonstrates that our preparation has been rewarded with larger growth in our business. One of the hallmarks of Super Micro has been our technology development and our time to market. We are well prepared for this launch and we expect our new product will do well in this technology transition. Second, our 2U Twin2 product line. Please turn to slide 6. We have launched our 2U Twin2 product line just recently and just started shipping in volume. During this big show, our 2U Twin2 has been recognized as the breakthrough product because of the four independent hot-pluggable DP nodes.
 : Third, our GPU optimized workstation and server solutions. Slide 7 please. We had recently developed a GPU (inaudible) optimized architecture to address the needs of high performance computing and virtualization applications. These applications are typically used in the field of oil and gas exploration, research labs, defense, and medical.
 : As we have said, we are a technology company at our core and we invest heavily in research and development to stay ahead of our competition. Recently, we also have been working on another exciting new product that will be launched in upcoming quarters. This new product will further enhance our sever product line and make for more total solutions from Super Micro.
 : And third, embedded product. We will extend our penetration of the cost-effective server applications with the Intel atom-based design. AMD, Istanbul. We will start shipping our AMD, Istanbul-based product also since this quarter. In summary, our R&D effort has provided us the best product lines in the industry. As you can see from our financial report, we have cut spending in other areas to fund our R&D investments. We feel that our focus on technology innovation clearly differentiates Super Micro from the competition and is the foundation of our success. It is our long-term strategy to continue to invest in developing computing technology and innovation products that promote the market share gain, bring awareness, and a strong ROI performance. History has shown that during market upheavals, companies that continue to focus on R&D had a better chance of future when market recovers. Now, we have strong new line of products that give us a great opportunity to increase our market share, as well as extend our product line to new markets. We believe that our strategy of being the leader in server technology innovation will be worthy to our shareholders. With that, let me hand it over to our CFO, Howard Hideshima for the financial details. Howard?
Howard Hideshima: Thank you, Charles, and good afternoon everyone. I will focus my remarks on earnings, gross margin, operating expenses, and similar items on a non-GAAP basis, which will reflect adjustments to exclude stock compensation expenses. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company in today’s earnings release and in the supplemental detail in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Let me begin with a review of the third quarter income statement. Please turn to slide 9. Revenue was $109.5 million, down 19.9% from the same quarter a year ago and down 14.8% sequentially. Revenue for the nine-month period was down 2.4% from the same nine-month period a year ago. Slide 10. The decrease in revenue was fairly widespread among our customer base, which we believe was caused by the global economic downturn and the effect it has had on IT spending, as well as the technology transition. The proportion of revenue from server systems was 39% of total revenues, which was an increase from 35% a year ago and down from 41% last quarter. ASP for servers was down from about $1,300 per unit last quarter to about $1,100 per unit. The decrease in server products was primarily due to a decrease in shipment of our 6000 series. During the quarter, components decreased due to decreases in chassis, which resulted in less pull-through of serverboard. For the nine-month period, components and server revenues were down 3.9% and 0.1% respectively over the same nine months a year ago. We continue to maintain a diverse revenue base with none of our over 400 customers making up more than 10% of our net sales in the third quarter. Furthermore, 59.8% of our revenues came from the US and 65.9% from our distributors and retailers channel. Internet datacenter revenue was 12.1%, which is an increase from the prior quarter of 7.9%. Slide 11 and 12. Gross profit was $16.5 million, down 34% from $25 million in the same quarter last year and down 32% from $24.2 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, gross margin was 15%, down from 18.2% a year ago and down from 18.9% sequentially. Price changes from Ablecom resulted in a negative 2-basis point change to gross profit in the quarter, with total purchases representing approximately 18.1% of total cost of goods sold, which is down from the 27.4% a year ago and 22% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease in gross margin resulted from lower margins across our product line due to competitive pressures as we grew market share during the economic downturn combined with a mature product line that is transitioning to the new Intel Nehalem CPU, which was launched on March 30th. This was partially offset by our inventory reserves being lower year-over-year due to our improvement of inventory management to reduce excess and slow-moving inventory through product conversion and increasing sales efforts. The sequential decrease in gross margin resulted from the same influences of the pressures from the economic downturn and the product transition to Nehalem, as well as an increase in inventory reserves. Slide 13. Operating expenses were $14.6 million, down from $15.6 million in the same quarter a year ago and down from $15.6 million sequentially. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses was 13.4%, up from 11.4% year-over-year and up from 12.2% sequentially. Operating expenses were lower on an absolute dollar basis both year-over-year and sequentially. We saw both year-over-year decreases in absolute spending in sales and marketing, as well as G&A expenses. Sequentially, we saw a decrease in R&D expense, which could have been lower except for a delay in a project caused us to defer in NRE credit. Headcount decreased by one sequentially. Overall, our third quarter operating expenses are evidence of our tight control on spending during this economic downturn. Operating profit was $1.8 million or 1.6% of revenue, down $7.5 million or 80.2% from $9.3 million a year ago and down from $6.8 million or 78.5% sequentially. Net income was $2.4 million or 2.2% of revenue, down from $3.5 million or 59.2% from $6 million a year ago and down $4.3 million or 63.8% from $6.7 million sequentially. Our non-GAAP fully diluted EPS was $0.06 per share, down $0.09 from $0.15 per share a year ago and down $0.11 from $0.17 per share sequentially. The number of fully diluted shares used in the third quarter was 38,893,519. The tax rate for the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis was a benefit of negative 44.3% compared to 36.4% a year ago and 20.8% sequentially. The tax rate was primarily affected by the reinstatement of the Federal Reserve and research and development tax credit and an adjustment to reduce a higher level of tax reserve than is currently warranted. We expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 30%. Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis. Slide 14. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments were $77.4 million, up $2.5 million from $74.9 million in the prior quarter. In the third quarter, free cash flow was a positive $3.2 million and a net change in cash was a positive $2.4 million. For the nine-month period, free cash flow was a positive $10.7 million and the net change in cash was a positive $11.2 million. Accounts receivable increased by $3.2 million to $42.8 million and DSOs were 35 days, an increase in four days from the prior quarter. Inventories decreased by $6.2 million to $82.9 million, with days in inventories increasing by one day to 85 days. The company continued to make progress in managing inventory in the quarter while preparing for product launches such as Nehalem and 2U Twin2. Accounts payable decreased by $5 million to $60.5 million as the days payable outstanding increased by five days to 62 days. Overall cash cycle days were 58 days, an increase of 10 days from the 48 in the prior quarter. During the quarter, we spent approximately $200,000 to repurchase about 55,000 shares of common stock. To date, we have spent about $2 million to repurchase approximately 445,000 shares of the 2 million shares authorized by the Board at an average price of $4.56 per share. Now, for a few comments on our outlook. As indicated previously, the third quarter was difficult due to the global economic downturn and a technology transition. Many economic reports suggest that we could be reaching a bottom within this economic downturn. The Nehalem processor launch was done on March 30th. As a result, we do expect improving conditions surrounding the adoption of both newer CPU platform and our newest product line. Therefore, the company currently expects net sales for the quarter ending June 30th, 2009 in a range of $117 million to $127 million. Assuming this revenue range, the company expects non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.08 to $0.11 from the quarter. It is currently expected that the outlook will not be updated until the release of the company’s next quarterly earnings announcement. Notwithstanding subsequent developments however; the company may update the outlook or any portion thereof at any time. With that, let me turn it back to Charles for some closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Howard. Before I turn the call over to questions, I would first like to thank all of our dedicated engineering team at Super Micro. Your hard work and commitment to our strategy of being the most innovative and always the first-to-market company has built Super Micro into a technology leader. The dedication of our employee to build the best product portfolio in the industry to our customer, like the hot-pluggable 2U Twin2, the dual GPU in 1U and four GPU in 4U solutions, and the strong Nehalem product line give me great confidence that our future will be strong and bright. Now, let me turn the call back to Perry.
Perry Hayes: Operator, at this time, we are ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator instructions) And we will first go to Alex Kurtz with Merriman Curhan Ford.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman Curhan Ford: Good evening, gentlemen. Can you hear me okay?
Charles Liang: Yes.
Howard Hideshima: Yes.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman Curhan Ford: Okay. So, Howard, just real quick on the housekeeping item. Did you give the unit volume for server components and servers in the quarter?
Howard Hideshima: We did not.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman Curhan Ford: Could you share that with us? You have it on you?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, let me come back to that question.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman Curhan Ford: Okay. And then the ASP of the server components would be great too. So, just looking at your guidance, expecting sequential growth into June, could you just go into detail what gives you guys that visibility and that confidence because last couple of quarters have been challenging for you guys. Do you have a real sense that a good chunk of business has been pushed out because of Nehalem and you really expect it to fall in the June quarter?
Charles Liang: Yes. Because Nehalem, a big product line, just updated on March 30th, right? So, only true data available to us for last quarter. So, now we have a complete Nehalem product line available with the brand new architecture I just mentioned, 2U Twin2, which has been very attractive to all customers. So, we strongly believe that business in this quarter will surely be better than last quarter.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman Curhan Ford: Okay. And Howard, on the OpEx line, are you guys taking any actions there to lower your OpEx going into the June quarter?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, I think as we talked about on the call, we have lowered OpEx expense by about $1 million sequentially and we are not stopping there. We are taking further actions to reduce our costs while continuing to invest in the technology that’s setting us apart from the market.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman Curhan Ford: So, would that come out of G&A or marketing, like where would you find it?
Howard Hideshima: I think you are going to see it all the way across the board.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman Curhan Ford: Okay. And guys, what have you seen in the first couple of weeks here or in the first month of April? How has activity been compared to March?
Charles Liang: Basically, we see the signal is quite positive.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman Curhan Ford: Okay. Okay and Howard, I’ll step aside here, but do you have those numbers yet?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, I’ve got at least the server numbers right now, 39,000 compared to 41,000 last quarter on the units per server unit.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman Curhan Ford: Okay.
Howard Hideshima: And ASP, I did give it at $1,100 versus $1,300 last quarter.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman Curhan Ford: Okay. And the server components?
Howard Hideshima: I’ll get back to you on that one in just a second.
Alex Kurtz – Merriman Curhan Ford: All right, no worry. Okay. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Our next question, then, is from Michael Burns [ph] with Kennedy Capital.
Michael Burns – Kennedy Capital: Yes, good afternoon gentlemen. Just a couple of questions on – what I wanted to explore with you guys about is where the gross margins will trend, so where do you think the pushes and pulls are on that? I mean, obviously the fees are down a little bit, lower utilization and that kind of thing, but what do you think that picture looks like over the course of the year as you start to see ramp in the newer products? And if you can speak in even just relative terms on some of the newer products versus some of the ones that are maybe seeing end of life or something else? What the margin difference is going to look like between those two things?
Charles Liang: Yes. Basically, I mean from our history, whenever Intel has a new CPU unit chipset, in that quarter or next couple of quarters we have a better margin and we have a good chance to grow our revenue. So, this time no different than before expect this time the chance, the difference can be bigger, because for every two years Intel has a big new launch. This time, indeed, it’s more than two years, about two years and ten months. So for the energy accumulator there for Super Micro, indeed have been more than before. And this new product, for sure – I mean, we will have a better margin.
Michael Burns – Kennedy Capital: Okay. So Charles, if you want – I don’t know if you can really put any sort of numbers around that, but if you would, just a relative sense, and would you see margins there between newer and older products, would they be 20% better or – I mean, just some sense around that? I mean, is it something where you are going to see substantial hundreds of basis points improvements or – I’m not going to pin you down for something in the next quarter or like that, but just – what’s the potential for you guys to fill in there?
Charles Liang: Howard, do you have the most – probably the numbers?
Howard Hideshima: Yes. I think Mike, if you look back in history back about over two-and-a-half years ago when we did the Woodcrest MP launch, that after a time, I think proceeding that quarter you’ll see about a point or two differentials as we release the new product.
Michael Burns – Kennedy Capital: Okay.
Howard Hideshima: So, I think if I take you back historically, if this result holds the same, we saw about a 1% to 2% increase in gross margins as we ramped a new product with the new technology.
Michael Burns – Kennedy Capital: Okay. And that pretty much would be from mix and your products. So and then as you think about sort of overall utilization improvements as we pick up volumes, I mean could you – do you think you can pick up another couple of hundred BPs from that as well and get you back toward that range you guys were sitting in before over the last 18 months or so?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, you know that our production expenses quite frankly are quite low. So the influence of utilization is not quite as high at this company as in other companies.
Michael Burns – Kennedy Capital: Okay.
Howard Hideshima: Okay, but we are taking other cost measures to make sure – and working with our vendors very diligently to make sure that we can improve ourselves.
Michael Burns – Kennedy Capital: Okay. Fair enough. And then just on the R&D side, you talked on the – in the presentation about several new groups of products and honestly, some things that looked like they’d really sort of expand your addressable market. Couple of things I wanted to ask you about that. One is particularly for the atom-powered embedded stuff, I mean do you see that as really being incremental to – in your current business or is there something where you are maybe going at the margin and cannibalize a little bit of what you have currently?
Charles Liang:
 :
Michael Burns – Kennedy Capital:
 :
Charles Liang: It’s hard to say, right? All the way from 10% to 30%, but it really depends because the – again, the visibility of today’s poor economical climate will make us try to be conservative.
Michael Burns – Kennedy Capital: Okay. Fair enough. And then last question in terms of – you guys have talked about controlling expenses, which you have done a job with, but continuing to spend on R&D, which is great. How much of your R&D spend is going towards some of these more incremental product lines? And Charles, I don’t know if you and I have ever talked before about to what your hurdle rate is on – what you needed to see back as a return on that spend for R&D before you really approve a project for that. I mean – but, if you can talk about how you kind of approach that, I’d appreciate it.
Charles Liang: Okay, yes. Basically in the last two quarters, we saw most of the competitors cutting their R&D expense, their engineering team size. But here, we did not. Indeed, we continued to grow, decided to grow in our engineering (inaudible) and the good thing is now we have a complete, big Nehalem product line ready, 2U Twin2, a new architecture is completed, ready for volume production. Our GPU product line will be ready for production this quarter and Itanium product line will be also ready this quarter. So, yes, our R&D expense in last couple of quarters will kind of – we will see some results from this quarter especially. And of course, we already have such a strong product line ready now. So, in next couple of quarters we do not have a plan to continue to grow our R&D expense basically. Basically, we have de-saturated here for R&D expense.
Michael Burns – Kennedy Capital: Okay. So, I should expect to see some leverage across the R&D line then into the fall?
Charles Liang: Yes.
Michael Burns – Kennedy Capital: Okay.
Howard Hideshima: And Michael, I’d just remind you, like I said, again, we pride ourselves on our building block base. So, a lot of these things have been developed and we are just retuning these things. So, it’s not incremental or it’s more cost efficient for us to develop new products than many of our competitors, which have brand new designs.
Michael Burns – Kennedy Capital: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks gentlemen.
Operator: (Operator instructions) We’ll next go to Glenn Hanus with Needham & Company.
Glenn Hanus – Needham & Company: Good afternoon. Could you talk at all about blades and how you are doing in ramping up blades?
Charles Liang: Okay. I mean our blade products, indeed, have been growing very steadily even in this poor economical climate. Our blades over this year, I believe will be a 2X to 3X growth. So, that kind of growth, indeed, I personally feel pretty good kind of given the economical condition and we will introduce indeed a Twin blade very soon. And also high-end switch for blades, high-end switch for – independent high-end switch to the market. So, overall, our blade product should be a very successful one, although we did not see a big revenue yet.
Glenn Hanus – Needham & Company: Okay. So you are looking for a sequential growth there in the next couple of quarters?
Charles Liang: Yes. We should be seeing growth for a couple – the next couple of years as well.
Glenn Hanus – Needham & Company: And then on the new product launches, can you give us sort of the timeframe that each of these and the kind of relative, which is the biggest and which is sort of some relative size to think about in terms of revenue contribution?
Charles Liang: Okay, for sure. Nehalem, lots of big things for Intel and especially for Super Micro. And then, 2U Twin2, because it’s a brand new architecture, a hot-pluggable 2U Twin2, some customers call this product low cost to operate, but gives lots of features like a blade server, but cost-wise much lower. So, 2U Twin2 hot-pluggable feature, we believe a great potential.
 :
Glenn Hanus – Needham & Company:
 :
Charles Liang: Okay. For storage, right? We will introduce the Super SBB storage-free space. We call it a super set, because by industry standard only operates UPs, unit processors. Super Micro is so far the only company with a product dual processor, SBB platform. And the launch day I believe will be around June and quantity will start to ramp up around June. Again, this quarter we don’t see a – we won’t see a SBB revenue, but next quarter, September quarter, we will see that. Switch, high-end switch product, again we started sampling some switch about one month ago and the quantity is ramping up. So again, the switch product and the SBB product won’t grow quickly, but relatively would be like our Superblade kind of consistent growth, but growth for long term. Now, this thing is our investment for those high-end storage and switch products are pretty much already there. So basically, we don’t need to spend extra money for those product developments.
Glenn Hanus – Needham & Company: Thank you.
Operator: And it appears at this time we have no further questions in the queue. I’d like to turn the conference back to Mr. Liang for any additional or closing comments.
Charles Liang: Thank you everyone for joining us today and we look forward to talking to you again in the – at the end of the quarter. Thank you everyone. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude Super Micro, Incorporated third quarter and fiscal 2009 conference call. We do appreciate your participation, you may now disconnect at this time. Thank you.

Before we begin, please note that during the course of this conference call, management will be making forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such forward-looking statements may relate, among other things, to our expected financial and operating results, our ability to build and grow Supermicro, the benefits of our products and our ability to achieve our goals, plans and objectives. Such forward-looking statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. These include, but are not limited to: the current economic uncertainty, our dependence on continued growth in the markets for X86, blade servers and embedded applications, increased competition, difficulties of predicting timing, introduction and customer acceptance of new products, poor product sales, difficulties in establishing and maintaining successful relationships with our distributors and vendors, shortages or price fluctuations in our supply chain, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, our ability to control the rate of expansion domestically and internationally, difficulty managing rapid growth and general political, economic and market conditions and events. Most of today's presentation will refer to non GAAP financial results and outlooks. For an explanation of our non GAAP financial measures, please refer to slide three of this presentation or to our press release published earlier today. I will now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Charles Liang : Thank you, Pierre and good afternoon everyone. Please turn to slide four. Super Micro's revenue in the second quarter was $128.6 million or 6.1% lower than last year. Non GAAP net income was $6.7 million or 21.4% lower compared to last year. Super Micro's non GAAP earnings per share were $0.17 per diluted share compared to $0.22 last year. Please turn to slide 5. Given the deep decline of economic condition in rest of the quarter, our industry struggle as IT spending was been reduced. As our result, our revenue was not as strong as we would like to have. Nevertheless, as our result indicated, we have managed to gain much share against our competitors. We are confident about our Super Micro's future shift. It had traditionally performed strongly in soft market condition. We see this difficult time as an opportunity to demonstrate our ability to create truly application optimized solution. They are the basic value for performance solution in the market today. Our market share gain proved that we are getting the attention of careful IT managers who had to operate under tight budget. We had shown them our fundamentals are strong and our product strategy is succeeding. Moreover, our margin is healthy. Our cost structure is well controlled and that we are continuing to be profitable. Please turn to slide 6. During the quarter, our stock price was adversely affected by the financial meltdown on Wall Street. As a result, the Board of Directors took the change to support our stock for the benefit of our shareholders. Utilizing the strong cash position of the Company, the Board authorized a buyback program that enabled the Company to purchase up to 2 million shares of our common stock. The buyback program will expire in June of this year. Our CFO, Howard Hideshima, will provide you with an update for the result or the buyback in a few minutes. There were many successes for Super Micro during the quarter and I would like share some of them with you now. Please turn to slide 7. During the quarter, we were acknowledged in CRN's annual survey as the number one X86 server vendor in the Channel as published in November 24th issue of CRN's 2008 Channel Affinity Index. Based on the result of 8,000 surveyed in this country conducted with the solution providers, it ranked Super Micro as the top X86 server vendor. We will continue to innovate and build a way to increase our channel opportunity to efficiently compete in the marketplace. This collaboration within Super Micro, our channel partners and our customers worldwide is one of the key foundations and the strength of our Company. Another recognition we achieved was from the Government Computer News where they rated Super Micro's SuperServer 6015W the overall best product of 2008. GCN described our product a truly SuperServer and truly the best of the best for the year. This will continue the trend that we have seen when independent groups compare our product to competitors based on power efficiency, thermal management performance and value. Our engineering capability and company infrastructure enabled us to launch many new products along the technology innovation as well as extended the global market we serve. In the recent quarter, we launched the addition of the world's most affordable personal supercomputer featuring our OfficeBlade solution. This product line is ideal for scientists and researchers in life science, biotech, physics, chemistry and similar fields of engineering and science. Moreover, we launched our 5046A workstation system and highly affordable [5035A] cost effective server storage. They are truly optimized for small office and home called SOHO application. Both of these single-socket systems feature 25 to 27dB whisper-quiet operation and deliver the superior energy efficiency that SOHO customers demand. We also had several key wins during the quarter which highlights Super Micro's continual technology leadership in complete intensity, high memory capacity and performance optimization. For example, our 1U Twin solution was recently selected for the prestigious Hyperion Project at Lawrence Livermore National Lab. Now, let me talk about some of our main product innovation that will be released in the coming quarters. Please come to the slide 8. In particular, we are gearing up for the important launch of Intel's Nehalem process technology which is one of the most significant technology transitions in years. We are ready to launch the strongest and broadest Nehalem product line with the cover of our brand new system architecture innovation. We are planning to introduce over 50 SKUs of server and work station board, alongside more than 30 optimized chassis power supply model at the launch which can be easily build into hundreds of application optimizers’ system model. Thank you to our [30:32] solution designs. Building our own success of our 1U Twin by continuing our engineering innovation, we had created an even better product with higher performance per watt and per dollar plus hide the complete density. This new product named 2U Twin2 will be launched in current quarter. This new generation of double density product will support full dB node in a 2U size enclosure with 93% in the high efficiency power including [AF] for sharing technology targeting the HPC and Datacenters market. We also introduced our SOHO product line that is just in CPU and we are seeing very promising demand. In addition, we will also launch high-speed connectivity product such as 10GbE switch and the QDR InfiniBand solution. Moreover, the main storage subsystem is planned to launch in this summer. This had been the advantage of Super Micro that we can react quickly for the changing market in creating new technology and extend our product offering which allows us to continue our technology leadership. Based on this strong product line, I am confident that our business is well positioned for continued succeed. Now, I would like to turn it over to our CFO, Howard Hideshima who will discuss our financial result and outlook for the coming quarter. Howard?
Howard Hideshima: Thank you Charles and good afternoon everyone. I will focus my remarks on earnings, gross margins, operating expenses and similar items on a non GAAP basis, which reflects adjustments that include stock compensation expenses. Reconciliation of GAAP to non GAAP is included in the financial statements of the Company in today's earnings release and in the supplemental details in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Let me begin with the review of the second quarter's income statement. Please turn to slide number 9. Revenue was $128.6 million, down 6.1% from the same quarter a year ago and down 10.8% sequentially. Revenue for the six-month period was up 7% over the same six months period a year ago. Slide number 10. The decrease in revenue was widespread among our customer base as the financial crisis was started in September, affected all parts of the economy. The proportion of revenue from server systems was 38.7% of total revenue, which was a decrease from 42.4% a year ago and 41% last quarter. ASP for servers was comparable the last quarter at about $1300 per unit. Decrease in server products was primarily due to a decrease in shipment of our 6000 series and OEM bundled server. During the quarter, component decreased due to a decrease in shopping which resulted in less full through of motherboard. For the six months period, components and server revenues were up 8.5% and 4.8% respectively for the same six months a year ago. We continue to maintain a diverse revenue base with none of our over 400 customers making up more than 10% of net sales in the second quarter. Furthermore, 65.1% of our revenue came from the US and 66.5% from our distributors and retailers. Internet datacenter revenue was 7.9%, which is comparable with the prior quarter of 10.5%. Slide 11 and 12; Gross profit was $24.2 million, down 11.5% from $27.4 million in the same quarter last year and down 13.4% from $28 million sequentially. On a percentage basis, gross margin was 18.9%, down from 20% a year ago and down from 19.4% sequentially. Price changes from Ablecom resulted in a zero basis point change to gross profit in the quarter with total purchases representing approximately 22.8% of total cost of good sold which is down from 28% a year ago and 27.3% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease in gross margin resulted from lower margins in motherboards and accessory product, offset in part by higher margins in server and chassis. In addition, our inventory reserve was lower year-over-year due to the emphasis on managing our inventory. The sequential decrease in gross margins resulted from lower margins in server products and accessory products offset by higher margins of motherboard and chassis and lower inventory reserve as noted above. Slide 13: Operating expenses were $15.6 million, up from $14.2 million in the same quarter a year ago and up from $14.9 million sequentially. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses was 12.2%, up from 10.4% year-over-year and up from 10.4% sequentially. The year-over-year increase in operating expenses is also from higher payroll and related fringe benefits primarily related to our R&D headcount which remains a competitive advantage of the Company and a priority. Nonetheless, headcount addition and expenses are leveling out. Sales and marketing expenses were controlled during the second quarter at some sales headcount grow and consulting expense was offset by lower variable compensation by the sales volume. G&A expense was flat year-over-year due to lower consulting expenses related to certain taxes offset by slightly higher payroll cost. Sequentially, R&D expenses were up primarily due to lower NRE of approximately $415,000 and an AR reserve of $350,000 recorded in G&A. Operating profit was $8.6 million or 6.7% of revenue, down $4.6 million or 34.6% from $13.2 million a year ago and down $4.4 million or 34% sequentially. Net income was $6.7 million or 5.2% of revenue, down $1.8 million or 29.4% from $8.6 million a year ago and down $1.6 million or 19.2% from $8.3 million sequentially. Our non GAAP fully diluted EPS was $0.17 per share, down $0.05 from $0.22 per share a year ago and down $0.04 from $0.21 per share sequentially. The number of fully diluted share that is used in the second quarter was 39,233,314. The tax rate for the second quarter on a non GAAP basis was 20.8% compared to 36% a year ago and 36.1% sequentially. The R&D credit was reinstated retroactively during the second quarter of fiscal 2009 and there was a one-time charge for this credit during the quarter. We expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 33% which is similar to fiscal year 2008 when the credit was stable. Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis, slide 14. Cash and cash equivalent in short term and long term investment was $74 million, $34.9 million, down $5 million from $79.9 million in the prior quarter. In the second quarter, free cash flow was a negative $3.8 million and a net change in cash was a negative $4.5 million. For the six months period, free cash flow was a positive $7.5 million and a net change from cash was a positive $8.8 million. Slide 15: Accounts receivable decreased by $6.6 million to $39.6 million and DSO was 31 days, which is the same as the prior quarter. The inventory decreased by $11.7 million to $89.1 million with days’ inventory increasing by 10 days to 84 days. While the Company made significant progress in reducing inventory in the quarter, inventory days increased to slow sale volume. Accounts payable decreased by $21.3 million to $65.6 million and the days payable outstanding increasing by one day to 57. Overall cash cycles were 48 days, an increase of 9 days from 39 days in the prior quarter. Free cash flow for the quarter was a negative $3.8 million. Cash flow was impacted by the significant decrease in our accounts payable during the quarter of $20.9 million, partially offset by improving our inventories and receivables. As Charles said earlier in the same fiscal quarter, Super Micro's Board of Director authorized buyback of stocks. During the quarter, we spent approximately $1.8 million to purchase 390,000 shares of common stocks. Now, for a few comments on our outlook: Current uncertainties in the global economic conditions make it more difficult to predict such purchasing decision and Super Micro business comp outlook for the third quarter affected the uncertainties in a demand cycle and coming of sales. The Company currently expects net sales for the quarter ending March 31, 2009 in a range of $115 million to $125 million. Assuming this revenue range, the Company expects non GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.11 to $0.14 per share for the quarter. It is currently expected that the outlook will not be updated until the release of Company's next quarterly earnings announcement, notwithstanding certain development; the Company may update the outlook or any portion thereof at any time. With that, let me turn it back to Charles for some closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Howard. Clearly, we have a stable quarter of challenged economic conditions ahead of us like everyone else. However, Super Micro fundamentals are strong and our product strategy is built to succeed for today's market. Our products represent the basic value proposition in the market today when measured by performance per dollars, performance per watt. We are winning important new clients and are gaining much share as a sign of our ability to perform in tough market and to support our long term success. In summary, we believe we are well positioned to outperform our competitors in today's market. In particular, we are well prepared for the upcoming significant launch of Nehalem product. I will now turn the call back to Pierre.
Pierre Hirsch: Operator, at this time, we are ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, our question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. (Operator's instruction) Your first question comes from the line of Alex Kurtz - Merriman, Curhan Ford & Co.
Alex Kurtz - Merriman, Curhan Ford & Co.: So, what steps are you guys taking to improve your visibility with your channel partners so investors can have some increased confidence in the guidance you just gave? I know it is a challenging market there right now, but are you guys taking any visible actionable steps to inspect your pipeline more or do something so you feel that investors will get behind the guidance that you just gave?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, this is Howard. We are increasing our efforts to get closer to our partners and so we are working even harder with our partners to help them during the challenging times. I do not understand exactly what the requirements are going to be.
Alex Kurtz - Merriman, Curhan Ford & Co.: Howard, does that mean your channel team is doing more reviews every week or doing more inspection of the pipeline? Is there something different happening?
Charles Liang: Yes. I mean we have a regular sales meeting almost twice a week so we have a very good feedback from customers from the market both channel and OEM customers.
Alex Kurtz - Merriman, Curhan Ford & Co.: Okay. Then Charles, can you put a stake in the ground and give us a better sense of when you guys start expecting the shift of Nehalem for revenue in the next couple of quarters like can you give us a month or a couple of months when you start to expect the ramp to happen?
Charles Liang: Okay, as you may know, Intel official launch will be at end of March, right? But traditionally, because our tender market, so usually we are able to service fitting solution or some really special appeal so this year will be a similar opportunity. So we will shift something this quarter will show and maybe this quarter or early April for sure. That will start to shift at regular volume. So, other than Nehalem, we also have some new product line that will support Nehalem or also support tour current product. So a couple of important products also will be start shifting about February.
Alex Kurtz - Merriman, Curhan Ford & Co.: And just last question, Howard, just on what Charles is just saying, how should we think about gross margin between March and June as Nehalem starts to ramp? And thanks again.
Howard Hideshima: I think, Alex, if you just think about it, again the economic conditions are tough out there and traditionally, it is lower seasonal quarter. However if you go back in time when we introduced the last introduction with Intel, we did see gross margin boost because of the newer products. So again those factors all affect what our ultimate gross margins will be.
Charles Liang: This quarter, we also have some changes to some Itanium product line.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Hanus - Needham and Company.
Glenn Hanus - Needham and Company: Just following up on the gross margin a little more, it sounds like you have some offsetting factors with lower volumes but then there is sort of Nehalem coming on. I am just wondering if you can talk a little bit more about the puts and takes on gross margins and to what extent do lower volumes tend to hurt your margins that could offset the Nehalem coming on?
Howard Hideshima: Glenn, this is Howard. Lower volumes obviously affect some of our overhead consumption rates but they are not very large, within 10% there. So, that would be the impact fairly from a lower margin or lower volume perspective and then as I just said to Alex, we got some counter daily forces with regards to release of new products that helped our margin.
Glenn Hanus - Needham and Company: Okay. Any other factors there with gross margins which you think about?
Howard Hideshima: Nothing that I have not mentioned already, I do not think.
Glenn Hanus - Needham and Company: Okay. How about maybe you just talk about operating expenses here over the next few quarters, sort of flattish or up a little, down a little, kind of any guidance there please?
Charles Liang: Basically with this economic downturn, we have better control our headcount, right, like we go 40 certain percent in engineering headcount and that is why today we have a very strong engineering team that is why we are able to support more OEM customers. However, given the poor economic condition, we have really much freeze headcount hiring and also we better control over time fairly for production and operation department. So, we believe we will save some money from kind of tight headcount control as well as reducing expenses with daily operation and some other employee benefit. So I believe we are prepared for this downturn.
Glenn Hanus - Needham and Company: Okay.
Howard Hideshima: Let me answer that a little bit. Again, as I mentioned in the call, some of our reductions here are bad debt expense was about $350,000 and we have in our lease portfolio off 400. So we did not have those things actually. Our expenses from OpEx is meant to be flat comparatively speaking.
Glenn Hanus - Needham and Company: Okay. Any progress report on how you guys are doing in the Blade market?
Charles Liang: We still see the continued, steady growth although the power market has some impact but here we still see a clear improvement, just not quite but steadily growing.
Operator: (Operator's instruction) Your next question comes from the line of John Roth - Argent Capital Management LLC.
John Roth - Argent Capital Management LLC: Howard, could you just repeat your comments about your tax rate expectations going forward?
Howard Hideshima: Sure, John. I have mentioned on the call that we do expect about a 33% tax rate going forward and a lower tax rate from a historical perspective of 36.6 which is due to the reinstatement of the R&D credit. We will credit benefits for that all throughout the rest of this year.
John Roth - Argent Capital Management LLC: Okay, great and lastly, what was the size or relative scale of the inventory adjustments in gross margin this quarter?
Howard Hideshima: About a positive 0.2%.
John Roth - Argent Capital Management LLC: Positive 0.2%, okay.
Operator: (Operator's instruction) You have a follow up question from the line of Alex Kurtz - Merriman, Curhan Ford & Co.
Alex Kurtz - Merriman, Curhan Ford & Co.: Yes, just to clarify the OpEx question that Glenn was asking, you expect the sequential decrease, Howard, in the OpEx line for March?
Howard Hideshima: As I mentioned, if I did not see the charge and if we turn back NRE, basically we would have been flat with Q1 as far as OpEx expenses.
Alex Kurtz - Merriman, Curhan Ford & Co.: So then thinking for the next couple of quarters, you are going to try to maintain that OpEx line around where you were in September?
Howard Hideshima: I think there is going to be puts and takes to it going forward but as Charles mentioned, we have got programs where we are reviewing basically all of our various cost working with our vendors to manage ourselves during this economic time.
Alex Kurtz - Merriman, Curhan Ford & Co.: Okay and just a question on the accounts payable change quarter over quarter, can you just give us a little bit insight there?
Howard Hideshima: Sure, with regards to, as we place and build up inventory last quarter, I mean again timing of the accounts payable comes in various points in the quarter so again that decrease hurt due to the prior buys of inventory and then as we looked to manage our inventory as we started seeing the headwinds again, those in 80s we can do. So, again we are getting on how we will run through from the benefits of us reducing our overall inventory during the quarter and we expect to continue to manage it that way.
Alex Kurtz - Merriman, Curhan Ford & Co.: And just remind me, Howard, you recognized from ship in or ship out of the channel?
Howard Hideshima: We recognize ship in to the channel.
Alex Kurtz - Merriman, Curhan Ford & Co.: So what is your sense right now about inventory levels among your channels partners when you are talking to them? Is there sort of a glut coming or do they feel like they have managed it pretty well over the last couple of months?
Howard Hideshima: I think as you know our products are fairly unique. Our applications are optimized. So, they keep very low inventories in the channels.
Operator: You have a follow up question from the line of Glenn Hanus - Needham and Company.
Glenn Hanus - Needham and Company: I am just wondering in this more challenging environment whether you are seeing greater pricing pressures either from your customers directly or results of competitive activity.
Charles Liang: Yes, including that past market for sure, competitors tried to be more aggressive in pricing. However, we feel we win by performance, by application optimized. So, we did not really have to lower our old price significantly. However, for some product line to grow much share, certain level we will try.
Glenn Hanus - Needham and Company: Sorry, I missed the last two sentences there.
Charles Liang: I mean for certain market segment to grow our market share, we will try to lower our price a little bit but overall, our profit should be in very healthy condition.
Operator: I am seeing no further questions. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Liang for any additional or closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you everyone for joining us today and we look forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you everyone. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That has concluded the Super Micro Inc. second quarter and fiscal year 2009 conference call. We do appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you.

I will now turn the call over to Charles Liang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Pierre and good afternoon everyone.  Now, let us turn to Micro. Super Micro, again had started a quarter of growth and financial performance. Super Micro’s revenue in the first quarter was $144.1 million or 22% higher than last year. Non-GAAP net income was $8.3 million or 27% higher than last year. Super Micro Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.21 per diluted share compared to a $0.17 last year. In addition, Super Micro had record free cash flow from operation during this quarter. I would like to briefly discuss about market for several portals. Last [5.0], as we conclude, our first quarter of fiscal year 2009 on September 30, we saw the global financial crisis had begun to affect as a broad economy in our energy. Today, as we assess the market situations, we great [5.29] said as a result for our solid economic condition. Customers have shipped their requirements to application optimize and by the TCO, total cost of ownership server solutions. Clearly that will be more important than other to meet our customers’ expectation by delivering innovative and application-optimized solution dynamically. We have brief the cost strength of Super Micro work by [6.05] over our strategic development. We allow Super Micro to continue to be [6.11] market with application optimized solutions instead a market require. Therefore, we are confident that our mission and strategy will be successful in the future as it had in the past. Our mission is to continue to be the global leader in application optimized high performance server solution. Our strategy have to maintain our mark to market advantage, this still now have been involve solutions. Expand the portal of [6.41] utilizing the basic technology including Blade servers. Further improve our leadership in energy reasons, server solution designs and expand that into new market and industry. That is the [7.01] application optimized computing.  Let me talk briefly about how Super Micro is differentiated and how we will use this our advantage. Please turn to slide six. Over the years, Super Micro we have invested in strong research and development in how is primary in the [7.25] headquarters. This center location contribute to our [7.31] market advantage, since we are near our technology catalogue and it is also allow hardware, maintaining, thermal, engineering teams and marketing corporation to work together harmonically and horizontally, which that, we had developed the largest array of server [7.56] to create optimized server solutions. This key differentiator enable Super Micro to be flexible and fast in creating solutions that satisfies the needs of our customers’ application at based of price performance ratio. We have confident that our strength will allow Super Micro to continue to have outstanding performance even in the current economic climate. We are well positioned to execute strategy and leadership, our technology leadership by extending our [8.39] scope and by offering the most competitive price to performance server solutions. In addition, our competitive advantage, we are also extended to our ability to offer a space [8.51] server architecture which [8.54] total costs of ownership. Now, let me talk about some of our main product innovation that will be released in the next and future quarters. Please go to slide seven. As you know, we have been developed in the [9.14] based on some order key new technology, which include the QPI base [9.24] processor and full way servers.  We are going to release more than 20 different servers designed plus more [9.35] server storage platform. We favor key new features, AMB Shanghai processor-based platform and the new [9.49] based titanium platform QPI. Higher density server with QTR in recent technology. Back however when you twin innovation. But with the new Blade, we have support to EP node in one single frame. These were not just to increase the [10.14] but will also reduce the hardware cost for node and the system power consumption and then [10G] is in thet controller and switch product line especially the HPC optimized with the broke in 10G switch for both Blades level and [10.37] level. Super Micro ability to deploy those new technology and to extend our product offering will enable us to continue our technology leadership based on these strong product lines, I am confident that our business is well position for continues success. Now, I would like to turn it over to our CFO, Howard Hideshima who will discuss our financial results and outlook for the coming quarter. Howard, please.
Howard Hideshima: Thank you Charles and good afternoon everyone. I will focus my remarks on earnings on both margins, operating expenses and similar items on a non GAAP basis which reflects adjustments that include stock compensation expenses. Reconciliation of GAAP to non GAAP is included in the financial statements of the Company in 10-K, earnings release and in the supplemental details in the slide presentation accompanying this conference call. Let me begin with the review of the first quarter's income statement. Please turn to slide 8. Revenue was $144.1 million, up 22% from the same quarter a year ago and down 3.4% sequentially. Slide 9: a portion of revenue from server system was essentially flat year over year and represent 38.7% of total revenues. ASP for server was up on a year-to-year basis from approximately $1200 per unit to $1300. The increase in server revenue was primarily due to a higher sales of our OEM and complete integrated server solution and sales of our innovative product such as UIO and 1U Twin. We continue to maintain a diverse revenue base with none of our over 400 customers making up more than 10% of our net sales in the first quarter. Furthermore, 66.2% of our revenue came from the US and 62.6% from our distributor and reseller. Internet data center revenue was 7.5% compared to 8.6% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. Slide 10 and 11: gross profit was $28 million, up 20.8% from $23.2 million in the same quarter last year and down 2.2% from $28.6 million sequentially. Our percentage basis gross margin was 19.4% down slightly from 19.6% year over year and up from 19.2% sequentially. Price changes from [Ablecom] result in a zero basis point charge to gross margins in the first quarter with total purchases representing approximately 27.3% of total cost of each sale which is up from 23.3% a year ago. The year over year decrease in gross margin resulted from a decrease in center margins due to higher complete system sales including integration of memory and hard disk drive offset impart by the sale of previously reserved item. The sequential improvement in gross margin resulted from beneficial pricing adjustments from materials which were partly offset by higher freight charge by 12. Operating expenses were $14.9 million, up from $13.1 million in the same quarter a year ago and down from $16.7 million sequentially. As the percentage of revenue, operating expenses close 10.4% down from 11.1% year over year and down from 11.2% sequentially. The year over year and sequential decrease in operating expense ratio resulted from the wining down of third consulting arrangement associated with top compliance. With regard to R&D expenses, as we said last quarter, head count addition and expenses are leveling up and we are confined with reduced expenses surrounding in the [14.41] rollout we experience a reduction in R&D expenses sequentially. The year over year increase in R&D expense was primarily due to headcount addition offset in part by reduction in Blade product development expenses as we rolled out the Blade product last year. Operating profit was $13 million or 9.1% of revenue, up $3 million or 29.8% from $10.1 million a year ago and up $1.2 million or 9.7% sequentially. Net income was $8.3 million or 5.8% of revenue, up $1.8 million or 27% from $6.6 million a year ago and up $23 million or 3.4% from $8.1 million sequentially. Our non GAAP fully diluted EPS was $0.21 per share, up $0.04 from $0.17 per share a year ago and flat at $0.21 per share sequentially. The number of fully diluted share is used in the first quarter was $39,559,095. The tax rate in the first quarter on a non GAAP basis was 36.1% compared to 36.6% a year ago and 2.1% sequentially. Similar to fiscal year '07, the R&D credit was reinstated retroactively during the second quarter of fiscal year 2009 and we expect the effective tax rate will be similar to the 31% during the third quarter of fiscal year 2007 when the credit was reinstated previously. Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis, slide 13. Cash and cash flow in short and long term investment were $79.9 million, up $12.3 million from $67.6 million in the prior quarter. In the first quarter, free cash flow was $11.3 million and exchange in cash was $13.3 million. Slide 14: Accounts receivable decreased by $3.3 million to $49.5 million and DSO was 31 days compared to 28 days in the prior quarter. Inventories increased by $15.2 million to $100.9 million with days in inventories increasing by 6 days to 74 days. The increase in days was primarily related to additional inventory to prepare and to support the growth of the Company and the launch of new products associated with Intel and AMD product releases. Historically, the Company has had higher days of inventories surrounding new product launches. Accounts payable increased by $5.9 million to $86.9 million with the days payable outstanding increasing by 5 days to 66 days. Overall, cash cycle days were 39 days, an increase of 4 days in 35 days in the prior quarter. Now for a few comments on our outlook, as we continue our first quarter of fiscal year 2009, Super Micro and others in the technology sector have witnessed events that have affected the global financial markets and impact the outlook for economic growth. Until the economic efficiency stabilizes, Super Micro will provide a wider range of guidance that reflects the current period of lower economic disabilities. In addition, Super Micro will only provide an outlook for the upcoming quarter. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2009 ending December 31, 2008, the Company expects net sales within the range of $140 million to $150 million. This represents an increase between 2.2% to 9.5% as compared to the second fiscal quarter of last year. In addition, the Company expects non GAAP earnings per diluted share to approximately $0.18 to $0.22 for the second quarter. It is fairly expected that the outlook will not be updated till the release of the Company’s next quarterly earnings announcement. An outlook standing subsequent development however, the Company may update the outlook for any portion thereof at any time. In addition, as mentioned in our fourth quarter earnings released, the overhung effects from those deferring options has been reduced substantially by about 80% that was only about 20% or 600,000 share remain an exercise. With that, let me turn back to Charles for some closing remark.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Howard. Today’s market climate place well to Super Micro's strength and strategy. We are already witness the market achieved to an [19.23] on cost performance and the application of [amortization] where our competitors are unable to fulfill. Today, more than ever, [Cutmost] are considering Super Micro because they recognize that we can deliver specialized server solution they are optimized for their application while offering the best PCO for them. It is our strategy to view on this momentum, our broader customer awareness of Super Micro's capability. We will continue to expand our product line we support to market of technology that provides solution for our outmost dynamic need. In summary, I believe we are well positioned to outperform our competitors in today's market. I will now turn the call back to Pierre.
Pierre Hirsch: Operator, at this time, we are ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, our question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. (Operator's instruction) Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Fidacaro - Merrill Lynch
Jeff Fidacaro - Merrill Lynch: Charles, I am wondering if you can talk to us a little bit about the outlook and the IT spending characteristics that you have seen recently. If you look a few past downturns that you have gone through already, have you seen any different behavior in your end customer and what is different this time?
Charles Liang: Yes, thank you for the question. Yes, we had seen some slowdown, a little bit slowdown in the market. Some customers are more price sensitive now and they are more picky for kind of lower power consumption for base TCO so we have something that is happening. However, we are happy to see that because we are very strong in application optimizer as you know. So we continue to satisfy most of the customer in data center and in other application. So although the market may continue to keep soft for a while, with our strong product line, we are quite confident.
Jeff Fidacaro - Merrill Lynch: If I could ask just one quick follow up. If you look at the guidance for the 2% to 10% type revenue growth next quarter, can you talk a little bit about what new products that include?
Charles Liang: As you know, traditionally Intel introduced big product line in summer like in 2002, 2004, 2006; they all introduced new product line in summer of timeframe. However, this time [22.56] our QPR Technology, they shifted announcement and the production for spring '09. So this is one of the factors that with our December quarter may not grow that much as before. However, the growth worksheet to couple of few quarters later, the growth, the advantage is still there. Again, whenever we enter a new technology, really we have a much better growth in the following couple of quarters.
Jeff Fidacaro - Merrill Lynch: And any update in the Itanium?
Charles Liang: Itanium, again its main production also maybe next summer so its long effect to our kind of financial performance for this year. By next year definitely.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kurtz - Merriman, Curhan Ford & Co.
Alex Kurtz - Merriman, Curhan Ford & Co.: So, just a follow up on that QPI question, I was a little bit in the impression that that was really going to help you guys and maybe in the margins June quarter, can you just repeat again, Charles, what you were saying about maybe a push out in QPI regarding your internal forecast?
Charles Liang: Yes, I mean and that is why that is mentioned this time into basically were introduced officially introduced and I mean supreme quarter and I push in early three where are the basis spring. That means that help to us where it really help in some in March but most in June quarter and then that will be at September quarter of 2009.
Alex Kurtz - Merriman, Curhan Ford & Co.: Okay and Howard, could you just and this is my follow up here, could you just talk about the gross margin a little bit? What was the inventory reserve and was there a specific product mix that helps grow the gross margin sequentially? Thank you.
Howard Hideshima: Yes, the effect of the provision, Alex to answer your question this quarter get about 0.4% of the gross margins was affected by our progress that negatively affected and that is similar to what we have last quarter which is 0.1%. So, if you will see that, I think we have about 0.3% actually decrease negative effect on our gross margins from our reserve.
Alex Kurtz - Merriman, Curhan Ford & Co.: Right and then what about just the overall growth in margin? What helped it this quarter? I mean it was only up I guess 20 basis points but…
Howard Hideshima: Right so in fact and again we continue to sell our products like UIO and 1U Twin very well. So, those are obviously helping us with our margins…
Alex Kurtz - Merriman, Curhan Ford & Co.: Where is the way to go?
Howard Hideshima: And Blades servers are going too.
Alex Kurtz - Merriman, Curhan Ford & Co.: And the SuperBlade, has it increased to like the 5% of sales yet?
Howard Hideshima: Not yet, it is still growing.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Hanus - Needham and Company.
Glenn Hanus - Needham and Company: Following up on the financial questions, you got your non-GAAP operating margin up over 9% and sequentially really took down operating expenses I guess about $1.5 million pretty substantially. Could you talk a little bit more about how you curtailed that operating expenses so much and your operating expense outlook going forward?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, I think Glenn last quarter, we were doing the finalization of our stock work and we passed off the last quarter at the end of our fiscal year and that resulted in a number of the consulting expenses to be occurred in the fourth quarter which did not follow on into this quarter. So, that was a primary portion of that reduction.
Charles Liang: The other effect is because we spent a lot of manpower in developing Blade serve and about six months ago, pretty much we already finished most of the applicable design. So, now we are able to use those engineering resource to take care some OEM account and for those OEM account, we have designed charge income.
Glenn Hanus - Needham and Company: So, should we look at the operating expense base that you have today or you just reported as kind of the base level, is that we should think of going forward plus just very modest growth?
Howard Hideshima: We see some growth going forward, Glenn.
Glenn Hanus - Needham and Company: But fairly modest?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, I mean I think you have seen the Q4 that had about a good portion of stock expenses were taken so I do not think you will see that which you will see again some addition headcounts that we took in this quarter and again some minor expenses going up until the next quarter.
Glenn Hanus - Needham and Company: Could you talk about your headcount, where your headcount is at and what your plans are for headcount additions over the next couple of quarters?
Charles Liang: Yes, indeed we are technology leader so it depends on economic condition. If market is still keeping soft then our headcount increase maybe more limited, maybe 5%, 10% gross for next three quarter but once the economy had come back and become much better, I guess we will hire additional headcount to our operation. It depends on our market condition.
Howard Hideshima: Just some, specifically we grew about 24 heads during the quarter over quarter. We are about at 824 heads at the end of this past quarter and you will see as, again, as we talk back couple of quarters ago, we wrapped up our R&D and build the infrastructure to help us with all the new product launches. If you look over the last couple of quarters, you will see that that has kind of flattened up and so our expenses have flattened up.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of John Roth - Argent Capital Management LLC.
John Roth - Argent Capital Management LLC: I am sorry, could you just repeat to me again what reflect the, you said regarding the adjustments really in [29.33]?
Howard Hideshima: Sure, John. The reserve for inventory this quarter was 24% of sales.  
John Roth - Argent Capital Management LLC: Twenty-four percent.
Howard Hideshima: Right, that is compared to about 0.1% in the prior quarter.
John Roth - Argent Capital Management LLC: So probably if we expect the $100,000 net, instead it compare to 0.1% in the prior quarter but in the prior quarter, did you have as well a positive impact on the sale of the inventory that is usually reserved?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, we did and so, we had here reserve and then we sell off some of that previously reserved item. The net effect last quarter was 0.1% of additional reserve or about $183,000.
John Roth - Argent Capital Management LLC: Okay. So, okay that was nice catch. Again, on the tax rate, I think what I heard you say with what you expected for Q2 tax rate kind of referred back to that 32% level, is that correct?
Howard Hideshima: That is correct. With the passage of the actually R&D credit was reinstated, so we have a bit of a catch up during this quarter and so our tax rate if you look back historically when the tax have happened back in fiscal year '07, we had about a 31.7% or 30.7% tax rate non GAAP in that period. So, we expect something similar this quarter.
John Roth - Argent Capital Management LLC: Okay and then presumably looking forward and beyond, I know you are not going to provide guidance about a certain quarter the magnitude but what you would be adding in Q2 should be a reasonable possibility.
Howard Hideshima: Well there is some catch up involved in the quarter because again you do not work R&D credit in prior quarters until the tax R&D credit was reinstated so the Q2 will be a catch up quarter and then if you look back historically, you will see that things level off after that.  
John Roth - Argent Capital Management LLC: Last question, had you been working to give any additional prospect that the share repurchase given with respect to the balance sheet cash flow you generate?
Howard Hideshima: Sorry, John, cay you speak up just a little bit?
John Roth - Argent Capital Management LLC: Yes, I am sorry. Has the Board given any sort of additional thought to potential share repurchase given the respect to your balance sheet and the amount of cash that you are generating?
Howard Hideshima: John we have always started to take a look at back and what we have discussed as we do it and we have not planned anything at this point.
John Roth - Argent Capital Management LLC: Okay, would you certainly aware where you are trading now and considering the back that seems to be better and better than a lot of folks that actually growing the business to improve the [32.32] pretty ugly downturn here. When I think to stock, I think it is a level where it is really pretty much of a lay up that guys could get out there and maybe we can share no doubt 12 to 18 months that heavily increasing in share and maybe to some capital but certainly not obligating some interested and [bullish anything stock] that will [33.03] in terms of share about the quarter.
Howard Hideshima: We appreciate your comments, John.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Manoj Nadkarni - ChipInvestor Group LLC.
Manoj Nadkarni - ChipInvestor Group LLC: You had a nice cash flow from operations in the September quarter. What are your expectations for free cash flow in the current quarter or at current revenue levels, what do you see as cash flow from operations?
Charles Liang: You can see that we had been [33.40] confident in the last 15 years, no exception. So, next quarter basically is still quite positive. Howard, do you have more detail?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, I think dealing in the factor again if we take a look back over the number of years, you will find that we have positive free cash flow look in every quarter and the only impact with that would be the acquisition of building at time to time. So, again if you look back over the last couple of years, you will see that we have had positive free cash flow.
Manoj Nadkarni - ChipInvestor Group LLC: Okay but it would vary from quarter to quarter you mentioned.
Howard Hideshima: It can vary some but again, it is based upon our guidance right now with the 140 to 150 in revenues and $0.18 to $0.22 per share EPS again. So, that will produce result.
Manoj Nadkarni - ChipInvestor Group LLC: Okay and I have follow up question. Can you guys give some color on what you saw in the September quarter? What segment target for our geography wide you saw growth and were there any soft spots?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, I think again with the broadness of the effects of this space, we have a very diverse product line but even this we saw not one sector being impacted more than other. I think we saw kind of fairly broad effects from this but again some of our diverse customer base having no customers over 10% of our revenues and some geographical diversity helps us in those situations but again it was fairly widespread. I cannot pinpoint in one sector versus another sector that is not particularly hard.
Manoj Nadkarni - ChipInvestor Group LLC: Okay, thank you.
Charles Liang: Indeed, in last many years including last quarter, we continue to expand our product line. So, at the same direction we will continue for the next many quarter, next many years especially in the embedded area.
Operator:  You have a follow up question from Alex Kurtz - Merriman, Curhan Ford & Co. 
Alex Kurtz - Merriman, Curhan Ford & Co.: Yes, guys I just have some data points that I wanted to ask you here. Howard, the OEM contribution, the one that was I think around 20, I think you have given up a 44% number last quarter. What was that percentage in this quarter?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, so let us just go back in that, the OEM, the retailers maybe if you get that, I get on the conference call at 62.6% so that makes this quarter 37.4%.
Alex Kurtz - Merriman, Curhan Ford & Co.: For OEM end customer?
Howard Hideshima: OEM end customer, that is correct.
Alex Kurtz - Merriman, Curhan Ford & Co.: Okay great and it looks like the internet vertical was down this quarter from it was, both on a percentage and then absolute basis. Was the weakness in the quarter seem for maybe push out at one of these larger data centers?
Howard Hideshima: I think when we compete in data centers again we talk about it being fairly project related. The last quarter, we were up to about 15% and it was based upon some projects that we had won this quarter. Those projects were not there. We compete on features and technology so as the projects come out from the internet data center market, we have the best technology there to find a means on those projects arise and to this particular quarter, that project that we got last quarter did not arrive.  
Alex Kurtz - Merriman, Curhan Ford & Co.: Okay so projects are in a quarter-to-quarter and so you do not have in a multiple quarter contracts it sounds like.
Howard Hideshima: Yes, they are project by project basis.
Alex Kurtz - Merriman, Curhan Ford & Co.: Okay just again on the cash flow question, obviously some of your best cash flow growth in company history, what do you expect to see maybe next quarter and I am sorry if that question is already asked.
Howard Hideshima: I think if you take a look in our guidance again, we have 140 to 150 EPS of $0.18 to $0.22, I think you will see that very similar to this quarter.
Alex Kurtz - Merriman, Curhan Ford & Co.: Great so just looking at working capital gains, you had in the quarter, do you think you will be able to maintain that level.
Howard Hideshima: I think there is nothing that we have indicated that fairly different.
Operator:  You have a follow up question from John Roth - Argent Capital Management LLC.
John Roth - Argent Capital Management LLC: Yes, sorry guys, just one quick follow up. What was the percentage of revenue in terms of the data center business this quarter?
Howard Hideshima: Looking at data center, it was 7.5%, John.
Operator:  You have a follow up question from Glenn Hanus - Needham and Company.
Glenn Hanus - Needham and Company: Could you talk about, you said in your commentary on the improvement in gross margin beneficial pricing offset by higher freight so could you talk about are you referring to some component pricing that was better, just talk about the gross margin and sustainability of gross margins in the current level.
Howard Hideshima: Yes, Glenn. I think as we talk about, we for example memory for our disk drive and those type, we started building partnership about a year and half ago and those partnerships increased and we have got any closer to those centers that we have thrown our volume in our business. So, again some of the positive benefits from growing that relation is the reduction of our overall cost.
Charles Liang: And plus our overall revenue is consistently growing. So, those kinds of economic scale also consistent happiness.
Glenn Hanus - Needham and Company: But offsetting that, how is the pricing to your customers where in the competitive landscape, was pricing more difficult or more challenging out there or obviously your gross margins came in fine so was there some offsetting pressures that you saw this quarter that were not there in the past or how did that look look?
Charles Liang: In pertinent area, you are pretty right. I mean last quarter we saw a relative more companies give in that into the customers. However we have most customers in every application especially in embedded and kind of high performance computing. Our overall margin is kind of quite stable. That had been quite stable.
Glenn Hanus - Needham and Company: Okay, so a little tougher in the data centers but the rest of the business pretty much unchanged.
Charles Liang: Yes because we continue to outgrow our product cost especially in the embedded area and because that was out in both solutions, it is much easier for us to cover wider industry compare with other competitors.
Glenn Hanus - Needham and Company: Okay, could you reinforce a little bit why in a slower economy application optimized is more relevant and you should be somewhat insulated from the macro environment?
Charles Liang: As we mentioned a couple of times ago when economy is tough, everyone, every end user watching deposit more picky, more carefully and when that happen, they are certain for at the phase of certain amount instead of continuing to do business with their order partner. So because we are new Company relatively compared with our competitors, customers become more picky, more aggressive, looking what basically is solution based to the [PCO], we got a better change especially in high efficiency computingperformance for work and performance for dollars. We are, I would like to say basically in the market today.
Glenn Hanus - Needham and Company: And you said in your slide there addressing new markets and industries that need optimize, so what are the new markets and new industries that need optimized that you are looking at going forward?
Charles Liang: Okay, a couple of area for example, even in [gaming]. Gaming industry before we were not there but now, we found them more and more picky even gaming customers. So, there one not just performance friendship chart but also supplying the kind of high efficiency computing. In [42.38] for example, we found the people now is really picky for power consumption. Lots of time, even 1% or 2% based on power consumption and make cheap and efficient today. We do not see this long time ago.
Operator:  You have a follow up question from Manoj Nadkarni - ChipInvestor Group LLC.  
Manoj Nadkarni - ChipInvestor Group LLC: Hi, you spoke about timeline for revenues coming from system based on new Intel processors. Can you tell us briefly what is happening with the systems based on new AMD processors?
Charles Liang: Yes, in AMD we have a Shanghai product line of video enhance next month and we here have at least ten people shippable and about 20 people of service cue based on AMD process. We have impede already for Shanghai processes. So, we are kind of completing already for Shanghai process.  
Manoj Nadkarni - ChipInvestor Group LLC: Okay, revenue ramp on four systems based on that platform. Is that dissimilar or it is just like one quarter or two capital quarter GAAP and then ramp up?
Charles Liang: This time, we are going fab earlier because this time Shanghai basically almost in fact all comparable with their Barcelona CPU, not 100% but almost 100% effect are all comparable. So, we got to find tune BOM and find tune some system configuration. So, this convey that it is much easier and much quick.
Operator: It appears that this time, we have no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Liang for any additional or closing comments. 
Charles Liang: Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you, everyone. Have a great day.
Operator: That does conclude today's program. We thank you for attending and have a great day.

Charles Liang: Super Micro has a history of consistent growth and popularity over the past 15 years, and this year is not different. Our revenue grew $120 million over 78.6% to $440.5 million in fiscal year 2008 and our net income grew 36.2%, over $7.7 million, to $29.1 million. This quarter our revenue reached a record $148.9 million which is an increase of 34.2% compared to the same period last year. Net income of $8.1 million is 32.7% higher compared to a year ago. We started to have this from a benefit from our significant investment in both R&D and infrastructure, which the company had met over the past year to drive both our short and long-term growth potential. I feel that we are finally in position to take an advantage over technology challenges and have our partners meet in the challenge that they are facing. In particular, our base SuperBlade solution won the best green data center solution award at the blade system insight 2008 technology conference and the base SuperBlade solution at the CRNTech portal review in May, 2008. In the treating components combined with our unmatched earth-friendly power reasons, as well as our other means, Super SSI gray architecture mix with all negotiated corporate the base that shows for all server environments, seeking to optimize both performance and power consumption. In today's sensitive market, our superior performance co-op blade server with up to 93% power efficiency, higher efficiency server boat design, optimizing server optimization and other factors help our customers save up to $3,000 on electrical fee or enclosure over three years and reduce their total costs of ownership co-op TSO. In the meantime, it will also reduce up to $0.16 of CO2 emission into our environment. Our demand server design innovation continues to win more and more recognition and awards. Both of these awards highlight the strength of Super Micro and the great opportunity we have to extend our business into a new market. We also just launched a number of high-end one new and full use super server and storage solutions optimizes for 2.5-inch fast in center hard drive. By combining our high visionary power surprise [731] and thermal subsystem design with our energy savings at an advantage of 2.1-inch hard drive, customers typically save $200 to $300 per server over three years which is crucial to enterprise and energy conscious customers. In addition to lower [755], 2.5-inch drivers enable higher heavily dense [800] empowering these servers to deliver up to 50% greater system performance in the same sort of cream. Our development of next-generation Intel QPI, quick pace interconnection, base recommend and base servers, storage products and all stations systems have been quite complete. The titanium-based project continues to be on course as well as AMD Shanghai-based servers. We can not elaborate on that details, our base development, for company safe reasons, but sure Super Micro will play a significant load in the next industry launch of X86 mainstream servers. Our historical record indicates that new technology transition periods always provide a great opportunity for Super Micro to grow our business, mostly in revenue and profitability. We also started to enrich our embedded portal [911] these past three years. We had introduced some truly optimized embedded Amembo [ph] and CHASI product lines and rapidly growing our customer base in this much segment. These are just a few examples of continuing R&D work we are doing here at Super Micro by leveraging the investment we made to our R&D and infrastructure over the past quarters. We have further improved our ability to deliver leading-edge toward marketing the product, a stronger reprieve. These investments are better positioned the company for strong future growth. Let me also provide a further detail on the status of some expiring options which was discussed in the press release. I had elected to take about $975,000 fuller base stock option grants dating back to 1998. They are scheduled to expire later this year and exchange those options to retreat share with a five-year investing period which is subject a rather exciting under 10B5 programs. I believe Super Micro's full pressure has yet to see it reach, and this is why I have chosen to think forward our benefits from selling this share as of this moment. With that in mind, let me now turn it over to our CFO, Howard Hideshima, who will discuss the financial results and forecast.
Howard Hideshima: First, let me point out that our GAAP numbers appear in the news release. So, I will discuss earnings, gross margins, operating expenses and similar items on a non-GAAP basis which reflect adjustments to exclude stock compensation expense. Reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company in today's earnings release. Let me begin with a review of fourth quarter income statement. Revenue of $148.9 million for the quarter was up 34.2% from the same quarter a year ago. The growth, on a percentage basis, was fairly equally distributed with revenue from server solutions increasing by 1.1% to 38.7% of total revenues. Unit volumes on server systems increased 32.4% year-over-year, from 34,000 to 45,000 units. ASPs for servers was up on a year-to-year basis from approximately $1,200 per unit to $1,300 per unit. The increase in server revenue was primarily due to higher sales of our OEM and bundled server solutions, and sale of our innovative products such as UIO and 1U Twin. We continue to maintain a diverse revenue base, with none of our approximately 400 customers making up more than 10% of our net sales in the fourth quarter. Furthermore, 60.1% of our revenues came from the US, and 55.5% from our distributors and resellers. Internet Data Center revenues was 15.4% compared to 6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal year '07. On a sequential basis, net revenues increased by 8.9%, or $12.1 million, from $136.8 million in the third quarter. The increase was primarily from server solution sales which increased 20.4% from the prior quarter. Non-GAAP gross profit was $28.6 million for the quarter, up 42.4% from $20.1 million in the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP gross margin was 19.2% of revenues, up from 18.1% a year ago and from 18.2% in the third quarter, due primarily to the sales of previously reserved items, new products and higher revenue mix of server solutions. Price changes from Ablecom resulted in a zero basis point change to our gross profits in the fourth quarter, with total purchases representing approximately 19.1% of total cost to goods sold, which is down from 28.8% a year ago. On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP operating expenses total $16.7 million for the fourth quarter, or 11.2% of revenue, up 1.1% from a year ago. The year-over-year absolute dollar increase of $5.5 million was primarily due to additional headcount to support the expansion of our product lines and additional work we are doing for our partners, and additional expenses associated with SOX compliance. On a sequential basis, non-GAAP operating expenses was up $1.1 million, or 6.8%. The company's headcount grew by 4, from 799 at the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2008 to 803 at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher salaries and payroll expenses associated with the increased headcount in the prior quarter and higher material costs associated with the support of product development. Non-GAAP operating profit for the fourth quarter was $11.9 million, or 8% of revenue, up $2.7 million, or 29.6%, from $9.2 million a year ago. Non-GAAP operating profit on a sequential basis was up $2.5 million, or 26.3%, from $9.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2008. On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $8.1 million, or 5.4% of revenue, which is up $2 million, or 32.7%, from $6.1 million non-GAAP net income a year ago. On a sequential basis, non-GAAP net income was up $2.1 million, or 34.9%, from $6 million in the third quarter. The tax rate in the fourth quarter on a non-GAAP basis was 32.1%, compared to 33.7% a year ago. The decrease in our tax this quarter compared to last year was due to the benefit from R&D credits provided by the increase in R&D expenses we did this year. Our non-GAAP fully diluted ETS for the fourth quarter was $0.21 per share, compared to $0.16 per share a year ago. Fully diluted shares used were 39.1 million compared to 38.9 million a year ago. On a sequential basis, our non-GAAP fully diluted EPS increased by $0.06 per share, from $0.15 in the third quarter. Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $67.6 million, up from $59.4 million in the prior quarter. The increase of $8.2 million is primarily due to net income of $8.1 million. Accounts receivable increased by $7.4 million to $49.5 million, and DSOs was 28 days compared to 30 days in the third quarter. Inventory decreased by $7.7 million to $85.7 million, with days in inventories decreasing by eight days to 68 days. The decrease in days was due to lower average inventory levels as we sold off some (inaudible) reserve inventory and improved our efficiency in managing our inventory. The inventory reserves were $14.4 million compared to $14.8 million in the third quarter. The percentage of inventory revision decreased by 1.5% to 0.1% in the fourth quarter. The total inventory reserves as a percentage of inventory increased from 13.7% to 14.3% between the third and fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 respectively. Accounts payable increased by $1.2 million to $81 million, with the days payable outstanding decreasing from 72 to 61 days. Now, a few comments on our outlook. The company expects net sales to grow 24% to 26% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009, ending September 30, 2008, compared to the first fiscal quarter of last year, which represents a range of $147 million to $151 million in net sales. Super Micro has historically seen seasonally slower rates of growth in net sales in the fiscal first quarter. The company expects this trend will continue, with the impact partially offset by sales and new products introduced during the prior quarters. In addition, the company expects non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.18 to $0.19 for the first quarter. For the full fiscal year 2009, the company currently expects net sales growth of 24% to 26% over fiscal year 2008 net sales, which represents a range of $670 million to $680 million. The company also expects non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately 89% to 94% for the full fiscal year 2009. It is currently expected that the outlook will not be updated until the release of the company's next quarterly earnings announcement. Notwithstanding subsequent developments, the company may update the outlook or any portion thereof at any time. With that, let me turn this back to Charles for some closing remarks.
Charles Liang: During fiscal year 2008, we made significant investments to grow our research and development resources including an increase of 53% new hiring in engineering and accounts, part of new infrastructure and facilities. These investments will play a significant load to support our growth for both short-term and medium-term. As we enter fiscal year 2009, we will continue to drive full service market technology development with our broad product offering including the new-generation (inaudible) data form for QPI which features the base cast interconnect memories and performance. Our full service market is an advantage. We are also extending to our new-generation titanium solutions in AMD Shanghai-based product mine, QPI infinitive technology and more. In addition, we will introduce new technology and features such as 10 gigabytes connectivity, higher efficiency power architecture to enhance our SuperBlade, UIO one-inch screen, and 2.5-inches hard drive server storage solutions. With such a strong foundation, I am confident that Super Micro will have another great year with a conservative estimation of 24% to 26% growth in both revenue and probability. With this, let us open for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Alex Kurtz - Merriman Curhan Ford & Co.
Alex Kurtz - Merriman Curhan Ford & Co.: What is the overall tone of your business, maybe linearity, in the quarter as you head into the September quarter? What are you seeing from customers? What is sort of the macroeconomic environment for your customers in relation to the top-line guidance that you gave?
Howard Hideshima: With regards to this quarter, it is typically seasonally lower quarter than the rest of our fiscal year. So, on the macro trends, while the rest of the economy seems to be slow, it does not seem to be affecting the IT area as much. It is still looking okay in the IT area.
Charles Liang: Yes, compared with last year, we see an estimate 24% to 26% growth both for revenue and post results.
Alex Kurtz - Merriman Curhan Ford & Co.: So, would you say the linearity in the June quarter, Howard, was pretty standard for you?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, it was. Yes, certainly linear.
Alex Kurtz - Merriman Curhan Ford & Co.: What is going to be the non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal '09?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, I think when we look at it historically, not counting on models, but historically, you will see it anywhere in about the 36% to 36.5% range.
Alex Kurtz - Merriman Curhan Ford & Co.: Okay. And then, the gross margin obviously had a nice uptick this quarter. Can you talk again, I know you mentioned earlier, but can you talk again the drivers behind that and how we should be thinking about modeling gross margin going forward?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, I think with regard to gross margins, I think we have always said that building our economy is one of the top priorities for the company. We said that during fiscal year '08 and we continue to believe that going into fiscal year '09. Opportunities do exist for us, though, with the new launches of QPI, as Charles has mentioned, and Shanghai from AMD and a number of other new technologies, so we will be able to take advantage probably during the second half of our year.
Alex Kurtz - Merriman Curhan Ford & Co.: Do you think you could get back to the 19% range?
Charles Liang: It is either in that type of quarter, we saw already a career change kind of. We are now an economic scale grow. Gross margin is also growing consistently.
Alex Kurtz - Merriman Curhan Ford & Co.: And then, finally, it looks like you guys did about $9 million in cash flow in the quarter and roughly $8 million in free cash flow. Is that about right, Howard?
Howard Hideshima: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from Glenn Hanus - Needham.
Glenn Hanus - Needham and Company: Let me try the gross margin this way. So, Howard, how much was the one-time benefit this quarter from that item you mentioned? What would the gross margin? However you want to answer it. What would the gross margin had been without that one-time benefit for the sale of the inventory and the reversal or whatever?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, Glenn, it probably contributed about 1.5% to the overall gross margin for the fourth quarter. And basically, we continue to look at opportunities to sell some of the product we have previously reserved. So, while we cannot predict it, we go with the best forecast for our reserves that we can. We cannot predict when that will come in or out per se. So, again, in taking that out, if you take a look at last year, fiscal year '09, our total gross margins for the year were 19.3% for the entire year.
Charles Liang: So, that is better than last year.
Howard Hideshima: That is better than 17.9% in fiscal year '07.
Glenn Hanus - Needham and Company: So, it was about 17.5% for the quarter basically without it?
Howard Hideshima: Probably about 18%.
Glenn Hanus - Needham and Company: And then, going forward, you are saying you can get some benefit from some of the new products, the QPI related and the others you mentioned. And should we think about that starting to kick in, in the September quarter, or is that more in December?
Charles Liang: Those new products start to be available quarter after quarter. So, it is kind of growing. Last year, we already shipped some new product. This quarter, we will have some more, and then we will start to grow. And not just there. The base server also comes with some better gross margins to our business.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeff Fidacaro - Merrill Lynch.
Jeff Fidacaro - Merrill Lynch: Hi. Howard, maybe you could talk a little bit about the OpEx side. When we took a look at R&D as a percent of revenues, it ticked up a bit to about 5.9% as well as overall operating expenses. Do you have the headcount in place that you are comfortable with going forward, and should we see that R&D as a percent of revenues sort of tick down from here now?
Charles Liang: Indeed, because last year we already hire 53% new engineers in one year, that was very aggressive, and those engineers basically have been well trained. So, this year in hiring in engineering will be much more conservative because, today, we have a much stronger engineering team now. So, we will continue to hire, but with lower hiring than last year.
Howard Hideshima: Jeff, to talk about the fourth quarter again, the increase there you saw was probably more of a topping off of the headcount, expenses from topping off the headcount that we had in the prior quarter. And so, we only hired about four people in the fourth quarter.
Jeff Fidacaro - Merrill Lynch: Charles, when you take a look at the landscape into fiscal '09, what trends are you seeing on the server side? Where are people really focused as far the requirements? And I will just leave it there.
Charles Liang: The power savings surprised me a little bit and the peek hole really emphasized three looking for higher efficiency computing now. And we are very happy that we are already signing high efficiency computing. So, with our estimation, our operate server has been [inaudible]. Most are green [inaudible] solution, and those [inaudible]. So, not yesterday, recently, we introduced the concrete 2.5-inch 1UTU server install reach. All of those become very hot in the market. So, we are very confident that in the coming years, coming quarters or even years, people will continue to look for better power consumption, or you can say better performance per watt design.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Roth - Argent Capital.
John Roth - Argent Capital: The first, what is a reasonable assumption going forward in terms of stock-based comp expense? Is sort of $1 million to $1.5 million reasonable for modeling purposes going forward?
Management LLC: The first, what is a reasonable assumption going forward in terms of stock-based comp expense? Is sort of $1 million to $1.5 million reasonable for modeling purposes going forward?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, John, I think, we do not see anything changing from what our historical pattern has been previously.
John Roth - Argent Capital: It looked like there was an account on the balance sheet, about $4 million of other long-term liabilities. Could you let me know what that is?
Management LLC: It looked like there was an account on the balance sheet, about $4 million of other long-term liabilities. Could you let me know what that is?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, that was the, when we adopted SIM 48, moving the tax liability around to the accrued liability side.
John Roth - Argent Capital: And last of all, could you maybe help me understand just a little bit better the transaction to exchange Mr. Liang's expiring options for restricted stock? Is it kind of fair to summarize as basically Mr. Liang does not, as a result of rolling into restricted stock, he does not have to put any cash out for options exercise and, in exchange, he has effectively agreed to lock those shares up for some period as a result of the vesting period? Is that the way I should be looking at that?
Management LLC: And last of all, could you maybe help me understand just a little bit better the transaction to exchange Mr. Liang's expiring options for restricted stock? Is it kind of fair to summarize as basically Mr. Liang does not, as a result of rolling into restricted stock, he does not have to put any cash out for options exercise and, in exchange, he has effectively agreed to lock those shares up for some period as a result of the vesting period? Is that the way I should be looking at that?
Charles Liang: [Inaudible] Personally, I believe the stock price has been, in that respect, not too valuable and also to pre-amend a sale in lots of stock at this moment. So, we have got company-approved to see full 925,000 share to retreat share for the next five years. So, that is basically good for push and also good for investor trade. Howard can give you more...
Howard Hideshima: They are not, no, it is not just a straight exchange, share for share. Actually, the exercise prices will be taking shares back by the company. So, it is not like Mr. Liang is getting free shares back in exchange for these.
John Roth - Argent Capital: Yes. No, no, I understood that, but I guess what I did not fully understand was why roll into the restricted stock as opposed to just exercising the options and holding the shares?
Management LLC: Yes. No, no, I understood that, but I guess what I did not fully understand was why roll into the restricted stock as opposed to just exercising the options and holding the shares?
Howard Hideshima: Yes. With regards to the restricted shares, the tax liability occurs as the shares vet, where if you do an exercise today, per se, the taxes are due today.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Bertz - Kennedy Capital.
Michael Bertz - Kennedy Capital Management: Can you talk, Howard, a little bit about obviously, you cannot predict that going forward, but either, one, in terms of how much you have currently sitting that you have reserved and, two, if there is anything you can talk about that is proven average of what we might have seen over the last few quarters?
Howard Hideshima: Yes. I mean, our total inventory reserve for the last couple of years, including this year, has been about 1.2% of net income, total year's net income. On average, I think fiscal year '08 will be about 1.3% of total revenues. Fiscal year '07 was about 1.3% also. So, it is very consistent between years. We get opportunities. We have about $14.3 million of reserves against our inventory right now. But, we are always looking for opportunities to basically reutilize that product that has been reserved and find a different application, so we can sell it.
Michael Bertz - Kennedy Capital Management: And then, secondly, as you look across the business, is there anyplace you can look at for any trends that you are seeing, whether it is maybe some of the embedded business that you are doing or places of strength or any relative weakness? I mean, obviously, it is clear, it seems you are doing pretty well fairly across the board, but any place where you are seeing things that maybe surprise you a little bit, where things were a little bit stronger than you would have expected?
Charles Liang: Yes, we had a part embedded in the market for field, but recently we found it is a difficult market. So, we emphasized in R&D, embedded in part '09, and now the transfer market has been great. So, we will continue spend more in this area, both in R&D and sales and marketing.
Operator: Your next question comes from Manoj Nadkarni - ChipInvestor Group.
Manoj Nadkarni - ChipInvestor Group LLC: Yes. Can you give some color around and review where you are seeing a strong growth geographic-wise and end market-wise? You mentioned Internet data centers being strong. Can you give some color around that and other areas?
Charles Liang: We just mentioned embedded, right? Embedded is an area we believe we have a good growth for our P&E. And data centers, yes. I mean, our economic scale continues to improvement. So, we find that we are getting stronger quarter after quarter in data center business as well. So, in that two years, we have seen that consistent improvement in data center business. Other than that, our chief [inaudible] which in high-put end production about six months ago have been continuing growing. And with our higher end switch connectivity [inaudible] will be available quarter after quarter. We do believe one-inch server for both HPC application and data center will be another quick growing area for us.
Operator: Your next question comes from Adam Kurtz - Merriman Curhan Ford.
Alex Kurtz - Merriman, Curhan Ford & Co.: So, could you give us a sense again, you mentioned earlier about your customer concentration and that 10% in 400 customers. Howard, what was that figure again?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, none of our customers make up more than 10% of our revenue during the quarter, and actually during the fiscal year either. So, we have over 400 customers and actually, for the fiscal year '08, we will have probably over 500 customers.
lex Kurtz - Merriman, Curhan Ford & Co.: And can you just give us a sense from the OEM business, was there one vertical or one technology that did especially well this quarter for you guys, or was it pretty broad-based across all of your partners?
Charles Liang: It was pretty diversified. We are growing, for example, server (inaudible), right, and those are kind of in HPC and data center. I mean, some OEM for data centers where also some embedded. So, I would say is our feeling has been efficiently growing quite proudly, quite diversified.
Alex Kurtz - Merriman, Curhan Ford & Co.: And finally, do you have a figure on what percentage of revenue the SuperBlade was for you guys this year in fiscal '08?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, we have not broken that down separately. However, it is still less than 10% of our revenue.
Operator: We have no further questions.
Charles Liang: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today, and we look forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you, everyone. Have a great day.

Charles Liang - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Howard, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter our revenue reached 136.8 million, which is an increase of 29.4% compared to the same period last year. Net income of $5 million is 23.4% higher compared to a year ago. The March quarter is traditionally a slower season in our history, as well as in the industry. Moreover, we have seen increasing investments in both our R&D headcount and infrastructure to drive our long-term growth potential. Nevertheless our year-over-year net income growth was 23.4%, which a wider industry average growth is less than 6%. In this coming quarter I am confident that we will see a consistent growth in revenue. And the net income should be slightly improved from last quarter. Although, we will keep strong investment in R&D. Super Micro has been a technology-oriented company with multicultural. Although we are having such a strong momentum year-by-year, our company's potential is still underestimated. Yes, we are still a small to medium sized company, but we are continuing to grow at more than three times faster than the average growth rate for a server industry. We continue to invest aggressively in R&D for long-term growth and profitability. We strongly believe that our technology foundation and leadership have been and will be the key for our customers' success. Our High Efficiency Server Building Block solution, incorporated with our expertise in technology and design, is highly demanded by partner and customers who are seeking for maximum system optimization, performance per watt, and cost-effectiveness. Our business has never been as strong as it is today. In particular, we continue to invest in improving our Blade server technology. Our Intel CPU-based Super Blade recently achieved an industry beating performance per watt milestone of 290 gigaFLOPS per kilowatt, 290 kiloFLOPS per kilowatt. The performance is about 10% to 30% faster than our competitors' total. In the 11 billion HPC market, Super Micro's leading performance-per-watt server are the best choice for helping our customers save significantly on their energy bills and total cost of ownership, TCO. As one of our recent wins, Super Blade was selected by CERN, one of the world's largest search labs in Europe for its computing capacity upgrade process. High performance, excellent scalability, and the superior energy reasons where key factor in this competitive selection process. We are also spearheading to develop of next generation Intel QPI for QuickPath interconnection-based servers. We cannot elaborate on the details of this development for competitive reasons, but for sure Super Micro will play a significant role in the next industry launch of X86 mainstream servers. Our historical record indicated that new technology transition periods always provide a great opportunity for Super Micro to grow our business both in revenue and profitability. In addition, we are currently engaged with a major partner in the development of Itanium based products for mission critical enterprise applications. This partnership will help Super Micro to gain market share in this higher margin segment. This high-end segment of IEA server technology represents an important new market for Super Micro. We believe this engineering investment will enable new opportunities and drive our huge opportunities, besides our well-known and competitive Intel-based server solutions. We also have a strong AMD-based product line ready for Barcelona process. As you know from our April 9th release, Super Micro's revenue was briefly delayed due to the hold ups over the processor by AMD, but it is now shipping. Super Micro's high density energy efficient Super Blade, four-way 1U system universal, whisper quiet, 28KP workstation and 1U Twin solution have all been optimized for a Barcelona processor, which is now widely available. On a separate note, as a sponsor and a Chair of the Asian Pacific Region of the Climate Saver Computing Initiative, CSCI, Super Micro is taking an active role in developing smarter and more efficient technology that will minimize power consumption and therefore reduce CO2 emissions. By the year 2010, the CSCI organization seeks to proactively save consumer over $5 billion in energy costs while reducing CO2 emissions by 54 million tons per year, which is equivalent to take about 11 million cars off the road. Super Micro's earth friendly computing technology helps our customers save electricity costs and helps to keep our earth green. These are just some examples of our continuing R&D work we are doing here at Super Micro. By investing in our infrastructure and working more closely with our partners, we have improved our ability to deliver leading edge first-to-market products. I strongly believe this investment will better position the company for strong future growth. I should point out again that our ability to consistently deliver leading edge technology first-to-market has driven Super Micro's growth and profitability over the last 14 years. In this time and in that time, Super Micro has never been as strong as it is today. With that in mind, let me move let me turn it over to our CFO, Howard, who will discuss the financial results and forecast. Howard?
Howard Hideshima - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Charles, and good afternoon, everyone. First, let me point out that our GAAP number's here in the new release, so I will discuss earnings, gross margins, operating expenses and similar items on a non-GAAP basis, which reflect adjustments to exclude stock compensation expense. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in the financial statements of the company in today's earnings release. Let me begin with a review of third quarter income statement. Revenue of 136.8 million for the quarter was up 29.4% from the same quarter a year ago. The growth was led primarily by the increase in our components business, primarily motherboards and chassis, which increased 32.9% year-over-year or 22 million to 88.9 million. Our server business increased by 23.5% year-over-year, or 9.1 million or 47.9 million. Unit volumes on server systems increased 20.6% year-over-year, from 34,000 to 41,000 units. ASPs for servers were about the same on a year-over-year basis of approximately $1200 per unit. The increase in server revenue was primarily due to higher sales of our OEM and bundled server solutions utilizing our high efficiency power supplies, and sales of new products such as UIO and 1U Twin. We continue to maintain a diverse revenue base, with none of our approximately 400 customers making up more than 10% of our net sales in the third quarter. Furthermore, 58% of our revenues came from the US, and 62.8% from our distributors and resellers. Internet Data Center revenues was 10.6% compared to 3% in the third quarter of fiscal year 2007. On a sequential basis, net revenues were about the same from 36.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal year '08. Non-GAAP gross profit was 25 million for the quarter, up 37.5% from 18.2 million in the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP gross margin was 18.2% of revenues, up from 17.2% a year ago. The non-GAAP gross margin increase from a year ago was primarily due to higher revenue mix from complete server solutions. On a sequential basis, non-GAAP gross margins decreased from 20% in the second quarter to 18.2% in the third quarter, due primarily to a higher revenue mix of component business, primarily motherboards and chassis, which generally carry a lower margin than server solutions. In addition, we provided aggressive pricing to one high profile customer which we believe has a good future potential. Price changes from Ablecom resulted in a zero basis point change to our gross profit in the third quarter, with total purchases representing approximately 27.4% of total cost that sold, which is down from 33.6% a year ago. On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP operating expenses total 15.6 million for the third quarter or 11.4% revenues up 0.7% on the year ago. The year-over-year absolute dollar fees increase 4.3 million was primarily due to additional head count to support the expansion of our product line, the additional work we are doing for our partners and addition expenses associated with SOX compliance. The company's headcount grew by 219 from 580 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2007 to 799 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2008, primarily in the areas of R&D, a [195] to 306, and production, 244 to 322. This includes overseas headcount during this period expanding from 89 to 143. The increase in SOX expenses went from zero to approximately 600,000 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2008. On a sequential basis, non-GAAP operating expenses was up 1.4 million or 10.1%. The company's headcount grew by 65, from 734 at the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2008 to 799 at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2008, primarily in the areas of R&D and production. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher salaries and payroll expenses associated with the increased headcount and the higher material costs associated to support product development, offset in part by higher NRE credit from our partners. In addition, SOX expenses increased by approximately $300,000 during the quarter. The company is required to be SOX compliant for the fiscal year ending June 30,2008, after which we do expect expenses from SOX compliance to decrease. Non-GAAP operating profit for the third quarter was 9.3 million, or 6.8% of revenue, up 2.5 million or 36% from 6.8 million a year ago. The increase was primarily due to growth in our revenues and gross margins, less than the reinvestment in research and development expenses made to expand our product line, support this growth, and overhead associated with being a public company. Non-GAAP operating profit on a sequential basis was down 3.9 million or 29.3% from 13.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2008, primarily related to the lower gross margins, investment in expansion of our product lines, and support of our partners, and SOX expenses discussed above. On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was 6 million or 4.4% of revenue, which is up 1.4 million or 31.6% from 4.5 million non-GAAP net income a year ago. On a sequential basis, non-GAAP net income was down 2.6 million or 30.2% from 8.6 million in the second quarter. The tax rate in the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis was 36.4%, compared to 30.1% a year ago. The increase in our tax basis where compared to last year was due to catch-ups in our benefits for R&D credits due to Congressional reinstatement of the credit last year. The tax credit expired on January 1, 2008. Should the credit be reinstated retroactively, then the company would adjust in the quarter the credit was reinstated. Our non-GAAP fully diluted EPS for the third quarter was $0.15 per share, compared to $0.14 per share a year ago. Fully diluted shares used were 39.1 million compared to 32.6 million a year ago. The fully diluted shares increase of 6.6 million shares or 20.2% primarily by the 6.4 million shares offered in the company's IPO, which closed on April 3, 2007. On a sequential basis, our non-GAAP fully diluted EPS decreased by $0.07 cents per share or 22% in the second quarter. Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were 41.8 million, down from 64.7 million in the prior quarter. The decrease was primarily due to the reclassification of 18.2 million of short-term investments and option-rated securities into long-term investments. If we include this into the cash balances above, the decrease would be 5.3 million, which was primarily due to capital investments for the new building we purchased in October of 2007 for expansion purposes, and 2.2 million in cash used in operating activity. Accounts receivable decreased by 3.6 million to 42.1 million, and DSOs was 30 days compared to 29 days in the second quarter. Inventory increased by 0.7 million to 93.1 million, with days in inventories increasing by six days to 76 days. The increase in days was due to higher average inventory levels as we continue to prepare for ramp of our revenue. The inventory reserves were 14.8 million compared to 13.1 million in Q2. The percentage of inventory revision decreased by 0.2% to 1.6% in the third quarter. The total inventory reserves as a percentage of inventory increased from 12.4% to 13.7% between Q2 and Q3 for fiscal year '08. Accounts payable decrease by 14.9 million to 79.8 million with the days payable outstanding increasing from 96 to 72 days. Again, the increase in days is primarily due to higher average inventory levels as we support growth of our revenue. Now, for a few comments on our outlook. The server industry has historically experienced seasonal revenue strength in the quarter ending June 30, our fiscal Q4. In addition, we have also benefited from revenue traction following the introduction of new products. The company expects both trends will continue this quarter, and that new product introduced during the prior quarter and historical seasonal strength should offset, in part, the impact of economic weakness. As a result, we expect revenues to be in range of 142 to 147 for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008. In addition we believe our non-GAAP EPS on a fully diluted basis will be approximately $0.17 to $0.18 per share for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2008. It is currently expected that the outlook will not be updated until the release of the company's next quarterly earnings announcement, notwithstanding subsequent developments. However the company may update the outlook or any portion thereof at any time. With that, let me turn it back to Charles for some closing remarks.
Charles Liang - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Howard. I do believe that our strong investments in R&D and infrastructure during the past three quarters will produce strong growth in our near and long-term business. Our 290 gigaFLOPS per k/watt Blade server that outperformed much above the industry standard, and our concern Intel QPI base, it is called [DOT-9], will prove our vision quickly. We have also strength our working partnership with our vendors and customers, both old and new. I am more confident today than any time before on the ability of the company to succeed. Thank you.
Howard Kalt - Public Relations, Kalt Rosen Group/Ruder Finn: Operator we are ready for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Glenn Hanus with Needham.
Glenn Hanus: Good afternoon. Could you maybe talk about what you're seeing on the competitive front from a pricing standpoint, and what your outlook is on gross margins for this quarter?
Charles Liang: Yes, basically if the competition is strong, however, we have a very strong new product line, that our 1U Twin still growing in revenue, and that is a very unique product. So, for those products we still have a very good margin. With our SuperBlade product, I just mentioned we reached 290 gigaFLOP per k/watt. Those are very outstanding products, and they will allow us to have a good margin from those products. So overall, before market is getting very competitive, especially the soft market. However, here at Super Micro, we foresee our profit, our gross margin, should be still in quite healthy neighborhood. By the way, I mean, back a way I just mentioned our QPI based Intel Quick-Path interconnection, a new product line is getting available. That will help our profitability as well, though.
Glenn Hanus: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from Jeff Fidacaro with Merrill Lynch.
Jeff Fidacaro: Good afternoon Charles and Howard. I am wondering, if you could talk a little bit about the Itanium project, sort of the timing, when we should start seeing product ship, and the impact it has been on R&D in this quarter as well as into the June quarter.
Charles Liang: Yes Itanium as you know, it's the highest-end, it is IA Intel architecture product. So, this year we have co-designed with our partner. And the reason why is we foresee with QPI, a QPI interface in the web is really a high performance platform, and really just choice for a mission critical application. So, we commit to design with our partner a prototype QPI available this year somewhere in, we hope, Q4 this year. And we never really committed to a mission critical risk product, so this is a big commitment from the company. And we feel very comfortable for business we took.
Jeff Fidacaro: Do you think the revenue impact from these products will really ramp? Is it going to be in the back half of this calendar year?
Charles Liang:  Yeah, it should be very big this year or earlier next year. 
Jeff Fidacaro:  Any anticipation of what the impact would be to margins? Is it greater than corporate average? Sounds like these are higher margin type products.
Charles Liang: Will be significantly higher NTO base put out, though, because the -- it is although small [medium], but very high-end, high margin product.
Jeff Fidacaro:  Okay. If we shift over to sort of the data center revenues, can you talk a little about the win this quarter? It sounds like you had to be a little bit more competitive to get that customer win, do we see that sort of impact to gross margins carrying into the June quarter as well?
Howard Hideshima: Yeah Jeff, this is Howard. Yeah, we did have this high profile customer come on board. And it just started up this quarter and will continue. We see there's future growth potential in this customer and that's why we did this. And so, it should carry on for the next few quarters, if not longer.
Charles Liang:  Yes, it is high efficiency computing architecture, and that's our 1U Twin that operates the -- that help a lot.
Jeff Fidacaro:  Great. Thank for your times.
Operator:  And our next question will come from John Roth with Argand Capital.
John Roth:  Hi, guys. I have a few questions for you. First of all, the tax rate. I understand you had to catch up this quarter. I mean, what would you assume on a sort of normalized basis going forward, assuming that the credit is not reinstated?
Howard Hideshima: Yeah, John the credit actually was -- last year was about 30%, the tax rate, and this year was about 36%. And we anticipate that 36% non-GAAP rate to be about the steady state until and if Congress re-passes the R&D credit, so which time we'll adjust it downward.
John Roth: Okay. And I just wanted to clarify what the previous caller asked. In terms of the high profile data center customer, you said that you expect their presence to have -- to continue to have a negative impact on the gross margin for at least a few quarters going forward, is that correct?
Howard Hideshima: Not exactly John.
John Roth: Okay. I guess I wasn't sure whether you were talking about the negative impact on gross margin or the positive impact in terms of the top line from them being there?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, it had a positive impact, and it's just starting with this past quarter, Q3 and we see great future potential in this customer going forward. And so, it's just the beginning with this relationship.
John Roth: Okay. Well, let me ask the question another way. I mean, if you look at the target model that you guys have spoken about historically, sort of gross margins of 19% to 22% and then working down, I think R&D to 4 and 5%, getting down to an operating margin of 9 to 12. Is that still the company's target model, or is that R&D going to move up from that 4% to 5% range for the foreseeable future? Can you just kind of help me understand what the model is doing, whether it's still kind of static in terms of where you're trying to get or if it's moving around?
Charles Liang: Yes, in theory, we did not change the model basically. However, when a change happen, when a change show up, like a couple quarter ago when we know we have a change to co-design Itanium solution, and when we saw the high efficiency computing become very important so we start to emphasize, dedicate even more in high efficiency breakthrough solution, all of those, we decide to hire more R&D engineer. Although that will increase our expense in short-term, however, for long -term we know we will benefit from those R&D investments. So, other than the Itanium and high performance Blade server, in theory we also are start to cooperate with more potential OEM to design some -- really optimize the system for them. So, we start cut-off of project right away, in last few quarters. This is the main reason we increase, indeed, 57% of our engineering headcount, in last few months. We understand this will increase our overhead expense, but long-term this is a really a very good chance for company, though. So not many companies have those chance.
John Roth: Okay. What was the size of the inventory adjustment on gross margin this quarter?
Howard Hideshima: 1.6%, same as Q3 of '07 and about 0.2% of benefit from the prior quarter.
John Roth: Okay. And I guess last of all its just a comment. I said this to you guys before but I would urge you at the board level to think about authorizing a repurchase. I know you have concerns around the liquidity of your stock, but its always good in my view to have the authorization in place so that when you have dislocations like you had over the past few weeks you are able to take advantage of those and ultimately if you do have confidence in where the business in going. You know the repurchases at these sorts of levels will certainly be accretive to shareholders over the long-term.
Howard Hideshima: I understand John and I appreciate the comment.
John Roth: Okay, thanks.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). And next we'll hear from Manoj Nadkarni with Chip Investor Group.
Manoj Nadkarni: Hi good afternoon. Can you please talk more about seasonal factors? Generally the PC market is slower in the second quarter if you look at Intel's guidance their revenue is lower sequentially. So what is different about the server market and about Super Micro that gives you confidence for sequential improvement?
Charles Liang: Yeah I mean that is historically. We have a lower quarter in March quarter and that why just mentioned PC market can be a little bit soft, I mean, recently. However, at Super Micro we are quite different from the industry in last many years. And I believe this year we'll have the same chance because, I mean, our business is pretty much based on technology. So, whenever there are new product lines, new transition of technology, then in that timeframe we usually got a much better trend. This year, basically no exception, right? Our kind of Blade server just available, our QPI solution is getting here and AMD just agreed to ship their Barcelona CPU. So, all of those make us feel very comfortable for this quarter and the coming quarter.
Manoj Nadkarni: Okay. Can you give any color on which end markets and geographies you are seeing strength?
Charles Liang: Pretty much our market is world wide and recently we found a market in Europe and Asia should be a two area, I mean we have big room to grow. But even in the United States recently we have approach some high profile account aggressively. And we are ready reach certain level of success. So we at this moment, I can say we have a good confidence on growing the business in the United States as well.
Manoj Nadkarni: Okay. And about 44% of your sales are international. So how much does the weakness of US dollar help you?
Howard Hideshima: All our transactions are denominated in United States dollars. So that really doesn't affect us from a currency exchange rate.
Manoj Nadkarni: No but I mean you're customers in Europe will find your products much cheaper right? 
Howard Hideshima: Absolutely. That is a healthy…
Charles Liang: Yeah in Europe and China yeah that will be a kind of a fundamental -- I mean, a hidden advantage, right?
Manoj Nadkarni: Okay. Thank you.
Charles Liang: Because there cost is low.
Manoj Nadkarni: Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). And our next question comes from Curtis Thom with Broadpoint Securities.
Curtis Thom: Hello, Howard and Charles. Good afternoon.
Howard Hideshima: Hi.
Charles Liang: Hi.
Curtis Thom: I appreciate what Charles said about the strength of the new products offsetting the macro weakness. I was wondering if you could quantify the macro weakness that you're seeing, and if -- and how we expect that to continue?
Howard Hideshima: Yes. Curtis, this is Howard. Yes, we've given the guidance. Again, we can see that some of these new products the new products that Charles has talked about we've invested on will help us counteract some of this economic weakness. We've given a range of 142 to 147, which is a good growth from prior year quarterly run rate. So, again, we don't see a slowdown with regards to our being able to deliver products to customers given the new products we have and the seasonal strength of the quarter. Curtis?
Operator: Mr. Thom, is there anything further?
Charles Liang: Yes, maybe I can add a little bit more. That 1U Twin, although we introduce that product about one year ago, and today we still almost the only one really strong in 1U Twin kind of high density computing. And recently we just add couple of other form factors, still 1U Twin but in form factor that is to optimize. 1U Twin solution for Siemens application. So, with the new 1U Twin with QPI coming soon, we start our own also with our 293 gigaFLOW per k/watt Blade server. Indeed, the growth will be quite -- we are optimistic about our growth.
Operator: And we move on to a follow up from Manoj Nadkarni.
Manoj Nadkarni: Hi, I have question about this reclassification of about $80 million to long-term securities. Can you give us any details as to what type of securities those are, and if you are taking any unrealized losses?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, we did take about 600,000 of unrealized temporary impairment charges. The securities are primarily, to small extent, student loans, to a large extent closed end option rate preferred shares of municipal funds, tax-exempt. They're very -- they're all AAA-based and well secured.
Manoj Nadkarni: And are they guaranteed by department of education or any state or federal?
Howard Hideshima: The student loan ones are guaranteed by the Federal Family Educational loan, 100%.
Manoj Nadkarni: Okay. And secondly I have question about cloud computing There has been a lot of talk about cloud computing. What type of products do you have and what revenue opportunities do you see in this area?
Charles Liang: What you mean by cloud computing?
Manoj Nadkarni: Cloud, cloud computing.
Charles Liang: What it is?
Manoj Nadkarni: Cloud like Amazon, Google etc, renting their computing facilities to other companies.
Howard Hideshima: Yeah. Yes, we do obviously have we have a lot of different customers that are selling- we're selling to a number of different applications. We have a little less visibility into that space. I do believe that some of our Internet customers would fit the bill that you're talking about there.
Manoj Nadkarni: So, this would be broadly under the data center computing?
Howard Hideshima: That's correct. And we have a fairly high percentage of our sales go through Disc G Network, so we have a little less color with regards to the final end customer.
Manoj Nadkarni: All right. Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). It appears at this time, we have no further questions. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Liang for additional or closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you. Thank you for joining us today. We look forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thank you, everyone. Have a great day.
Operator: That does concludes today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. Have a great day.

Charles Liang: Thank you, Howard, and goodafternoon everyone. This was a record high quarter for us in both revenue andprofitability. Our revenue reached a record high of $136.9 million, growing $23million or 21% compared to the same time last year. This quarter net incomereached a record high of $7.7 million, up $2.7 million or 56% compared withlast year. Our leading edge products, likehigh efficiency power supply server UIO and 1U Twin servers were primarycontributors to this increase in revenue and profitability. We consider SuperMicro being the leader in providing energy, retaining twin servers to the industryfor the past two years. A year ago, we had achievedapproximately 85% power-efficiency on some of our servers, while our industryaverage was at above 75% to 80% power-efficiency. We have continued our drive forinnovation and have increased our power efficiency on some of our servers to 93%today, while our industry has moved to 80% to 90% maximum power-efficiency. However, our driver for power-efficiencyservers extended beyond justthe power supply. We also optimize for power-efficiency at the componentslevel, such as motherboard, memory subsystem, and chassis. While it may seemlike relativity is more saving in power, they achieve some significant powersavings on a completed server basis. These savings have been embraced by ourcustomers as indicated by the growth in our business. Most of our UIO and 1U Twinservers have increased significantly in revenue in the last three months.Customers appreciated a better IO bandwidth, flexibility, cost advantage, andinvestment protection, which the UIO provides. Future upgrades can be achievedby replacing the UIO card and/or expansion card instead of replacing the entiresystem. Even without an UIO module or expansion cards, our UIO system functionsas an extremely cost effective server. With UIO feature, a single UIO servercan support many different SAS controllers, 10-gigabit Ethernet controller or InfiniBandcontroller. This versatility also minimizes the number of different servermodels that resellers need to keep in inventory. The 1U Twin servers require halfof many server racks, chassis, power-supplies and power cables, which reducescustomers total cost of ownership to as long as PCU. Additional cost of savingsassociated with best IT space requires us, whereas each year maintenance and management make theseservers a very attractive option for almost any high performance serverapplication. Most of these platforms will continue to be optimized, with ratherthe space technology and design in order to meet the increasing needs of ourcustomers. Delivering innovative applicationoptimizes server solutions and being first to the market has been hallmark ofSuper Micro. Our solutions help the customers grow their business, which inturn helps our growth. As has been proven by our increase in revenue and profitability,we will continue to invest in our infrastructure to support the continuingneeds of our customers, order wise. We have significantly extended ourengineering capability and capacity, both here in San Joseand in Asia. We have also added smallproduction resources to meet the demand of our customers. We are continuing toevaluate a site in Asia to extend ourmanufacturing and warehousing capacity in the near future, in order to reduce postproduction and logistical cost. All of this is within our plan togrow our technical and operational capability and capacity to build a strongerfoundation for our future, while maintaining our financial discipline andgrowing our shareholder value. With that in mind, let me nowturn it over to our CFO Howard Hideshima, who will discuss the financialresults and forecast. Howard?
Howard Hideshima: Thank you Charles, and goodafternoon everyone. First let me point out that our GAAP numbers appear in thenews release while I will discuss earnings, gross margins, operating expenses,and similar items on a non-GAAP basis, which reflects adjustments to excludestock-compensation expenses. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included inthe financial statements of the company in today's earnings release. Let me begin with the review ofthe second quarter income statement. Revenue of $136.9 million for the quarterwas up 20.5% in the same quarter a year ago. The growth was lead by theincrease in our server systems business, which increased 44.4% year-over-year,or $17.8 million to $58 million. Unit volumes on server systemsincreased 29.4% year-over-year from 34,000 units to 44,000 units. ASPs forservers had also increased on a year-to-year basis from approximately $400 perunit to $1,300 per unit. The increase in server revenue was primarily due tohigher sales of our OEMs and end customer solutions, utilizing our high-efficiencypower supply and sales of new products, such as the UIO and 1U Twin. We continue to maintain a diverserevenue base with none of our approximately 400 customers making up more than10% of our net sales in the second quarter. Further more, 62.1% of our revenue camefrom the USand 60.9% coming from our distributors and retailers. Internet data centerrevenue was 12.3% compared to 8.8% in Q2 of fiscal year '07. On a sequential basis, netrevenues were up by $19 million or 16.1% from $117.9 million in Q1. Again, theincrease was primarily due to an increase in the sales of UIO and highefficiency power products. Internet data center revenue was 12.3% compared to 8.6%in Q1 of fiscal year '08. Non-GAAP gross profit was $27.4million for the quarter, up 43.4% from $19.1 million in the same quarter lastyear. Non-GAAP gross margin was 20% of revenue, up from 16.8% a year ago. Thenon-GAAP gross margin increase from a year ago reflects three factors; first,higher revenue mix from computer server solutions; second, improvement in ourcost of standard performance, such as memory, hard disk drive, which we had typicallynot provided a year ago; and third, our higher margins on newer products suchas the UIO and 1U Twin, offset in part by higher inventory reserves in thesecond quarter of fiscal year '08 of approximately 1.8%. On a sequential basis, non-GAAPgross margins increased from 19.6% in Q1 to 20% in Q2, due primarily to higherrevenue of server solutions, which generally carried a higher margin exponent.On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $14.2 millionfor the second quarter or 10.4% of revenues, up from 9.6% a year ago. The year-over-year absolutedollar increased $3.3 million and was primarily due to additional headcounts orbetween investments in our product lines, and the ramp in our revenues. The company'sheadcount grew by 186 from 548 at Q2 fiscal year '07 to 734 at Q2 fiscal year'08, primarily in the areas of R&D and production. Overseas headcountduring this period expanded from 87 to 131 and is included in the totalheadcount number I just provided. On a sequential basis, non-GAAPoperating expenses were up $1.1 million or 8.4%. The company's headcount grewby 73 from 661 at Q1 fiscal year '07 to 734 at Q2 fiscal year '08, primarily inthe areas of R&D and production. The increase in operating expenses wasprimarily due to the higher salary and payroll expenses associated with thisheadcount increase. Non-GAAP operating profits for thesecond quarter were $13.2 million or 9.6% of revenue, up $5 million or 61.5%from $8.2 million a year ago. The increase was primarily due to our revenue andgrowth margins, offset in part by increase in our operating expense [isperfect] growth of the company and the overhead associated with being a publiccompany. Non-GAAP operating gross profit,on a sequentially basis, was up $3.1 million or 31% from $10.1 million or 8.5% ofrevenue in Q1, primarily related to the higher revenue and growth marginsdiscussed above. On a year-over-year basisnon-GAAP net income for second quarter was $8.6 million or 6.2% of revenue,which is up $3.2 million or 60.5% from $5.3 million or 4.7% of revenue a year ago.On a sequentially basis, non-GAAP net income was up $2 million or 30.5% from$6.6 million in Q1. The tax rate in the second quarter on a non-GAAP basis was36% compared to 32.3% a year ago. The increase in our tax rate thisquarter compared to last year was due to [catch up] in our benefits from R&Dcredits due to the timing of rational reinstatement or the tax credit lastyear. Our non-GAAP fully diluted EPS in the second quarter was 22% per sharecompared to $0.16 per share a year ago. Fully diluted shares used were38.9 million compared to 32.5 million a year ago. Fully-diluted sharesincreased by the 6.4 million shares offered in the company's IPO, which closedon April 2, 2007. On a sequential basis, our non-GAAP fully-diluted EPSincreased by $0.05 per share from $0.17 in the first quarter. Turning to the balance sheet on asequential basis, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were$64.7 million, down $4.7 million from $69.4 million in the prior quarter. The decreaseis primarily due to the purchase of a new building, as previously described inour press release on June 28, 2007 for $11.3 million, offset impart by $8.5million positive cash flow from operating activities during the second quarter.Accounts receivable increased by $5.1 million to $45.8 million and DSOs remainedthe same at 29 days from Q1 fiscal year '08.  Inventories increased by $19.2million to $92.7 million, with days in inventory decreasing by two days to 70days. The increased two days was due to continuing to ramp our revenue.Inventory reserves were $15.1 million, compared to $10.9 million in Q1. Thepercentage of inventory position was the same between quarters. Accounts payable increased by$24.5 million to $94.6 million, with the days payable outstanding, increasing69 days. The increase in days is primarily due to higher inventory levels as describedabove. Land and building was $38.3 million, representing approximately 352,000square ft. of property in San Jose, California at the end of Q2. As previously indicated in the pressrelease and the 8-K filings, the company closed escrow on a building locatedclose to San Joseon October 16, 2007. The building is approximately 9,000 square feetand costs approximately $11.3 million. Historically, we have allocated 70% ofthe value of the land and 30% to building, which has appreciated over 39 years. Now for a few comments on ouroutlook. The total industry has, historically, a period of seasonal revenue weaknessin quarters ending September 30th and March 31st, our fiscal Q1 andQ3. However, we have also benefited from revenue traction following theintroduction of new products. The company expects the growth trends willcontinue this quarter and that new products introduced during this period’sprior quarters should offset, in part, the impact of seasonal weakness. As aresult, we expect revenue to be in the range of $137 million to $142 millionfor the third quarter of fiscal year 2008 ending March 31, 2008. In addition, the companyreconfirms the guidance provided on November 14, 2007 regarding fiscal year2008 revenues and net income. The company continues to expect that as comparedto fiscal year 2007, to fiscal year 2008, revenues from server side would growby about 50%. Total sales will increase by a minimum of 30% and net income willincrease by a minimum of 35%. It is currently expected that theoutlook will not be updated until the release of the company's next quarterlyearnings announcement. Notwithstanding subsequent development, however, thecompany may update the outlook or any portion thereof at any time. With that, let me turn it back toCharles for some closing remarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you Howard. Super Micro hada great quarter, with very high revenue and profitability. The broad base ofleading-edge products, the outflow and the ability to deliver applicationoptimized solutions, in fact, in an efficient and timely manner to ourcustomers around the world to help them succeed drove these outstanding results. We continue to drive our salesquarter wise to further optimize our business through innovation and expansion.This quarter our San Clemente chips set space, Xeon, Quad-Core,DDR2 solutions have gone into high volume production, added this with ourfamily of Whisper-Quite high performance workstations, to our already broad andinnovative product line. I believe we will have another record-high quarter inrevenue. Thank you all for joining us onour Earnings Call. With that, we will open the call to questions.
Glenn Hanus - Needham: Good afternoon. Can you hear me?
Charles Liang: Yes, Glenn.
Glenn Hanus - Needham: Okay. Could you maybe talk alittle bit about the offsetting factors of seasonality and the new products.First talk about seasonality or whether you are seeing if that should be moresevere than normal or about like normal? And then in terms of the new products,any sort of quantification you can help us with -- how much did new productssort of makeup of your revenues this past quarter and how do you expect that torollout?
Charles Liang: Okay. Thank you, Charles again. Basically in history, in Marchquarter we have a seasoning added below our quarter. However this yearwe had a very strong product line like we just mentioned, our 1U Twin and ahigh density server have been growing well and we believe this trend willcontinue for the next couple of quarters at least. As well as our UIO Universal I/O,which we introduce last March about nine months ago, this product line alsocontinues growing. And again people like the feature we provide. Also, I mean,I just mentioned Intel's Quad-Core [San Clemente] space, Xeon DDR2 that's all of our lowerpower consumption solution for server and workstation. So we have that productline just in high volume production basically. However with our Whisper-Quiet, Imean, both times we introduced a very quiet workstation solution for the market-- we call it Whisper-Quiet workstation solutions. So with all of thoseexceptional products, I believe in our March quarter we should have a recordhigh in revenue again.
Glenn Hanus - Needham: As a follow-up, can you talkabout the -- aside from the new products -- can you talk about the level ofseasonality, and kind of macro factors you are seeing out there? Are you seeingany scaling back in spending or anything on those lines due to the overallmacro environment?
Charles Liang: For example last year, three monthsago our March quarter dropped quite a bit from last year, December one yearago. But this year should be different because again our very strong productline, new product line, so I believe like Howard just mentioned, this quarterwe could see a 137 to 142. So we should be able to see some gross althoughmaybe not large, because of the traditional seasonality. So Howard you aregoing to answer.
Howard Hideshima: Glen, like I said to characterize Charles has worked withsome numbers in past, last quarter about a year ago we had about $115million next quarter we had about $105 million. But this quarter we are goingfrom the $137 million we just reported and our range is 137 to 142. 
Operator: Our next question goes to Jeffery[Hekaro] at Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Jeffery Hekaro - Merrill Lynch: Hey, Charles. I was wondering ifyou could talk a little bit more staying on the new products, about the ramp upin the 1U Twin, the UIO, and also, you recently started shipping the SuperBladeproduct. Wondering if you could give us a little bit more color about how thoseproducts are ramping and especially on the 1U Twin, if you talk about any OEMor increased OEM interest?
Charles Liang: Yeah, indeed with the IU Twin,the solution we introduced about three months ago. This product has beengrowing very successful and a little bit beyond our expectations, so a verynice product. We have a strong confidence that this product now will continueto grow both with new technology, that's new cheapest and new CPU support andnew system architecture. So we are growing multiple dimensions with the 1U Twinsolution. So in next couple of quarters this product will continue to grow thatwe strongly believe. As to UIO, again, also a brandnew architecture we just introduced nine months ago. So this product follows 1UTwin. We also have very strong confidence they will continue to grow. As toSuperBlade, because we have lot of customers asking for [Odune] kind of 1U Twinand [Odune] kind of UIO, we have allocated more engineering resource in lastsix months in 1U Twin, and UIO. So, SuperBlade continues to growin as most of these, but the volumes schedule added up to the base. So, westarted volume production about four months ago and the quantity is growingmostly not very fast. However we see the booking from customers is gettingstronger and stronger. So for SuperBlade especially optimized, but they have toenter and the one optimized for obviously the environment. I mean [CPDP]right, very quite blade solutions. We have a very strong confidence that thequantity will start to grow quicker, starting from this quarter, maybe aFebruary timeframe, next month.
Jeffery Hekaro - Merrill Lynch: Okay. Then could you just touchon the gross margins clearly getting into the 20% this quarter above saw the18% to 19% range? Could you talk a little bit about sort of the componentswithin there; in other words, was pricing components down, a majority of it,was that economic to scale? And how should we think about this going forward asyou saw a bigger percentage of the revenues on the servers?
Howard Hideshima: Yeah, Jeff, this is Howard. Ithink you'll see that most of the gross margin indicates three factors the[phenomena] was built by the shift to our server revenue. You see that going upto about 42% and so that shift, as you know, the components have a lower grossmargins than our complete service solutions in general, so as a shift to morecomplete service solutions we gained higher margins.
Charles Liang: Basically, our 1U Twin and UIO as you know is a brand newaspect show so customer we need to pay at even the, they have priced higherpriced product performance in future space. And this trend basically iscontinuing.
Operator: And our next question goes toJosh Sloan with Glacier Bay Capital. Please go ahead.
Josh Sloan - Glacier Bay Capital: Hey, guys really good quarter, weespecially like to see the margin expansion there so good job. On the bladeproduct, could you go into that a little bit more? I mean, do you have productsnow that address all segments of the market, and is there something competitivethat’s making it a little slower than you thought, or do you just expected toramp up over the next several quarters?
Charles Liang: Okay. Yeah, I mean which was shipped aggressively in highvolume and it would be earlier. But again, because of the stronginterest in 1U Twin and UIO we had to allocate more engineering and power tothose products. However, now we’re getting back to the place where we were,again. So enterprise-wise, we had a task sheet about four months ago and officebreak, I mean the break going at 50:50 very low noise they were and 93% highefficiency basically we have been volume production by next month. So with thatproduct we had lots of interest and some POfrom [Cosmo]. Our dada centre optimize [bray] also have been volume productionnext month, so it is growing?
Josh Sloan - Glacier Bay Capital: How does the size of the blademarket compare to sort of where you compete right now? Do you expect that to bea major driver over the next several years?
Charles Liang: Yes I mean for blade server, nowwhere do our market go, above 55% year-over-year, right. So, compared withdocuments about where do our markets go, only about 5% or 6%. So, pretty much itssales grew much faster the global way. So as chip (inaudible) because theproduct is new to us, we have 0% revenue coming from blade before and nowbecome a big product line to us. Yes we just started shipping four months ago.So the volume space is kind of small but for long term, let's say next 12months, 24 months should be very important product line for us in terms ofrevenue and profitability.
Josh Sloan - Glacier Bay Capital: At one point you guys weretalking about building a software server management product, is that still onthe table?
Charles Liang: That product line is continuing.So, I believe about this summer or this fall we should have a better sight,better servable customer. So again it's a long-term investment, but we startfrom a hardware business and then gradually we provide some server managementproducts since two years ago and the product line is growing and it's veryimportant product for us especially for long-term success.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We'regoing to go next to Kenneth Miller of Bonanza Capital. Please go ahead.
Kenneth Miller - Bonanza Capital: Afternoon, gentlemen.
Charles Liang: Afternoon.
Kenneth Miller - Bonanza Capital: I wanted to clarify your guidancea little bit. One thing, I don't fully understand, you gave guidance of revenuegrowth in the release 30% and net income growth in the release 35%. It looks tome like your net income is going 60% year-over-year. And so, can you talk aboutwhere you expect operating margins to go directionally, and why thedifferential between your revenue growth and your net income growth doesn'tlook greater than 35%?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, Kenny, this is HowardHideshima. Again, the 35% is on an annual basis. So again, while thequarter-over-quarter is 60%, the annual for what we're giving guidance to isfar from 35% minimum, again I stress minimum growth in net income. 
Kenneth Miller - Bonanza Capital: But if I'm doing the math quicklyhere, your year-over-year net income growth was actually more like 56%, so reallynot far off.
Charles Liang: Yeah. I would rather saybasically, we make a conservative presentation to the market.
Kenneth Miller - Bonanza Capital: Well directionally where do youexpect your operating margins to go for the rest of the year? Do you expectthem to maintain at the net, almost 9% level or it will go down in these fourquarters of investments and operating expenses?
Howard Hideshima: I think historically Ken, if youtake a look at our percent of operating expenses compared to what we are, weare running fairly consistent historically. And the company over the lastcouple of years has been very consistent with regards to where its operatingexpenses have been on a percentage basis of revenue.
Kenneth Miller - Bonanza Capital: So could you comment on what youthink operating margins will go in the next couple of quarters or not?
Howard Hideshima: We haven't given guidance withinthe (inaudible0 segment. 
Operator: And we'll go next to [John Ralph.I believe it’s Argon Capital] Please go ahead.
John Ralph - Argon Capital: Hi, guys just a couple of quickquestions. One, could you give me again what the CapEx numbers associated withthe building purchase are?
Howard Hideshima: Yeah, $11.3 million.
John Ralph - Argon Capital: Okay. That was 11.3. And Inoticed as well there is a new long-term liability on balance sheet, what isthat?
Howard Hideshima: We had a new accounting probableannounced to come out from FIN 48.
John Ralph - Argon Capital: Okay. 
Howard Hideshima: It's basically the, that was theshift of the tax payable from payable, down below to accrued liability.
John Ralph - Argon Capital: Okay, I see. And now the lastthing, can you tell me what the charge was in this quarter for adjustment ofinventory?
Howard Hideshima: 1.8%.
John Ralph - Argon Capital: 1.8% of revenues.
Howard Hideshima:  Right.
John Ralph - Argon Capital: Okay great. Okay thanks verymuch.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And itappears at this time that we have no further questions. I would like to turnthe call back over to Mr. Liang for any additional or closing comments. Sir.
Charles Liang: Thank you for joining us todayand we look forward to talking to you again at the end of this quarter. Thankyou everyone. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,that does conclude the Super Micro Computer, Incorporated second quarter 2008conference call. We do appreciate your participation. You may disconnect atthis time. Thank you.

Charles Liang: Thank you, Howard, and good afternoon, everyone. Thisquarter marks our 14th anniversary since our funding in 1993. It washighlighted by record high in revenue again. Our revenue reach $180 millionwith a growth of $27.8 million, compared with our fourth quarter of fiscal year2007, which is about 30.8% growth. This quarter net income reach $5.8 million with a growth of$1 million compared with last quarter, which is about a 20% growth. Thecontinued revenue traction of our 1U Twin and Universal I/O solutions, thestart of volume shipment of our SuperBlade servers and the launch of ourinnovative products, such as AMD Barcelona server and Intel quad-core MP Xeonserver solutions sets our table for additional goals in our future. The 1U Twin continues to gain much share with customers inhigh-performance, high-density, server converting and data center environments.The 1U Twin server require half as many server racks, chassis, power suppliesand power cables, which should reduce customer's TCO. Additional cost savings associated with this IP spacerequired as well easier maintenance and management make this servers are veryattractive option for almost any high-performance server applications. Our newinnovation Universal I/O architecture has also been increasing in revenueduring the quarter. Customers appreciated 1U Twin flexibility, cost advantages,and investment protection, which the UIO architecture provides. Future upgrades can be achieved by replacing the UIO cardand or expansion card instead of replacing entire systems. Even without any UIOmodule or expansion cards, our UIO system functions as an better cost effectiveserver. With the UIO card installed a single UIO server can support a SAS, 10GbEthernet or even InfiniBand. This versatility also minimize the number ofdifferent server models that resellers need to keep in inventory. During the quarter, we went into volume shipment of ourSuperBlade servers, which implement the very latest advancement in servertechnologies, making them an ideal solution, not just for enterpriseapplications, but also HPC environment. Taking module computing to another level, our high-densityblade can be optimized for a wider range of applications with exceptionalscalability. Super Micro Blade use 90% SAS, high-efficiency, redundant powersupply to ensure energy efficient operation and reliability. During the quarter, we also launched innovative productssuch as our AMD Barcelona server solution and a nine of Intel quad-core MP Xeonservers. Most of these products highlight our ability to deliver a variety ofapplications rapidly to market, utilizes our latest in technology. One of the most innovative products, which we showcased atIntel Developer Forum, was our OfficeBlade server, optimized for officeenvironments and which it is 93% high-efficiency power supply. Our OfficeBladeservers operate at a noise level of less than 50 -TB, which is as quiet as ahigh-end workstation. Now you can have a supercomputer at your desktop. While this market is more of a niche, it represents anopportunity for additional growth of our SuperBlade platform. Delivering applicationoptimizers, server solutions, and being first to market have been hallmarks ofSuper Micro. The value, which we provide to our customers, has again beenproved by the continuous growth in our revenue and profitability. We have continued to invest in our infrastructure in orderto support the market's growing needs. We have recently expanded ourengineering employee base, both here in San Jose and in Asia. We have alsoadded more resource to production area in order to meet the demands of our customers.We are continuing to evaluate sites in Asia to expand our manufacturing andwarehousing capacity in the near term, in order to reduce most production andlogistic cost. All of this is within our plan to grow our technical andoperation capability and capacity to build a stronger foundation for our futuregrowth while maintaining our financial discipline and growing our shareholdervalues. With that in mind, let me now turn it over to our CFO,Howard Hideshima, who will discuss the financial results and forecast. Thankyou.
Howard Hideshima: Thank you, Charles. And good afternoon, everybody. First letme point out that our GAAP numbers appear in the news release and so I would bediscussing earnings, gross margins, operating expenses, and similar items on anon-GAAP basis, which reflects adjustments to exclude stock-compensationexpenses. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP is included in thefinancial statements of the Company in today's earnings release. Let me beginwith a review of the first quarter net income statement. Revenues of $117.9 million for the quarter, was up 30.8% forthe same quarter a year ago. This growth was lead by the increase in our serversystems business, which increase 43.5% year-over-year or $13.8 million to $45.6million. Unit volumes on server systems increased 26.7%year-over-year from 30,000 to 38,000 units. ASP for servers also increased onyear-to-year basis, from approximately $1,000 per unit to $1,200 per unit. The increase in server revenue was primarily due to highersales of our OEM and Series 6000 servers, offset in part by declining AMD-basedservers. Our 1U Twin and UIO products, as well as our enterprise Bladeproducts, continued to gain traction during the quarter. We continue to maintain a diverse revenue base with none ofour more than 300 customers making up more than 10% of our net sales in thefirst quarter, 61.7% coming from the U.S. and 60.9% coming from ourdistributors and resellers. Internet data center revenue was 8.6% compared to 3.3% in Q1of fiscal year '07. We started approaching this market about two years ago andhave progressed well in developing solutions which serve this market. On a sequential basis net revenues were up by $7 million or6.3% from a $110.9 million in Q4. The increase is primarily due to the increasein sales to our OEM customers and continued growth in sales of the 1U Twin andUIO products, offset in part by lower shipments of AMD products. Internet datacenter revenue was 8.6% compared to 6% in Q4. Non-GAAP gross profit was $23.2 million for the quarter, up28.7% from $18 million in the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP gross margin was19.6% of revenue, down from 20% a year ago. The non-GAAP gross margin declinefrom a year ago reflects higher inventory reserves in Q1 of fiscal year '08 ofapproximately 1%, offset in part by cost reductions in material and freightcosts. On a sequential basis non-GAAP gross margins increased from18.1% in Q4 to 19.6% in Q1 due primarily to cost reductions on existingproduct, higher gross margins on new products, such as the 1U Twin and UIO andlower inventory reserves. On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP operating expensestotaled $13.1 million for the first quarter or 11.1% of revenue, up from 10.6%,a year ago. The year-over-year absolute dollar increase of $3.6 million wasprimarily due to additional R&D, SG&A, head count to support the growthof the Company. The company's head count grew by 170 from 491 in Q1 offiscal year '07 to 661 at Q1 fiscal year '08, primarily in the areas ofproduction, 207 to 270 and R&D 166 to 236. Overseas head count during thisperiod expanded from 79 to 116. On a sequential bases non-GAAP operating expenses was up$1.9 million or 16.9%. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due tohigher salaries and payroll expenses associated with increased head count andannual salary increases of about $700,000 and NRE expenses related to our Bladeproduct development of about $700,000. Non-GAAP operating profit for the first quarter was $10.1million or 8.5% of revenue, up $1.6 million from $8.5 million or 9.4% ofrevenue a year ago. The increase was primarily due to growth in our revenue,offset in part by higher operating expenses to support the growth of thecompany, introduction of new products, and overhead associated with being apublic company. Non-GAAP operating profit on a sequential basis was up $1.2million or 13.4% from $8.9 million or 8% of revenue in Q4, primarily related tothe higher revenues and gross margins discussed above. On a year-over-year basis non-GAAP net income for the firstquarter was $6.6 million or 5.6% of revenue, which is up from $5.1 million or5.7% of revenue a year ago. On a sequential basis, non-GAAP net income was up$0.5 million or 8.1% from $6.1 million in Q4. The tax rate for the first quarter on a non-GAAP basis was36.6%, compared to 37.7% a year ago. The decrease in our tax rate was due toincrease in our benefits from R&D credits. Our non-GAAP fully diluted EPS for the first quarter was$0.17 per share, compared to $0.16 per share a year ago. Fully diluted sharesused were $38.9 million compared to $32.4 million a year ago. The fully diluted shares increased by 6.5 million primarily,due to the 6.4 million shares offered in the Company's IPO, which closed onApril 2, 2007. On a sequential basis, our non-GAAP fully diluted EPS increasedby $0.01per share from $0.16 in the fourth quarter. Turning to the balance sheet on a sequential basis, cash andcash equivalents and short-term investments were $69.4 million, up $3.5 millionfrom $65.9 million in the prior quarter. The increase is primarily due topositive cash flow from operating activities of $4 million in the quarter. Accounts receivable increased by $7.2 million to $40.7million, DSOs increased by two days to 29 days from Q4, as the company workedto reduce the discount its customers receive from TT and COD payment terms. Inventories increases by $6.7 million to $73.4 million withthe days in inventory decreasing by three days to 68. The decrease in days wasdue to higher revenues during Q1. Inventory reserves were $10.9 million,compared to $8.9 million in Q4. Accounts payable decreased by $8.7 million to $70.1 million,with the days payable outstanding decreasing by one day to 64. The decrease indays is primarily, due to the company working with our vendors to gain costreduction and paying on better terms. Land and building was $27 million, representingapproximately 262,000 square foot of property in San Jose, California at theend of Q1. As previously indicated in a press release and 8-K filing,the Company closed escrow on a building located in San Jose near close to itsSan Jose facility on October 16, 2007. The building is approximately 90,000square feet and cost approximately $11.3 million. Historically we have allocated about 70% of the value toland and 30% to building, which is to depreciate over 39 years. Now, for a fewcomments on our outlook. We have historically seen seasonal revenue growth in ourfiscal Q2 and Q4. We have also seen a historical pattern of increased revenuetraction following the introduction of new products. We believe that thisshould continue this quarter. New products introduced, during the prior to quarters shouldprovide additional revenue during Q2. As a result, we estimate second quarterfiscal year 2008 revenues to be in the range of $128 million to $135 million. Let me also say that Charles and I will be at the UBSTechnology Conference on November 15th in New York, presenting at 11:45 a.m.local time. We hope to see you there and we also continue to meet withportfolio managers and security analysts, both on the road and our offices. Ifyou are interested in such a meeting, please contact Howard Kalt at415-692-3059. With that let me turn it back to Charles for some closingremarks.
Charles Liang: Thank you, Howard. I would like to say that we started thefiscal year 2008 with solid first quarter in which we saw sequential revenue,margin, and net income goals. We continue to work on strengthening ouroperation in the U.S. and abroad and looking forward to and exciting yearfilled with additional innovative products resulting in continued growth inrevenue, profitability, and shareholder value. We begin our 15 years of operation expecting to continue our14-year tradition of profitability. Thank you all for joining us on ourearnings conference call. With that, we will open the call to questions. Thankyou.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And we'll go first to Glenn Hanuswith Needham.
Glenn Hanus - Needham: Good afternoon. Could you talk -- your gross marginperformance exceeded my model. Could you talk about the sort of relativecontribution of the items you mentioned in your script on the upside there? And the -- kind of how you’re feeling about thesustainability of gross margins at current levels now going forward?
Howard Hideshima: Okay, very good. I mean, basically because our 1U Twin havebeen growing very well, indeed a bit better than what we thought, and UniversalI/O, UIO product also growing strongly. Together we started to shipping in production. So all ofthose contributed to our better gross margin. Again, because of new technology,better technology. So it's very important for Super Micro to continue to keepinnovative products and we have a good feeling for those. However, yes, according to the market, sometime forstrategic reason, we may not gain new market segment or new customer, so inthose cases we may have to be aggressive in price to gain new customer. So basically we like to control our growth and for sure,control our gross margin.
Glenn Hanus - Needham: And anything on the outlook there, gross margins, do youthink you can hold them here above 19?
Charles Liang: It -- we have options, you know? Basically we try to keep ahalf a number for companies long-term business, and that's good forshareholders long-term future. So from 18 to 19 or something it's all possible.
Glenn Hanus - Needham: I can't quite understand that. It's possible.
Charles Liang: It's possible to keep between 18 or 19 something.
Glenn Hanus - Needham: Okay.
Charles Liang: That's why potable (ph) companies long-term future.
Glenn Hanus - Needham: Okay. That's my question, then. I guess I'll let you move onand circle back. Thank you.
Charles Liang: Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And we'll go next to Joshua Solanwith Glacier Bay Capital.
Joshua Solan - Glacier Bay Capital: Hey, guys, how's it going? Just had a question on theoperating expense line. I do think it increased sequentially a little bit morethan maybe I was expecting, and I'm curious if you think can sustain at thatlevel or if we should continue to model growth in there?
Howard Hideshima: Hey, Josh, yes, we -- as I mentioned earlier we had about a$700,000 charge for NRE expenses in our R&D area, and we do -- that was aculmination of probably about three years -- over two years of development workin our Blade server solution business. So again that was a culmination of thatproject. Obviously we'll have other projects going forward, but that was amajor endeavor of the company and we're happy that we went into volumeproduction in that area.
Joshua Solan - Glacier Bay Capital: Is the implication of that that absolute dollar of OpExcould be down next quarter?
Howard Hideshima: Again, we won't see that particular expense incurring, butthere may be other NRE or other charges. But again, that was the $700,000 wasfor the culmination of about a project that lasted over few years.
Joshua Solan - Glacier Bay Capital: I would say even than I though I mean just the other reasonI believe because if I take that out maybe it was up still sequentially morethan I thought. I mean, just -- 
Charles Liang: The other reason, I believe, because we aggressively growingour foundation in R&D and production. So all of those, including the hiremore people, retrain our people those for long-term a company growth. And Ibelieve it's a very good idea to invest at this moment when company is stronglygrowing.
Joshua Solan - Glacier Bay Capital: That's fair. And on the gross margin line, I think everyoneon the call -- or everyone who follows this because sort of sees you guysgrowing the business 30% a year, at least. You're doing some interesting thingsin Asia as far as assembly there and then a lot of other things to increasegross margin. And getting back to the last question, I guess, I mean isyour -- and I know there's sort of new products and there are good years andbad years with new products, but I mean is your gross margin sustainably higherbecause of scale and because of all of these other things that you're doingthan it was a year ago or two years ago, on a sort of on a like-for-like basis,assuming new products or not new products?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, Josh, I think we talked quite a bit about buildingeconomic scale being one of our primary short-term goals and I believe thecompany through its revenue performance has continued to build scale. So we'reobviously in better position today as we were in a number of years ago. Andwe'll continue to look at, again, improving and strengthening our position.
Joshua Solan - Glacier Bay Capital: Last question. Could you just give me the absolute dollar onthe inventory write-down number?
Howard Hideshima: About $2 million.
Josh Sloan - Glacier Bay Capital: About $2 million? Okay.
Howard Hideshima: Yes.
Josh Sloan - Glacier Bay Capital: Which again compares to last quarter it was about $2.7million. Is that higher than it should be?
Howard Hideshima: It's what we believe. Obviously, we look every quarter atthe end of every quarter and make our estimates to put what we believe is anadequate reserve.
Josh Sloan - Glacier Bay Capital: No, I was just saying going forward maybe. Is there a way weshould think about it maybe as a percent of sales or something like that?
Howard Hideshima: Again, last year we had about 1.3% for fiscal year '07 wasour inventory provision. Again, this quarter it ran a little higher and again,we'll look at it every quarter.
Charles Liang: In the long term, we hope we can continually improve,though, because in the past couple of quarter, as you people know, TTI won andthose have been issued to lot of company and looking forward to next fewquarter, I believe we have room to improve.
Josh Sloan - Glacier Bay Capital: Well, I mean, I guess all of this really bodes well forgross margins going forward, I imagine. Thanks a lot guys, appreciate it.
Howard Hideshima: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Vamzy Mullen (ph) with MerrillLynch.
Vamzy Mullen - Merrill Lynch: Hey, Howard and Charles. Question I had was also pertainingto gross margin. You guys mentioned a higher gross margin from new products,cost reduction and also lower inventory reserves. If you rank ordered those, Charles, should I take youcomment that new products were the primary driver of the higher gross margin?
Charles Liang: Pretty much new products, especially 1U Twin and UIO.
Vamzy Mullen - Merrill Lynch: Okay. And from a component cost perspective, how much wasthe impact in gross margins was that?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, Vamzy, on a higher gross margins and cost reductions,we had about 1.5% made up by that.
Vamzy Mullen - Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thanks. And can you talk about the impact from Ablecomon your gross margins?
Howard Hideshima: Sure, happy to. It was minimal. It resulted in about eightbasis point increase to our gross profit in Q1, and there are purchasesrepresented about 23%, 23.7% of total cost of goods sold, which is down fromprior quarters and prior year.
Vamzy Mullen - Merrill Lynch: Thanks, Howard. And can you comment on what your, how you'rethinking about balancing between revenue growth and margins? I mean in thisquarter, did you make a conscience decision and walk away from some of thelower-margin businesses? I mean it looks like your Internet data centercustomer percent actually went up, so can you elaborate on that a little bit?
Charles Liang: Indeed, you are right. I mean, in those case we have achoice to upgrade you in some competitive deal or not. So looking forwardagain, we had to keep the company able to grow more than 30% year after year.That’s pretty much our bottom line. And once above this bottom line, I mean, we try to have adynamic choice to viable basically our company and for our shareholder.
Vamzy Mullen - Merrill Lynch: Thanks, Charles. One more, if I could. How large of animpact were Blades on revenue growth in this quarter and how should we thinkabout it next quarter? Obviously, HPC class is doing really well. IBM's notdoing as well in that particular segment. Are you seeing, relatively speaking what particularverticals or what particular areas are you seeing opportunities in the Bladeproduct? Thanks.
Charles Liang: Yeah, very good. Basically, we spend almost three years todevelop our progressive product line. Finally we are very happy, it's ready forproduction. However, revenue growth won't be sharply because in our new portalwe try to be conservative, so from some customer, although we shipping in somevolume, but we try to control the growth. Because overall 30 something percent, again is our bottomline growth rate and in the near future we too feel very exciting for thisstrong product line. We have enterprise Blade server and then coming soonOfficeBlade. Like I just mentioned, our OfficeBlade perform at about 50TP noise level, which is like a high-end workstation, so very suitable foroffice environment. Before people don't believe Blade is good for officeenvironment. Now we make that product -- that possibility available. So again,in next couple of quarter and near future, we feel very excited for this strongproduct line.
Vamzy Mullen - Merrill Lynch: Thank you.
Charles Liang: Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And next we'll take a follow up fromGlenn Hanus with Needham.
Glenn Hanus - Needham: Can you talk, Howard, a little bit more about you mentionedthe discounts and that you're getting better terms are suppliers and with yourcustomers and your suppliers. Can you give us some quantification or some wayto think about how that's progressing and how much more progress might beavailable?
Howard Hideshima: Yes, sure, Glenn. With regards to our days, we went to 29days and previously it'd been in the low 20s and we're working our way upthere. It's primarily because we do have a good portion, the majority of oursales had been in the TT and COD type of terms, which the Company has thetraditionally offered anywhere from a 1.5% to 2% discount for those types ofterms. So we've been weaning our customers off, trying to move ourcustomers off to more standard terms, like net 30 and what have you, and thathas contributed to the gross margin pickup. As I mentioned the combination ofthe 1.5% for new product introductions, cost reductions, it's all put in tothat bucket.
Glenn Hanus - Needham: Okay. Can you maybe talk about how you're feeling about the impactof server virtualization products on your business?
Charles Liang: Yes, I mean, about 18% of our product application optimizemarket, so we see this segment impact from virtualization is much smaller. Yes,we have some general-purpose server markets where each year faced to a morechallenge with tradition. However, in the more virtualization application,people need really high-performance, high-density system, and as you know, weare very good, very strong in this area. For example, our Intel MP system, AMD MP systems all aregrowing quickly. And that’s 1U Twin, lots of people use the 1U Twin forvirtualization application as well. So when virtualization become more popular,I do feel very optimistic regarding the impact to our business.
Glenn Hanus - Needham: Any comments you can make on the competitive landscape yousaw in pricing environment through the quarter versus HP, IBM, and DELL?
Charles Liang: Yes, that market, in last quarter from what I observe isquite stable. Again, the market continued to be very competitive, but basicallynot much change in last quarter. And looking forward, I believe our foundationbecome bigger, stronger. Our market share we're continuing to grow. So the challengewill be continued stronger effort but looks like we should be in better shapethan before.
Glenn Hanus - Needham: And more specifically on the enterprise Blade productsversus HP and IBM, any commentary you want to make there?
Charles Liang: We are new, right, and that's a fact. Now we send a lot ofsystems for customer to start practice our system and order feedback are quitepositive. So we have very good confidence that our Blade will be a successfulproduct, especially our Blade server provided some feature that our competitorscannot beat us. For example, computing, density, high-efficiency power supply,and also very directory. Our cost advantage is quite good in Blade server.
Glenn Hanus - Needham: Thank you.
Charles Liang: Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And it appears at this time we haveno further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Liang forany additional or closing comments.
Charles Liang: Thank you. Thank you for joining us today. We are pleased tobe a member of the public marketplace, and we look forward to talking to youagain at the end of the next quarter. Thank you, everyone. Have a good day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Super MicroComputer, Inc. first quarter 2008 conference call. We do appreciate yourparticipation. You may disconnect at this time.
